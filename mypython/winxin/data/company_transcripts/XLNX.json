My name is Kelly and I will be your conference operator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.", "Rick Muscha", "Thank you and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO and Lorenzo Flores, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the December quarter and then we will open the call for questions.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and actual results may differ materially. We refer you to documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.", "Let me now turn the call over to Lorenzo.", "Lorenzo Flores", "Thank you, Rick and good afternoon everyone. In the December quarter, Xilinx\u2019s sales were $586 million, up 1% sequentially and up 3% on a year-over-year basis. Our sales for the first three quarters of the fiscal year are up 6% compared to the same period of the prior year. Growth was driven by our advanced products, which increased 2% sequentially and reached a new record. For the first three quarters of the fiscal year, advanced products have grown nearly 50% compared to the same period of the prior year. In the December quarter, sales from our 28-nanometer Zynq family, our 20-nanometer family and our 16-nanometer family also passed our targets and reached new records with Zynq approaching 10% of total sales. Total 28-nanometer was approximately flat overall.", "From an end market perspective, the largest sequential gains during the quarter were driven by communications with Industrial and A&D up slightly and Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive down. Profitability remained strong during the quarter as both gross margin and expenses were slightly better than guided. Gross margin in Q3 was 69.6%, slightly better than guided as we continue to benefit from our focus on operational efficiencies.", "Operating expense was $244 million, $1 million lower than guided. Recall that the primary driver of the increase in our R&D investment from the prior quarter was for 16-nanometer tape-outs as we continue to accelerate our technology leadership and brought in our product portfolio. Moshe will discuss how this R&D investment is beginning to pay off. Operating income for the quarter was $163 million or 27.8%. Other income and expense was an expense of $392,000, lower than guided due primarily to an investment distribution. Our tax rate was 13% for the quarter, better than guided due to several small discrete items. Our net income for Q3 was $142 million or $0.52 per share.", "Some key points on the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $3.4 billion in gross cash and $1.8 billion net cash after our debt. Accounts receivable ended the quarter up $113 million at $341 million. This relatively high level of receivables was caused by the pattern of shipments and collections in the quarter and we see no collectibility issues. Inventory was $206 million, up $9 million from the prior quarter and up $10 million from the same quarter a year ago.", "Operating cash flow was $106 million and was impacted by accounts receivable, as I just discussed. We expect operating cash flow to improve significantly next quarter as we normalize accounts receivable. In the quarter, we paid $83 million in dividends and we repurchased 3.9 million shares for $214 million, an average price of $54.72. For the first three quarters of the fiscal year, we have returned $665 million to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. This is more than 100% of the operating cash we have generated over the same period.", "We ended the quarter with diluted shares of 271 million, which included 16.9 million shares from the convertible. A further comment on the convertible. In December, we received conversion notices for $140 million of the $600 million convertible notes consistent with the term of the notes. These conversions will be settled this quarter. Our expectations based on the current range of share prices, is that this will reduce diluted shares by 2 million to 2.5 million. As we have discussed, capital allocation remains a top priority for the company. We continue to invest in our business to capitalize on our leadership position and we will return capital to our shareholders with a commitment to an increasing dividend over time and through share repurchases. We continue to execute the more deliberate approach to share repurchase I discussed last quarter with the intention of exhausting our $1 billion authorization over the next several quarters.", "As I turn to guidance, I would like to once again refresh the key points of our annual guidance from our Analyst Day in May. At the Analyst Day, we said we expected revenue growth to be between 4% and 8%, our gross margin to be between 68% and 70%, and our operating expense to be between $930 million and $950 million. Our performance through the first three quarters of the year and our guidance for Q4 indicate that we are on track to the guidance provided at our Analyst Meeting. In the March quarter, we are expecting sales to increase to $590 million to $620 million, which would put at the center of the revenue guidance provided at our Analyst Meeting. Our backlog is up heading into the quarter and advanced products will continue to grow, delivering new records for sales of our 28-nanometer, 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer products. On end markets, we expect communications to be down slightly with declines from wireless offsetting growth from wired. Industrial and A&D is expected to increase with all three secondary markets, flat to up.", "Lastly, Broadcast, Consumer and Automotive is expected to increase driven by a significant increase in advanced driver assistance systems. Our gross margin will be approximately 68% to 70%. For operating expense, we continue to invest in accelerating our leadership position and we expect operating expense to be approximately flat at $244 million. Our operating expense outlook includes $1 million of amortization. Other income and expense will be an expense of $4 million. Finally, our tax rate is expected to be 14%.", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you, Lorenzo. I am very pleased with the financial results of the third quarter. We delivered our fifth consecutive revenue growth quarter. Revenue reached its highest level in nearly 2 years while delivering better-than-expected profitability. We continue to benefit from our diversified, multi-market strategy and technology leadership portfolio. In the December quarter, wireless rebounded significantly, largely driven by 4G business in China and India as well as pre-5G deployment. Sales also increased in A&D and ISM, more than offsetting declines in other end markets.", "Overall, revenue growth continues to be driven by our advanced products. For the first 9 months of fiscal year \u201817, advanced products were up nearly 50% versus the prior year period. We anticipate our advanced products will again grow significantly in the March quarter and set a new sales record. This momentum in our advanced products is fueling our confidence in meeting the midpoint \u2013 the revenue growth forecast 4% to 8% we provided at last year\u2019s Analyst Meeting.", "Sales from our 28-nanometer Zynq product family, the industry\u2019s first All Programmable SoC, increased by nearly 20% led by growth in wireless communications and ADAS applications. Our overall 28-nanometer revenue, including Zynq, is expected to increase in the March quarter, set a new record driven by broad end market deployment. 20-nanometer revenue again reached a record level, significantly exceeding our $50 million target. We expect to ship over $60 million of 20-nanometer products in the March quarter, setting a new record. 60-nanometer sales grew significantly in the December quarter to a new record, exceeding our forecast while shipping to multiple end markets, including automotive, data center and communications. We expect 60-nanometer sales to increase again in the March quarter, set a record as broad based customer adoption continues to accelerate.", "Our decision to increase our fiscal year 2017 R&D investment to both capitalize on our technology leadership and expand our product portfolio continues to pay off. After reaching critical production milestone that extended our 60-nanometer competitive lead to well over a year, we have accelerated our production tape-outs of this node and are currently shipping 12 unique products to over 300 active customers. We announced the expansion of our 60-nanometer portfolio with devices that integrate high bandwidth memory and CCIX technology. This product family is architected to support performance intensive applications, such as compute acceleration in the data center, high data rate, Ethernet connectivity, 8K video and radar systems. Last quarter, these expanded R&D investments helped us to further develop the market potential for data center acceleration. Xilinx introduced the reconfigurable acceleration stack with a goal to enable mainstream adoption of our FPGAs for accelerated machine learning, video transcoding and big data analytics. Amazon Web Services recently announced they are deploying our 60-nanometer UltraScale+ FPGAs in the cloud. This has the potential to create a new disruptive business model for our technology and expand the reach to a very broad set of enterprise customers.", "We continue to invest in data center market development, anticipating the longer-term horizon for revenue returns. The $590 million to $620 million sequential revenue guidance driven from significant growth in our advanced products will manifest itself in many of our end markets, including wired communications, data center, automotive, ISM, A&D, consumer and broadcast. This broad based growth underscores the strength of our diversified, multi-market portfolio.", "We now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Joe Moore", "Great. Thank you so much. I had a question on the broadcast, consumer and auto being down sequentially quite a bit and I guess the ADAS business within that is obviously doing very well, can you just kind of put in context kind of what are the puts and takes in that business and is there something anomalous about the decline that you saw in the December quarter?", "Lorenzo Flores", "So I don\u2019t think there is anything anomalous in the decline, Joe. I think the issues we had, some inventory positioning on the part of some of our key customers in ADAS. We still see strength in all of the design wins that we have talked about and all the \u2013 on all of the end markets \u2013 I am sorry, end manufacturer models that we have talked about before, so we don\u2019t have any concerns over that. And as Moshe described, we expect to see a very strong rebound in automotive driven by ADAS in the fourth quarter. A large part of the decline, as we have been talking about before, has been in the infotainment business as well. So we are not concerned.", "Joe Moore", "Okay, great. Thank you. And I guess maybe following-up just on that business, can you talk about \u2013 there is infotainment headwinds, are there other headwinds to understand and when you have talked about pretty strong growth in ADAS, should we see that result in much higher revenue growth in this segment in the next 12 months or are there offsets to that?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, if you go back 1 year or 2 years, infotainment was by far the largest portion of the business. And over the last 2 years, ADAS has grown and infotainment has shrunk. Now, ADAS is by far the largest portion of the business and it generally speaking, continues to grow at a faster rate. So we expect our automotive business to be one of the growth drivers over the next year for sure and see overall growth in automotive in fiscal year 2018 versus fiscal year 2017.", "Lorenzo Flores", "I think we have discussed before Joe that the breadth of our design wins and we are at a point where it\u2019s the take rate of the option packages that will help determine the growth of our business there.", "Joe Moore", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Lorenzo Flores", "Thank you. Next question?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Ambrish Srivastava", "Thank you. Moshe, I had a question on OpEx and really not looking for the guide, but really the framework of how should we think about what are you and Lorenzo looking at as we look at the next fiscal year, because last year you negatively surprised everybody, but then you articulated why you are doing it and then since then you have kind of shown to us why and you gave some good metrics today. So how should we think about how you are thinking about what you and Lorenzo are looking at over the next quarter or two quarters. And then my quick follow-up for you Lorenzo, accounts receivable are up a lot and you said it should normalize back in the quarter, did I get that correct that there will be a big delta on a positive side for CFO?", "Lorenzo Flores", "Thanks. So the quick answer is yes. And I will let Moshe answer the bigger picture framework question and I will probably add in at some point.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. So we will be giving guidance for next year, some initial guidance at the next earnings release and obviously full guidance in May when we have our Investor/Analyst Day in New York City. But generally speaking, if you look at what we had committed to do, we had said that we are investing. We are investing to exploit the technology lead we have and it would be foolish not to do that both in the short-term and definitely in the medium-term and long-term. Having said that, we are committed to getting back to the 30%, right. So what you will hear in the next earnings release and in May, you will hear more details with regards to that, but we should be moving back in that direction generally speaking. And how quickly we will get there, it\u2019s too early for me to give you any clear guidance on that, but that direction we are committed to regardless.", "Lorenzo Flores", "Yes. So actually, I don\u2019t have much to add to that Ambrish, but I think I will expand a little bit on accounts receivable because I am sure other people may have the same question. If you look back, we have had an occasional spike of accounts receivable and you probably generally followed up with the quarter where they come down and we obviously collect the cash. Obviously, we are trying to manage this, but most importantly, when we service our customers, when they want the product. And so that impacts when we can collect for the revenue that we have. So and looked it very closely, we don\u2019t see any issues, as I have said earlier, on collecting the accounts receivable. So we expect to turn that back down to a more normal level in this quarter.", "Ambrish Srivastava", "Okay. Thanks for the clarity.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open.", "C.J. Muse", "Yes. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. I guess, one question, two parts, so as you think about 60-nanometer, your share gains there and the acceleration that you are seeing there with your customer base, I am curious on two fronts, one, when do you think we could get upwards of $100 million or so incremental revenues either on a run rate basis or overall across ADAS and data center. And then secondly, now that you have put all the spending on the OpEx side in fiscal \u201816 \u2013 fiscal \u201817, sorry, how should we think about OpEx trajectory into fiscal \u201818? Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. Let me do \u2013 I will try to answer your first part of your question probably a little differently than the way you had asked it. Just to remind you, we \u2013 typically takes a very long period of time from when we introduce the technology to when it actually provides huge revenue. And an example would be 28- nanometer, which is still not at its peak and we actually think that it\u2019s a minimum of 2 years, maybe even further away from its peak. Now, if you look at 20 and 16 together, we tend to look at them as one node just due to the way they were introduced. They came relatively close together. And the combination of those \u2013 these two nodes is doing very well across all markets. 16, it\u2019s still early days. We have these 300 customers and 12 unique devices that are shipping, but none of the customers are yet in volume production. You are right in highlighting that 16, two of the markets that will unquestionably drive that are automotive and data center. They are not the only two markets. They actually had much broader applicability. And of the two \u2013 those two data center tends to happen a little faster than automotive, but data center for us is a nascent market. It\u2019s very early in its development and that\u2019s why we are very careful in highlighting that the investments we are making in data center now will likely pay off a few years down the road, and we sort of highlighted 2020 is when it will be substantial in the potentially hundreds of millions of dollars. So to answer on 16-nanometer, overall, I would be disappointed in 2 years if it isn\u2019t well over $100 million worth of business. Which markets will constitute that $100 million of sales, it\u2019s still early to tell. And for this year, it will be significant, but it won\u2019t be at that $100 million for this fiscal year for sure.", "Lorenzo Flores", "And the other part with the OpEx trajectory?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Sure.", "Lorenzo Flores", "Okay. So C.J., I think I\u2019ll just echo a little bit of what Moshe said in response to Ambrish\u2019s question, which is we will obviously provide more details coming out of our fiscal year and at our Analyst Day. But I think that what we said in the past is what we are thinking now, which is we don\u2019t expect the slope of the R&D investment to be at the same angle as this past year and we are managing the company to get back to the 30% up and greater operating margin level in the intermediate term, if you will.", "C.J. Muse", "Very helpful. Thanks so much.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you. Next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra from Baird. Your line is open.", "Tristan Gerra", "Hi, good afternoon. Could you provide an update, if you could in terms of the timing for the next geometry node initial ramp? And also, what type of product should we expect, will it be all very high end or stacked architecture or will you be targeting mid-range as well with that new node?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. Well, it\u2019s the risk of quoting our President it\u2019s going to be phenomenal. But back on the serious note, we are very excited about the 7-nanometer. We are delighted that TSMC continue to provide leadership product. We definitely benefit from the fact that they now have caught up and providing leadership technology at the earliest point in time. We expect our 2018 to be the year that we tape-out and provide first silicon. It will be \u2013 and this is where the phenomenal ends it stripes, it will be a very broad product offering, it won\u2019t be just the high-end product offering and we believe we have \u2013 we will have the engineering innovation that enables us to cover most of the market, definitely not the low end with the 7- nanometer technology. So, it will be a very broad technology, applicability and we will have very significant impact on numerous of the markets we service. It will likely not at least initially have a low end footprint just because when you get to those new advanced nodes, they tend to be a lot more expensive, both in terms of mask sets and in terms of wafer costs and it takes time to get that to the point where you can actually address a low end portfolio. So, what we have done to address the low end portfolio in the interim is expanding 28-nanometer, which is a much more cost-sensitive and mature node to address that market, so we can protect and actually expand our position at the low end, because we feel that the low end has been relatively underserved, and it\u2019s an opportunity for us. Hence, the additional investment we are making at 28-nanometer at the low end.", "Tristan Gerra", "Great, thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Sure, thank you. Next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Your line is open.", "Steve Smigie", "Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate my questions. My first question was a little bit on the competitive front, you saw Intel/Altera product there, 14-nanometer part. And I am just curious now it\u2019s a little bit into that what we have actually seen from customers, does it matter or are you guys already so far ahead since you are a year out that it will take a while to even really get manage lion\u2019s share of customers?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, we never underestimate our competition, least of all, Intel in that regard. But having said that, they are doing extremely well at 16-nanometer. The product is very mature. The yields are exceptional. The functionality of the product is great. That\u2019s why we are investing in getting the production mask sets with very fine tweaks to solve the teething issues that the product had at the very beginning. And it\u2019s doing really, really well. So our competitive position, we feel is incredibly strong at this node just due to the maturity of the product and the breadth of the family and the quality of the design and the operations at this point. So, it\u2019s going really well. And we obviously are intent on continuing to exploit this lead and we assume there will be competition, but we are moving forward as quickly as possible to enhance and consolidate our position and it\u2019s working quite well for us.", "Steve Smigie", "Great, thanks. And just as my follow-up, you have had quite a bit of success with Zynq with good growth rates there. Now, it\u2019s been out there for a little while. Can you talk about what the growth trajectory over the next year or two might look like at this point?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, it\u2019s \u2013 Zynq was the groundbreaking new product for us and it was introduced relatively late in the 28-nanometer cycled product introduction, it was about a year after the initial device is. It was targeted at three markets, wireless, automotive and industrial. What has happened is because it is a really a system-level solution, because it has a very powerful CPU system embedded inside it, and that\u2019s the first time something of this sort was available. It took a little longer for those designs to move into production. But what has happened now is that they are moving into production. Wireless and automotive are further ahead. The big ramp in industrial is still ahead of us. We have a mountain of design wins, which are now moving into production. And if you look at 16-nanometer, we are already seeing very fast adoption of the follow-on MPSoC device, which is going to market much faster than the initial generation was. So this is a significant portion of our business, because it started from zero and was competing with over $2 billion of other markets. It\u2019s of other technologies. It took time, but it\u2019s already at 10%, and we expected of our overall revenue and we expect it to be a very significant portion and a growing portion of the revenue with each subsequent node that we come up with. And it fundamentally moves us to a different role in our customer systems. And we are now competing against ASSP quite successfully in a broad range of markets. And if you look at our automotive business, our position in ADAS is very different from our position in infotainment. In infotainment, we were a companion device. In ADAS, we are the central device in the system. And that transition that we have made into the hearts of our customer systems is continuing at a fast rate. And Zynq is \u2013 in the 60-nanometer version and definitely the 7-nanometer version, which will be even more powerful and capable will enable us to do that in more and more of the markets we serve.", "Steve Smigie", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you. Next question, please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Ross Seymore", "Hi guys. Thanks for letting me asking you question. I just want to go back a little bit to the December quarter and could you explain a bit more about what broadcast consumer did, you mentioned that auto was down from an inventory digest and that\u2019s understandable, but it seems like between what you delivered in December quarter in that entire segment and what you are guiding for March, it \u2013 there must have been a pretty steep decline in auto and then a pretty big snapback implied in your guidance, is there any color you can give on that, please?", "Lorenzo Flores", "Yes. So Ross, the other end markets in that group were also down a little. And you are right, our guidance for next quarter assumes \u2013 we really are expecting a significant snapback from automotive.", "Ross Seymore", "Got it. Thanks for that color. And then I guess following up on the prior question about Zynq, Moshe. Conceptually, how do you look at that as far as being an incremental adder of revenue to the company versus something where there is some resemblance of a substitution effect and I guess the reason why I ask it that way is the 20% growth sequentially, the 25% going from very little to now 10% of your revenues, those are very impressive numbers, but if I look segment-by-segment where that Zynq product resides, those are not growing nearly as fast as what I would think if Zynq is growing in there, so is there are some offset to that we are not appreciating or any description on that dynamic would be helpful?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. Well, generally speaking, if you look at our business, we tend to serve a lot of markets and those markets move at difference rates. And as a result, we typically have numerous \u2013 revenue from numerous technology nodes at the same time. So first order effect and this is before I talk about Zynq against vis-\u00e0-vis other non-Zynq technologies. So first order effect, you have older technologies that are shrinking and you have newer technologies that when we do well in those nodes and now we have three nodes in a row where we have done well, they tend to be growing. And what has happened over the past few years is it took time for the advanced nodes to get to the point where they could, even though we had well over our natural market share, but it took time for these advanced nodes to be able to compensate for the old nodes, which were shrinking. Now, if you sort of do the arithmetic, we are at 47% on the advanced nodes and 53% on what we call core technology. And so the growth \u2013 the accelerated growth in the core technology is generally compensating for and then some for the shrinkage in the old nodes. This trend of new node cannibalizing old nodes is just parts and parcel of the semiconductor industry. We are not very different than that. So every time we introduced a new node, it \u2013 to some extent, if all the customers need is the exact same device, but a little cheaper, they can achieve that by going to the new node and that cannibalizes. What sort has happened is over the years, we have provided a very significant integration play and this is where I am getting to answering your question, just in case you are wondering. This is where the integration enables us to capture a larger part of the customer\u2019s bill of material. And Zynq is part of that. And so if you look at the bill of materials now, we actually have the opportunity to replace ASSPs or standalone processors or standalone microcontrollers, at least in some of the markets, not all that we read. So yes, in that regard, Zynq is a market expansion play, but it very similar to the core business, it does tend to have some element of cannibalization. And that\u2019s why when you sort of look at the numbers, which we have projected, we are sort of on course to deliver the first of what our hopefully several 6% growth years, which we said was our goal last year. And we are pleased to have delivered on that. And part of it is through market expansion. And Zynq is a market expansion play. But it provides some market expansion, but you are right, it does cannibalize some of the revenue from the previous generation. And if you look at wireless as an example, which is a market, which we are now serving with Zynq, and before, we used to serve with what I would call advanced, but cleaner FPGAs, then yes, that\u2019s a market where we are cannibalizing the old revenue. But truthfully, if we didn\u2019t have the Zynq, we would not be playing in that market with these advanced nodes. So in some cases, it\u2019s an expansion. In some cases, you just need to move forward in order to standstill. And that\u2019s the name of the game is the semiconductors.", "Ross Seymore", "Thank you very much for that detail. It\u2019s very helpful.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Danely from Citi. Your line is open.", "Philip Lee", "Hi guys. This is Philip Lee on behalf of Chris. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I just want to dive a little deeper into the data center, the [indiscernible] opportunity there, how much revenue do you think you guys can do this year and how much of that is in new applications, such as hyper-scale or compute?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So the numbers we have projected are potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in and around calendar 2020. And we are still at the early stages, right. So and that\u2019s why our choice of words has been consistently very careful in terms of setting expectations. Now what has happened is we are seeing tremendous pickup and tremendous interest in public design wins with Baidu and AWS position us to \u2013 as this market evolves and as it emerges to service it in a unique way. But it would be premature to assume that there is going to be a huge growth in terms of revenue in fiscal year \u201818, right. It\u2019s still too early. These deployments are new deployments. We are committed to supporting them extremely well to enable them over time to develop into significant business, but this is not fiscal year 2018 where it will make a significant dent in whatever number we commit to for this upcoming year. It\u2019s still a little further out than that.", "Philip Lee", "Thanks, Moshe. Very helpful. And as a follow-on can you talk about your end markets the relative growth you expect this year, do you see any of the segments going faster or slower relative to the other ones?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "We will provide more insight, significantly more insight into that in May. It\u2019s still premature, but no, we feel that the technology leadership and the broad market participation are playing in our favor. And sometimes we predict that market A will grow and actually, it\u2019s a market B that grows. And that\u2019s one of the benefits of the broad market participation that we have. So, we will give you more data in May.", "Philip Lee", "Okay, thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "John Pitzer", "Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question and congratulations on the good quarter. Lorenzo, maybe I can ask the OpEx question a different way. If you look at sort of the ramp of OpEx throughout the fiscal year, you\u2019ve got a much bigger spend in the second half of the year such that if you just kind of straight line the March quarter guide, OpEx would be up 5% year-on-year in fiscal \u201818. I am just kind of curious given sort of the pace of tape-outs, especially in the back half of the year, this fiscal year, is there actually opportunity to take OpEx absolute dollars down going forward or is the opportunity set such that it\u2019s really about sort of the slope of the ramp and the rate of growth?", "Lorenzo Flores", "Yes. So John, I certainly understand both why you asked the question and how you kind of framed it, but I will go back to something Moshe has said and we are going to try very hard to stick to over the next 3 months. We want to provide you a much clearer view of what our 2018, or FY 2018 looks like as we come out of this fiscal year and into our Analyst Day. But I will address a couple of your points may be to help you out in the interim. We do have, as you noted, significant increase in the second half of the year from tape-outs that we are taking advantage of our leadership position and we think it was the right thing to do. We told you we are going to do it at our last Analyst Day and as we are doing it. We are also growing our overall R&D capability. So, those are factors we are going to have to balance as well as what we are doing on the next nodes in the next fiscal year. And I think it\u2019s probably more beneficial to your understanding of our operating model next year to wait rather than try to guess at it right now.", "John Pitzer", "That\u2019s helpful. And then Moshe maybe as my follow-up, notwithstanding your comments earlier about putting expectations around acceleration, just given what we are seeing going on in the GPU market right now and the uptake of GPU to the data center, given that it would seem that the FPGA architecture in a lot of instances for acceleration applications might actually be superior, what is it that that\u2019s allowing GPU uptick to be faster than FPGA uptake for these applications in the data center in the near term? Is it really a software stack issue or can you help me understand that?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "You are absolutely right. This was identified as a growth market by the GPU companies primarily NVIDIA, a long, long time ago and I give them credits for identifying that in their desire to diversify beyond their core PC and gaming focus, they invested very heavily on the software front. What we are doing is we are now taking a page out of their book. It\u2019s not necessarily the same page. It\u2019s a little bit of a different page. And we have to do that in order to enable broader deployment fundamentally, because the customer base \u2013 the target customer base is not FPGA savvy and it\u2019s very unlikely that they will become FPGA savvy. Hence, you need this higher level of abstraction. And so the core benefits in the silicon architecture are there and we are continuing to drive those in all of the current generations. Some of the customers have the capability to deliver on that by themselves. Some of them need quite a bit of help and we are providing that through things like this rest architecture solution, which should make it easier for them to access the technology. Now as that is done and then you can look at some unique deployments like the Amazon one is unique and that it\u2019s FPGA as a service, as we support that effort to enable them to expand the markets that could have a significant leverage with regards to the breadth of people who have access to it. That\u2019s why we are so excited. That\u2019s why we are getting some benefit from probably the biggest customer in the world and their business model and their approach to doing this. So that could, as it gets deployed and it\u2019s brought to the market successfully that could accelerate this entire process. So between that and the rest architecture, I think those are the things that we believe will enable us to get to market much faster. And it won\u2019t take us the same period of time, but it took other competitors in the past to develop this market.", "John Pitzer", "That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Sure. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is open.", "William Stein", "Great, thanks. Actually, I have a similar question to the last one, but maybe from a more generic perspective, you are highlighting this deployment at AWS. And as you just said software has been a big differentiator that\u2019s perhaps given NVIDIA some early traction there. But can you talk a little bit more generically about the architecture of FPGAs versus GPUs and then your architecture versus what Intel/Altera has, and why you expect to capture more share of this market relative to both of those solutions?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. So, let\u2019s step back. The market really is very, very nascent and the biggest player today is Intel through their CPU offering. And now a fast emerging player who has pretty significant deployments is NVIDIA with some of these hyperscale players. What has become very, very clear is as the market is evolving, it\u2019s also segmenting. And there are \u2013 it\u2019s becoming clearer what elements are served really well by NVIDIA, for example and what elements which sometimes overlap, but sometimes are totally different are better within all programmable solution. So in these early days, its first-mover advantage is significant. It does give a lead, but there are inherent advantages, which we believe we have. And Intel clearly recognized those and that was one of the major drivers as they publicly have stated for their acquiring Altera was to be able to address that market. So, there is a whole set of applications, which are learning-oriented where NVIDIA and GPUs have probably a better architectural fit, but most other applications, which are potentially larger, are better serviced by us and programmable logic.", "Now with regards to the competition against Intel, it\u2019s again very early 30 days. We believe that, a), anything which is non-Intel related were going to be the obvious solution, right? And so there is not insignificant business, which potentially could be serviced by AMD on x86 by IBM with their power solution and by the host of ARM guys and that will fall very naturally into our lap for obvious reasons. Having said that, that\u2019s not the only market we can play in, because we think that even \u2013 and we are hearing this from the major players even where they are currently using Intel x86 processors when they are looking for an acceleration, they are finding that our leadership in terms of silicon technology and the approach with the pooled architecture where basically you could have a pool of Xilinx\u2019 FPGAs, which provide acceleration, is more attractive to them than the approach, which Intel pursues which is more likely to strengthen their CPU hegemony with the one CPU, one FPGA solution, right. And that\u2019s where we think that for a lot of these players, we \u2013 even if they end up using Intel x86, they are likely to want to pursue an acceleration solution, which is not dictated by Intel. And that\u2019s where we have the opportunity. All-in-all, we are very careful in terms of setting expectations. And hence, it\u2019s still early days. We expect to see hundreds of millions of dollars in the 2,000 \u2013 calendar 2000 [ph] timeframe. And if we do well and all of these other things work our way, potentially it could happen maybe faster or maybe larger, but it\u2019s too early to commit and we are very careful in terms of highlighting that.", "William Stein", "Great. If I can get one follow-up, please, in the ADAS market, the big sort of category that I am aware of is this sort of hovering view stitching together for a camera corner view in some orders, but I am suspecting maybe it\u2019s much more diverse and at the minimum, you might have some sensor fusion applications, could you comment on the diversity of the design wins and the pace of ramps in those ADAS application? Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. So you are right that this is emerging and it\u2019s emerging very, very quickly. And the needs are quite fluid and they are growing and there are different requirements. And so there is a broad set of design wins, which address different approaches. And sensor fusion is sort of a buzzword for highlighting that there is a whole family of different sensors that are required, some of which point forward, some of which point inward, some of which point sideways, some of which point backward. And this market is evolving at a very, very fast rate. What we are seeing is due to be uncertainty in the market and the \u2013 and due to the fact that for automotive, it\u2019s moving, it\u2019s an unprecedented upgrade [ph]. There is a lot of uncertainty, and that\u2019s where we believe we have tremendous benefit because our solutions tend to enable a lot of flexibility as the markets change. And we are seeing that the major benefit with regards to competition with other companies that have a more ASSP oriented rigid solution. And we are seeing just a broad range of these different approaches and the design wins actually fall into numerous categories for us that \u2013 and enable us to address a lot of these. The early mover advantage we had here is helping us, because we have the relationships and it\u2019s already approaching 10% of our business, which actually makes this one of the biggest players in this market. Just don\u2019t have the marketing budget to sort of spray that over the Super Bowl, but we are doing really well.", "William Stein", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, this is Charles on for Toshiya. Thanks for taking my question. Just going to head on the data center side again, such tremendous opportunity, but I was wondering, as you kind of size your opportunity in hundreds of millions of dollars out to 2018, 2020, what are kind of the share \u2013 what kind of share does that imply for you guys in the acceleration market and I was just wondering what your TAM assumptions might be. And then I had another one, in terms of displacing NVIDIA, just wondering if you have any sense of the hurdles, maybe from a performance standpoint or a power standpoint that you have to overcome given kind of your weight in the game on the software side?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So the TAM is huge. The TAM today is \u2013 it has been growing maybe not as quite as quickly as it was before, but it has been growing and it\u2019s approaching $20 billion. And that\u2019s if you look mostly at the service side that primarily with x86 and the GPU side and that\u2019s sort of a market, which is already at that level now. That market is changing and it\u2019s changing to be serviced by more cost effective and power effective solutions and that\u2019s where we actually, for a broad range of applications can provide high performance, which we have demonstrated at a lower power point than competitive solutions, be they processors where the gap tends to be quite big and GPUs where the gap is somewhat smaller, but it\u2019s still substantial. And so if you look at the big market, you can say well, $20 billion market and we do not want to leave anyone with the impression that, that is all serviceable by Xilinx. However, I do believe that there is billions of dollars available to be addressed by alternate solution. And of that, we believe we can easily capture 10%. And if we do well, we can capture more than 10% of that over time. And the benefit will be higher performance to lower power point. And again for us, we have to accept the fact that we recognized this leg. And we now have to \u2013 we have the relationships with the sever hyper-scale guys. We have design wins with several of them in significant programs, but it\u2019s still going to take time for that to translate into massive deployments. And that\u2019s why we are providing these numbers, right in the hundreds and millions of dollars, which sort of correlate to the market share \u2013 potential market share of the serviceable market that I shared with you.", "Unidentified Analyst", "That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, you had mentioned some revenue from pre-5G builds, I was wondering if your outlook kind of on the timing of 5G has changed at all and if so, what\u2019s kind of driving that? Thanks.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So 5G originally because monetization of 4G took a little longer, there was an expectation that 5G would get pushed out about 2 years ago, maybe a little longer than that. It appeared that the tide had turned and there was a mad rush to provide 5G solutions. And we are benefiting from that because technology leadership has given us the full position with regards to this pre-5G deployment. Having said that, we think that the prime time for 5G is still likely in the 2020 timeframe and it\u2019s not going to be massive before that. If it is, we will be in a good position to address it. But we are looking at 2020 for the big wave of 5G deployments. And we think between now and then, there will be a lot of interim steps, which we are well positioned to service, but they are less likely to be true 5G. In terms of marketing statements, I am sure there will be a lot of ultra stating marketing statements, which will claim 5G and all of that, but we won\u2019t be \u2013 the real thing there will be a step in the direction.", "Lorenzo Flores", "Operator, we can take one more question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Rolland from Susquehanna International Group. Your line is open.", "Chris Rolland", "Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. So I am just thinking about India, perhaps that\u2019s the next area of infrastructure of growth and I know won\u2019t be as large as China, but also, we can understand that the equipment may not to be as heavily dependent on ASICs, so thinking in terms of actual FPGA content, what might India look like in revenue terms for you guys compared to China?", "Lorenzo Flores", "So we are actually pretty pleased with our position in India. We are benefiting right now \u2013 the strength in our wireless business, a significant portion of it comes from India-based deployments. So as that expands over time, we think we will continue to take advantage of it. But the outlook \u2013 specific outlook for the deployment is a little bit more murky, but as I said just a second ago, we are really well positioned with respect to our customers that have a position in India. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be of this scale in the near-term that the China-based deployments were and we also don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be as rapid deployment has happened in China. We still think it\u2019s a good amount of business for us.", "Chris Rolland", "Great. Also, on the auto side of things, at CES I think there was at least one announcement from a large German Tier 1. I think they currently use Zynq that they will be switching to NVIDIA solutions. I think ADAS is a great market for you guys, has been Zynq it will continue to be, but what gives you guys confidence that we won\u2019t see ASIC replacement in ADAS as kind of market standards start to mature here?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So I am not quite sure who you are referring to because we have a plethora of design wins and we also tend to have follow-on design wins with all of the current players and new ones. The market is evolving and it\u2019s changing quite rapidly. And there are people who have the strong position in infotainment who are trying and planning on playing in the market. It\u2019s \u2013 they are not coming at it from an ADAS-like approach, which tends to have a lot of distributed processing. They tend to have a approach, which is very, very super CPU or super GPU oriented with the central control. It\u2019s still too early to know which of these approaches will work. And what is happening is as the market is very fluid, the needs are fluid and the competition is very fluid and the automotive market is going through a huge transition in this regard probably in unprecedented transition. We actually believe that having been there early on ADAS and being involved in all of these next steps is very attractive for us. And that\u2019s why we believe that this will continue to drive our growth going forward. 10 years from now, it\u2019s quite possible that the market will be commoditized and there won\u2019t be the room for the changes and the uncertainty as to how the market will evolve. And at that point in time, it\u2019s quite possible that ASIC/ASSPs will gain market share, but I think there is several years ahead of us of fluid market where the flexibility of our capabilities and the strength which a lot of the strength, which is inherent that we just talked about in data center is actually very germane to automotive, right. And that\u2019s where you will find a higher performance at a lower PowerPoint solution with the programmable logic element. So we are quite confident that we are \u2013 for the next several years, we are in a very good spot with regards to monetizing this market.", "Chris Rolland", "Yes, I agree. Great answer. Thanks, Moshe.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Sure. Thank you.", "Rick Muscha", "Thanks for joining us today. We have a playback of this call beginning at 5 p.m. Pacific Time, 8 p.m. Eastern Time today.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx First Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.", "Rick Muscha", "Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We'll provide a financial and business review of the June quarter and then we'll open the call for questions.", "This quarter, we changed our revenue by product category classification. We make changes to these classifications periodically as products mature and new products are introduced, enabling the product categories to be more meaningful to investors. For comparative purposes, we have provided a supplemental schedule on our website at www.investor.xilinx.com that presents results based on both the new and old category classifications.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company.

This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.", "Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.", "Jon A. Olson", "Thank you, Rick. Xilinx's sales were $583 million in the June quarter, up 4% sequentially slightly better than the midpoint of our guidance. The quarter was characterized by strength in Asia-Pacific, particularly in communications applications, marginally better than anticipated shipments of last time buy inventory and expected weakness in North America driven by defense and industrial, scientific and medical. Turns were 55% for the quarter and relatively linear on a monthly basis. We continue to get the capacity we need from our foundry partners, and our lead times with few exceptions are within normal ranges.", "Gross margin was 66%, at the high end of our forecast due primarily to continued new product yield improvement. Operating expenses of $220 million were in line with guidance resulting in an operating margin of 28.2%. New product sales were up 31% sequentially, with strong growth from our 28-nanometer, 40-nanometer and 45-nanometer families. Sales of our 28-nanometer products increased significantly during the quarter surpassing our target of $10 million. On a year-over-year basis, new products are up nearly 80% with most of this growth coming from our 40- and 45-nanometer product portfolios, which continue to gain momentum as designs ramp into volume production. Mainstream products increased 4% during the quarter, but are down 16% versus the same quarter of the prior fiscal year and base products declined 5% during the quarter, but are down 10% on a year-over-year basis.", "Let me now turn to a discussion of end markets. During the quarter, we modified our end market categories in 2 ways. First, we moved all data center customers into the communications category. And second, we renamed the categories to be more descriptive of the applications contained within each category, as well as more reflective of how we run the business.", "The communications category will now become communications and data center. Sales from this category were particularly strong during the quarter increasing 8% sequentially driven by strong wired communication sales and double-digit sales to wireless applications.", "The category that used to be called industrial and other will be now called industrial and aerospace and defense. This category decreased 5% sequentially with decreases from industrial, scientific and medical and aerospace and defense.", "The consumer and automotive category has been renamed broadcast, consumer and automotive. Sales from this category increased 12% sequentially during the quarter driven by strength from audio/video broadcast and automotive, while pure-play consumer applications were essentially flat.", "Lastly, the data processing category, which has been a relatively small business for Xilinx over the last several years, was renamed other. This category will continue to contain applications such as high-performance computing, server and computer peripherals. Sales from this category increased 11% sequentially.", "Net income for the quarter was $130 million or $0.47 per diluted share. Other income and expense, with a net expense of $9.7 million, higher than anticipated due primarily to lower than anticipated income from our investment portfolio and slightly higher interest expense associated with the accounting treatment of the convertible debt instruments.", "Operating cash flow for the June quarter was $163 million before $8 million in CapEx. We paid $58 million in cash dividends during the quarter and repurchased 3.1 million shares for $99 million. The tax rate in the June quarter was 16%. Diluted shares for the quarter were 274 million shares. There was a 6 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions relating to the dilution associated with the convertibles, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com.", "Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased $16 million to approximately $3.1 billion. We have approximately $1.3 billion in convertible debt, and our net cash position is approximately $1.8 billion. Days sales outstanding increased 5 days in the June quarter to 40 days. Inventory dollars at Xilinx declined by $12 million sequentially during the quarter. Combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution together were at 99  days, down from 110 days in the prior quarter. We are now within our target of 90 to 100 days, but expect days to increase slightly in the September quarter.", "Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the September quarter at Slide 13. Our backlog heading into the quarter is down sequentially, due in part to the completion of our last time buy program, which we expect to negatively impact us by approximately $25 million. This is a somewhat larger number than we had originally anticipated given greater than expected last time buy sales in the June quarter. Additionally, we believe macroeconomic uncertainty may result in unpredictable customer ordering patterns. That being said, we are expecting continuing growth from our new products as we continue to enjoy strong demand for products in all technology shipping in this category.", "From an end market perspective, we expect communications to be down sequentially. Within communications, there will be certain pockets of growth such as wireless in North America and most data center applications. However, we expect these areas of growth to be offset by declines isolated to a couple of major end customers as they adjust internal inventories.", "Within industrial and automotive -- excuse me, industrial and aerospace and defense, we expect defense and test and measurement to decline with ISM to be relatively stable. Lastly, we expect broadcast, consumer and automotive to decline driven by consumer and automotive, with sales from broadcast expecting to increase. As a result, we're expecting total sales to be down 4% to down 8% sequentially with sales from all geographies decreasing.", "The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 57%. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 66% consistent with the June quarter. We continue to make progress on margin improvement projects across our product portfolio with particular emphasis on new product margin improvement. Operating expenses in the September quarter expected to be approximately flat at $220 million, including $2 million of amortization of acquisition related intangibles. Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $8 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 274 million shares. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 16%.", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. While there continues to be uncertainty in the current economic environment, I'm very pleased with the sales increase of 4% in the June quarter. This growth was driven by double-digit increases in half of our secondary end markets.", "New product sales were exceptional during the quarter, increasing more than 30% sequentially. This growth was driven by across-the-board strength from both our 28-nanometer and 40-nanometer, 45-nanometer product families indicating widespread customer adoption in all application segments. Particular sales from our 28-nanometer product family grew significantly in the June quarter exceeding our $10 million milestone. There is no question that we are realizing the advantages of our highly differentiated breakout portfolio that includes not only FPGAs, but also our pioneering all programmable 3D ICs and SoCs.", "The growth in June was driven by significant increases in revenue shipments of Virtex-7 and Kintex-7 FPGAs, Virtex-7 3D ICs and Zynq SoC products. Our 28-nanometer product family rollout continues at an accelerated pace. Not only did we achieve a significant revenue milestone for the family through the announcement of the first shipments of our Artix-7 family FPGAs, we are now shipping members of the entire 28-nanometer family. The Artix-7 devices extend the reach of 28-nanometer FPGA technology to applications requiring low power, low-cost programmable devices with the highest performance in the industry by far for this category of device implemented in a small form factor. Artix-7 devices are securing design wins in a large number of applications, including portable, medical, handheld radio, small cellular base stations.", "This past quarter, we also began shipping for revenue the Virtex-7 H580T FPGA. This is the industry's first 3D heterogeneous all programmable product. Virtex-7 HT devices use our stacked silicon interconnect technology to deliver the industry's highest bandwidth programmable devices, featuring up to 16 28-gigabit per second transceivers and 72 13.1-gigabit per second transceivers, making them the only single-chip solutions for addressing key 100-gig and 400-gig line card applications and functions.", "With the April announcement of our Vivado Design Suite, we now have all 4 key elements of about 28-nanometer portfolio in the market. All programmable FPGAs, SoCs and 3D ICs coupled with the next-generation design environment enable these next generation devices. The customer acceptance of Vivado has been outstanding, with more than 200 beta customers designing with this new software suite, which provides up to a 4x productivity advantage and an improvement of 15% in terms of quality of results over previous generation development environments.", "28-nanometer design win momentum continues at an unprecedented pace. We continue to see customers move away from ASICs through programmable imperative accelerated this node. The same time, we're integrating and displacing evermore ASSPs, as mid-tiered vendors struggle to fund and deliver on their next-generation devices, while our 28-nanometer portfolio is enabling a whole totally new level of programmable systems integration coupled with game changing price-performance per watt parameters.", "Additionally, with our breakout 3D Virtex-7 ICs and our Zynq-7000 SoC products, we're penetrating markets and applications that traditionally were not served by FPGAs, and there is no PLD competition there yet. We have demonstrated indisputable leadership with our 28-nanometer portfolio. We have now shipped parts from all 5 of the 28-nanometer product families to hundreds of customers further demonstrating the very broad acceptance of the family. Having achieved the $10 million sales milestone in the June quarter, with sales expected to exceed $20 million in the September quarter, I'm confident that this 28-nanometer node will, by a very significant margin, be our most successful node ever. Despite some near-term concern in the macroeconomic environment, our clear 28-nanometer leadership puts us in a phenomenal competitive position that will enable continued share gains, against both ASICs, ASSPs and traditional PLD competitors.", "Let me now turn the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ian Ing with Lazard Capital Markets.", "Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "You talked about 5 out of the 10 submarkets being up this quarter. Can you talk about which end markets are sort of most or least below their prior peak in demand and given the guidance, are we done with inventory replenishment and restocking at this point?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, I'd say from a peak perspective Ian, this is Jon, I think from a peak perspective, wired is a little bit below the peak and ISM is a little bit below the peak. I think those are a couple that are, I would say, marginally softer, but slightly softer. And then the computing aspect of things has been down a little bit from its peak, but generally others have been up. I'd say so wired and wireless down a little bit, I didn't mention wireless, wireless has been down a little bit because obviously there was some bigger build-up when both China and U.S. we're going at the same time. So it comes down a little bit and then pure industrial down a little bit. And did you have a second part of that question, Ian, I'm sorry, I missed that.", "Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Just your sense as -- is inventory replenishment and restocking over at this point or if there's still...", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. I may make some general comments about our posture and positioning here. And I think from an economic perspective, we really are seeing -- we aren't seeing anything really negative out in the market. I mean, orders have slowed, but yet cancellations and push outs have not increased. And my view here is there isn't any -- there is not significant build up of inventory in the overall in any of our end markets, with some exceptions in the communications segment. There are a couple of customers that I think have been procuring inventory a little bit ahead, and they're going to work through that in the next quarter or 2. I think that's the only place where we see anything. And that really isn't across the board, that's just at a couple of selected customers.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.", "Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division", "Just a follow up on that question, I'm wondering if you could kind of breakout, is it on the wireless or wireline side of this inventory piece, a few major customers that you have are building some inventory?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, it's wireline, primarily. Sometimes it's hard to tell because we do ship to some customers that have both wireless and wireline, but it is a little bit more wireline than it is wired.", "Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division", "And then I guess the second question would be on the industrial side, which had a -- we just rebounded in the March quarter, I guess in the June quarter with some inventory refresh or replenishment to the cycle there, do you think that's now kind of a little bit completed or do you think there's any legs left in that part of the business?", "Jon A. Olson", "I think it's completed, and I think everyone's being really cautious about ordering. I wanted to emphasize our -- the fact that our lead times are in great shape on a relative basis so there -- my belief is that people are being a lot more cautious about stocking inventory, and they know they can get it in a relatively short amount of time. So if I go back to look at some of the other cycles we've gone into, we've seen push outs and cancellations increase ahead of the revenue drop, and we really aren't seeing that. So I think it's possible we've been cautious on our guidance for the coming quarter, but I do think we're going to be going through -- living through periods of up and down here as people make a decision on whether the economy is slowing down or not. Yet we still see CapEx spending very strong in the wireless area and even some wired initiatives going on in China. So it doesn't feel unhealthy to me. It's just feels like a lot of caution.", "Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division", "And I'll sneak one last one if I could on the P&L. R&D was supposed to peak, I guess, in the September quarter, is that still the expectation, I mean, in the back half of the fiscal year we see some decline in the overall OpEx rate?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, so total OpEx I believe will still be lower in the second half of our fiscal year than in the first half of the fiscal year. That being said, I think OpEx will move up a little bit from the $220 million in the December quarter, but then decline in December. So we're going to have a little more flat, instead of having a more pronounced peak like peak, it's going to be a little more flat than a decline.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with JPMorgan.", "Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So Moshe put out some 28-nanometer revenue targets, can you just give us a sense of how you expect 28-nanometer to ramp after this quarter and then if you could provide what the 40-, 45-nanometer revs were in the previous quarter and how you expect that to ramp as well?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, well, we aren't making any specific forecasts for this year, Chris, on 28-nanometer, but we do expect every quarter to increase on a going forward basis throughout the rest of this fiscal year. We're seeing very strong uptake from our customers even for samples, which is an extremely positive view relative to history on 28-nanometer. So we would expect increase. I know we're forecasting going from exceeding $10 million to exceeding $20 million and on a percentage basis, that's pretty good. I doubt that, that percentage increase will continue, but I do expect significant growth on a quarter-by-quarter basis for the rest of the year. And our 40 and 45, the whole new product, the new product category now is defined by being 28-nanometer and 40, 45 technology solely. So there's nothing else in there. So we grew overall new products over 30%, so 31%. And so I think you can probably do the math since we gave you the 28-nanometer number, you can figure it out pretty well.", "Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And for my follow up, I guess a bit of a longer-term question, so if we look at your guidance for the September quarter and compare it with a year ago, revenues have bounced around, but it's roughly flat. And yet OpEx is up, I want to say like almost 15%. So can you just talk about your longer-term plans on how to get a little more leverage out of the model and to get the OpEx down towards your target and how do you feel about -- like the growth of the PLD industry and the growth of Xilinx these days?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, so there's no question that we are spending ahead of the revenue growth level at this point in time and that's really primarily to leverage our leadership at 28-nanometer to make sure we get everything out as fast as we probably can and that speed and then the expense of the technology are driving that. And we've talked about in our long term revenue growth model of 8% to 12% growth. I mean, we need -- in order to get ourselves into model, we do need to grow at least at the 8% growth, and certainly the midpoint of that 8% to 10%, 5-year CAGR would put us in a position where we would comfortably be back in the model in my opinion. So we do need that, the top line growth in order to make that happen and to the extent that it happens, then our model holds, to the extent it doesn't happen, then we'd have to reevaluate, but we're not in that situation of thinking about reevaluation at this time.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "And we're confident that the strong position on 28-nanometer is what will drive that growth, hence the ongoing investment to make sure that we don't compromise that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura.", "Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Jon, can you just explain this last time buy issue demand? I'm not familiar with it. It looks like it's having a meaningful impact to your guidance in the quarter. Is it a problem that goes away after the September period?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, well, this is just the obsolescence of old technologies that after 12 to 14 years, we tell our customers that since volumes are relatively low we're not going to continue to ship small quantities and hold the manufacturing capability in our foundries beyond that, and we'd give them a long notice to say, better to tell us all of the units that you need and then take them, and we give you a last date that you have to actually receive them all. And so, this is basically a 2-year cycle that goes on, so every 2 years, we have this kind of process going on. And in this particular cycle from that technology, yes, we have had some elevation in the normal run rate for those products, which we've characterized as approximately $25 million impact in the September quarter. We will be shipping a very limited number of those products from those technologies on a go-forward basis. So yes, after -- starting in September, we won't be shipping very many of them.", "Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And then on North America infrastructure, it was an area of strength for you last quarter, and I think you guys are saying it's going to be up again this quarter. Considering that this market tends to be lumpy, are you at all concerned that maybe it fades as the year progresses?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, so we're still very bullish about wireless. Our customer's customer serving North America, and we believe that even though if you just look at the CapEx spending between Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile, at least Verizon and AT&T on a year-over-year basis, you said, while the CapEx spending really isn't going up that much why would Xilinx improve? Well, if you look inside of where they're spending their CapEx, they aren't spending on wired. They're spending more of it on wireless this year than they did last year. And so we're benefiting from their increased focus on 4G rollout in the U.S. And Sprint continues to be deploying as well and then T-Mobile in the second half of this year starts to kick in, in North America. So we are -- even though many of those units are shipped at different geographies for build and then shipped back into North America, we are still very positive on the rest of this year's impact with respect to our business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO, Bank of Montr\u00e9al.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Jon and Moshe, first, just a little bit more clarification on what I'm hearing from you guys versus what the customers are saying because on the wireline side it seems we have seen a parade of misses from the com equipment guys, and they have specifically called out North America spending slowing down, so you are saying that North America wireless is trying to think. Ericsson also talked about LTE becoming stronger going forward, but just reconciling that with what you were saying and more importantly, you mentioned that no \"alarm bells\" are going off and maybe you didn't use that word, but what then sets the alarm bells for you guys when you look at the order patterns, kind of what are the metrics that you look at and say, \"Uh oh, this is not what we were thinking,\" i.e. it's much worse than what we were initially thinking. And then my quick follow up was rather tied to what Chris was asking, interestingly enough, when you go down another node and we heard about multiple patterning and how that entails a higher cost, would that keep your OpEx higher as you go to the next node of  Virtex?", "Jon A. Olson", "Okay, so back on the comment on infrastructure business and particularly in North America that wire -- actually, wireline is a little softer. It will go down in the September quarter we believe and is wireless and that is the biggest issue positive issue for us. Wireline overall is, I'd say, stable in most places, down a little bit in North America and then down a little bit in Asia-Pacific. So it is kind of a mixed bag for us, it's a net down. But wireless, while wireless is -- went up quite a bit in the June quarter, a very healthy double-digit percentage, we think we'll be able to kind of hold that level, if you will, and there are these additional things that are happening with other carriers that we believe is going to give us some strength. So I know it's a little confusing because it's up some places, down some places, but we think we're in a really good position in this cycle with both, 65-, 40- and 28-nanometer technologies across the board winning designs at the key suppliers supporting LTE technology. Then your ordering pattern question. Yes, I know, there's all these things written in the paper, there's been a couple of companies that have come out and say things are softer in industrial, and they might miss their numbers and those kinds of things, and I respect that and that's why I think we've had a relatively cautious forecast, meaning down because we do think some things in industrial are going to be much more challenging. The data points that we look at are the rate of cancellations and push outs, the rate of orders, particularly when you're talking about industrial, how it shapes up from our distribution channel and what their forecasts are and what they're seeing, and we look at that by geography so we get a sense as to whether it's one geography or broad-based, a broad-based scenario. And it's entirely possible that we aren't seeing it yet and it's yet to come, but I also don't -- we talk to customers, we aren't getting the feeling that they're canceling their orders. And our backlog's down some, it's not down gigantic amount. So there's  a lot there that could push out and cancel if they wanted too. So we look at all those data points, we review all that weekly, and we've taken our best shot of what we think the quarter is even though I know there's all this macro uncertainty that you read about. And I try not to read the papers too much because it can get you depressed and try to use the data to guide the business. Then the third question's around node...", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Yes, why don't I take that? So definitely, 20-nanometer is going to be more difficult than 28 and similarly 28 was technically more challenging and more expensive on a per device basis than the 40-nanometer. And the way we are addressing it is we are being ever more diligent in making sure that the return on our engineering investment is there to support the level of investment. So generally speaking, I think that it should more or less remain at the same level, but we will be more careful with regards to tape-outs and we'll make sure that everyone counts as they become more expensive and more difficult and the design investment, it's incumbent upon us to make sure that the returns are there to support it. So generally speaking, our product planning is more meticulous at the 20-nanometer node than it has been at the 28-nanometer node and similarly at the 28-nanometer node was a lot more disciplined than it was of the previous node. It's one of the reasons that we believe we have actually hit the ball out of the park on the 28. The products were designed very well, and they're more or less getting that response from the customers. They're getting the right level of performance and power for each of the target markets, and we just need to be more diligent because you can't, if the design costs go up 2x or the market costs go up 2x, then you definitely can't afford to have the same number of tape-outs and hence we are being more careful and more meticulous about the planning process.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Ryan Carver - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "This is Ryan Carver in for John Pitzer. Just following up on that last comment, given the focus on the return of engineering investment on the allocation of engineering resources for future nodes, how does that coincide with your stated intent to be pursuing ASIC and ASSP sockets, which traditionally have a lower ASP? I mean, how do you balance this resourcing for future nodes towards the right efforts with also pursuing traditionally lower ASP sockets?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "So that's a good observation, one doesn't preclude the other. We just need to be -- to the extent that we're targeting or replacing ASICs and ASSPs, which is happening en masse basically. Clearly, much faster on the ASIC front than on the ASSP front, but its happening on both of those areas. You just need to make sure that the devices you do come out with are targeted to compete effectively and have the right performance and power and set of features that the customers need. So it's incumbent upon us to do that. Having said all of that, you need to realize that these same parameters apply to the ASSP and the very, very, very few companies that are still pursuing ASICs and typically only for extremely high volume consumer-type application. And their design costs are going up, so they can't continue to blanket the earth and start designs willy nilly, and they're not. And what we're seeing is an ongoing accelerated transition where less and less companies are pursuing those angles on the ASICs front and on the ASSP front to be very well documented that the companies that are moving forward, are moving forward very aggressively, and we are one of those who strive to be at the leading edge, but more and more are holding back and saying, \"Well, we'll design at the new nodes 2 to 5 years from now because we can't afford it anymore, and at that point in time the market costs will go down and the yields will be at their peak, et cetera, and we'll be able to make the financials work.\" But at that point in time, we will, if we continue to move forward, we'll have a big advantage versus those companies that are holding back and that is part of the programmable imperative and it continues at least at this point basically unimpaired and full steam ahead.", "Ryan Carver - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Great. And then just sort of going back into the coms business. If you look back to the Q1 timeframe, I mean, you guys were up sequentially in coms, where your comp was sort of down 20%, and it seemed to be a pretty big gap in similar sectors, albeit, different geographical mixes and now you guys are talking about sort of a down September quarter on large customer inventory burn down. So I'm just curious, how much of the strength in the Q1 and the Q2 timeframe calendar-wise was attributable to perhaps pull-ins versus sort of organic demand?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, I don't think there's any impact on any pull-ins to any large degree. We did call out, there was a couple of customers that built -- that has some inventory issues that we believe they built ahead. But on a broad-base, there really wasn't an exacerbated calendar Q1 or calendar Q2 impact from any of that. We were participating in a recovery in the March quarter in a very large way as customers very broadly across all of our end markets replenished their inventory, and I think we've had more, say, typical growth out of an inventory cycle.  I'd say it's very typical for us that you'd have to ask a competitor about their particular profile and issues.", "Ryan Carver - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Great. One last if I could, on 28-nanometer relative to March quarter expectations for the growth, I mean, how does that growth trajectory look? And I guess what I'm thinking about is, given early in the year commentary that 28-nanometer would be sold out through the balance of the year, how has your 28-nanometer trended relative to what you had perhaps told your foundry partners at the beginning of the year and are there any issues in terms of needing more product that they be can potentially supply or being forced to take more product than you actually need?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Well, we projected some time ago that when we'd hit $10 million this quarter, and we're delighted to have done that, and that's in line with our plans. For several quarters, we expected this to be a $10 million quarter. And similarly, we're looking at the $20 million mark and for the quarter we are in, the September quarter and as Jon alluded to, we expect growth, and it could be significant growth through the rest of our fiscal year because this is a rocket ship, and it's one of those things which when it takes off, given the nature of our business, it doesn't turn on immediately, it starts layering. And we're seeing an acceleration, which is the fastest we've seen, which we strongly believe is a function of the technology position we have and the breadth and depth of our product offering, plus the very significant advantage this gives over the previous generation of product in terms of much lower power and much higher level of -- much higher density or gate count. So fundamentally, the product offering is very strong. We're seeing that translate into design wins. Now design wins, those are very big numbers, they're in the billions of dollars at this point, but what really matters is revenue and that's the number we're fixated on, and that's the number that really matters. And we feel very comfortable in our fab partner, TSMC, at 28-nanometer being able to cover for us, and you need to keep in mind that these are great numbers for us, but these are still small numbers in terms of wafer volume for a large fab like TSMC. So they have the capacity to address this, and we do not see any issues either this year or to be honest next year in terms of meeting our demands.", "Jon A. Olson", "Nor do we have any deals, any relationship that forces us to take a certain amount of wafers out. You made some comment that I didn't really -- maybe I had misinterpreted, but that's not how our relationship works where we're required to take it. So I wasn't 100% sure where you were going. First it was sold out. You said it was sold out, implying that we didn't -- we couldn't get capacity. Well, we have what we need to meet our revenue needs, and I guess that's all I'll say about it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS.", "Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Moshe, first of all, congratulations on the progress you've made on 28-nanometers. Can you give me, is it possible for you to provide some color as to the relative strength of this business across the 3 segments you mentioned, the stacked silicon and the high end product content so that I can just kind of get a sense of where the strength is coming from,  why is it different across the board.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Okay. So no, we have 5 general product families and 2 of the 5 are unique, and they are product families that we pioneered, and we believe we have huge as in a year or more and potentially could be significantly more lead over the competition. Those 2 product families are SSIT, the 3D stacked silicon; and the Zynq product line. The Zynq product line is still, in terms of number of units shipped, it's quite significant, but it's a small ASP. The stacked silicon tends to be a smaller number of units, but it's quite significant for devices of that complexity, and it is a significant part of the revenue that we have shipped. In addition, when you look at the 3 other product families which are the mainstream ones, which is the mainstream Virtex-7. That is basically doing extremely well, is ahead of plan and given that it has a significant power advantage over the competing products, plus we actually have higher overall bandwidth going in and out of those devices. We're seeing a tremendous level of design wins, which is starting to translate to revenues. But that's not yet huge as part of the $10 million number. So the largest components of the number are the SSIT and actually the Kintex product offering. But very shortly, we expect the Virtex to translate into a significant number and actually if you look at the overall Virtex family it will be the majority of the revenue at the node will be the Virtex and the SSIT, which is the high end of the Virtex. And then the Zynq is sort of an expansion play, which is on schedule and we already have in our mind a year at a minimum of lead over the competition and that is starting to move into volume production in the foreseeable future. So it will be a major part of our revenue coming soon, but it will be less than either Virtex or Kintex as a stand-alone. Artix, we have sampled the product and that tends to be the low end so in terms of the overall percentage of the revenue that will likely be the smallest of the --", "Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Of the mix?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Of them all. Hopefully, that answers your question.", "Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "It does. It does. Let me just ask you a difficult question, part of the strategy to drive growth is to retake share in the 40-nanometer category, and you've grown that over just -- in the quarter that just ended. Any way for us to calibrate your progress and if we have any sense as to where your share was and where you like it'd to catch so that we know how to calibrate that, that would be helpful.", "Jon A. Olson", "Jon could just...", "Jon A. Olson", "Let me try that. So quarterly share is really dependent on customer mix and things like that relative to us versus our competitor, and so when I did the Analyst Day, as you may recall I talked about the fact that in calendar year '11, we had 35% share at that node, and we felt on a run-rate basis over the next several years it was going to move up to 50%. Last quarter, I'll say the March quarter, make sure we're in the right quarter, March quarter we estimated to be in the low to mid-40% because we shipped quite a bit, our competitor didn't ship as much. This quarter, I don't know what this quarter is going to be, but we had very significant growth, as we said, we had over 30% growth of new products and the overweighting dollar value of our new products happen to be in 40-, 45-nanometer because we're still very fresh with the 28-nanometer, $10 million or so. And so we had a very, very strong growth of 40-, 45-nanometer so we're very happy with where we are in terms of these key designs that are moving into production and starting to take volume. And I think because we've modified our new products to be only 2 technologies now, it's going to be easier for you guys to figure out what the growth  numbers are, good, bad or different at any given quarter as we provide that data and information.", "Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Sure. That's helpful. And just one last question please, if I may. Moshe, can you just provide a bit more insight as to what's going on within China, ZTE, which is one of your customers, preannounced recently I think on Sunday night and that if I think about the various phases of events within China, it's something a little difficult to kind of get a clear view. So any sense as to how you see the China coms business developing and the road you expect to play in that will just be my last question.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Well, China's been a focus area for us, and it clearly was a smaller business for us than it was for our primary competitor, and I think part of that was due to a geographic focus and part of it was due to product focus. And I have no doubt that the Chinese companies and the 2 biggest ones are very well known are going to do very well in the communications business, and we feel that we have by far, the best product offering which addresses their requirements. So we don't know who the winners are going to be, but in terms of percentage of business for us in China, it should be much higher than it has been in the past and that will be driven by 28-nanometer. And it's already manifesting itself in terms of design wins and actually significant parts of the $10 million was shipped into China. So best we can tell that's going in the right direction for us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra with Baird.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Could you talk about the -- what you see in terms of small cell in terms of FPGA content? How meaningful that could be later in the year and whether we should be concerned on second generation of those small cell that there could be some migration back into ASIC or you think that FPGA has a very solid position in those new products or new class of products?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "So what is becoming clearer is that they are going to be heterogeneous networks, which have a mix of macro cells and small cells and when we talk to our key customers in this area, we're hearing more and more that they expect that to be the norm, and it isn't going to be one replacing the other, but both of those will need to coexist, and they expect their end customers to deploy networks, which has a mix of those. And so as such, we are continuing to see a big investment in wireless base station infrastructure buildup which uses FPGAs. In those cases we actually see that the FPGA is becoming a larger portion of the bill of materials as our customers painstakingly point out to us every time there's a negotiation. And so generally speaking, we're addressing what is a larger market. Portions of it will definitely be addressed by small cells and those might be either done as ASICs or there's a whole host of ASSP companies that are probably overpopulating that arena and hoping that it will grow at a large rate. We expect those to coexist and we actually play in some of those markets with our products, but it's not in the high-volume consumerish places. It's in -- for a larger number of users that's where FPGAs are used to implement that. So this announcement on the death of macro cells is, and I'm paraphrasing, very premature at this point in time and everything we hear from our customers implies that they're going to be deploying massive amounts of macro cells in the future, both short, medium and long term, and it's not a one technology obviates the need for the other, they both will coexist.", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, we're actively designing for some concept with FPGAs as a player in certain categories, in certain numbers of users of the cells -- of small cells, which if you get more educated, everybody's got their own version of a small, medium and large, but we believe we can participate in the medium-sized and the larger sized small cells if you want to get to be real basic in that. So we do think that we are -- we do believe it's going to grow and that category is going to grow, and we think we have a play in them as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering if you could talk about on the wireless side, some of the geographical trends you're seeing and you expect over the next couple of quarters there's been a lot of mixed data points about what's happening in India and China and in other geographies including Europe. Can you maybe talk about what kind of deployments you're expecting? Do you think those are slowing down or you see them as largely unchanged in the end of the year?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, so let me take that one, Jim. Over the next 2 to 3 quarters, I think there's a bigger opportunity for carrier spending first in North America then in Europe and then maybe third in China, and then India would be last. And I know Europe might sound odd, but some of our data points seem to indicate that there is a need to have more CapEx and to start to upgrade the network, which is starting not to keep up in some of the suppliers in particularly they have not even really touched the LTE technology at this point in time and there are carriers that are now making the call to invest even in the face of -- for their biggest macroeconomic uncertainty is, which is in Europe. So if those actually -- if they really go forward with that, I think that will be a very positive thing for us as well. I've talked a lot about North America and how strong it is with all the major carriers here making investments. Even Russia, for example, we believe there's a big play going on in Russia to start to roll LTE and again that's a very positive thing relative to the customers where we are. China seems to be the biggest potential consumer, but not a whole lot of movement going on about when things really happen, and when things are going to take off. And then India, I have no new information on India, just seems to still be uncertain of when it's going to happen.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful color. And then maybe as a follow up, normally in the December quarter, your defense business is up rather strongly based on the visibility you see in products today and how you think that's going to shape up, do you still think that's going to be the case this December quarter or do you think there is a potential that the fiscal issues could -- and the budgetary issues could have an impact on that this year?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, there's always an issue. There's always a chance that the fiscal issues could have some impact. But typically, it's more the volume or our revenue is typically projects that are well in flight somewhere and sometimes that can be impacted by the short term freezes and things like that, in other times not. I would still expect a better December in aerospace and defense than in September. That's my expectation, but I have to admit I have not looked at it on a customer-by-customer basis yet. We're saying we're down at September versus June, and I would -- my expectation is that we would be up again in December in that category.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just a question on the magnitude of your guidance by segment, about 4 out of your down 6 points in your overall guidance is coming from the last time buys, if we take that out of the equation, you talked about your main end market categories, can you give us an idea of the magnitude of how you believe those would perform? Kind of what would be best, what would be worse, et cetera?", "Jon A. Olson", "Parsing out pieces of our revenue and not having a way to explain it to you on an equal basis is actually a little dangerous thing for me to do. I don't think I'm going to give non-GAAP information about our end markets that we publish on our filings and things like that by taking certain things out. I will -- I can tell you that, that last time buy has impacted several -- we ship things to several end markets, but industrial, automotive, aerospace and defense and some communications and kind of in that order. Those are the ones that were impacted the most by it. So you might imply from that, that oh, since industrial is going to be kind of flat, not counting aerospace and defense, then gee if you didn't have last time buy maybe it would have been up a little bit. So I'm not trying to be difficult, but I don't really think I want to get into non-GAAP analysis.", "Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Got you. And then one that might be a little bit straightforward, I guess, just a clarification of an earlier comment you made, Jon, on the OpEx trajectory for the rest of the fiscal year. Just to make sure I have the fiscal and the calendar quarters right, did you say that the December quarter OpEx would actually be up a little and then the bigger fall off to get the back half down year over or half over half would be in March or was it actually going to be down in the December quarter as well?", "Jon A. Olson", "It's what you said first, it will be up, it's going to be up a little bit in December quarter and then down in March.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays.", "Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I guess first question just a point to clarify. In terms of end of life, what was the sequential downtick in September that's negatively impacting your guidance?", "Jon A. Olson", "$25 million. Okay, we'll ship $25 million less of that category of inventory in September then we did in June.", "Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And that will fully be resolved end of September and should not impact revenues going into the December quarter or will there be a sale?", "Jon A. Olson", "Correct. The tail is really, really small. So essentially it's -- that's it. Now we're done with that, with that technology.", "Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Excellent. And then I guess a question on 28 and thank you for the great color there in terms of what's driving the growth in the mix there. And I guess my question is on the stacked silicon side, can you talk about what the kind of growth trajectory looks like there, my understanding is that emulation is the biggest driver for you guys, and I guess curious what the sustainability of growth looks like and how we should think about that part of the business exiting calendar '12 and moving into calendar '13?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "So you're right in highlighting that emulation is a driver, but it's not the only driver and so if you look at who would use stacked silicon, you need to look at the -- what it provides customers and basically provides the customers with higher capacity and higher bandwidth than they can achieve any other way. And to some extent, it generates a market in of itself because the only other way to achieve this would be to design a hideously expensive ASIC and in some cases, even if they went to the most advanced process node then they would need to design for these to achieve these high frequencies, which is in of itself a very significant challenge. So clearly, the people who use it first are ASIC prototyping, but actually then it moves into other areas, which are wired communications, test and measurement and actually A&D, and it's all in the high end of those markets. So this is not a one quarter wonder and then the whole thing goes away. It does not really go away until there's an alternative, which if you use traditional forms at the very earliest, is available at the next process node, and it's available at the next process node only when the largest chips are available at the next process node, which typically take some time to get there. So you can count on this having a significant vibrant life and emulation are the early swallows, but then full-fledged spring starts with all of the other applications that use it, and it should have a 3-year life cycle just driven by the fact there is no other alternative. And as such we are very pleased with the opportunities it opens us.", "Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "That's very helpful. If I could just sneak one last question in. Jon, what is -- and I know it's hard to calculate because nothing's normal these days, but what is typical seasonality for Q3?", "Jon A. Olson", "Q3 calendar, Q3 fiscal, trying to make sure it's September.", "Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Calendar.", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, September quarter. As you look back at our history, it's been up a little. So pretty flat and of course the standard deviation is actually pretty broad. We've had some times where we've been down a whole lot and up a whole lot, but if you look at averages over the last 5 years or 10 years, it's really in the neighborhood of kind of a plus or minus 2% range.", "Rick Muscha", "Thanks for joining us today.

G. Edwards ", "Operator", "Good afternoon. My name is Kristin, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx First Quarter FY'08 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions) ", "Please limit your questions to one and refrain from multi-part questions to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone. After each participant has asked their question, their line will be muted and they will be placed back in the conference. If time permits, additional questions will be taken. ", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Maria Quillard. Thank you, Ms. Quillard, you may begin your conference. ", "Marie Quillard", "Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today are Wim Roelandts, CEO, and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the June quarter, and then we'll open the call for questions. I will then end the call with a few housekeeping items. ", "As published in our press release, our business update for the second quarter of Fiscal Year 2008 will take place in the form of a press release after the market closes on Thursday, September 6. After we update our guidance, we will be in a quiet period until we report the following month. ", "Let me remind everyone, that during our conference call today we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially. ", "We refer you to the documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections for forward-looking statements. This call is open to all and is being web-cast live. It can be accessed from our Investor Relations website. ", "Now let me turn the call over to Jon. ", "Jon Olson", "Thank you, Maria. First of all, I would like to mention that we will only be reporting GAAP results going forward and will no longer detail our results on a pro forma basis, excluding stock based compensation expense. With our earnings release, we are now publishing selected cash flow information which will lift the impact of stock option expense or you can obtain the information from our 10-Q filings. ", "Revenues in fiscal Q1 increased 1% from last quarter to $446 million. Gross margin of 62.2% was in line with our forecast and was essentially flat to the 62.1% reported in the prior quarter. Continued yield improvement on 65-nanometer and 90-nanometer products more than offset a customer mix that was heavily skewed towards large OEMs. These large OEMs generally drive higher volumes which result in more favorable pricing. ", "Operating income was $97.5 million, up 23% from $79.4 million in the prior quarter and up 5% from $93.1 million in the same quarter a year ago. This increase is due to a combination of factors including continued cost reduction efforts as well as decreased stock based compensation expense. ", "Net income of $84.3 million was down 4% sequentially and up 2% from the same quarter of the prior year. Net income for the quarter was impacted by approximately $8 million of interest expense associated with our debt offering, our first full quarter since issuance, and $3.5 million discrete items in our tax provision. The improvement in our operating model is due in part to ongoing cost reduction effort across the company. OpEx reduction is a key focus for Xilinx, and during the quarter we continue to reduce discretionary spending. ", "Additionally, R&D expense is benefiting from improved quality and execution which is reducing product development expenses, as well as the impact of lower mass cost. As we have mentioned before, in fiscal year '08, we are committed to achieving the bottom end of our operating margin goal of 24% to 26% by Q4, which should be a significant improvement over the previous year. ", "Going forward, controlling cost will remain focus of the company as we work towards consistent performance at or above our corporate model. Other income including interest expense was $14 million, slightly lower than guidance of the $15 million we've provided. Free cash flow during the quarter was $111 million, after $16 million in CapEx. And we paid dividend of $0.12 per share during the quarter. The tax rate for the quarter was 24%, higher than our guidance for the reason I stated previously. Let me now comment on the balance sheet. ", "Cash balance increased $118 million during the quarter to $1.9 billion. Factoring in the $1 billion convertible, our net cash position is now approximately $933 million. Day sales outstanding increased seven days to 43 days. The increase was primarily driven by the timing of payments from customers, and the timing of shipments during the quarter. Combined inventory at Xilinx and distribution decreased 19 days to 101 days, with 79 days at Xilinx and 22 days at distribution. ", "Many factors contributed to the large decrease, including improved forecasting accuracy, fewer mixed issues and distributors decreasing our inventories, entering a seasonally slow summer quarter. In the September quarter, we expect to see a slight increase in days occurring at both Xilinx as well as distribution. Our goal for the remainder of fiscal year '08 and beyond is to keep combined inventory levels at 110 days or below. ", "I will now turn the call over to Willem to comment on our business and products. ", "Wim Roelandts", "Thank you Jon and first let me give you my own comments on the June quarter. The June quarter result turned out as planned with just a few exceptions. From an end market point of view, communications showed growth as we forecasted. After three quarters of communication revenues declining, total communication sales increased driven by an improvement in both wireless and wireline. Our RSP and defense business also showed excellent growth this quarter, as we predicted after the seasonally slower March quarter. ", "During last quarters' call, we forecasted that all geographies extension plan would be up sequentially. Japan was down sequentially as planned, but so was Europe, which turned out to be surprise. This quarter our top 10 European accounts, which represent 45% of total European sales were up 16%, but the main remaining channel accounts were down 19%. The weakness was mainly in the distribution channel across a few end markets including industrial, audio and video broadcast and data processing. ", "On the products front, we saw that the new product category would show strong growth compared with the prior quarter. Indeed new products grew 17% sequentially and now represent 28% of total revenues up from 24% in the prior quarter. Revenues from Virtex-5 and Virtex-4 were particularly strong during the quarter and sales from the Spartan-3 families also increased sequentially. CoolRunner-II was the only product family that didn't show growth, but remember the CoolRunner-II grew approximately 30% in the March quarter. ", "Total booking for the quarter totaled 67%. April started strong, May was soft and June, although starting out weak, ended strong; a pattern very similar to the March quarter. Total Virtex revenues grew 3% to 54% of overall revenues. Spartan revenues increased 2% to 26% of total revenues and the CPLDs, however, declined this quarter and now represent 9% of total revenues. Down from the 10% last quarter. ", "From a geographic prospective Asia Pacific was the strongest region, growing 12% quarter-to-quarter and reaching a record 29% of total sales. China was a standout contributing about 12% of overall revenues and increasing nearly 30% sequentially. China revenue was driven primarily by communications-led customers, several of which are deploying TDS CDMA wireless based stations. ", "In terms of end markets, communication grew 3% to 45% of total revenues. Wireless increased sequentially as its wire lined, but to lesser extent. Wireless remains under 15% of total sales. Enterprise networking increased only slightly, while telecom remained lackluster especially North America. ", "This quarter our 25 communication customers grew sequentially after three quarter decline. The industrial and other category grew 7% sequentially driven by increased defense sales as we predicted. The double-digit strength in defense was offset by declines in industrial, scientific and medical, which was strong in the previous -- in the prior quarter and is expected to rebound in the September quarter. Consumer automotive declined 6%. Good growth in automotive was offset by a flat panel weakness and a seasonal weakness in audio video broadcast. ", "Lastly, data processing segment declined 8% of -- it declined to 8% of total revenues with weakness across server, storage and computing applications. We do expect to see some improvement in the September ending quarter as some of the programs ramp up. ", "On the product front new products grew 17% sequentially driven by double-digit growth of both Virtex-5 and Virtex-4 product families. Virtex-5 nearly doubled from last quarter and Virtex-4 grew almost 25% sequentially. The Spartan-3 families were nearly 10%. ", "Mainstream products declined 5%, which is the more difficult pattern expected to be seen going forward. Virtex-5 continues to receive extremely positive customer feedback. All the LX, LXT and SXT devices are now shipping on or ahead of schedule. Volume production has begun and the design in momentum continues to run. ", "Yields on this high-performance 65 nanometer family has been better than any other Virtex product family at the same point in this life cycle. This last quarter we've seen working silicon of our FXT Family, which includes both transceivers and the embedded processor. We are very pleased with progress made to date and expect to start sampling this family before the end of our fiscal year. ", "Let me now turn to the guidance for the quarter, the September quarter revenue guidance is for sales to be flat to slightly down. We are expecting North America and Europe to be down slightly on the sequential basis, either proceeding to be flattish and Japan to be up. From an end market perspective we are expecting communications to be down slightly due to typical summer season out in the wireline telecommunication industry. ", "Industrial and other is expected to be up driven by defense as well as rebound in science, scientific and medical. Consumer will be flattish and data processing is expected to rebound slightly from the June quarter. ", "Now, let me turn the call back to Jon for some final remarks. ", "Jon Olson", "Thank you, Iain. Gross margin was expected to be approximately to 62% to 63%. Combined operating expenses are expected to be up approximately 2% sequentially driven primarily by our annual salary review process as well as increased stock-based compensation expense related to the annual option restricted stock unit grants. ", "Research and development spending will be approximately $90 million, SG&A spending will be approximately $92 million. Amortization expense will be approximately $2 million. Other income including the impact of interest expense was expected to be $16 million. The share count was expected to be approximately flat at 303 million shares. And the tax rate is expected to be 21%. Let me now open the line for questions. ", "Back to you operator. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "The floor is now open for question. (Operator Instructions) And your first question is from Credit Suisse, Mr. Michael Masdea. ", "Deepak Sitaraman - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. Good afternoon. This is Deepak Sitaraman for Michael. ", "I guess, first off Wim, could you share with us, again the comments you made about ordering pattern in 2Q, and maybe also comment on order linearity in 2Q as well as what you are seeing in the current quarter? ", "Wim Roelandts", "So, yes. I assume when you say 2Q you mean not first quarter for our fiscal year, the June quarter, is that correct? I assume it\u2019s correct. So the order pattern that we have seen is that communications was up. Both the wireline and the wireless communications was up during the quarter. ", "We expect for next quarter this to be slightly down mainly because of the summer season and the vacation season. A lot of our communication business from Europe, which of course, closes down in part of this quarter. ", "Computing was down and we expect that to be slightly up going forward. The consumer and automotive was down this quarter. Automotive was up, the consumer was down. We expect that to be sluggish for next quarter. ", "And then the industrial and other, which contains aerospace and defense, industrial, medical, scientific we expect to be up \u2013 were up this quarter and we expect it to be for next quarter mainly driven by the defense. ", "Linearity, April started strong, May was soft, and then June order started off weak, but then ended strong. Next question, please. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Citigroup, Mr. Glen Yeung. ", "Rohini Raghunathan - Citigroup", "Hi. This is Rohini Raghunathan calling in for Mr. Glen Yeung. My question is about the operating expenses. You have said that you are focusing on reducing the operating expenses. Can you give us some details on what specific activities you are targeting to reduce it? ", "Wim Roelandts", "Sure, at the beginning of the year, the beginning of our fiscal year in the March timeframe when we were completing our annual budget process, that\u2019s the what kind of a beginning of the self sided more structural conversation, what we wanted to do in the R&D in the SG&A area. And at that time is where we determined that we were going to cancel a major program of ours. So we did do that. It was an unannounced product, but we cancelled it to free up engineering resources. ", "And we also re-calenderized some of our engineering efforts, so as we didn\u2019t have to higher more resources in order to complete the projects. So essentially re-aligning our product plans and the focus on the planning aspect that was. ", "So those were kind of some of the, I would say, some of the larger decisions. But since then, we have had also put together a variety of groups focused on discretionary spending, cutbacks, efficiency around the company, efficiency inside the business units and engineering. ", "And then lastly, we\u2019ve launched some efforts around reducing product costs, cost type of -- a focus around, improving both our cost of our current products, as well as, focusing on design for cost going forward. ", "So, all those things, I would say, are in the beginning stages. We have seen some pretty good success so far. As you can see our spending number was down more then we had forecast, and a lot of that increased improvements from what we thought was really around the focus and the results around discretionary spending, as well as these decisions I talked about earlier in terms of the engineering projects. Next question, please. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from J.P. Morgan, Mr. Chris Danley. ", "Lewis Polshock - J.P. Morgan", "Hi. This is [Lewis Polshock] calling for Chris Danley. I was just wondering if you could comment on your market share? Do you think that you may be losing share, or gaining share, give me a sense of where that\u2019s going? ", "Wim Roelandts", "Well, so, you know our competition is not announced. There are a number of sell certificate to know but, my understanding is that the guidance is also in the pretty low single digits area side. If you lose any market share in this quarter, there will be minimal. The last study we did which was at the end of the calendar year, which was kind of where you see the full calendar year was that we maintained our market share during last year those were minus a few tenths of a percent maybe. So and I expect that this pattern will continue certainly for this quarter or for this fiscal year. ", "We have some very new products are ramping up, which are unique in the market like our Virtex-5 family and 65-nanometer. We are the only ones shipping high performance 65-nanometer products. And we are really gaining a lot of momentum there where as such there is no competition from our competitors. ", "Our Spartan family has very broad range of products covering multiple different aspects of the industry. So we feel pretty good that things will continue to ramp in these new products. Several of the new Spartan families were introduced earlier this year. So all of these families are slowly going to ramp up and that should help us in the second half of the year, next question please. ", "Operator", "The next question is from Robert Baird, Mr. Tristan Gerra. ", "Tristan Gerra - Robert Baird", "Looking at the recent pick up in wireline and networking, would you characterize this just as an easy comparison or is there any secular trend there? And if you had any comment beyond the September quarter as far as whether we should expect communication to stabilize or maybe even increase as a percentage of total revenues? ", "Wim Roelandts", "Yes, you know there clearly is a lot of activity in the communication field, some of you have called it a Triple Play. And there is, when I visit customers there is indeed a lot of activity people are looking for higher speed, the metropolitan area networks which are there running a 10 gigabit, people are moving to 40 gigabit networks. There's a lot of activity in fibre-to-the-home delivering of video to the home, video servers. So there's a lot of things going on. ", "It's still too early to say that this up tick that we have seen this quarter in communication really is the beginning of longer term trend although up. Because you'd probably there couple of points before you can assert that but certainly within the next between the foreseeable future could it be three months, six months or a year, we won\u2019t see an increase in the communication business because of the there are continued deployment of these side speed networks. The continued deployment in 3G wireless and of course our success that we have had in some of the consumer products related to that. ", "So I believe that we are at the verge of growth in the communication sector that is pass it on the what we have seen in the last seven years which has been pretty poor, so we expect that things will start to improve in the communication sector going forward. ", "Another thing that is important is this that the communications service companies the service providers' balance sheet is in very good shape. So I believe that they will start investing in some of these new capabilities going forward. Next question please. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from A. G. Edwards. Mr. David Wong. ", "David Wong - A. G. Edwards", "Thank you very much, Virtex-5 could you give us a rough idea of what their actual magnitude of sales are at the moment and what you expect out of Virtex-5 in terms of sales may be next year ? ", "Wim Roelandts. ", "Yeah it's difficult, David to predict. We obviously have not done our planning for next year yet. It will begin in this year but I continue to believe that even if the industry doesn't improve, that Xilinx will see a better results going forward, not in the September quarter, which is traditionally our weakest quarter, because of vacations and things like that. ", "But in the second half of the year, of the fiscal year that we'll see business starting to improves simply because of what I said, we have a lot of new families ramping up, Virtex-5, Virtex-4 is really still ramping up surely some basic or some big road for actually big big numbers. Virtex-5 is off course is just ramping up now but also we introduced I think three new Spartan families earlier this year and they should be a ramping up during the rest of remaining of the years, so that would help our top line going forward. ", "For us about it difficult to predict at the moment you know it's, like is I said, it really depends if the whole high tech industry starts to improve further. So, is telecommunication which is still 45% of our business, have been pretty weak over the last seven years. You know with very little growth in that period. And I think all of that came from the dotcom bubble and the access of all the that time, their the Y2K installations, I think they are slowly getting behind us now and I think that the industry is ready for some reinvestments and off course that will position driving very well to take advantage of that. Next question please. ", "Operator", "The next question is from Deutsche Bank Securities from Mr. Arnab Chanda. ", "Arnab Chanda - Deutsche Bank Securities", "First of all, do you think there is a difference between, what you are seeing to distribution versus their actual OEMs and then second question is if you look at the communication infrastructure market, is there a difference in behavior in wireline versus wireless and is that partly at all responsible? Thank you. ", "Wim Roelandts", "Well, first of all on the what we have seen like I've mentioned specially in Europe, we saw a kind of a diversion picture where that large companies are growing, that is a good billing of smaller companies that declining it is to early to take a conclusion of that it could simply be a temporary one quarter affect of the other thing we could say is that in general, when things are going in different directions the small companies adapt faster and first, because they tend to be more nimble. And now we know the Europe has come up with a phase where there was a little growth happening in the last year, year and a half. So people are questioning if here the work will continue. ", "But I think it's too early to say that, but it certainly would be an indication that may be things are going to slow down there overtime. Next question? I am sorry, so your question was what? ", "Arnab Chanda - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Wireline versus Wireless. The difference. ", "Wim Roelandts", "The different between wireline and wireless. A very different behavior, of course, wireless is heavily focused in newly developing countries; Asia; in China, and in India. And we see that will continue. Clearly there's a tremendous growth taking place there, and we are very well positioned with the third generation systems. We are very well-positioned with the Chinese standard called TD-SCDMA. So that will continue to work for us. Now the wireless business tends to be more lumpier depending on certain [contact] wireline and things like that. So you will see probably more and more in the wireless business. ", "And wireline is a lot more stable, it's a lot more fixed. It's the traditional business, and so it\u2019s a little bit better to forecast. And the increase totally in the wireline is certainly encouraging although it's rather a small increase in our business. Next question please? ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Morgan Stanley, Mr. Louis Gerhardy. ", "Louis Gerhardy - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, good afternoon guys. One housekeeping question, and I apologies if I missed this in the first round. But, what is your turns expectation for this quarter? ", "Wim Roelandts", "Turn expectation, we didn\u2019t mention it. So you didn\u2019t lose it. But our turns equitation is pretty similar to the current quarter in the high 50s. The score was 57, it could be 57, 58, 59 somewhere in that range. Next question? ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Banc of America Securities, Mr. Sumit Dhanda. ", "Mark Sholes - Banc of America Securities", "Hi, this is [Mark Sholes] calling for Sumit Dhanda. I have a question on inventories. Your internal inventory was down 16 days sequentially, and the total inventory was down 19 days sequentially, implying that distribution inventory was down three days, and yet deferred revenues were up 10% quarter-over-quarter. How do you reconcile this? Thanks. ", "Wim Roelandts: ", "The deferred revenue, its heavily impacted by not just the volume but also the mix of what's in there. So, that might lead you to believe that gross margin of what's remaining in deferred revenue account might be higher than it was on average in the previous quarter, which then might lead you to believe, it's a mix of a higher, more expensive high-end products where margins could be higher. And I don\u2019t have the precise analysis at my finger tips, but those are things that would cause that particular thing to happen. ", "I think another factor here is, if you look inside at where some of our inventories was down, I think wafer receipts were a little lower than we had anticipated. So you get low run with number in there that might have an impact that would drive inventory down as well in addition to what you are seeing in the deferred account. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your next question is from Bear Stearns, Mr. [Danny Kuo]. ", "Danny Kuo - Bear Stearns", "Just wanted to get some granularity on your consumer and automotive guidance for the quarter, it looks like in the past two years that business has been up missing or they are just contrary. And just in the quarter just wondering what's going on there, and if whether you're seeing a bit more drastic deadline on automotives, which is being offset by the strengthened consumer or you are just kind of staying away from the lower margin consumer business. Thanks. ", "Wim Roelandts", "What we have seen in fact this quarter was really a strength in automotive and a weakness in consumer. And part of that is seasonal because typically the first half of the year consumer tends to be weak and then start moving upwards in the third quarter, and especially in the fourth quarter in preparations for the Holiday Season. ", "But this time we have also seen some weakness, and like I mentioned that in my prepared remarks about the flat panel market which is another sort of bonus that people expected. So there is pretty hefty ASP declines in flat panels but there is overcapacity. And so the ASPs are coming not just for planners of course, but also for the equipment which they are using. And so that could be another weakness that we are seeing beyond just a simple season weakness. ", "Our belief is still that for the second half of our fiscal year, especially the December quarter we see strength in the consumer market based on our designing activities that are ramping up and thing like that. Automotive is overall to be a small market for us, but has been a strong effort for Xilinx so we continued to grow there and we expect higher growth rates for the market continuing in the higher double digits -- I am sorry it's not higher double digits, 20%-30% range. Okay. Next question please. ", "Operator", "You have no further question at this time sir. ", "Jon Olson", "Great, that's good. ", "Operator", "Okay, well thank you for joining us today. We have payback of this call began at 5.00 pm Pacific Time and 8.00 pm Standard Time. For a copy of our earning release, please visit our IR website. To reiterate, our guidance update for the September quarter will be posted after the market on September 6. ", "Our next earning release date for the second quarter of fiscal year 2008 will be Thursday, October 18th, after the market close. This completes our call. Thank you for your participation.

My name is Marvin and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Q2 Fiscal Year 2007 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions].", "I would now just turn the call over to Maria Quillard, thank you. Ms. Quillard you may begin your conference.", "Maria Quillard - Vice President Investor Relations", "Thank you and good afternoon. With me are Wim Roelandts, CEO and John Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the September quarter, and then we will open the call up for questions. I will then end the call with a few housekeeping items.", "This quarter we changed our product category classifications. The last time we changed our classifications was exactly two years ago. We do this on a regular basis as we introduce new products to the market, making the product categories more meaningful for investors. A five quarter history of both the new and old methodology will be hosted on our investor relations website.", "We have also changed the name of the storage and server category to data processing, to more accurately depict the type of applications found in this category. As published in our press release our business update for Q3 of fiscal year 2007 will take place in the form of a press release after the market closes on Thursday December 7th. After we update our guidance we will be in a quite period until we report the following month.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially.", "We refer you to the documents the Company files with the SEC, including our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.", "This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Investor Relations website. Now, let me turn the call over to Jon Olson.", "Jon Olson - Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you Maria. Revenues in fiscal Q2 decreased 3% from last quarter to $467 million, slightly better than the guidance provided during our business update due to better than anticipated bookings in the month of September. Gross margin of 61.3% was within our guidance of  61% to 62% and an increase from 60.1% in the prior quarter.", "Now let me turn to operating and net margin. Operating income was $93.2 million, essentially flat with last quarter. Net income of $93 million or $0.27 per diluted share was up 13% sequentially including stock based compensation expense of $22 million. Factors impacting the sequential improvement of net income include a higher than expected increase in interest and other income and a lower tax rate which I will discuss in a moment.", "One additional item impacting both operating and net margin was the fact that stock based compensation expense was lower than our original guidance of $25 million due to refinement of forfeiture rate assumptions and the impact of the purchase price adjustment for employee stock purchase plan consistent with the terms of the plan. As a result we expect stock based compensation expense to be approximately $22 million for the next several quarters. Excluding stock based compensation operating income was $115 million or 25%, down 6% sequentially. Net income was $110 million or 24%, up 4% sequentially. Interest and other income of $26 million was better than the guidance of $20 million primarily due to the gain on the sale of UMC stock during the quarter.", "We generated $105 million in free cash flow during the quarter and repurchased 5.9 million shares for $125 million. We also paid $30 million in dividends. The tax rate for the quarter was 22% lower than anticipated primarily due to the release of reserves associated with the expiration of the statute of limitations for fiscal year \u201803 federal return offset by the tax impact of the gain on the sale of UMC stock. Let me now comment on the balance sheet.", "Cash balance increased $160 million to $1.8 billion due mostly to the sale of UMC shares I mentioned previously. Day sales outstanding increased 7 days to 36 days, a result of strong shipment profile at the end of this quarter. Combined inventory at Xilinx  and distribution increased by nine days to 126 days. Internal inventory levels increased eight days while distributor inventory days increased by one day.", "I will now turn the call over to Wim to comment on our business and products.", "Wim Roelandts - Chairman, President, CEO", "Thank you Jon, and first let me give my own comments on the September quarter. The September quarter is always very challenging to forecast due to the summer seasonality. While we expected turns in the month of September to pick up from the July and August levels, orders ended on a stronger note than we had and resulted in us achieving our original revenue guidance.", "The September quarter revenues were down 2.9% sequentially in line with our prior 40 years average, which has been down about 2.5%. Summer seasonality was evidenced during the quarter which weakened on anticipated bookings through July and August. Bookings picked up again in the month of September and the turns bookings for the quarter were 53%.", "Like Maria mentioned, we really find out a new found category removing V-II Pro and Spartan-IIE both of which were introduced over three years ago and incorporated them into the mainstream product category. We also moved the original Virtex and Spartan-XL to base products from the mainstream products. Consequently new products grew by 18% sequentially driven by double digit increase from Spartan-3, 3E, Virtex-4 and CoolRunner-II.  CoolRunner-II shipped 1 million units to a single customer during the month of September, a major milestone for our CPLDs.", "Our 90 nanometer products which include which includes Spartan-3, 3E, and Virtex-4 contributed to 20% of revenues this quarter. At 20% our 90-nanometer product shipments are out pacing all other PLD companies. Spartan-3,3E and Virtex-4 should continue to drive revenue growth for the next several quarters. Our latest 65-nanometer Virtex-5 product family generated its first revenues although immaterial to date.", "Due to an over inventory situation at some of our large communication customers along with mergers in that space our mainstream product revenues were negatively impacted. Products like Virtex-II Pro and Virtex-II which have been shipping in volume production for several years are more prone to inventory accumulation. V-II Pro saw a number of cancellations and push outs from wireline and wireless customers in the September quarter. Next quarter we believe that revenues from our mainstream products will be flourished compared to down double digits this quarter. Our base products declined 2% sequentially and we accept base product revenues to routinely decline overtime as many of these products near end of life.", "Total Spartan revenues grew 1% sequentially to 26% of overall revenues. CPLE\u2019s were flat at 9% and total Virtex revenues declined 5% to 53% of total revenues. In total geographies, Europe was down sequentially and Japan up sequentially as forecasted. America was flattish, which was slightly better than we thought. Asia-Pacific was the one region which was weaker. As we highlighted in our mid quarter update, the Asia-Pacific softness was due to a handful of global communication customers that subcontract manufacturing in Asia. In addition Chinese infrastructure spending was weaker in the September quarter.", "In terms of market data now, communications was done 9% to 45% of revenues, the lowest percentage that it has ever been. Wireline communications where weak in North America and Asia Pacific while wireless was soft in Europe and Japan.", "Industry was a bright spots this quarter as defense applications drove the 5% sequential increase. Defense and other outer space sales now represents over 10% of revenues. Consumer and automotive grew 1% sequentially, consumer was at double digits but the growth was offset by audio, video and broadcast which declined quarter to quarter.", "Let me now say a few words about our latest product family Virtex-5. This past Monday Xilinx announced that we are now shipping to first 65 nanometer FPGAs with hardened protocol blocks. Virtex-5 LXT is the first FPGA family to deliver fully compliant and characterized hard-coded PCI express and Ethernet Mac box. The Virtex-5 LXT platform also features the industry\u2019s lowest power transceivers consuming less than 100mW per channel at 3.2 gigabytes per second. PCI Express and Gigabit Ethernets have emerged as the leading interface standards for FPGAs and are accepted to account for over 80% of all port shipments in a few years.", "Today we are shipping seven Virtex-5 devices, four out of six LX devices and three out of six LXT devices. Also shipping is our 8.2i Integrated Software Environment tool suite, known as ISE, supporting the Virtex-5 family. The ISE either 2 designer environment enables 30% faster performance on previous generations of FPGAs. We are very pleased with how smooth our Virtex-5 execution has been so far. There are few new materials or equipment needed to produce 65 nanometer, in addition we are introducing improvements to our product introduction process including more rigorous correlation of our product process matching prior to producing wafers. We have also placed increased focus on early product functional acquisition with key customers prior to broad sampling. Both of these process improvements have allowed us to remain on scheduled for our 65 nanometer roll out, and significantly ahead of the competition.", "Let me now turn to the guidance for the quarter. The December quarter is typically a relatively strong quarter for Xilinx as our customer\u2019s infrastructure spending resumes. In terms of end markets we are expecting communications to be up sequentially, industrial increased due to another strong quarter in defense and in consumer automotive to be as well. Data processing of 10% of revenues expected to be flattish. We also have forecasting all geographies to be up sequentially although Asia Pacific is the biggest risk. The one caveat is that we will need returns in the high 50% range due to our reduced beginning backlog position. On the other hand with our four to six week lead times and our customers inventories in better balanced customers will tend to order for immediate delivery. Turns in the high 50% range is definitely no doubt unusual.", "Taking all these into account we are forecasting revenues to increase 2% to 5% sequentially in December ending quarter. Now let me turn this call back to Jon for some remarks.", "Jon Olson", "Thank you Wim. Gross margins are expected to be flat at 61% to 62% including $2 million of stock based compensation. Combined inventory days are expected to be approximately flat at 126 days. R&D expense will be approximately $99 million including $10 million in stock based compensation. SG&A will be approximately $93 million including $10 million of stock based compensation. Amortization expense will be approximately $2 million. Other income is expected to be approximately $18 million. The share account is expected to be $340 million shares and lastly the tax rate is expected to be between 23% and 24%. Let me now open the lines for questions, back to you operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Masdea with Credit Suisse.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes, good afternoon this is Thomas Ross[ph] calling in for Michael Masdea, could you discuss a little, what you\u2019re seeing in terms of customer mentality as you enter the December quarter and specifically could you comment on what you are seeing in terms of inventory levels in the supply chain.", "Jon Olson", "Sure, I would say that customers are quite optimistic, they are going forward. I believe that the decreases in raw material cost and energy prices have created more positive feeling amongst our customers. The inventory of course is something that they keep under very close control and because really when you look at inventory, its not really only in two points, its at the end customers for final integration in the form of stuff boards and it is of the companies like Xilinx who have the price suppliers and so it something that we want it very carefully, but obviously depends very much on the sell through from our customers obviously evolve over the next quarter. I think that people are quite optimistic and I think the inventories are in the -- well controlled. Next question please", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citigroup.", "Glen Yeung - Citigroup", "Thanks, can you just talk about what it is in the month of September that turned around may be one end market that show that kind of strength and then I will have one quick follow up after that.", "Jon Olson", "Well, you know it\u2019s really was very broad based and both from the end market point of view with of course the caveats that we have indicated, I mean communications being done but even their communications improved, the wireless and wireline improved, the military started to rump up. So it was very broad based from an industry point of view than little bit based from the geographic point of view. So there was really no specific indications that there was a one element that -- here. It was a broad based recovery after very weak July and August.", "Glen Yeung - Citigroup", "So when we look into the Q4, a lot of other companies are talking about weakness in communications, particularly in base station business and I wonder particularly as regarding for it to grow, you think you\u2019re seeing something different or is it just a different mix for you or what might it being.", "Jon Olson", "Well, I think that in general trend we see down cycles faster than most other companies and vice versa. I think the week that we saw in June, July and August, I think other people are now maybe seeing that. Then also don\u2019t forget there are communications are at an all time low, so you know we don\u2019t believe that we were down somewhere as, I don\u2019t think that I said that we will grow a lot.", "Glen Yeung - Citigroup", "Okay, that\u2019s all -- thanks.", "Jon Olson", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Adam Parker with Sanford Bernstein.", "Adam Parker - Sanford C Bernstein", "Hi, what do you expect to happen to your and in the distribution inventory level during the December quarter, do you plan building through seasonally strong March, would that be normal or how should I look at that?", "Wim Roelandts", "No Adam, the you know we keep very tight control over distribution inventory and in fact that\u2019s why we bought it together with our own because we have really managed -- our December there is -- quite closely and our growth is typically around 30 days so this quarter was on the low end side and it really depends on how the sale true is the end of the quarter.  You know, I think a strong September created a lower inventory levels of our distribution, but in general we keep it very well controlled and I don\u2019t expect any big changes in that matter.", "Adam Parker - Sanford C Bernstein", "Sure you are not worried about you know, what's happened a few times in the past, the few years you know, which is you know this inventory level building and then impeding your progress at some point in calendar \u201807.", "Wim Roelandts", "It certainly could happen, but you know times have changed a lot, you know I mean if you look at 5 years ago distribution was really not you know 60 to 90 days of inventory and the same was for Xilinx to do. Xilinx runs up around 90 days. I mean this quarter was little bit higher because our openings were lower than anticipated, and that the distribution in running up 30 days or less. So it is really and they are liking it because one of their measures is there bit number of returns that their inventory does so its something that is quite different from what it used to be several years ago. So I don\u2019t expect any big changes because you know they are really carried out when you look at the inventory, if you look at historically.", "Adam Parker - Sanford C Bernstein", "Okay thanks.", "Wim Roelandts", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Seogju Lee with Goldman Sachs.", "Jim Schneider - Goldman Sachs", "Hi this is actually Jim Schneider for Seogju Lee. Thank you for taking my question. First of all, could address perhaps the inventory mix that you are seeing in your internal inventories?", "Wim Roelandts", "Well yes, obviously the on a number of various point of view, our newest products have the highest number of days because we really anticipating growth in this areas and so we have to build inventory for higher growth next quarter. Jon said that the more mainstream mature products inventory is going to be much lower because they are stable, there easy to forecast. So if you look at the -- those are the inventory it\u2019s always skewed towards US products, probably a kind of a distribution in time, we try to keep as much of our inventory especially in (inaudible) bank and that is still the case today. So I don\u2019t have the exact number, percentage here in mind, in front of me, but 100% of our inventories sitting in (inaudible) bank and then we\u2019ve a very fast back end process where we can package and test these and send to our customers typically in less than two weeks and so that is one of the reasons why distribution is running with less inventory because we keep it special so we can really customize it depending on the speed rate and pack it the way the customer want and therefore minimize our inventory. Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Stanley with JP Morgan.", "Chris Stanley \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay thanks guys. I realize that the bookings had pick up recently, but I\u2019m checking through my notes and you haven\u2019t done high 50s turns in over a year and I guess you know given the disappointment in the last quarter I\u2019m just wondering why guides for that?", "Wim Roelandts", "Yeah, well you know if you look at the statistics you know we have highest close to 50 over 60 during -- not in last three quarters, but in the pervious four quarters we were -- on the previous three quarters we were in the high 50s almost 60. So out of the last six quarters three were of 60%, three were of 55% so I think that the -- typically when there is a risk for shortages, people puts more ahead of time and I don\u2019t have to remind that beginning of this year there were shortages in industry even though the values we managed are extremely well even early times by a couple of weeks as compared with normal. I think all of these is not behind us and I think that\u2019s why our customers were confident that if they need we\u2019ll be there. So I think it\u2019s very natural if you look back over the last years why we had lower turns in the beginning of the year. There were shortages in the industry and now the shortage is pretty much gone. Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tim Luke with Lehman Brothers.", "Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks Jon Olson I wonder if you can give some color on some of the factors playing into the gross margin and I also wondering separately in seeing the improvement income to that suggest maybe the dislocation associated with some of the big mergers in the wireless infrastructure area whether it was Nokia, Siemens, or Alcatel Lucent, is largely been observed. Is that one of the factors that played into the wireless weakness? Thanks.", "Jon Olson", "On the gross margin Tim, things are really kind of valiant so I would say we -- as long as we can keep our mix in a reasonable shape. We are pretty confident about hitting our 61% to 63% model. New products are stronger and that\u2019s you know, our margins are typically weaker in the beginning of the prior lifecycle and then they get up to proper model after awhile. So there was a little bit of downward pressure from that and the fact our mainstream products were weaker than we thought. But again in total, if we can keep our cost reasonably well controlled and we keep the mix about right, we are okay in this model. If the trend from the last quarter continues and new products grow dramatically faster than everything else then we could have a bit downward pressure but we don\u2019t anticipate that happening. Our relative year communications improvement question of what\u2019s really going on with some of the merges and acquisitions. You know, it\u2019s a hard thing for us to tell quite frankly when you sit in the summer months because some of the MI activity is out of the combination of North America and Europe. And they are typically slow in the summer, anyway. So you know, we look at that and we particularly let\u2019s say Lucent and Alcatel and we have done a lot of studying on both sides of it and while there are some overlap for us there isn\u2019t a great deal over the last in there. So I suspect there is a -- still a little bit flood coming for us from that merger that we haven\u2019t seen yet. But again we don\u2019t see in that particular situation a big change in our business. Thank you, next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Wong with A.G. Edwards.", "David Wong - A.G. Edwards", "Thanks very much. You mentioned Virtex-5 which is just beginning to start them now. Can you remind us of things that make the budget five special, what are the differentiating factors in your view for Virtex-5, it could be -- you talk a little bit about your thoughts on family and what attributes you are going to build on or actually for that family to help differentiate that family?", "Wim Roelandts", "Sure, well Virtex-5 first of all, it\u2019s our first family in 65-nanometer technology so what it really means is that average dia size approximately 50% smaller than the equivalent sized Virtex-4 products. Secondly, we really implemented a new program logic architecture with (inaudible) and a new routing system which we call (inaudible) which is almost three-dimensional routing system. Both of these together create integrated with our software allows to have performance up to 30% faster than the previous generation product. You know that with the advancing technology, technology doesn\u2019t give you that much of a performance boosts anymore or if you want it, it cost you dearly in power consumption. So here in fact the Virtex-5 has lowered power consumption on Virtex-4 and up to 30% faster power. So it\u2019s a major advantage from that point of view. As far as the Virtex-5 LXD family which we just announced Monday. It is the first family with a low power transceiver, less than 100mW per channel and two hard cores of PCI Express hard core and an Ethernet hard core. People use these transceivers for all kind of things, but according to some forecaster up to 80% of transceivers will be used a future for these two applications, and so having these cores it has logic it means that we can -- people can implement it much easier. It\u2019s a pre-tested core and they also don\u2019t -- you don\u2019t have consumer program or logic to implement these cores. So it\u2019s a tremendous advantage for our customers. So these two families, the LX family and XP family are the first two families, there is two more families coming called SXT and FXD and they will be coming later in the year or early next year with different characteristics, but these are the main differences of this family. On Spartan-3 they are, of course, Spartan-3 is mainly designed to address the more higher volume markets, consumer electronics and the motives and so on though they are also widely use by our communication, traditional customers, because they are general purpose FPGAs, but with a lower cost structure. The lower cost structure is achieved by having lower cost packages, taking out some of the functionality over vertex in order to reduce buy size and in general by targeting low performance, performance is expensive from a buy size point of view, because your drivers have to be bigger and so on. So the key elements in this packing family are a very low-cost both on a cost per IO basis and also on cost per (inaudible) basis and I guess it is specially targeted for consumer tech markets, next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tim Kellis with Stanford Group.", "Tim Kellis - Stanford Group", "Yes, I just want to see maybe give us a little more color on the lead times, you mention there were four to six weeks quarter maybe was the end of the quarter and how you're still playing out in the December quarter, thank you.", "Wim Roelandts", "Yes, the lead times I mentioned four to six weeks that is currently done so its end of the quarter beginning of this quarter they are typically where we like to be, we like to be in the four to eight weeks. So typically you got the number correctly about 80% of our products are less than four weeks or less and the rest is in the four to eight weeks so this -- as far as I know no product that are beyond that. And the same by the way is true for our new vertex size family, we can deliver pretty much -- deliver customers are all the rate because of very, very good deals in the 65-nanometer process. We explain that to remain like this for the rest of the quarter, unless of course -- you know we see dramatic growth. But you know we have ample buy back inventory to satisfy our customers assuming that this -- we meet our forecast, even behind our forecast we should be able to meet that without an increase in our lead times. Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Edelstone with Morgan Stanley.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, this is actually John I\u2019m calling in for Mark Edelstone. I have a question for you. In regards to the turns target you gave this earlier about being in the high 50s. If I recall correctly at the beginning of last quarter you are in the mid-50s as the target I mean of course the quarter turns out to be very back end loaded. Kind of wondering if you are looking at the same type of a situation for this quarter?", "Wim Roelandts", "Yes, John, this quarter fortunately it\u2019s maybe little bit more on the opposite you know in another words we expect a very strong October and November and then of course the vacation starts you know the Thanksgiving vacation and then the Christmas vacation. So typically this is quite the opposite of last quarter although you know last year even December was very stronger with vacation and everything. So but our expectation is that we are very, very stronger October, November follow that maybe a little bit weaker. December certainly if you compare December with the month of September which is very strong in the last quarter. So that\u2019s basically how we see the season of the evolving.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you.", "Wim Roelandts", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Stanley with JP Morgan.", "Chris Stanley \u2013 JP Morgan", "Hi, thanks guys, I hope you will take a question and we follow up. You gave some guidance on gross margins and OpEx for this quarter, John, can you just talk about how we should expect that the trend going forward, and then I have a follow up?", "Jon Olson \u2013 CFO", "Sure Chris. Well, we are not going to give specific forecast going forward, our posture is tried -- try to control the growth of our Opex as much as possible so I am not going to forecast it, will be totally flat out in time but we are trying to demodulate it with one you know fairly significant difference and that\u2019s because we are launching Virtex-5 product families through out the next 12 month periods of completing out the current families as well as adding new families downstream and those drive incremental cost relative to market rollouts and those kind of things.", "So you know we undoubtedly we\u2019ll have some upward pressure because of those but other than that you know we would like to try keep things as clamp down as possible for a while and then also anything relative variable to higher revenue where we have higher incentives, commissions and bonus accruals etc those will tend to push this up as well so, that\u2019s our profile. We are trying to keep ourselves in an appetite that is a little more in the area of control of items and then growth at this point in time. Well, anyway I guess we have follow up after that, go ahead.", "Chris Stanley \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, that\u2019s SG&A should trend up less than sales and then at some point R&D will have a bump, it will be a one time occurrence?", "Jon Olson", "No, I don\u2019t know it will be a one time, we have a couple of quarters where it will be up a little bit because of those but they won\u2019t, you know I don\u2019t think its just like a one quarter giant pop at this point.", "Chris Stanley \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, thanks and then the follow up is on uses of cash, its growing a lot any thoughts to you know raising the dividend or increasing the buyback?", "Jon Olson", "Our cash is actually been held flat over the last several quarters with the exception of the cash that came in from the UMC sale and so yes, now the balance is up. We go through essentially an annual review with the board around our cash policy strategy. We\u2019ve raised our dividend in the spring time in the last couple of years, so from a calendarization perspective you know, it is about -- the winter time is about the time when we go through and discuss those kinds of things. I am not going to make any statements about exactly what or how and when we are going to do something but we do believe that we should be returning cash to the shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks and the factor that our cash balance is gone up because of this three events you know, we will take that into account.", "Chris Stanley \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, thanks guys.", "Wim Roelandts", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Danny Kuo with Bear Stearns.", "Danny Kuo - Bear Stearns", "Hey, guys good afternoon. It seems to me that this quarter you just had about $10 million up sight with an industrial -- an event, can you just talk about you know, the strength you\u2019re seeing their and whether it is 10% of revenues or aerospace and defense is (inaudible) \u201807.", "Wim Roelandts", "Yes Danny, we like last year you know, we typically expect an up thing during the December quarter for the defense industry because these people want to use up their budgets like they say and if like the same is true for some of other customers also and so but unfortunately it\u2019s a one time event so they fill in their budgets and the next quarter we have to make up the short falls because its only a one quarter event. So our expectation is that things we had similar to whatever last year. We closed about at -- I think for $7 to $10 million impact for one-time defense program spending, I would call it.", "Danny Kuo - Bear Stearns", "I\u2019m sorry, just a follow up on that. So we should kind of expect in the March quarter that would --?", "Wim Roelandts", "Yes, well the March quarters are typically our strongest quarter for the fiscal year. So you know but over the last couple of years with our strength in our defense business it has the season now because December is stronger and therefore it creates a little of very -- you know onetime sort of purchase so it increase a little bit of a slowdown in March, which tradition is a very strong quarter. So we expect to roll up unless there is an economic slowdown we expect to grow in the March quarter compared with December, the numbers much as we have seen historically because of the stronger taking defense. It all depends on how strong it is, you know, because obviously depends from one to another and we cannot predict how much it would will this quarter and how it will impact the March quarter.", "Danny Kuo - Bear Stearns", "Thanks.", "Wim Roelandts", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Edelstone with Morgan Stanley.", "Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley", "Hi Wim, just wanted to see if you could give a little additional color around your statement about Asia been the weakest point or the greatest risk for the coming quarter?", "Wim Roelandts", "Yes well Asia, of course, consist of two parts you know, that is the subcontract manufacturing business and in other words we shipped parts to Asia, first we do design in North America or another place in the world and that is going to be very dependent on how these businesses do, how these different industries especially North America will do. And secondly, there is the Asia spending itself, products design in Asia and produce in Asia and that -- the uncertainty really comes from the second part that is how will the Chinese government policies work with slowing down their -- spending on infrastructure. So this are kind of a do and certainties for Asia and that\u2019s why we are a little bit -- obviously we cannot predict what -- these or one of these two is doing well especially not the Chinese government. So that\u2019s why we are a little bit cautious as far as Asia is concern. On the other side, you know, is of course, continuously very strong of the year from an economic activity point of view and businesses generation point of view. So my expectations these are our search from the local generated business continue to grow.", "Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, thank you.", "Wim Roelandts", "Next question please.", "Operator", "There seems to be no further at this time.", "Wim Roelandts", "Very good.", "Maria Quillard", "Okay, well thank you all for joining us today.

(NASDAQ:XLNX)   Q4 2007 Earnings Call  April 25, 2007  5:00 PM ET", "Executives", "Marie Quillard - Public Relations ", " Wim Roelandts - CEO ", " Jon Olson - CFO ", "Analysts", "John Dryden - J.P.

Morgan ", " Lindsay Mathern - A.G. Edwards & Sons ", "Operator", "Good afternoon. My name is Kristin, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2007 Earnings Release Conference Call. ", "All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions). ", "Please limit your questions to one and refrain from multi-part questions to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone. After each participant has asked their question, their line will be muted and they will be placed back in the conference. If time permits, additional questions will be taken. ", "I would now like to turn the call over to Marie Quillard. Thank you. Ms. Quillard, you may begin your conference. ", "Marie Quillard", "Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today are Wim Roelandts, CEO, and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the March quarter then we'll open the call up for questions. I will then end the call with a few housekeeping questions. ", "As published in our press release, our business update for the first quarter of fiscal year. 2008 our guidance place in the reporting market closes on Thursday, June 7. After we update our guidance we will be in a quiet period until we report the following month. ", "Let me remind everyone, that during call today we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially. ", "We refer you to the documents the Company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections for forward-looking statements. This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations Web site. ", "Now let me turn the call over to Jon Olson. ", "Jon Olson", "Thank you, Maria. Revenues in fiscal Q4 decreased 2% from last quarter to $443.5 million, in line with the guidance provided during the March quarter business update. Gross margin of 62.1% was higher than our forecast of 61%, primarily due to improved yields on 90-nanometer and 65-nanometer technology. ", "Additionally, we benefited during the quarter from a product mix shift to higher margin products. We expect gross margin to continue to benefit from better than expected 65-nanometer yield, at this early stage in the production rollout. ", "Now let me turn to operating and net margin. Operating income was $79.4 million, down 3% from last quarter. Net income of $87.6 million, or $0.27 per diluted share was flat sequentially. ", "Both operating and net income included a $5.9 million charge related to an impairment of a leased building we no longer intend to occupy. Excluding this charge, operating expenses were up 0.5%, slightly better than we had forecasted. ", "Other income including interest expense was $22 million, slightly higher than expected due primarily to higher investment interest income. Free cash flow during the quarter was $43 million after $63 million in Cap Ex. ", "Capital expenditures were much higher than typical this quarter, primarily due to a spike in progress payments for the construction of our Singapore facility, and for land purchased in the San Jose area targeted for future expansion. We have no current plans to build on the property. ", "Next quarter we expect CapEx to be around $20 million due to the remaining impact of our Singapore facility. After the June quarter CapEx is expected to return to more normal levels of approximately 10 to $15 million per quarter. ", "We repurchased a total of 39 million shares during the quarter for $1.03 billion. 35 million of these shares were repurchased with the proceeds of the convertible note we issued. During fiscal 2007 we repurchased over 55 million shares of our common stock for $1.43 billion. We also raised our dividend twice during the fiscal year and are currently paying a dividend of $0.12 per share per quarter, a yield of approximately 2%. ", "The tax rate for the quarter was 13%. This rate was lower than expected primarily due to the refinement in methodology of stock option cost sharing charges and an increase in the R&D tax credit driven by higher qualified expenditures than previously estimated. ", "During the quarter we issued $1billion junior subordinated convertible note and used the proceeds in an accelerated share repurchase program, which was completed during the quarter. We chose to borrow the funds, to execute the buyback in order to more effectively manage our worldwide cash flow, while keeping the flexibility to continue the return, to return cash to shareholders in future periods. When comparing the economics of different debt instruments, a convertible represented the most attractive option. ", "The resulting impact to our financial statements is as follows. Our net cash position has decreased from $1.8 billion to $800 million. Our near-term objective is to keep our net cash balance in the $500 million to $1 billion range. ", "We used the proceeds of the convertible to repurchase 35 million shares in an accelerated buyback that occurred during the quarter. Interest and other will decline to about $15 million per quarter due to interest expense associated with the convertible. ", "The convertible has a net share settled featured, which means we will redeem the par value with cash and settle with shares for amounts exceeding the conversion premium. The terms of the convertible allow for a tax deduction greater than our coupon rate of 3.125%, which contributes to the cash flow positive nature of this instrument. In summary, the convertible is cash flow positive, accretive, and represents an inexpensive way to borrow money. ", "Let me now comment on the balance sheet. The cash balance increased $15 million during the quarter to $1.8 billion. Factoring in the $1 billion convertible, our net cash position is now approximately $800 million as previously stated. ", "Day sales outstanding increased seven days to 37 days, a reflection of our higher shipment profile at the end of the quarter. Combined inventory at Xilinx and distribution increased by two days to 120 days, with the increase coming from distributor inventory levels while our internal inventory levels remained. ", "I will now turn the call over to Wim to comment on our business and products. ", "Wim Roelandts", "Thank you, Jon, and let me first give my own comments on the March quarter. The March quarter as expected, was a challenging quarter for us with sales declining 2% in line with our guidance. ", "As you may remember, we started the quarter with a lower beginning backlog and the knowledge markets would be sort should be that our defense and wireless end markets would be. Indeed this are not up being the case. ", "Defense business, which was exceptionally strong in the September and December quarters, slowed substantially in the March quarter, due to a few large customer programs taking a breather as well as a normal seasonal decline. The wireless infrastructure market was also down, as expected due to an over inventory situation and telecom consolidations. ", "These issues, coupled with a weakness in Japan, made for an atypical March quarter. Except for the communications bubble busting in 2001, every March quarter has shown a sequential increase for Xilinx. ", "In spite of the revenue decline, we were pleased with several things this quarter, including an improved gross margin, a strong Virtex-5 revenue ramp, stabilization of our wire line business, higher turns bookings, and a positive starting backlog position. We also saw solid growth from our small account customers, which we view as a leading indicator of inventory levels coming into better balance. ", "Total booking for the quarter totaled 59%. January and February turns orders were as expected. March orders started out weak and ended strong. Another reason why the March quarter was so atypical was that our new products declined sequentially, which we believe to be a one-quarter phenomenon. ", "In the new products group, Virtex-5 and CoolRunner did very well with Spartan-3 and Virtex-4 both saw sequential decreases due to the weakness in wireless and defense, as we mentioned earlier, as well as some seasonal consumer weakness. ", "Our 65-nanometer Virtex-5 family revenues approached $5 million, and CoolRunner II grew approximately 30%, driven by portable consumer device strength. These products grew this quarter due in part to some last time buys before the scheduled price increase goes into effect for some of the older parts. ", "We don't expect these products to grow sequentially in the June quarter. Again, this should be a one-quarter phenomenon. ", "Total Virtex revenues declined 6% to 53% of overall revenues. Spartan revenues declined 2% to 25% of total revenues. CPLDs, however, grew double digits this quarter, and 10% of overall revenues, their highest percentage in the company's history. ", "From a geographic perspective, North America and Japan declined sequentially while Europe and Asia Pacific both grew quarter-to-quarter. Japan weakness was wireless and consumer related, but North America's softness was due primarily to the predicted fall off in defense revenues this quarter. ", "Europe grew as weakness in wireless was offset by strength in industrial and automotive. Asia Pacific saw good domestic growth as revenues from China were up sequentially after being down for the last couple of quarters. Transfer business also increased during the March ending period. ", "In terms of end markets, the revenue percentages didn't change much quarter-to-quarter. Communication dollars declined but the overall percentage stayed steady at 44%. ", "Wireless was again the culprit because wire telecom and networking grew sequentially. Our wireless revenues are now under 15% of company revenues. ", "The industrial and other category was impacted by a more than 20% decrease in our defense revenues, offset by a very good performance in industrial and in test and measurement applications. Consumer automotive was flat quarter-to-quarter as good growth in audio video broadcast and automotive was offset by seasonal softness in consumer applications. ", "Let me now say a few words about Xilinx performance in fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006. New products grew 102% while mainstream and base products both declined. Virtex grew 8%, Spartan grew 15%, and CPLDs grew 11%. ", "Revenues from all geographies except Japan increased from fiscal 2006. Europe was a top performer, growing 21%. Asia Pacific grew 15%, North America 2%, and Japan declined 13%. ", "End market trends showed that our diversification efforts are working. Only storage and wire communication declined year-to-year. All other end market segments grew and nearly all by double digits in fiscal year 2007, even wireless communications. ", "Industrial and other grew 22%. Consumer and other increased 18%. Communications was down 1% due to wire telecom weakness and data processing declined 10% year-over-year due to storage losses. ", "On the product front, we continue to execute on all fronts with our 65-nanometer Virtex-5 family rollout. We are currently shipping 12 devices across the LX, LXT, and SXT platforms. ", "By meeting our committed rollout schedules, we have established our customers to develop --sorry we have enabled our customers to develop up next-generation products well ahead of our competition. Early this month, our Virtex-5 family won both the Product and the Innovator of the Year Awards of the EDN Magazine's annual award competition. ", "On the Spartan side, we introduced Spartan-3A DSP, which provides high DSP performance at the lowest cost points in the FPGA industry. With the addition of the new Spartan DSP series, we provide DSP engineers with the flexibility to choose the right mix of features to match application requirements. Spartan DSP complements the high performance processing of our Virtex DSP series. ", "Let me now turn to the guidance for the quarter. The June quarter revenue guidance is for a plus 1 to plus 5% increase. After three quarters of modest sequential revenue declines, we expect to return to growth in the June quarter. ", "We are entering the quarter with a modest increase in our backlog position. The mid point of our guidance will require a turn\u2019s rate of slightly less than the 59% that we achieved in the March quarter. ", "From an end market point of view, we expect wireless and defense to show growth this quarter. We also expect all geographies except Japan to be up sequentially. ", "Now, let me turn the call back to Jon for some final remarks. ", "Jon Olson", "Thank you, Wim. ", "Gross margin is expected to be approximately 62%. Combined inventory days are expected to be approximately flat at 120 days. R&D spending will be approximately $92 million. ", "SG&A spending will be approximately $94 million. This is a reduction of 4% to 5% sequentially. The drop in expenses is driven by the absence of the lease impairment, overall expense controls, and lower share-based expenses. ", "Amortization expense will be approximately $2 million. Other income, including the impact of interest expense, is expected to be $15 million. ", "The share count is expected to be 302 million shares. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 21%. ", "Let me now open the lines for questions. Back to you, operator. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "The floor is now open for questions (Operator Instructions). And your first question comes from the line of John Dryden. ", "John Dryden - J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.", "Thanks, guys, for taking my question. First Wim, could you provide additional insight into the Com segment? Particularly, have you seen any visibility increase with the two large mergers, which seem to be off to a bad start, at least from an operating perspective? ", "Wim Roelandts", "Yes, John. First of all, like I kind of alluded to during the prepared remarks is that our wireline business increased, in fact, quarter-to-quarter. So I think that the mergers are stabilizing and that we see a slight growth and my expectation is that this growth will continue for the quarters to come. ", "The culprit this time was wireless, which continued to decline this quarter, but they're also expect the growth for the next quarter. So overall our communications sector, which is still 44% of the company's revenue is expected to grow next quarter. ", "Next question, please? ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung. Mr. Yeung, your line is open. I believe that question has been withdrawn. And your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely. ", "Chris Danely - J.P. Morgan", "Thanks, guys. So if I plug in the new numbers and we look at normal seasonal growth this year, it looks like your revenue should be up, you know, say around 10% by the end of fiscal '08, but to meet your R&D and SG&A goals you'll have to hold those both flattish or flat to slightly down. I'm just wondering what the confidence is in that? ", "Wim Roelandts", "Well, I don't know the fiscal year '08 growth seems too high to me because you know, if you look at the fiscal year '07, we had three negative quarters so we'll be starting a whole. ", "On the other part of your question, Chris, you're absolutely right. We have made a commitment to get our controlled expenses down by 5% by Q4. So Q4 FY '08 will be down 5% compared with Q4 FY '07 and that should help rebuild our margin levels during the year. Coupled with some growth we should be in target in our corporate model by the end of the fiscal year or may be earlier. ", "Jon Olson", "Yes, Chris, this is Jon. The real target here is in getting back to our corporate model which restated on a GAAP basis is a minimum of 24% operating margin and that's really what we're shooting for. And we're controlling expenses and obviously assume some revenue pickup next year. But we are definitely in the mode of controlling expenses to get our numbers there the second half of the year. ", "Wim Roelandts", "Next question, please? ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Parag Agrawal. ", "Parag Agrawal - Jefferies & Co.", "Hi, this is Parag for John Lau. ", "Coming back to your communications segment. Just wanted to get your comments on your design win activity in the enterprise networking and do you think that enterprise networking growth could make for a slowdown in wireless networking going forward? ", "Wim Roelandts", "Yes, well, two things. First of all, clearly, there's a lot of design activity in the wireless space than the communications space due to the, what people have called triple play. So there is a lot of people especially in metropolitan area networks developing new routers that can do, run up to 20 gig, 40 gig or even 100 gig Ethernet instead of 10 gig today. ", "There is new activities in the areas of video servers and video delivery systems. So there is a lot of activity going on in the design space, and of course with our strength in our V-5 product family, we believe we will get the vast majority of these design and so we are winning the vast majority of these designs. Also, V-5 most of our products now have built-in transceivers, which exactly what is needed for that kind of an application. ", "On the other side, like I mentioned, we believe that the wireless business will start growing again starting next, I mean this quarter, the June quarter, and going forward. I think that we were in a situation of a pause that happened in the deployment of 3G, but the 3G deployment is still far from finished so I think there is going to be more coming. ", "So I'm very optimistic for both wireline and wireless segments of our market. And Japan was weak, for instance, because DoCoMo delayed infrastructure buildouts for their 3G their networks, but all that intelligence shows that this is coming within the next quarter, the quarter after this quarter, next quarter. ", "Next question, please? ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Han Lee. ", "Han Lee - Global Crown Capital", "Hi, this is Han Li for David Wu. I have a quick question about your operating expense. ", "Your competitors talk about lowering their SG&A expense to the mid teens so I just want to ask your opinion on, is that achievable? And if you are going to do that, what kind of restructuring would you need to -- what things do you need to achieve those kind of targets? ", "Wim Roelandts", "Yes. Well, Han, I can tell you that our corporate model is for SG&A expenses to be in the 15 to 16% range. So we're talking about, sorry, and that is before stock option expensing of one of the old model. So we're talking roughly about the same order of magnitude. ", "Maybe Jon, do you have any? ", "Jon Olson", "Yes. I'm not going to respond to what they're doing relative to their model versus ours. I mean, I think we certainly have a strategy as an innovator, which means our R&D spending and SG&A might have a different profile than others. ", "And so, you know, we've modeled our SG&A out in time to be in the mid to high teens and our R&D to be in the high teens. And, you know, if I recall what Altera has said and they're talking about out in time it, as well. I don't think that's something they're doing this year. This is '08 and beyond. ", "So I'm not particularly focused on that particular long-term model. I'm really focused on doing what it takes to keep the treadmill going here in terms of innovation and get to our 24% operating margin target this year. ", "Wim Roelandts", "Next question, please? ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Kellis. ", "Tim Kellis - Stanford Financial Group", "Yes, I was wondering if you were in the position to discuss any developments on 65-nanometer on the Spartan product line? ", "Wim Roelandts", "Yes, of course. Most of our engineers -- all of our engineers at Spartan are working on that but we're not really ready to make announcements at this time. ", "Wim Roelandts", "Next question, please? ", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of Steve Eliscu. ", "Steve Eliscu - UBS", "Yes, this is Steve Eliscu for Uche Orji. I wanted to get a better understanding with regards to 3G in China, and how much of what you're seeing in terms of China build outs and how well you're positioned and also how much you think in terms of your about 3G business is coming from China. Thank you. ", "Wim Roelandts", "Yes, Steve. Well, first of all, we don't have exact dates on how much of our 3G business is coming out of China. We don't have the details or at least I don't have not seen the details on that level. ", "But clearly, China has been one of these regions that have kind of delayed their 3G deployment. And the reason is that the Chinese government is developing their own standard called TDMA, which is a Chinese proprietary stunt for 3G if I can say so. ", "And so what happens is the government is delaying in allocating the 3Gs licenses because they're waiting until CDMA's mature enough so it can compete against the wideband CDMA from Europe and CDMA2000 from the U.S. So that's part of the whole thing. ", "Now my understanding is that the first contract for TD-CDMA of about $5 billion have been allocated. So I think that the TD-CDMA is now in a strong enough position to really start -- for the Chinese government to give out the licenses and then let people decide if they want to use TD-CDMA or they want to use wideband CDMA or UMTS or so on. ", "So that's part of the reasons why I think the wireless sector has been a little bit slow in the last couple of quarters. So again, I think these things make us believe that the next couple of quarters will be stronger. ", "As far as our positions are concerned, we are very well positioned in all of the three markets really. You know, because of our strength in the DSP processing, which I think there, is no doubt that, we are the absolute leader in pure performance and in cost per whatever. We win a lot of the designs in all of the three different technologies. ", "Both wideband CDMA or UMTS like it's called in Europe, CDMA 2000 or the TD-DMA in China. So for us, it's really kind of to some degree not really important which one wins or which one is used because we are very, very well represented in all three technologies. ", "The only thing that because it of the delayed of course, all of that suffered. That's the problem. Now suddenly the government starts giving out licenses, we will win -- whoever technology they decide to choose. ", "Next question, please? ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ruben Roy. ", "Ruben Roy - Pacific Crest Securities", "Thank you. Wim you talked about Virtex-5 winning the vast majority of designs available, I was wondering if you could talk about the types of designs you're seeing traction for that product family and also in terms of end market, as well if you could. ", "Also you mentioned $5 million, I think Virtex-5 has been shipping for almost a year now. Can you compare and contrast how that $5 million number compares to the Virtex will rollout? Thank you. ", "Wim Roelandts", "Yes, Ruben. I mean, Virtex-5 is really the family that that is designed for infrastructure type of application. So we are widely used in anything to do with the communications. Heavily used in defense. Our design didn't obviously -- most people are not yet in volume production. ", "The -- another year that we are doing very well in is the audio video broadcast. The test of measurement, medical, electronics, so it really is a line, which represents over 50% of our revenues as a company. So it's pretty much for consumer, automotive, it's pretty much used across the board. ", "The -- as far the revenue is concerned, we think we are more or less on track. This is the third quarter that we are shipping Virtex-5. And if we look back at the previous history, I would say that we're probably a little bit ahead of where we were with Virtex-4. ", "But also the design momentum is really picking up. Dramatically -- especially in this quarter we saw a tremendous uptick. And I must say that since the introduction of the Virtex-5 LXT family, that has been extremely successful and that created a much strong momentum. ", "You remember we introduced Virtex-5 LX family in May and Virtex-5 LXT in October. So I think and we started shipping also, another factor is that we have now started shipping the largest parts the LX 330, which is like the largest FPGA by far in the industry. ", "And 330,000 logic cells we have also version with transceivers that is shipping. But that is not used in volume products. It is mainly used for prototyping and things like that and that is a very good business for us because of these large devices that we are able to ship. ", "By the way, the fact that we are able to ship these large devices, which are about 450 square millimeter size, also indicate that the technology is in extremely good shape because if you have a bad defect rate of course, you have no yield to these very, very large devices. So overall I am very pleased, and I think that Virtex-5 is ahead of Virtex-4 and will stay ahead from over the quarters to come. Next question please. ", "Operator", "You have a follow-up question from the line of John Dryden. ", "John Dreyden", "Yes again for Wim. Could you go over maybe during the nine-month downturn? Did you see any customer specific examples or product developments where they shipped it away from ASICs to FBGA's to take advantage of the downturn and enhance their design cycle time? ", "Wim Roelandts", "Well, John, that's a good question. Although this trend is really been an ongoing trend for the last several years, especially since 90-nanometer and I think it will accelerate as 65-nanometer. If you look at the cost in ASIC there are fewer and fewer applications that can do that. ", "So if you really look at where you know a couple of years ago or five years ago the bulk of design were really ASICs. And you know the programs were used mainly largely. ", "I think what has happened now is that ASICs have become a niche for very high density, very high volume, very low cost applications. And I am talking here about this advanced technology. Those people who do ASICs in 250-nanometer of course I am not talking about these. I am talking about people doing ASICs in 90-nanometer or 65-nanometer or planning to do 65. ", "And so what has been replacing them on one side in the lower volume markets is FBGA's and in the higher volume markets it is ASSPs and on the other side lets not forget that an ASICs is for five customers. So whatever happened with the ASIC market overtime will happen with the ASSP market. That means that you need higher and higher investment in the ASSP\u2019s and these advanced technologies. ", "And that is going to limit them to fewer and fewer applications over time. So the trend that we talked about in the infrastructure markets, you know you talk about communication infrastructure, you talk about computing infrastructure, you talk about areas like military, the audio video broadcasting. ", "You talk about areas like the Test and Measurement and so on. I think that the transition by and large has moved to FPGAs. As long as the FPGA can do the job there from speed performance point of view. While in the higher volume markets or in markets where customer\u2019s notable customers do the same thing. The ASSPs have taken over, but again, with the technology going forward, I think that that will also move in favor of FPGAs over time. ", "Next question, please? ", "Operator", "You have a follow-up question from the line of Parag Agrawal. ", "Parag Agrawal - Jefferies & Co.", "Earlier last quarter you had talked about second half of the year being strong. Just wondering if as we go forward into the year, like you have changed in the sense that you expect better spends than your original view, or your real spend to the same. ", "Wim Roelandts", "Yes, well I think that our forecast for the coming quarter is the first indication that we see a better business climate. And my belief is really not changed very much. I think that the second half of the year will be stronger. It is stronger for a couple of reasons. I think that the wireless side, which has been the primary reason for the weakness -- one of the reasons for the weakness will get better. ", "The wireline business is hurt by all the mergers going on and these will get behind us and I think also that we'll see more and more shipments related to the triple play coming on board when the year goes on. And then from a Xilinx\u2019s specific point of view, I think that our Virtex-5 momentum, some of the newer Spartan three products that we have introduced, all of that will create momentum going forward that I think we can take advantage of. ", "So my view has not changed. If anything, I am even more confirmed that this is going to happen over the next fiscal year, yes. Next question, please? ", "Operator", "You have a follow-up question from the line of Han Lee. ", "Han Lee - Global Crown Capital", "Hi, thank you for taking my question again. Last quarter you talked about your OpEx had increased by 1% sequentially. And by now I'm seeing a, you know, about $5.5 million increase in your SG&A. Could you please comment on that? ", "Jon Olson", "Yes. Han, the biggest single item that was in our OpEx was the impairment of a lease property, a lease building that we entered into an arrangement in previous period that we have now decided not to inhabit with employees as we are kind of cutting back our expenses and holding the line on headcount and things like that. So we don't need the added facility. ", "And while that's spread across both R&D and G&A and SG&A primarily a little bit into the cost of sales, you're seeing a reflection of that in there. Also there was a charge in the previous quarter that was in -- a benefit in the previous quarter in SG&A that didn't repeat itself. ", "So that artificially made SG&A lower the quarter before last. Those two things together are driving that increase. ", "Wim Roelandts", "But on a controlled expense basis, in fact our expenses were below what we said so\u2026 ", "Jon Olson", "Right, if you take out the one-time charge. Yes, that's correct. ", "Wim Roelandts", "If you take out the one-time charges in fact that we beat the forecast that we had given. Next question, please? ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Danny Kuo. ", "Danny Kuo - Bear Stearns & Co.", "Hey, Jon, I just want to figure out the gross margin upside this quarter how much of that came from the yield improvement and how much of that came from your mix shift? And if you can also comment on the yield improvement on 90-nanometer, how far do we have to go on that? ", "Jon Olson", "Sure, Danny. The split actually was pretty equally distributed. Maybe a little bit more towards the mix shift. But, you know, in the neighborhood of 50-50, 60-40 kind of a number. ", "So, you know, the mix shift was really driven by the fact that our base products were up in the neighborhood of 6%, and those are the older products, and they typically have, you know, very high margins, and etcetera. ", "And that was a, kind of a cyclical thing for us in combination with our price increase, which was mostly in the base, or in all in the base products area. So that's really what caused the uplift there. ", "On the yield basis, we still have an improvement to go on 90-nanometer relative to the product cost, products margin of our 90-nanometer products. I would say we're in the neighborhood of 75 to 80% of the way to where we are going. ", "But we also have an effort to improve our product cost as part of our overall cost control, cost improvement program this year. And so we're not giving up on where we are, being satisfied with history. We're trying to push ourselves beyond where we've been in the past. ", "And you know, the foundries have been full enough that have allowed essentially good through-put through the factories which then help us get to a lower cost as our yield engineers are working with their yield engineers to try to figure out how to make things happen. ", "So, a long way to go on 65-nanometer. Although, we're really pleased, and 90-nanometer, we're probably three-quarters of the way to where we need to get to. ", "Wim Roelandts", "Next question, please? ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Aalok Shah. ", "Aalok Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Hi, Wim. I know you spoke a little bit new products being down and that being a component of how the wireless business was weak in the quarter but I'm wondering if that actually had any margin impact to you guys and over the next quarter if you expect new product revenue to actually sequentially the increase? ", "Wim Roelandts", "Yes, Aalok. First of all, like I said, the weakness was due to the fact that both defense and the wireless declined and both of them were, I mean in these cases, it were V-4 customers. So our expectation is that V-4 will grow again this quarter. ", "In fact, all our forecasts indicate that and that overall the category of new products will grow this quarter without too much problem. So it's really a one-quarter effect that we had due to the specific weakness by a few customers. ", "Next question, please? ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung. ", "Peter Trigarszky - Citigroup", "This is Peter for Glen. I wanted to ask for next quarter with wireless defense coming back and margins staying flat, is there a potential, I mean, can you give me some sense of what would be the offset to a gross margin uplift from those two product categories coming back? ", "Wim Roelandts", "Yes, Peter. I'm sorry, I was asked the same question, I forgot to answer that part. ", "You know, our forecast is for the next quarter to be around 62%, so pretty similar to what we are today, I mean we announced 62.1%. So we expect to be the same and so clearly we don't expect the all the products, the base products to increase next quarter. But on the other side, the yield improvement we expect that to continue. And so one will also the other loss to some degree, and that is our current one. ", "Also, like Jon mentioned we are continuous working on cost improvements. So there is lot of factor that play in the gross margin picture that makes us reasonably confident that we will stay around 62% for the coming quarter. ", "Next question, please? ", "Operator", "You have a follow-up question from the line of Steve Eliscu. ", "Steve Eliscu - UBS", "Yes, thank you. In terms of trying to calibrate Virtex by growth, and looking back in history at Virtex-4, seems like Virtex-4 had a nice initial ramp. You got to about 5% of revenue really quickly in just a few quarters, then it kind of flattened there. Do, you think Virtex-5 is going to be a bit stronger in terms of its ramp? And what gives you confidence if that's the case? Thank you. ", "Wim Roelandts", "Well, we believe that indeed Virtex-5 will be stronger than Virtex-4. The problem is the slowdown, as you mentioned. But it also is that I believe we are going much ahead of our competition with the Virtex-5 compared with Virtex-4. Virtex-4 and our competitors announced roughly, I think in fact if I remember it correctly that our competition announced a month before Virtex-4 was announced. In this case we are anywhere between 15 and 18 months ahead of our competition. In fact today we are in volume production with Virtex-5 and our competition has not yet shipped their high-end product families. So and that is a really big difference so already our first, especially in the high-end markets, where technology and density and performance matter. ", "The other thing is that in Virtex-5, we need some architectural innovations with 16 foot lot a logic cell instead of a 14 foot lot and also a the three-dimensional routing system we put in place, it really gives us a significant higher performance bullet compared with Virtex-5, but also compared to the competition. So we believe that that both of these factors being ahead with the technology and having higher performance, I think it will allow us to grow to for a Virtex-5 to ramp up much faster than you had seen with Virtex-4 and also to sustain over time. ", "Next question, please? ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Luke. ", "Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you very much. ", "Just within the call arena having seen the dislocation associated with the combinations of some of the major vendors Nokia, Siemens and Alcatel Lucent. Do you feel often that you're in a period where you're largely through the effects of that, and you may now see the more balanced environment in the second half of base wireline and wireless? ", "And separately maybe fit you on, can you just talk about the potential for incremental cost reduction, are these being moved through the second half this year and into the following fiscal year? ", "Wim Roelandts", "Okay. Let me first answer the consolidation question, then you know, I think we are somewhere in the middle, I would say. You know, I don't think we are through it yet because for a very simple reason. We had three major consolidations one happened a year ago that was the Ericsson and Microni and they are pretty much behind us, I think that is pretty much finished by now. ", "Lucent, Alcatel happened in December of last year. And I think that they have made their first quarter like, you know, was not very successful part of it is because of this merger I think they are working very hard in business, still some work to do. ", "And of course the Siemens Nokia merger is just hoping or will happened, I think it just happened last Monday or last week or something like that. So clearly there are different stages that these companies are in. For us, of course, it depends for which company you're talking about. ", "So no, I think that we still have a couple of quarters to go before that is behind us. But clearly, it will be positive from now on. I think we have crossed the low point in this merger. And I think that things will start continuing to improve over the quarters to come. ", "And by the second half of our fiscal year, things will pretty much be back to normal, which means the December and March quarters. ", "Jon would you? ", "Jon Olson", "Yeah, let me answer the second question. ", "Tim, yes, I would characterize our OpEx spending reductions that we talked about at our analysts meeting as on track to what we said. And while, I mean, we're showing a reasonable decline in the first quarter. There are a lot of other things going on in the middle of the year that we\u2019re going to be working against us that we have to work through and offset with other kinds of things. ", "So our annual salary activity is in the September quarter. So beginning of the September quarter is when we do that. There's also some other tape out and other kinds of factors that kick in that particular quarter. ", "So while I'm encouraged by what I see right now in our forecast for the near-term quarter, we still have a lot of teamwork do to make sure that we achieve what we say we're going to achieve. In the area of product cost reduction, we real didn't talk about it that much at the analysts' meeting. ", "And we're starting to put a lot more pressure on that and model that, and try to see, if we can get some of our operating margin and earning growth coming from improved gross margin out in time. And again, we're digging it pretty heavily on that stuff now. So more to come is about all I can say on that. ", "Wim Roelandts", "Next question please. ", "Operator", "You have a follow-up question from the line of Chris Danely. ", "Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan", "Thanks, guys. ", "As you build up the cash again, how do you think about increasing the dividend versus more buybacks, and is there any reason you wouldn't take the yield to, say, 3% or above from like what if you competitors has? ", "Jon Olson", "So Chris, the, you know, the current plan again is to keep these balance even though we did this one time, I will say one large, one time, but one large buyback, and then kind of just the dividend yield up a little bit, as well. And our thinking really is kind of walk through the next year or so and see how the top-line growth and our cash accumulates before we make any further decisions on that. ", "You know, it's easy to say, is there any reason that wouldn't cause us to go 3%, well, yeah, we have to carefully consider what our needs are and discuss it with the Board. We are definitely committed to keeping our net cash balance at the levels we've talked about, between $500 million and a$1 billion at this point in time. ", "And it's kind of premature to say that we're going to forecast dividends to rise faster than buyback. We want to do them, you know, in a balanced fashion and probably move them both. We're committed to doing both, maybe not as committed as you want us to be in the dividend side, but definitely we're committed to both. ", "Wim Roelandts", "Next question, please? ", "Operator", "You have a follow-up question from the line of Han Li. ", "Han Lee - Global Crown Capital", "Hi. Thank you for taking my question again. ", "So, could you please comment a little bit on the yield for your 65-nanometer products? How is it compared to your 90-nanometer at the same point of the lifetime, and how does it compare to, say, the yield of 65-nanometer at TSMC? ", "Jon Olson", "Jon, let me take that one. So, 65 compared to 90. Right now we're in a significantly improved position doing 65 and 90. And the real reason for that is the stability of our fab partners in addition to the stability of the tools and the process. ", "So, let me explain that a little bit more. So in our case we are producing 65-nanometer product in the same physical factories that we have 90-nanometer. And that's a big advantage to us because it's the same people, same kind of technology and tools, et cetera and that\u2019s given us an advantage over some of the previous experiences we've had in transitioning from process-to-process. ", "The second point is that the number of differences in tools, involving the process and producing the device is significantly smaller. I mean, the change is less than it has been during a specific process. So, essentially mostly the same material, same tools. You know, pretty much the same, you know, physics involved in this, and it's allowed us to get improved yields at a more rapid time. ", "Relative to comparing to TSMC, we don't have any specific information that we can offer that right now. This is from a public perspective, I'm unaware of direct comparisons between the two that would be valuable because they are, you know, everybody runs their fabs a little different and their processes are also and technologies are a little different, as well. ", "Wim Roelandts", "This is Wim. One another thing that I can add, if you look at 65-nanometer technology, there are really -- we're talking about two technologies. We're talking about what some people have called 65-nanometer low power and 65-nanometer high performance. ", "Our technology is 65-nanometer high-performance technology, which is more complex to manufacture. So the fact that we have better yields than what we've seen on 90-nanometer, and in fact if you look at our learning curves, we are ahead of every single technology node that we did with 65-nanometer. ", "It's not because, I mean, it's a very advanced technology and the low power technology is a lot simpler. It doesn't use straining or mobility enhancement techniques as they're called. ", "And I think that some foundries focus first on low power because they have large cell phone customers. Some foundries focus first on the high performance. You know, our UMC and Toshiba both have the high performance technology, and like Jon said, we are doing very well in that area. ", "Next question, please. ", "Operator", "You have a follow-up question from the line of Mr. Tim Luke. ", "Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you. I just had a question on networking. I'm not sure if you touched on this earlier, but your principal competitor was talking about that being somewhat softer because of the move to lean manufacturing while the others areas of com were up in terms of the coming quarter. I was wondering if you had any color on that? ", "Wim Roelandts", "Yes. I mean you know, the company that we're talking about, we have been working with them over the years. We are the largest supplier in programmable logic to that company. So a lot of their plans that they're talking about, that our competition talks about, we have been working with them on establishing them. ", "You know, the relationship between Xilinx and our customers is more than just a supplier of parts. We also look at improving their inventory situation, their supply chain, being able to react if they have upsides or downsides. So all of these things are part of the engagement we have with our larger customers. ", "So we are, you know, we don't expect any big changes as far as our customer is concerned really because we have been evolving with them over the years to come. Because we are a major supplier to them and a very strategic partner. ", "Last question, please? ", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Lindsay Mathern. ", "Lindsay Mathern - A.G. Edwards & Sons", "Yes, I'm here for David Wong. ", "I might have missed this but you talked about capital spending, was that considerably due to the impact of Singapore facility. And then you talked about it sort of coming down to, you know, more $20 million next quarter, and a little bit lower the rest of the year. ", "Is that something that we would expect to see? I mean are there any other things that could impact it that we ought to be aware of that could cause it to be higher than expected? Could you give me a little color on that? I appreciate it. ", "Jon Olson", "Yes, I don't, Lindsay, I don't foresee anything right now that could have significant impact on that. I mean most of our Cap Ex since we're so heavily outsourced is on a steady state basis, are a combination of engineering equipment, IT equipment, and then on the manufacturing side testers and test equipment. ", "And we buy testers at a pretty steady rate as our revenue or technologies move forward, either one of those. And I don't anticipate anything to be abnormal after we get through completing the facility in Singapore that we have on the horizon. ", "Lindsay Mathern - A.G. Edwards & Sons", "Okay. ", "Jon Olson", "Operator, back to you. ", "Marie Quillard", "Okay. Thank you for joining us today. We'll have a playback thereof call beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific time, 8:00 p.m. Eastern.

Thank you Ms. Quillard, you may begin your conference.", "Maria Quillard", "Thank you, and good afternoon.With me today are Wim Roelandts, CEO, and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide afinancial and business review of the September quarter, then we'll open thecall for questions. I will end the call with a few housekeeping items.", "As published in our pressrelease, our business update for the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 willtake place in the form of a press release, after the market closes onWednesday, December 5th. After we update our guidance, we will be in a quietperiod until we report the following month.", "Let me remind everyone, thatduring our conference call today, we may make projections or otherforward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financialperformance of the company.

This conference call is open to all and is beingwebcasted live. It can be accessed from our Investor Relations website,www.xilinx.com.", "Now let me turn the call over toJon Olson.", "Jon Olson", "Thank you, Maria. Revenues infiscal Q2 were $455 million flat sequentially from the prior quarter. Grossmargin at 61.8% was slightly below our guidance and included two one-time itemsrelated to our warranty obligation and an impairment charge both whichaccounted for approximately 1.5 point of gross margin.", "Additionally, unforecasted strengthfrom a high volume consumer customer for our CPLD products impacted margins byapproximately 20 basis points. Operating income was $94.4 million, or 21.2%above what we expected, as lower gross margin was offset by better thanexpected expense control.", "Operating expenses were roughlyflat, sequentially better than our guidance of 2% growth. This was a result ofcontinued overall expense control as well as lower than anticipated stock-basedcompensation expenses.", "We remain focused on achieving anoperating margin of 24% by fiscal year-end, and to that extent we are pleasedwith our continued progress and controlling expenses. Net income increased 6%sequentially to $89.7 million resulting in a profit margin of 20.2% up from18.9% last quarter, and the highest we've reported in six quarters.", "Other income including interestexpense was $19 million. This was $3 million more than we had guided due to ahigher than expected interest income and foreign currency hedging gainsrealized during the quarter. Free cash flow during the quarter was a $134million after $30 million in CapEx, and we paid a dividend of $0.12 per shareduring the quarter.", "We repurchased 6 million sharesfor $150 million and paid $36 million in dividends. The tax rate for thequarter was 21%, in line with the guidance we provided.", "Let me now comment on the balancesheet. Cash balance decreased $23 million during the quarter to $1.9 billion.Factoring in the $1 billion convertible, our net cash position is nowapproximately $900 million.", "Day sales outstanding increasedfive days to 48 days. This is slightly higher than our corporate target of 45days, primarily due to an increased shipment profile in the month of September.We expect this figure to decrease in the December quarter.", "Combined inventory at Xilinx anddistribution decreased by nine days to 92 days, with 69 days of Xilinx and 23days at distribution. This is the lowest we had anticipated. In fact, this is lowerthan we had anticipated entering the quarter, and our combined inventories daysare now the lowest in nearly four years.", "Several factors contributed tothe decrease, including improved forecasting accuracy, stable through-put timefrom the supply-chain and pure mix issues. We are establishing a new targetgoing forward of 90 to 100 days of combined inventory.", "In December, we expect to remainwithin this 90 to 100-day range. I will now turn the call over to Wim tocomment on our business and products.", "Wim Roelandts", "Thank you, Jon and let me firstcomment on the September quarter. The September quarter was a typical seasonalsummer quarter with sales from North America and Europe declining slightly, whileJapanand Asia-Pacific revenues grew sequentially.", "Total bookings for the quartertotaled 59%. July started out positive. August orders were slightly better thanexpected, but September term's orders were a little short of expectations. Onthe other hand, during the month of September, we built a strong beginningbacklog. Our beginning backlog provision has not been this healthy since thesame period two years ago.", "Our large OEM customers again didvery well this past quarter. Our top 10 customers' total revenue across eachgeography were up from the prior quarter. This was not the case last quarter orall of last fiscal year. These large OEM customers are not just communications-drivencompanies, but they are well-diversified across all our various end markets.", "On the new product front. Our newproduct category grew 6% sequentially, and now that represents 30% of totalrevenues, up from 22% in the prior year quarter. Group revenue growth for thequarter came from Virtex-5, Spartan-3 and CoolRunner-II. Virtex-4 was virtuallyflat after growing over 20% in the June-ending quarter.", "Mainstream products declined 1%,while base products declined 10%, which is more of a typical pattern that wewould expect to see going forward. Total Virtex revenues were flat at 64% of totalrevenues. Spartan revenues increased 1% to 26% of total revenues, and the CPLDsgrew the most, climbing 8% to reach 10% of total revenues.", "From a geographic perspective, AsiaPacific was again the strongest region growing 3% quarter-to-quarter, andreaching a record 30% of total sales. This quarter we saw strength coming frommultinational companies employing contract manufacturing in Asia, as well as organicgrowth within Asia.", "In terms of end markets,communications was up 1% sequentially, due to unforecasted strength in Wired lines,especially in North America, where bothenterprise networking and Wired telecom grew. Wireless, as expected, was downsequentially; although wireless revenues in Japan grew double-digits for thefirst time in nearly two years.", "The consumer and automotive endmarket was standard, growing 8% quarter-to-quarter, to a record 17% of sales.Our digital consumer and audio, video broadcast, and video and broadcastsegments, both showed good strength across geographies. Industrial and othercategory declined 5% which surprised us. A rebound in industrial, scientificand medical wasn't enough to offset softness in tested measurement and defense inthis quarter. The decline in our defense business was attributable to a coupleof large customers that had robust orders in the June ended quarter.", "These customers are expected toresume ordering again this December quarter, and have already placed a backlogon us. Like the past two December periods, we are expecting good growth fromdefense.", "Lastly, the data processingsector was flattish as we had forecasted. ", "Now I would like to change thetopic to address the issue of market share for a moment. Our cumulative salesof 65 and 90 nanometer accounted for nearly 70% of overall industry revenues ofBODs.", "The products manufactured onthese [notes] are our newest product families. We are also seeing record levelsof design win activities for these 90 nanometer and 65 nanometer products. Itis a clear result of our ongoing effort to further drive down the cost of ourdevices through advanced process technologies. Our clear sales in design andleadership indicates with these products bode us well for the future marketshare gains.", "Our internal design win metricsshow that Virtex-5 products are winning the vast majority of the high-endsocket designs to-date, while our nearest competitor has only one devicecurrently shipping on 65-nanometer at the high-end. We estimate that Virtex-5has more than a year lead over any competing 65-nanometer products. Let's notforget the high-end [Virtex-5] devices, which represent about two-thirds of thetotal FPGA market.", "Let me now turn to the guidancefor the quarter. The December quarter revenues guidance is for sales to be up2% to 6% sequentially. We are expecting all geographies to be up sequentiallywith the possible exception of Asia Pacific, which is forecasted to beflattish. From an end-market perspective, we are expecting consumer andautomotive to increase, given some specific Digital TV design wins that we willbe ramping into volume production, starting in the December quarter.", "Industrial other is expected tobe up, driven by defense. Communications is the most challenging end-market toforecast. We believe it will be flattish and are most cautious about thewireless infrastructure piece. Data processing is also expected to be flattish.", "From a product point of view, weare expecting Virtex-4 to experience solid growth in the December quarter,Virtex-5 to approximately double, and the Spartan-3 family of products to havea very good quarter, given the production ramp of a few key programs. The newproduct category should be very healthy for this quarter and next.", "So, let me now turn it back toJon for some final remarks.", "Jon Olson", "Thank you, Wim. Gross margin isexpected to be approximately 62% to 63%. Combined operating expenses areexpected to be flat. Amortization expense will be approximately $2 million.Other income, including the impact of interest expense is expected to be $12million. This level of other income and expense is a more typical run rate, asit reflects both lower investment market rates and a modest impact from foreignexchange rate contract. Share count is expected to be approximately 297 millionshares. And the tax rate is expected to be 21%. Let me now open the line forquestions. Operator, back to you.", "Maria Quillard", "Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Yes Ma'am. I do apologize. Justone moment. The floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions). Yourfirst question comes from Seogju Lee.", "Jim Snyder - Goldman Sachs", "Hi, thanks. This is [Jim Snyder]for Seogju Lee. Thanks for taking the question. If you guys look into the restof the fiscal year, what's your expectation about the magnitude of R&D andSG&A reductions we will be able to get, exiting fiscal year, andspecifically do you see any upside to your target coming out of the fiscalyear?", "Jon Olson", "So Jim we haven't made any futureforecast into next fiscal year yet. I don't think we are really prepared tomake a statement on that. I mean, we are committed to sustain our business, adda minimum in the 24% to 26% operating margin region. So obviously, we have tospend some time looking at what we think the forward growth rates are for usnext year. And then pay a little attention to what we can do in terms of whatthat means for spending. So, at this point in time, I don't think I am ready tomake a comment on that.", "Jim Snyder", "Okay. I was just wondering ifthere is any upside for this fiscal year, exiting?", "Jon Olson", "So, exiting this fiscal year orwithin this fiscal year?", "Jim Snyder", "Within this fiscal year.", "Jon Olson", "Well, I mean, I think a lot ofthat is determined by how much growth we are going to get here in the last twoquarters of the fiscal year. Our 2% to 6% guidance, we feel pretty good aboutbased on our backlog. Things would continue to stay strong throughout thequarter than that might yield, certainly more upside and therefore morestrength.", "We have also been focusing ongross margins, cost of sales items quite a bit and so we are hopeful that wecan continue to deliver solid results and see if there is anything we can doabout making that a little bit stronger, as we go throughout the year but a lotof it is dependent on the overall business environment and I would play thatout.", "Jim Snyder", "Perfect, thanks very much.", "Wim Roelandts", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from TimLuke.", "Kate Fehrenbacher - Lehman Brothers", "Hi this is Kate for Tim. I justhad two quick questions first on the data processing segment, I was justwondering what kind of opportunities do you see there going forward it's beenkind of down and flattish for a while now?", "Wim Roelandts", "Yes, well, indeed the dataprocess even -- this is more than flattish it has being declining over the lastperiod and it really consists of two components one is the storage component,which is more and more based on ASICs or ASSP designs across the industry. So,there is, that used to be a very big segment for us, but I think that wholesegment has been moved away from program for logic. The other part of course iscomputing and there, we see some potential going forward so our devices aremore and more used in especially in the high-end servers and probably slideback. So, overall with the whole storage share area being smaller and smaller,I think, we will see some growth that is more commensurate with the rest of thecompany growth, and we don't expect much further decline anymore. Your secondquestion?", "Kate Fehrenbacher - Lehman Brothers", "Yeah, I had one more quickfollow-up on the comp business in general, I know, you said that wireless, youare the most cautious on the wireless side of things, I was wondering, if youcould give anymore color on maybe in the data process -- the enterprisenetworking versus the kind of Wired line business versus wireless is there anydifference?", "Wim Roelandts", "Well, like we saw, this quarterwas that indeed the Wired line business grew, which was a little bit surprisingon one side, because we had not planned for it. But on the other side, there isclearly reinvestment starting in the whole infrastructure space with thetransmission of video and voice over the Internet, where clearly we arereaching the capacity of limits that the current infrastructure will provide.So, there is a lot of activities going on in building new types of routers, newtypes of servers, that can handle these increased traffic. And I think we arejust at the beginning. So, my expectation is that we'll see reasonable growthin the Wired line business going forward, although, there could be somelumpiness, which is always the case when you start up things.", "On the wireless side, there wehad a couple of negative quarters now. And it really has to do with theinvestment of deployment of 3G base stations throughout the world. And ourexpectation is that we probably see not one may be two more quarters ofnegative growth, but the feedback we really seek from our customers are quitebullish for next year. So, obviously with all the terms on economic conditionsand other factors that can influence that, but our expectation is that thewireless less business, will start growing in one or two more quarters. Nextquestion please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes fromUche Orji.", "Parag - UBS", "Hi, this is Parag for Uche. Justwanted to get a clarification on your comments, you said that your mainstreamin this business declined quarter-over-quarter is going to remain in the samerange as this quarter. So, I was just wondering, if your new product revenuecontinues to grow at the same rate, and given that your mainstream decline ismoderating. Should we expect to see revenue expectation going forward into '08?", "Wim Roelandts", "Yeah, absolutely, you are talkingabout the measurement business?", "Maria Quillard", "The mainstream?", "Wim Roelandts", "Mainstream, I am sorry.", "Jon Olson", "They got sort of new products forthe mainstream.", "Wim Roelandts", "Well, you're really talking abouttwo different aspects, the three segments that we identified for is newbusiness stream and base business and business of the older products.Typically, they will continue to decline over the years, these are productsthat are typically five -- at least five or six years old, plus they're peak inproduction.", "The mainstream business really,is very dependant on the economic conditions. So, I think if these are theproducts that are in production for our customers, and so, our customers buythese products when they see their business growing or not. So, it's reallyvery little we can do on that, but the new products, however, that is somethingthat we can impact by having good new products and be ahead of our competition.", "And so, although this quarter wasa little bit on the weak side, but mainly because of V-4, which is kind of inthe limit now for between new and mainstream. But my expectation is that fornext quarter, the new business will do very well, mainly based on the strengththat we see on both V-4, V-5 especially, and then also on Spartan-3.", "The mainstream business willdepend on the, like I said, on the overall economic conditions. We expect it togrow slightly for the coming quarter, mainly because we expect the business tobe growing for the next quarter.", "Parag - UBS", "Okay. And then I have a follow-upon your backlog. And could you provide, you said that your backlog is thestrongest in the last few years. Could you provide some more color as to wherethat strength is from coming from, I mean which kind of market?", "Wim Roelandts", "Yes. Our backlog is up in thehigh-single digits compared with last quarter.", "Jon Olson", "So, I think from an end-marketperspective, as we've talked about where we see the strength in the nextquarter, we do think our aspects in defense will be stronger on a sequentialbasis and the consumer piece. Those are the two places that I think are the twolarge opportunities, anything in the industrial area, which is where aerospaceand defense is in the consumer space.", "Parag - UBS", "Thank you.", "Wim Roelandts", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes fromTristan Gerra.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird", "Hi guys. In Virtex-5, wheneveryou seem to be at an inflection point, is that the beginning of a migrationfrom product tightening to volume, and is that significant increasequarter-on-quarter sustainable beyond the December quarter or in line with whatwe have seen with previous Virtex ramps?", "Wim Roelandts", "Yes, well, Virtex-5 is clearly ina stage where we see a lot of activities, some of the first design wins arestarting doing the production, but this is still relatively a small number.", "Most of this revenue comes fromnew designs from engineering prototyping and for, from the emulation market,which are the emulation companies are buying very large Virtex devices. So allof the numbers, in units, it not may be very high, but the dollar revenue is ofcourse much higher.", "And so, it really is still mainlydesign win activities that we see happening. And, of course this quarter isextremely strong, part of it because a lot of shipments were already made tothe distribution channel that we expect to enter into customers, during thisquarter. But also because it is a very strong, very well received product lineand fundamentally, there is really no competition for some of the devices,mainly because of the features we have in there. So that's why we see a lot ofdesign activity in that space. Next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes fromGlen Yeung.", "Peter - Citigroup", "Hi, this is a Peter for Glenn. Iactually want to do a touch on, you talked about strength across your top 10customers, which are large OEMs and it looks like you also worked down channelinventory quite a bit, which I usually think is associated with small mediumcustomers. Should we think that more broadly, is this any indication that morebroadly, there is just a bit of strength coming back or did you really workdown the inventory earlier in the quarter, and then it was the large OEMs who lookedbetter towards the end? Any color would be helpful. Thanks.", "Wim Roelandts", "Yeah. Well, the, what was kind ofinteresting this quarter, is that in all geographies our top 10 customersincreased, which is a sign that things are may be picking up, although I amvery careful because one quarter doesn't make a trend yet. So, you have tocareful of, about that, but indeed, overall there seems to be a little moreoptimism. Again, it depends very much on the overall economic conditions goingforward, and that could dampen this trend in the future.", "But overall, yes, the bigcompanies have been kind of sluggish for the last several quarters. So thatpick-up is really very encouraging to us, and we see also good design activityin all of our other channels.", "Jon Olson", "I can add something. I think youwere also kind of talking, asking a question around the volume going todistribution. Quite or few of our large customers still are served via ourdistribution network and are not direct shipped from Xilinx. So even though, wehad a lot of, lower days in distribution. That doesn't necessarily indicatethat's it's all small customers.", "Peter - Citigroup", "And could I actually ask afollow-up?", "Jon Olson", "Sure.", "Wim Roelandts", "Sure.", "Peter - Citigroup", "Earlier in the year I think youhad a just a better ramp up, that matured yields a little bit more quicklythan, maybe was anticipated. I was wondering, if it's too early to starttalking about on how next sets of products. Well, how yields are continuing toimprove and if you think there is any potential for margin upside out of thator out of the next, I guess, [40]-nanometer?", "Wim Roelandts", "Well, the 45 nanometer, ofcourse, it's too early to say, there is no products yet introduced in that, andit typically takes several quarters to really see what the trends are inyields, but as far as 65 nanometer is concerned, and I mention that, I think acouple of quarters ago, indeed the yields have been better than we anticipated,and also better not where you have seen over the previous generation oftechnology. One of the factors we have measured very carefully is what iscalled the learning curve, so it really is the improvement in yields or indefect rates versus time versus unit shipped. And clearly 65-nanometer learninggrowth was better than what we have seen for instance a 90-nanometer or130-nanometer. I think it is due to the fact that there is a lot new technologybeing used for design for manufacturability, in line inspection. Anothertechnology they really allow you to improve the yield faster.", "Also 65-nanometer was arelatively -- technology was relatively new little innovation and as far asequipment or processes were concerned through this pretty much of showing from90-nanometer. 45-nanometer would be a lot more difficult, because there inorder to build 45-nanometer products you will need new steppers -- theimmersion steppers, which of course is a brand new technology. And there couldbe some hiccups when another new technology is deployed in production. So, I expectthat 45-nanometer is potentially a little bit more difficult than 65, but 65 indetail very smooth and continues to be moving forward at a faster pace and itwill be achieved with the previous generation of technology.", "Peter - Citigroup", "That's helpful, thank you.", "Wim Roelandts", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes fromChris Danley.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, good afternoon. This is(inaudible) for Chris Danley. You've already talked about recent problems withsome of the biggest customers especially in the wireless base station market,do you think that this is the odd term problem? Or are you expecting increasein sales from them going forward?", "Wim Roelandts", "Yes, like I said a little bitearlier in our description with our wireless customers. Our forecast is prettypositive going forward, and you were referring to the announcement by Ericsson,but if you listen to their announcement and that is being I can confirm thattheir weakness came mainly from software and services and not from theequipment side, which continues to do well. And that of course where we areinvolved in the forecast from Ericsson continue to be quite positive for thelonger-term future. Next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes fromArnab Chanda.", "Arnab Chanda - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Thank you, question for Wim, isthere, do you see, if you look at some of the high volume markets, and you aretalking about Digital TV, historically they don't tend to use FPGA as that muchof several prototyping, are you seeing a difference in to the CPLD businesswhere it seems like grow is actually picking up? Are you seeing that going todifferent markets and does that change your growth rates at all? Do havefollow-up. Thanks.", "Wim Roelandts", "Yes, absolutely in the -- alwaysFPGAs were only used for prototyping or for very low volumes in the high volumemarket, which still is 100,000 of units. But now, we really see, thanks to thecost improvements driven by 90-nanometer and further cost reductions in the90-nanometer product lines and its Spartan-3 product line. We see more and moreacceptance of FPGAs even in the relatively high volume productions, millions ofunits type of volume production.", "So, clearly it is a space wherestandards are changing where a lot of the panels are changing. So, there is aplace where programmers can play a very important role in supporting the newesttechnology in the newest panels. And because of the cost of program did notreach a level that there can be price comparative with other solutions in thatmarket. So, there a couple of years ago we saw then we had a million unitsorder, in this period we see several million unit orders, and even much higherthan that coming in for the life span of that product. Next question please.", "Operator", "You next question comes from MarkLipacis.", "John - Prudential Securities", "Hi. This is John on for Mark. Heyguys, I have a question, for actually inventory levels. It just seems very lowcompared to historically. It sounds like, and if you dissect that a little bitmore, your channel inventories are up pretty much back to normal after a bigpop last quarter, but your internal inventories are drastically bad. I\u2019m justkind of wondering, how you really feel about that. And I know you were sayingthat your targets are around the 90 to 100 days. And in the past year yourtarget has been a little bit higher as well. I'm wondering what you're thinkingabout your inventory levels at this point?", "Jon Olson", "So, this is one of the focusareas John that we've had in the company over the last six quarters, is to,really to manage things on the balance sheet a little differently than in thepast, and be more focused about that. And inventory is one of our shinierexamples of success story of how we've driven it down. Well, it really isn't acorrelation between having piles and piles of inventory and meeting customercommitments.", "We actually have increasing OFDor first commit to our customers and increasing percentage over the last coupleof quarters, and as you know, the last six quarters, well at the same time weare taking inventory down. So, we think we can effectively manage the supplyline and meet upside along the way.", "So we are not leaving things outat the expense of not being able to [test] by upside, then we carefully planthat upside capability on high running products every quarter as we go --excuse me, every month as we go through our wafer allocation process. So, thisis just blocking and tackling and good strong, a fiscal on operational control.", "John - Prudential Securities", "Okay, I understand. Thank youvery much.", "Wim Roelandts", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from[Danny Kuo].", "Danny Kuo - Bear Stearns", "Yeah, guys. Can you just give usthe absolute dollar for your aerospace and defense business in the currentquarter, and maybe for this fiscal year '08, should we expect a similar type ofgrowth in that business as compared to last fiscal year?", "Wim Roelandts", "I am sorry Danny, but we don'tgive specific numbers for subsets of the businesses. We only give numbers forthe four segments that we report on. But we have communicated in the past therough percentages and aerospace, defense is in the 10% to 12% of our totalcompany's revenue.", "Danny Kuo - Bear Stearns", "And maybe, another question forJon. I guess, within your gross margin guidance let me assume a comparablerevenue mix in the December quarter. Should we expect that gross margin to comeback up to, I guess 63%, which is a high end to your guidance range, withouttheir one-time charges?", "Jon Olson", "Well, certainly, the one-timecharges impacted us this time, and we would have landed more comfortably in the52 to 63 range without them. Again, we have done some significant thingsrelative to improving our cost forecast, and actually, our cost to actuals, andit's really a matter of how the mix comes in. So, it is possible for the mix tocome in a way that gets us to 63%. It's not a stretch to the imagination. Onthe other hand, it could also be in the low 52% as well, so, a lot ofdependencies here to be able to land it within that tide of a range.", "Danny Kuo - Bear Stearns", "Thanks.", "Wim Roelandts", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes fromArnab Chanda.", "Arnab Chanda - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Hi, Jon, just a follow-up on thetax rate, your tax rate seems to have come down, you've talked about havingoverseas, the things that you are doing in Singapore, et cetera. Is thissomething that we expect to kind of continuously go down towards maybe yourmajor competitor, which is quite a bit lower still? Or do you think that thisis a good number to work on for the foreseeable future? Thank you.", "Jon Olson", "Our first goal is to be able tomanage our actual cash that we paid to various U.S. and foreign governments and inother words to optimize that for the company. So it's really, first a cashthing and then the rates, that's the secondary issue.", "We have been certainly doing somethings in reviewing our overall structures to see if there are other ways forus to lower the rate. We are not prepared to provide a forecast for next year.", "It's certainly on our plate toreview and see if there are opportunities for us to go lower. I think you also,if you look at, you compare our rates to most of the other semi-rates, you willfind that we are in the mid-range to lower already. So our competitor may be atlow out layer, but I am not going to comment on their particular tax structure.But I think, we are already at least competitive or better among the semis.Even though, we will always look for an opportunity to lower it.", "Arnab Chanda - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Thanks Jon.", "Jon Olson", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "You have a follow-up questionfrom the line of Mark Lipacis.", "John - Prudential Securities", "Hi, this is John again. So, interms of target levels, are the target, I am sorry, the trench target for thisquarter, it was 59% last quarter, correct? So what is it for this quarter?", "Wim Roelandts", "We expect it to be roughly in thesame range, maybe a little lower because we know we have stronger backlog. So,in the high 50s.", "John - Prudential Securities", "Okay thanks.", "Operator", "We have another follow-upquestion from the line of Uche Orji.", "Parag - UBS", "The question has been answered.Thank you.", "Wim Roelandts", "Next question?", "Operator", "You have no further questions.", "Maria Quillard", "Okay.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx third quarter fiscal year 2008 earnings release conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to [Maria Quillard]. Thank you, Ms. [Quillard] you may begin your conference.", "[Maria Quillard]", "Thank you and good afternoon everyone. With me are Wim Roelandts, Chairman, Moche Gavrielov, CEO and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business of the December quarter and then we will open the call for questions. I will then end the call with a few housekeeping items. As published in our press release, we are discontinuing the practice of issuing scheduled mid quarter business updates. As a result no fourth quarter business update press releases will be issued during the March quarter. Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially. We refer you to the documents the company filed with the SEC including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ material from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Investor Relations website. Now let me turn the call over to Jon Olson.", "Jon Olson", "Thank you Maria. We executed on many fronts during the quarter. Revenues in fiscal Q3 were $475 million up 7% sequentially from the prior quarter and better than expected due primarily due to strength from defense and consumer applications. Gross margin of 63.3% was also above our guidance and the highest we\u2019ve reported in over three years as we benefited from manufacturing efficiencies and continued yield improvement on 90-nm and 65-nm process technologies. Operating income of $115.3 million was up 22% sequentially and up 40% versus the same quarter of the prior year. As a result we achieved our operating margin target of 24% one quarter earlier than anticipated. Operating margin for the December quarter was 24.3% up from 21.2% in the prior quarter and up from 18.2% in the same quarter a year ago. Reaching a 24% operating margin has been our chief objective for the past year and is reflective of the progress we have made in reducing the cost of our products as well as disciplined expense management. This is the highest operating margin we have reported in nearly two years during which time we implemented stock option expensing. ", "Let me stress that we are not finished with focusing on operating efficiencies. I believe there is continued opportunity to drive shareholder value through improved operating efficiencies and this will remain a priority for the company. Operating expenses were higher than anticipated during the quarter due primarily to higher sales commissions, bonuses associated with higher revenue and profit levels and the adverse affect of foreign exchange putting pressure on our operating expenses. ", "Other income was $14.4 million higher than the $12 million we forecasted mainly due to higher interest income and a foreign currency hedging gain. Net income was 21.8% up from 20.2% in the prior quarter and up from 19.4% in the same quarter a year ago. Finally earnings per share were $0.35 a share up from $0.30 a share in the prior quarter. Free cash flow during the quarter was $197 million after $11 million in CapEx and we paid a dividend of $0.12 per share during the quarter. We increased our buy back during the quarter repurchasing 8.2 million shares for $200 million and we paid $34 million in dividends. During the calendar year we generated $482 million in free cash flow. Our dividend yield is currently 2.5% higher than the S&P average and among the highest in the technology sector. ", "Lastly the tax rate for the quarter was 20.1% lower than the forecasted 21% rate primarily due to a higher distribution of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions and a change in the R&D credit methodology. Let me now comment on the balance sheet.", "The cash balance decreased $18 million during the quarter to $1.9 billion. Factoring in the $1 billion convertible, our net cash position is now approximately $900 million. Day sales outstanding decreased four days to 44 days. Combined inventory at Xilinx and distribution decreased by one day to 91 days with 69 days at Xilinx and 22 days at distribution. This is well within our target of 90-100 days and remains the lowest in nearly four years. Stability in inventory levels is indicative of balance in the overall supply chain. Quite simply our customers are taking the product when they need it. This is also reflective in our turns for the quarter which were 59% consistent with the levels we\u2019ve seen for the past several quarters. I will now turn the call over to Wim to comment on our business and products.", "Willem Roelandts", "Thank you Jon and let me first give you my own comments on the December quarter. The December quarter was an outstanding quarter for Xilinx. We exceeded the top end of our revenue guidance and we are poised to capture [inaudible] market segment share this quarter. Once again our last OEM customers [inaudible] very well. The difference this quarter was that our smaller channel customers grew at nearly the same rate as our large OEMs. This was not the case in the prior two quarters. Our channel customer design and momentum is strong with significant wins for Virtex-5, [inaudible] a variety of end markets. Our large OEM customers are well diversified across all our various end markets and are not just communications driven companies. In fact, of our top 50 accounts only about a third are communications customers. ", "On the product front, our new product category grew an impressive 23% sequentially and now represents 35% of total revenues up from 26% in the prior year quarter. Virtex-5 revenues doubled as we had forecast and are now a meaningful number of just shy of 5% of total revenues. Virtex-4 and Spartan-3 both grew at healthy double-digit sequential rates. Total Virtex revenue increased to 55% of our overall revenues. Spartan revenues were at 25% of our total revenues while CPLDs fell to 9% of overall revenues. ", "From a geographic perspective all geographies, except Asia Pacific posted strong sequential growth. North American revenues were up 14% on the strength of defense orders. Europe grew 8% sequentially driven by strength in the industrial and consumer and automotive sectors. In Japan we saw improvement in communications and in particular wireless, after many quarters of softness. Asia Pacific took a breather this quarter after reaching a record 30% of total sales last quarter, it declined to 27% of total revenues primarily due to the lower communications revenues. ", "In terms of end markets, industrial and other grew to 33% of revenues driven by the strength of our defense business. After wired communications, defense is the second largest end market segment of 15% of total revenues. However even excluding our growth in defense, we still would have shown sequential revenue growth this quarter. Consumer and automotive [inaudible] stand out growing 9% quarter to quarter. The other [inaudible] surprise was data processing which was up 17% and ceased being a drag on our revenues. We were not expecting much from communications this quarter and as predicted, communications was down 2%. Wireless fell flat and wired communications was down. ", "Let me know turn to our recent announcement about my successor. On January 7 began a new chapter in Xilinx history. It is my real pleasure to introduce Moshe Gavrielov as the new CEO of Xilinx. He immediately takes on all CEO level responsibilities and decisions. We had many good candidates but in Moshe, we found an excellent match for the continued success of Xilinx. Doing his 30 year career, he has proven himself to be an effective, result driven leader who understands how to grow businesses by building strong teams and developing excellent relationships with customers. His experience in both the silicon and software side of the business has provided him with the necessary background to drive Xilinx forward. Lastly his collaborative team focus management style provides and excellent fit. Here is Moshe.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you Wim and good afternoon everyone. I just wanted to say a few words of introduction. First of all I want you all to know that I am absolutely delighted to have the opportunity to lead Xilinx. This is definitely my dream job, one that builds upon my 30 years of very relevant experience in the high complexity end of the [inaudible] world. Xilinx is a very sophisticated business. Consequently I have a lot of ground to cover in the near term and planning to spend the next few months in accelerated immersion meeting with as many customers, partners and employees as possible. I see many possibilities ahead of Xilinx given the programmable platform and our customers\u2019 needs for complete solutions. One of my top priorities will be to accelerate growth but in parallel I am committed to improving operating efficiencies across the company and driving increased shareholder return. I absolutely have a very direct interest in enhancing the company\u2019s performance and relish the opportunity to address this challenge. Undoubtedly there will be changes made to achieve these goals. With that in mind, I appreciate your patience as I fully formulate our strategy and vision for the company going forward. I very much look forward to working with all of you. With that, let me turn it back to Wim.", "Willem Roelandts", "Thank you Moshe. So let me now give the guidance for our December quarter. And our guidance for the December quarter is for sales to be up 3% to down 1% sequentially. We are being prudent with the guidance due to the macro economic conditions. We are expecting all geographies to be up sequentially with the exception of North America which we are expecting to decrease due to the decline in the defense sales which tend to be seasonally soft in the March quarter. From an end market perspective we are expecting consumer and automotive to increase given some specific visual TV design wins that will continue ramping into volume production during the March quarter, as well as strength from audio, video and broadcasting. Industrial and [inaudible] expect to be down driven by the defense seasonality that I have mentioned before. Communications continues to be the most challenging end market to forecast. We believe it will be up modestly in both wireless and wire line given the preliminary forecast data from our key end customers. After posting strong growth in December quarter, data processing expected to be down slightly due to seasonality. From a product standpoint we are expecting new product category to be healthy again this quarter with the strong ramp of our 90-nm and 65-nm products. ", "Now let me turn the call back to Jon for some final remarks.", "Jon Olson", "Thank you Wim. Our gross margin is expected to be approximately 63% as it continues to benefit from improving yields on advance process [nodes]. Combined operating expenses including about $1.5 million of amortization are expected to be approximately $185 million. Other income including the impact of interest expense is expected to be approximately $10 million. This lower level is reflective of lower investment market rates and a modest impact from foreign exchange rate contracts. Share count is expected to be approximately at 286 million shares. And the tax rate is expected to be 20%. Let me now open the lines for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from Glen Yeung \u2013 Citigroup", "Glen Yeung \u2013 Citigroup", "Thanks very much, your commentary about being prudent with regard to macro looking into the March quarter when you broke it down by end market, it looked like you were actually looking largely for seasonality, I wonder if you could be specific about which of your end markets you think you\u2019re being the most prudent and then maybe address any signs of macro weakness you may be seeing in your order book or anything else.", "Willem Roelandts", "Well Glen first of all the big part of our business except for the consumer of course is related to capital goods spending and so although the feedback from our customers is quite optimistic for the quarter, our experience shows that when the economy goes sideways or down, CEOs start delaying purchases and that\u2019s what we are worried about. So we are a little bit in a difficult situation here because like I said the feedback from our customers is quite optimistic, we have polled them over and over again because of the economic uncertainty but it\u2019s more our own caution that will hold us back a little bit. And if we see a weakness it will be in the capital goods area. In other words, in the major part of our businesses which is the communication space, the whole computing area and then industrial and others. Of course we know that defense is going to be weaker, December is always the strongest quarter for defense spending so we have already figured that in our numbers [inaudible] we are a little bit cautious because I think if the economy continues to deteriorate, CEOs will start delaying purchases of capital goods and that will impact our own business. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "Coming to your gross margin they were up handsomely this quarter and you\u2019re guiding for 63% next quarter and traditionally March has been an up part of your gross margin so should we expect an upside to the March gross margin quarter, I mean going forward, is there a more upside in longer time as well?", "Jon Olson", "We forecasted 63% as a mid point of our range and obviously it could be a little higher and also could be a little lower and what\u2019s happening to us here as we talked about the defense business being so strong in the fourth quarter typically that comes with margins that are higher than our business model and with that becoming softer, in our mind, the improved yields are more or less offsetting the mix issue that\u2019s surrounding the fact that defense business comes with slightly higher margins. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from James Schneider - Goldman Sachs", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs", "Hi thanks and welcome Moshe, just a question on the industrial market, if you were to exclude the defense business and you looked forward into the next quarter, are you seeing any kind of slowdown in that segment of the business because of the macro environment or not?", "Willem Roelandts", "Well the forecast that we receive from our customers is quite positive. If you look at the components of industrial and [inaudible] is really three segments. One is defense and aerospace, which like I said we will expect it to be down. The other component is industrial, scientific and medical and there in fact we expect, or the feedback from our customers is that will be up. And then the third one is tested measurement which we expect to be flat to slightly down and that\u2019s where I think probably the biggest danger is for economic slowdown. Even if economic slowdown happens again this is capital equipment, these are things that people tend to postpone or delay if they are not confident in the economy.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan", "Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan", "Hi good afternoon. I have a question about your long term outlook for growth in the semiconductor market. Can you comment based on the macro economic weakness do you see a substantial slowdown in the field [inaudible] space or do you expect it to be at the same levels as the last three or four years?", "Willem Roelandts", "Well there is multiple components to your question so let me just site a few one. First of all like I mentioned before a big chunk of our business, 85%, everything except consumer automotive is really capital goods related and like I mentioned before if there is an economic slowdown that will impact that business. If you look beyond the pure [inaudible] economic concerns that exist, I believe that the [inaudible] market will continue to expand at a faster rate than the overall semiconductor market and there are several reasons for that. I think that first of all in the communication space sooner or later will have to expand the internet infrastructure simply because you know with all the additional bandwidth that is being required from a video transmission for instance like with systems like YouTube, voice over IP, there is\u2026studies have shown that the internet infrastructure is reaching capacity and so companies will have to expand that and that of course will benefit us because we are a major supplier to the communication infrastructure building wireless and wire line. ", "In the other areas and especially in the audio, video, broadcast but also military, industrial, electronics areas, the trend is quite positive for us over the longer term in a sense that more and more of these customers because of the cost of doing [inaudible] are using [inaudible] and the trend will continue. Our biggest opportunity for growth however is in the consumer space, consumer automotive which we are really a very small player and so we really have opportunity there to grow. You know we are seeing more and more design activities which for us means high volume I think for a consumer industry it\u2019s probably more medium volume. What I mean by that is a million units or more per year per socket. But we see more and more activity of that every quarter and I believe that with programmables going to the next generation technology, the 45-nm technology, I think that we can get our average selling price lower and therefore expand our market opportunity in these high volume markets and I think that\u2019s where the biggest growth opportunity for the PLD industries and for Xilinx specifically. ", "But for Xilinx, I think we are in a very strong product position, in the high end, with our Virtex-5 family. We virtually have no competition. Our competitors have barely a product out in that area. We have several families that are in volume production. We see tremendous amount of design activity going on and I think that we are gaining market share certainly in the high end. In the high volume side we are holding up very well. We have a broad portfolio of products that really are fit to specific applications and they also are doing well. And of course like I said with the newer generations coming in the more advanced technologies we will continue to expand the opportunities for Xilinx going forward. And I think both in the short term from Xilinx specifically and in the longer term I think we have great opportunities. The only kind of caution of course is the current economic conditions and that is once that is behind us I think we\u2019ll do very well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers", "Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers", "I just wanted to see if you could speak a little bit more about the competitive positioning of Virtex-5 against [Stratex-3]?", "Willem Roelandts", "Sure, like I mentioned the Virtex-5 we introduced our first 65-nm products in May of 2006, so it\u2019s a family that was first introduced almost 18 months ago. We have since then rolled out three sub families that are all in volume production now all doing very well. If you look at our competition, they just introduced their first product literally their first product, and they only have one product in 65-nm in the Stratex family on the market today. It\u2019s an engineering sampling so that means that they have very limited production. Against that we have about I think 17 or 18 family members that are holding volume production. We are starting sampling our last sub family, the [Effex D] family and that will be announced somewhere early this year so I think we are in a [inaudible] position. Our competition\u2019s product doesn\u2019t have [inaudible] they don\u2019t have processors, they don\u2019t have all the other features we have and all the input that I receive both from our sales people but also from independent sources indicate that we are gaining at least 80% of all of the sockets in the high end of the market and that is a very, very strong position to be in. I don\u2019t see any change in that happening over the next year, this calendar year as I think we\u2019re basically are in a position that there is no competition for us for another six to 12 months. So that is the situation and that\u2019s why our business in Virtex-5 is doing so well and now is really becoming a substantial part of our overall revenues.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Arnab Chanda - Deutsche Bank", "Arnab Chanda - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you, congratulations Moshe. Question about your data processing business, it seemed like for the first time it actually came back into pretty strong growth, could you explain what is happening there, is it a regaining of share, are there some new [inaudible] ramping and is that, do you think that\u2019s sustainable for the next 12 months or so?", "Willem Roelandts", "You know the data processing business is really a very a business that is [inaudible] accounting innovation so you know programmables are always very attractive when things keep changing or there is new innovation happening. I think that data processing is a much more mature business. It doesn\u2019t mean that there are no opportunities but this quarter was more, like last quarter was weaker than we expected, this quarter is a little bit stronger than we expected so this is kind of where we believe the business will be over the next several quarters. We don\u2019t expect that there is going to be a lot of design activities in that space. So I think the roughly 8%, now 6% to 8% of our business and I expect that it will stay around that level for the foreseeable future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Mark Liposis] - Morgan Stanley", "[Mark Liposis] - Morgan Stanley", "Hi good afternoon, hey Moshe congratulations on the new position and look forward to working with you. The question I has was in regards to the consumer strength this past quarter, you know if you could provide a little bit more color into that as well as do you think it\u2019s the same type of customer base that\u2019s going to show strength in the current quarter as well? Thank you.", "Willem Roelandts", "Yes John indeed what is happening we have in fact during last year mainly since the beginning of 2007 we really have made a major effort to gain more business in the consumer space and I think what you are seeing now is the first successes it takes. You know the nice thing about consumer is that they from a design win to production typically is only six to nine months so that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing here. We expect what we are happening what is happening more specifically several design wins in very large panel TVs area mainly in preparation for the summer Olympics in Beijing. So these are relatively expensive devices but the volume is very high I mean certainly for Xilinx standards and these are the areas where we have done very well multiple design wins and where traditionally September and December are the strong quarters for consumer electronics we are a little bit in a different pattern here and I think it\u2019s driven by the summer Olympics where multiple of the consumer companies are preparing offerings for the winter Olympics and that\u2019s where we are have won several design wins. So we expect that the strength in consumer will in fact last for several quarters and then of course after the Olympics we\u2019ll go into the Christmas shopping season for 2008. So I think that you\u2019ll see quite some good business in that area for the next three or four quarters.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities", "Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities", "Could you guys maybe talk a little bit about the backlog heading into the March quarter and the change from the most recent quarter? And maybe if you saw any of the softness you\u2019re worried about towards the end of the quarter. Thanks.", "Willem Roelandts", "Well Sumit December is always the soft quarter at the end because you know with the Christmas and New Year holidays so it\u2019s difficult to compare the end of the December quarter with the end of the September let\u2019s say. Our backlog is down just a little bit pretty much I would say insignificant very, very low single-digits and I think part of it is driven by the holiday seasons that people basically close their factories and don\u2019t order so much and now they\u2019re starting to ramp up again. So basically I think we are in a good position to see some growth this quarter if it was not for potential economic weakness in the industry. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Danny Quo] - Bear Stearns", "[Danny Quo] - Bear Stearns", "Can you comment on the networking market and whether the trends you\u2019re seeing there if you\u2019re expecting growth this quarter?", "Willem Roelandts", "Yes well the networking, in the networking space like I mentioned in my prepared remarks you know wireless was flattish, the wired count was down a little bit, overall the whole sector was down 2% which is kind of not that much but and we kind of expect it and the reason is typical end of the year weakness. You know network equipment is capital equipment. It\u2019s really driven by budgets. Most of the companies that our customers sold to are on yearly cycles so typically people run out of budget by the end of the year and that is always a little bit of a weaker period for networking. We expect that to rebound because companies will get new budgets at the beginning of their fiscal year and then will start ordering equipment. In the longer term I\u2019m very optimistic about networking after pretty much kind of a seven year flatness although declined first and then flattened as in that industry because I really believe that triple play is moving on and that network capacity is being used up, capacity that was put in place in 1999 and 2000 to an extreme is now being used up very rapidly and I think that most customers we talk to, these are the equipment companies who sell to the service providers of course and most of these customers are working on the much higher speed routers and networking gear because they see the demand from their customers. So I expect that in the longer term the telecommunication industry will see some growth in the next several years due to kind of an upgrade of the infrastructure in the internet. At the same time, in the wireless space a lot of changes are happening there and clearly again all of these are in our favor. There is, when people deployed the third generation wireless you know there was some question about why do you need data, is it are people going to use it, but clearly now data in wireless is becoming more and more used. Again for the same things you know watching movie clips, things like that, transmitting pictures whatever it is and so again that will increase the demand for wireless infrastructure and again that plays very strong in our favor because pretty much in the networking space most customers with a few exceptions are using programmables in the core of their design and we are the leading supplier to these customers. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sidney Ho - Merrill Lynch", "Sidney Ho - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks for taking my questions and welcome aboard Moshe. On the product front, I understand that Virtex-4 started shipping in early \u201904 and Virtex-5 starting shipping in \u201906, first what is the relative revenue size of the two product family last quarter then how does Virtex-5 ramp compared to Virtex-4 ramp during the same period and do you see end market exposure with different members of the product families change that [inaudible] materially and finally as for Virtex-4 is it premature to predict when revenue [inaudible]?", "Willem Roelandts", "Well you know our cycle is typically consists of two years of design win activity so the initial two years of a product you really sell engineering samples for so people can build their prototypes and it typically lasts for about two years that we see the production starting and that\u2019s when we see the growth taking off. So Virtex-5 clearly still in this early stage of engineering samples and is much, much smaller than Virtex-4 at this time. Virtex-4 of course there we are in volume production. We still win some new designs in Virtex-4 but mainly the revenue we get now is for volume production business. Typically it takes about five to six years after introduction before we see a peaking in revenue so we still, Virtex-4 had very healthy growth this quarter, will continue to grow for at least several more years before it will reach the peak in volume which typically happens I\u2019d say about five, six, sometimes seven years after a product was introduced so we are still, we still see big growth in Virtex-4 and of course these numbers are much, much bigger on the Virtex-5 numbers which really are just starting up with the business. The same thing for Virtex-5 if you compare Virtex-5 and Virtex-4 ramp up they were pretty much on the same level you know plus or minus a few percent so its pretty much the same pattern that we have seen. However, I believe that Virtex-5 because of additional capabilities over the longer term will be bigger than Virtex-4. You know during ramp up these ramp ups are typically similar because you\u2019re talking about selling a few parts to literally hundred or thousands of customers who do their design so the, initially you don\u2019t see much difference its really when the product gets in production that I think we\u2019ll see a much bigger ramp for Virtex-5 than we have seen for Virtex-4.", "Operator", "Your next question is a follow-up from Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "Uche Orji - UBS", "", "Just a question on your 45-nm strategy. Typically you have led your competition in [inaudible], do you plan to continue that with 45-nm as well and if you could provide any update on your 45-nm products?", "Willem Roelandts", "Well clearly our strategy is to be on the leading edge of technology. Whenever new theme of technology is available we will have a product ready for that and that is our strategy going forward. So we are not really changing our strategy in that matter so as soon as the 45-nm high performance process will be available we will within literally a couple of months we will tape out our products using that technology and that is what we plan to do for the 45-nm node. You have to realize that the foundries really have two processes; you know they have a 45-nm low power process which has been introduced to the market by most of the foundries. This 45-nm low power is mainly used by the cell phone maker, chips for cell phones and other portable devices. The high performance process typically comes out about six months or so after six to nine months after the low power process so we are expecting that to come out somewhere in the second half of this year and we expect to tape out our first products shortly thereafter. I cannot give you more details at this moment but as soon as we are ready with more information we\u2019ll certainly make that public.", "Operator", "", "Your next question is a follow-up from Glen Yeung \u2013 Citigroup", "Glen Yeung - Citigroup", "Thanks, maybe for Jon, if you guys hit the mid point of your revenue guidance for the first quarter what do you anticipate inventories will do on a quarter by quarter basis?", "Jon Olson", "I don\u2019t expect a great deal of change on inventory. We\u2019ve been living pretty steadily here for the last few quarters in the 90 to 100 range. The supply chain is really stable for us right now. Even though there\u2019s been ups and downs in terms of loadings of the fab even if it\u2019s been pretty fully loaded or even over subscribed, we\u2019ve been able to get the wafers that we require and the lay time in terms of a cycle time has not been very significant. So we haven\u2019t had to buffer that with extra die bank. So we\u2019ve been able to maintain that and we don\u2019t anything in the next quarter anything that will make it any different than that so again there could be some timing of when wafers hit us that might drive us above 91 to 98 for example, but we\u2019re still really confident we can stay in that level and I would expect on a dollar basis to be, net inventory dollar basis to be approximately flat with where we are today. ", "Operator", "Your next question is a follow-up from Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers", "Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers", "", "Thanks a couple of quick things. First could you just sort of remind us again what the [inaudible] for the coming quarter and also if you could give us some sense of how the usual March linearity proceeds and how you\u2019ve seen the general trend of business at the outset of this calendar first quarter and then with respect to the segments, I think you said that the com wireless business might be up a little sequentially, how do you see the networking and wire line side is that flattish or might we expect that to be seasonally up a little bit. And it looks like in consumer that it\u2019s really the audio visual industrial business that\u2019s up, is that what you\u2019re expecting to be higher again in the calendar first quarter? Thank you.", "Jon Olson", "Well Tim you now hit the record for a single topic question, you got four in there so let me see, I hope you\u2019re still able to be on the line in case I forgot something along the way. So let\u2019s talk about turns for a second in our backlog position and in our trends. Okay so the turns, expectation of our turns are to be approximately flat with where we\u2019ve been at the high end in the 50s. We\u2019ve been around 59% pretty consistently for the last couple of quarters and again because the lead times are low the supply chain is good we don\u2019t see a different pattern unfolding with respect to that. When talking a little bit about the linearity throughout the quarter, this quarter is relative to any other we\u2019re in is more stable, there are more days, shipment days because of fewer holidays. There\u2019s also typically an acceleration towards the March time period for turns business so it\u2019s typically March is a stronger third month than many of the other of our quarters. And if you think back to what our pattern is in the December quarter, we went into the quarter with a lot of backlog relative to what we have had. We had a strong two months of turns and then a drop off in December. This quarter is typified more by a little slowness entering into it and then acceleration throughout the quarter. As we sit here today, as Wim said, we\u2019re flat to a little bit down on a sequential trend. We still feel like we\u2019re in pretty good shape. Wim is going to take the other comments on the segment.", "Willem Roelandts", "So let me talk about telecom and what we\u2019re expecting. Our expectation is based on feedback from our customers so we did quite an extensive interview with our customers to see what their patterns are, what they see happening, how much for example are they going to order, and both the wire line and the wireless segment we are expecting slightly to be up this quarter slightly up. Of course again you have to put the overall economic situation on top of that so like I said if the economic situation were to deteriorate CEOs will delay purchasing but our current view is that both of these segments will be up for the quarter. In the consumer and automotive sector it really consists of three parts like you know, there is automotive, there is consumer and then there is audio video broadcast and we expect both the consumer and the audio video broadcast to be up this quarter. Audio video broadcast always has a strong quarter because again its capital equipment related, companies get new budgets, they buy more stuff. The consumer is [inaudible] non typical because like I said we won several design wins in the flat panel area, flat panel TV area in anticipation of the Olympic games in Beijing. And so this is a little bit different from normal seasonality that we expect consumer to be up this quarter based on design wins and the parts that we have to deliver in during this quarter to these consumer companies. ", "Operator", "Your next question is a follow-up from [Mark Liposis] - Morgan Stanley", "[Mark Liposis] - Morgan Stanley", "Hi Jon, how should we think about stock buy backs going forward?", "Jon Olson", "I think throughout the year we\u2019ve been relatively aggressive on stock buy backs starting with the convertible debt that we did that we ended up buying back a significant amount of the company at that point and we\u2019ve demonstrated a kind of an increasing pattern here and that\u2019s really been driven by the fact that we\u2019ve improved our financial model quite a bit, the balance sheet, the P&L, we\u2019re generating more cash, we\u2019re following our overall plan to return cash to shareholders and keep our net cash balance within a range. So this last quarter we bought back $200 million worth and I\u2019m not forecasting what we\u2019re doing in the future but we certainly will continue to live with our current cash policy statement of returning cash to shareholders through dividend and buy backs. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question is a follow-up from James Schneider - Goldman Sachs", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs", "Hi Jon just real quick, on the gross margin upside could you perhaps quantify for us how much was mix and how much was operational?", "Jon Olson", "Actually that\u2019s not an easy thing to do I mean if you just look segment out the pure industrial, excuse me the defense part of things I think we\u2019re talking about a few tenths of impact so its  definitely even less than half a point for sure. And that\u2019s why we think every quarter has yields depending on the mix and the growth of new products which is really where the largest impact of yields improvement is in terms of change, in terms of the percentages that\u2019s why through our models it appears that that\u2019s the kind of number we pick up each quarter and then it depends on whether more older products are sold or new products have [inaudible] and those are kind of the dynamics on a quarter to quarter basis.

And we had a pretty flat revenue environment up until this last quarter. We\u2019ve continued to improve our cost profile across the board throughout this time period and we got to our 24% target a quarter earlier than we had planned and we had talked about last year in the analyst meeting.

All the input that I have received is that they finally are starting to deploy new equipment both in the wire line and the wireless side, but especially in the wireless side they have been delaying, and so that\u2019s why we see the recovery in Japan. On top of that of course are [inaudible] the consumer space also helped because a lot of the consumer companies are in Japan but we are dealing with, and so both the consumer and the communication, improvement in communication has really helped our business in Japan. And I believe that this will continue to go forward in both areas. I think that NDT and [inaudible] having delayed the deployment of new equipment are now starting to deploy it and so that will continue to benefit us in the communication space and on the other side, like I said, a lot of the high end consumer products are being developed in Japan and that\u2019s where we have done very well and so these people are gearing up for the summer Olympic in Beijing and so we expect that our business in Japan will continue to grow over the next several quarters. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Glen Yeung \u2013 Citigroup", "Glen Yeung \u2013 Citigroup", "Wim, just in that same vain, any thoughts on China and how business looks in that part of the world, particularly in China mobile and if you see any [inaudible] coming there?", "Willem Roelandts", "Absolutely, you know it\u2019s kind of one of these areas that we believe could potentially grow. You know the situation in China is that the Chinese government has delayed the deployment of 3G because they were developing their own standard called TDSCDMA. We have been very extensively used in TDSCDMA base stations and now their TSDCDMA standard is kind of stable, we\u2019ll see quite some deployment and of course they want to be ready also for the Olympic games so there again I believe that the telecom business in China will continue to do better than the rest of the world for these circumstances and we are in a good position to take advantage of that.

My name is Cara and I will be your conference Operator. I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx first quarter fiscal year 2009 earnings release conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)", "I would now like to turn the call over to Maria Quillard. ", "Maria Quillard", "Thank you and good afternoon everyone. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the June quarter then we will open the call for questions.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially.", "We refer you to the documents that the company files with the SEC including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. ", "This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.", "Now let me turn the call over to Jon Olson.", "Jon Olson", "Thank you, Maria. During today\u2019s commentary, I will review our business results for the June quarter. I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the September quarter.", "Revenues in the June quarter set a new record at $488.2 million, up 3% sequentially from the prior quarter and up 9% from the same quarter of the prior year. Gross margin of 63.8% was at the high-end of our guidance of 63 to 64%, due primarily to improved yield and manufacturing efficiencies. ", "This is the third sequential quarter of gross margin improvement for Xilinx and a direct result of focused yield improvement and cost reduction efforts.", "Operating income of $107 million, including $19.5 million in restructuring charges, was down 9% sequentially and up 10% year-over-year. Combined R&D and SG&A expense were flat sequentially as guided and represented 37.6% of sales. ", "We continue to make progress in controlling expenses. In the same period a year ago, combined R&D and SG&A expense accounted for 39.9% of sales. However, we still have some work to do to realize our target of 17% for both R&D and SG&A.", "Other income in the June quarter was $5.7 million, up slightly from the prior quarter and in line with our guidance. June quarter net income of $83.9 million or $0.30 per diluted share, and included the previous mentioned restructuring charge in addition to a pre-tax $4.6 million charge related to impairment losses on equity investments.", "Collectively, these charges represented $24.1 million or approximately $0.07 per diluted share. Operating cash flow for the June quarter was $158 million before $10 million in CapEx. We repurchased 5.9 million shares for $150 million during the quarter and paid $39 million in dividends.", "Lastly, the tax rate for the March quarter was 22%, slightly higher than the 21% guided due to the fact that we have proportionately more U.S. income. Our recent workforce reduction disproportionately impacted U.S.-based employees, lowering expense and increasing U.S. income.", "Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments decreased $15 million during the quarter to $1.85 billion. Factoring in the $1 billion convertible, our net cash position is approximately $850 million. Days sales outstanding decreased 10 days in the June quarter to 38 days.", "Inventory dollars at Xilinx increased by $10 million sequentially in the June quarter representing 72 days. This is up from 68 days in the prior quarter and down from 79 days in the same quarter a year ago. ", "Worldwide distributors held 21 days in the June quarter, which is down from 24 days in the prior quarter and down from 22 days held in the same quarter a year ago. Combined inventory days in the June quarter were 93, well within our target of 90 to 100 days.", "Let me now turn to guidance for the September quarter of fiscal 2009. As most of you are aware the September quarter is normally our seasonally weakest quarter. Over the past five years the September quarter average sales decline has approximated 2%. We enter the quarter with backlog that is slightly down sequentially.", "The first couple of weeks have been typical for a September quarter, which is normally backend loaded. We continue to remain cautious about the macroeconomic environment. ", "However, we are optimistic about the traction we are receiving from the Virtex-5 FPGA family. We are expecting this family to achieve strong sales growth in the September quarter.", "As a result, we are forecasting the September quarter to be up 1% to down 3% sequentially. This will require a turns percentage in the high 50s. ", "Based on backlog analysis and customer feedback, we are anticipating sales from Asia Pacific, North America and Japan to be flattish sequentially and sales from Europe to be down sequentially in the September quarter.", "From an end markets perspective, we expect communications and industrial and other to be flat to slightly down sequentially and consumer automotive and data processing to be up sequentially. ", "Gross margin is expected to be approximately 63 to 64%. Combined operating expenses, including $1.4 million of amortization, are expected to be approximately $180 million.", "Included in the $180 million of combined operating spending is 1 to $2 million of previously announced restructuring charges. Other income, including the impact of interest expense, is expected to be approximately $5 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 277 million shares. The tax rate is expected to be 22%.", "I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Moshe for some further comment.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you, Jon and good afternoon to you all. I\u2019m very pleased with the June quarter results, which marked a new record for the company at $488 million, coming in at the high-end of our sales guidance. ", "In a challenging economic environment, we were able to achieve a number of milestones including record sales from our industrial and other category, record sales from the Asia Pacific region, and the highest gross margin since the September quarter of fiscal 2005.", "I\u2019ll now provide some color on the results of our vertical markets. Final tally, sales from Communications, Industrial and Other, and Data Processing all grew sequentially this quarter while Consumer and Automotive declined slightly. The Industrial and Other market was undoubtedly the highlight of the quarter.", "Sales reached record levels in the June quarter exceeding $160 million. Aerospace and Defense sales, which were seasonally week in the March quarter, increased 10% sequentially in the June quarter. Sales growth from this category was very broad based with 16 of our top 20 customers growing during the quarter. ", "Sales from Industrial, Scientific and Medical Applications increased in high single digits sequentially. This category continues to demonstrate consistent growth, benefiting from secular trends including productivity and power saving initiatives, coupled with renewed spending on U.S. medical equipment.", "By sub-segment following Wired Communications, Aerospace and Defense is our second largest area with Industrial, Scientific and Medical as number three. ", "Communications was up 3% sequentially representing 42% of sales. European Communications customers were particularly strong, delivering double-digit growth in the June quarter. ", "Asian and Japanese Communication customers were also generally strong, both delivering single-digit sequential growth. North American Networking customers were healthy again this quarter, but Wireless customers declined sequentially.", "Our V-5 momentum and leadership is very encouraging, and we are expecting strong sales in the September quarter as several communications customers begin employing V-5 for initial production runs. ", "In addition, global communications upgrades including 3G wireless, WiMAX are on the rise and Xilinx is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends. As we are heading into the summer quarter, we expect our European Communications business to be seasonally softer.", "Data Processing grew 3% due to growth from new storage applications. The Consumer and Automotive end market was down 2% sequentially; Automotive and Audio-video Broadcast sub-segments were flat, but Consumer declined sequentially, due primarily to two customers. We expect the September quarter to experience a seasonal pick up for the Consumer and Automotive end market.", "Product family split shows total Virtex revenues 57% of overall revenues increasing 7% sequentially, while we tend to highlight Virtex-5 momentum, our Virtex-4 family continues to do very well and grew double-digit sequentially. ", "Virtex-4 is the industry\u2019s largest high end FPGA family in terms of revenues. Spartan revenues grew 3% to 26% overall revenues and CPLDs were down sequentially comprising 8% of our overall revenue.", "It\u2019s been six months since I joined Xilinx and I\u2019m delighted with the rapid progress that\u2019s been made to date. At our analyst meeting last month, I discussed a market dynamic I called the programmable imperative. ", "Basically highlights the inexorable trend that end market requirements driving programmability to become increasingly important in the complex burgeoning digital world.", "In parallel the alternative solutions, i.e. ASICs and ASSPs are becoming by financial necessity, more and more focused on the highest volume applications, thereby increasing the sweet spot for programmable solutions. ", "To capitalize on this trend we\u2019ve taken some bold proactive measures at Xilinx. We recently completed a very broad reorganization into an efficient functional structure. The new organization is significantly simplified and more tightly integrated. ", "This new organization is already benefiting from increased efficiencies, more effective go-to-market strategies and improved execution. Consequently, it enables us to more rapidly develop and deliver focused customer and market driven products thereby targeting higher growth, higher return applications.", "As part of the reorganization we already have reviewed our existing portfolio, pruned and optimized it to accelerate the highest ROI programs. Over time we\u2019ll be expanding our portfolio of offerings beyond focusing on power, cost and IP to further focus on power and deliver both horizontal and vertical platforms. These new offerings will be market driven with an increased emphasis on early customer collaboration.", "In addition we\u2019ve implemented performance-based compensation and bonus plans to tightly align the variable compensation of the entire employee base with performance-driven metrics.", "In summary, there is abundant and growing opportunity for programmable solutions and definitely a lot to deliver in order to facilitate and capture these opportunities within a disciplined financial framework. ", "I look forward to continuing our ongoing dialogue on the Xilinx story, keeping you apprised of our progress. Jon and I, in conjunction with the entire employee base and management team focused on delivering improved results for all of our shareholders.", "Now let me turn the call back to the Operator to open it up for the Q&A session.", " ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers.", "Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks so much. A couple of clarifications and a question; with respect to clarifications, if you could give us how the book-to-bill was in the quarter and any clarity, Jon, on how you have perceived the linearity through the quarter?", "And then just as a question, within Communications how you had perceived in terms of your guide the different segments of Wireline, Telecom, Networking and Wireless?", "Separately Jon, I was also wondering; you\u2019ve got the gross margins marching upwards, although you have more new products and I believe generally your mature products have had the highest margins? Thanks.", "Jon Olson", "From a bookings pattern as we went through the quarter and then going into next quarter, we are starting in a flat to slightly down position in the quarter coming up here, Tim, from a backlog perspective. ", "But I wouldn\u2019t call that anything but typical relative to this quarter because more typical as we have a stronger September turns business than we do July and August, particularly because of vacations, and in Europe in particular it\u2019s really pretty slow in July and August. ", "We don\u2019t see anything different right now from that perspective. So from a book-to-bill perspective I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that\u2019s out of line here. It\u2019s really pretty close to 1.", "Our linearity throughout the quarter was pretty much as we anticipated. This was a pretty level quarter for us. April, May, June all being pretty even and we didn\u2019t see anything in particular different about June than any other June. ", "We might have had some stronger Communications business in the month of June. That\u2019s probably the only outlying item that I can recall.", "Then you asked a question around our Communications information by segment. As Moshe was talking about, we did experience good progress in the Networking area and we saw some good early positive signs in Telecom and some of that goodness was offset in the Wireless business for us. ", "Now part of the Wireless offset was really around prototyping not base station; rollouts of 3G or Next Generation etcetera, it was really around the prototyping business was the biggest individual decline and I think that was really set up by a strong prototyping dollar in our last previous quarter\u2019s figures for the most part.", "Then the last question was around gross margin being up, but it was up and we still had strong growth in new products and decline in our older products. While it is true that our older products have higher margins, we\u2019ve done a really nice job of sequentially improving margins every quarter on our new products. ", "New products are primarily made up of 90- and 65-nanometer based products. The 90-nanometer is starting to get much more mature; 65 yields are ramping in a way that\u2019s much faster than 90-nanometer as we have discussed over the last two years pretty consistently. We\u2019re quite pleased where we are with the product margin and gross margins of our products.", "Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers ", "", "Just as a follow up then, in terms of the calendar third quarter Communications guide you would expect all of those segments to be slightly lower sequentially or are there any that are slightly higher?", "And just as a general question, I think your rival Altera was suggesting last night that they will see more design wins on 40-nanometer in the second half than on 65-nanometer. Any commentary on just, how you perceive the competitive dynamics there at the leading edge and any flavor as to how big 65 is as a piece of the growing business currently?", "Jon Olson", "From a third quarter perspective I don\u2019t really have much color on forward-looking guidance by segment of Communications because I think we expect all the segments to be pretty much flat to down. ", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be one of the three segments standing out one way or the other. And when you\u2019re in this kind of a flat kind of environment there really isn\u2019t a whole lot of variation.", "Relative to Altera\u2019s comments, we have an extremely strong 65-nanometer portfolio with our Virtex-5 product line. We are expecting growth. We are expecting significant growth next quarter and the quarter after in our advanced products.", "As we said at the analyst meeting, we\u2019ll be announcing our 40-, 45-nanometer portfolio by the end of our fiscal year. In the meantime we\u2019ve got a lot of really strong products to sell versus any of the competitors at the high-end and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be doing.", "Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers ", "Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Schneider - Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs", "First of all on the end market commentary, can you talk about what you are seeing in Industrial? And in particular if you exclude the Auto and Defense business and look at broad-based industrial and in particular smaller customers, what are you seeing there; any signs of changes, weakening perhaps due to the macro economy?", "Jon Olson", "Jim, I think that if you take Industrial and you take out Aerospace and Defense that leaves you with the broad-based Industrial and Scientific and Medical. We are seeing strength in the Scientific and Medical area and broad-based Industrial, depends on the geography. ", "If you talk about the broad-based macroeconomic trends, the only kink that I\u2019m seeing right now is in North America. We have had some sequentially weaker channel business and some of that lands in the Industrial area and the broad-based Industrial area. ", "But other than that, from a macroeconomics perspective we are really not seeing too much going on. And the broad-based Industrial and the Scientific and Medical both, we believe, will grow.", "If you remember at our three-year CAGR growth forecast from the analyst meeting, we talked about where we thought the company was going to grow over the next three years and the Industrial area was actually the leader in terms of percentage growth, double-digit growth in those areas. ", "That wasn\u2019t just all about Aerospace and Defense. It was just as much about the broad-based Industrial and Scientific and Medical for us. So we are doing quite well there.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs", "Great. And then as a follow up, could you maybe talk a little bit about the shape of the OpEx profile that you expect through the remainder of the fiscal year? If you could throw out any kind of dollar target in terms of absolute dollars for the year that would be great.", "Jon Olson", "In the analyst meeting I talked about lowering our OpEx two to three-points as a percentage of revenue exiting Q4 of this next year. I don\u2019t know what other kind of color I am going to have. ", "If you look at the number we gave you for next quarter which is $180 million and then it has the 1 to $2 million of restructuring charge, you can see that the actions we\u2019ve taken both RIF and cost savings, as you can see that there\u2019s some dollars coming out. ", "We have some more cost reductions planned throughout the year, but we also have some add backs that we had talked about also in the analyst meeting. I wouldn\u2019t see us going forward having a big swing and maybe flat to slightly down in that number as we go through the year.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. So just to clarify, you wouldn\u2019t expect another significant step down in Q3?", "Jon Olson", "I would not expect another significant step down in Q3. We are going to work diligently through the rest of the year on our cost reduction opportunities, and as we said before there will be some add back of heads.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Lau - Jefferies & Co.", "John Lau - Jefferies & Co ", "Thank you very much. You commented on the communications end market. I wanted to follow-up on that. The competition saw some extremely strong pulls there and the overall results were very, very strong. It seems like your results have a different profile. I was wondering can you comment on any of the different dynamics there that we can be looking at?", "Jon Olson", "Obviously, we saw the announcement and if you parse where that came from, it appears that in North America they had very strong Communications business. And from our perspective we saw strong Networking across the board in almost every geography. ", "We had extremely strong business in Asia and in our large customer base and that was across both generally wired and wireless technologies. I think one of the overall differences could be between the two of us was our wireless business, and as we\u2019ve talked about, ours declined sequentially and I think they had a different profile.", "I can only comment on what they said in their call relative to our business, and I think there\u2019s just a different timing of some of the customers\u2019 needs from us versus the customers\u2019 needs from them. ", "I think if you look at our patterns over the years, you\u2019ve seen us be much stronger towards the end of our fiscal year and their pattern is a little bit different. Those are some of the differences that I\u2019ve seen.", "John Lau - Jefferies & Co ", "As a follow-up to that, you indicated that not only was Communications strong for you, but Asia was strong. What are you factoring in with regards to your outlook on Q3 especially with some of the commentary about the Olympics or any slowdown over there? Have you factored that into some of your guidance?", "Jon Olson", "We certainly assume the Olympics are going to happen. I don\u2019t think we are going to do anything about that one way or the other. But we definitely have taken a look at our customer forecast across the board. We\u2019ve heard about the view that there is going to be some softness in terms of the rollouts during the calendar third quarter and we\u2019ve put in the appropriate amounts into our forecast with that in our thinking and in the right context.", "John Lau - Jefferies & Co ", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung - Citi.", "Glen Yeung - Citi ", "Thanks. I just have one question although it\u2019s in twelve parts. First part is really thinking about how you think about the Comm end-markets relative to the macro? Where I\u2019m really going is we\u2019ve seen projects, obviously, in China and in Japan, you hear about projects in the U.S.; what\u2019s your sense as to sustainability of those projects, or the risk to them given the macro environment we\u2019re seeing?", "Jon Olson", "We\u2019ve been cautious. We\u2019ve been thinking about the macro environment. We\u2019ve been waiting for something bad to happen to us in our backlog and customers to back away, and we have not experienced anything significant in this area. ", "Our large customers are all rolling ahead with their projects. We\u2019ve been getting very strong design wins on our Virtex-5, which is usually indicative of next generation Communications in many ways, as well as the Aerospace and Defense, but that\u2019s less impacted by macroeconomics in the short-term. ", "All the signs that we see are that prototyping is happening and the projects are moving forward. So we can all get afraid about oil prices and everything else and maybe someday it will actually happen in a way that hurts us, but right now we are not getting any information that says different than full steam ahead in terms of the Communications segment.", "Glen Yeung - Citi ", "Okay. And then you talked about V-5 showing significant strength, I think, you said in the third quarter. Can you just talk about what end market you see that strength coming from?", "Jon Olson", "I think primarily that will be the Communications and Aerospace and Defense will be the two areas that that will be the strongest in for us.", "Glen Yeung - Citi ", "Okay. And on the same vein, you also talk about Comm being strong exiting the June quarter. Maybe clarify what end market that was coming from?", "Jon Olson", "I don\u2019t know that I want to get that granular. We did say overall Networking was very strong for us, so I think that gives you a pretty good indication of where it came from.", "Glen Yeung - Citi ", "Fair enough. Last question, Jon; thinking about calendar Q4, Altera was able to say that they felt like that Q4 would be above seasonal based on what they are seeing today. I wonder as you look into your calendar Q4 if you get the sense that above seasonal is a reasonable expectation?", "Jon Olson", "I think it\u2019s too early for us to tell whether it\u2019s really going to be above seasonal or not. We feel pretty good about the growth in the fourth quarter. Our historic patterns indicate that that\u2019s typically a pretty good quarter for us, although there are a couple of outlier data points for us. ", "The strength typically been some in Communications, but a great deal in the Industrial and Other category, specifically Aerospace and Defense as the budget patterns of the government give them new money and that\u2019s a usually a pretty big quarter, and most of those customers are saying good things to us, but until they actually get the money you never know for sure.", "Glen Yeung - Citi ", "All right. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely - JPMorgan.", "Christopher Danely - JPMorgan ", "Moshe, in the beginning spiel, you mentioned horizontal and vertical platforms in terms of the different products we could see. Are you going to change your product portfolio? Are you going to have new products? Are you going to subtract some products? Are you going to start doing modules? Can you just expand upon that statement, please?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "At relatively high levels, if you examine what has happened in the FPGA world over the past ten years, primarily, in the past it was used for glue-gobbling, and there\u2019s been a huge transition. Today, due to a variety of elements in a larger and larger number of applications FPGAs are now an important and central part of the system. ", "That\u2019s driven by what you can achieve with an FPGA today, and it\u2019s also being driven by the economics which are very difficult for justifying ASICs and even standard products for everything except the highest end applications.", "Now, as you look at that general transition, the complexity of the product is significantly growing, and the complexity has numerous aspects to it. So, whereas in the past things were driven primarily just by having the highest performance and the largest capacity as you branch into more and more applications then there are other elements that are important. ", "The IP portfolio has become quickly important, and then, integrating all of these things together becomes important.", "So, what you will see from Xilinx is a very strong focus on all of these aspects; performance, cost, capacity and power is becoming increasingly important. Then the IP and the existence of a platform which enables a broader solution are becoming more important, and we break those platforms into two kinds. ", "There\u2019s the more horizontal oriented that service numerous applications, and the vertical ones, which are more specific to certain markets. What you\u2019ll see from us \u2212 and we\u2019ve made huge strides, we just need to hone our strategy and to implement and deliver \u2212 is a much more focused element in terms of providing these platforms and they will be driven by where we believe there is the highest return.", "It will also enable us to scale in terms of addressing our customers. One of the blessings we have is the thousands and thousands and thousands of customers having a platform based solution, actually, will enable us to address them efficiently, and it will reduce the onus of design that they need to bear, and it\u2019ll reduce the support costs that we have. ", "This is becoming a multi-parametered solution, and it\u2019s indicative of an industry which is transitioning from providing a peripheral solution to being the center part of our customers\u2019 applications.", "Christopher Danely - JPMorgan ", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Dryden - Charter Equity.", "John Dryden - Charter Equity ", "", "Thanks for taking my question. Jon, can you walk through the accelerated cash receipts in the quarter? Should we look for this to continue or was there a dynamic late in the period that allowed to you bring in the accounts receivable?", "Jon Olson", "The issue is really around if you look at the calendarization of when revenue came in the last quarter versus this quarter. In March there was a lot of business in at the end of the quarter; April and May being more linear than January and February. ", "More of the shipments to our distributors who still are our primary conduit to the customer came in a way that the timing of when the billings went out, more cash came in. So that was point one.", "Point two is, as we got to the end of the quarter, the primary distributor Avnet\u2019s year-end was at the end of this last quarter and they, I think, were also taking fewer shipments leaning out their inventory during that time period. Their shipments, they took more front-end loaded as well, would be my estimation.", "The net answer to your question is, no, this is not a repeatable item every quarter. It was really the confluence of two things going on at the same time and that drove our days sales outstanding to being actually lower than what I would think the typical average range is which would more be in the 40s.", "John Dryden - Charter Equity ", "Thanks for taking my question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Wu - Global Crown Capital.", "David Wu - Global Crown Capital ", "", "I have a question and clarification. The clarification is on the last quarter your Asia Pacific was 32% of revenue. I assume that China is a big chunk of that 32%. Am I correct?", "The other one I have is about your gross margin. Both you and your competitor have very excellent gross margins on 90- and 65-nanometer and I was wondering, given how careful the guys in Taiwan have been expanding their capacity, can that good cost reduction or yield improvement continue at the 40- to 45-nanometer node?", "Jon Olson", "To answer your first question, yes, China is a very significant part of our Asia Pacific business. We don\u2019t really quote the precise percentage but it is a very significant portion so you can assume that to be true.", "And then relative to overall foundry capacity, pricing, et cetera, that certainly is a current question and always an interesting one to understand. To me the yield improvement is not necessarily correlated to what the wafer pricing situation might be going forward. ", "I think it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest to have the yield be as best as it possibly can, and we work very closely with our partners to work on yield improvements. I think going forward yield improvement programs are going to be extremely important and at the cost of a 40-, 45-nanometer wafer due to the investment to develop the technology, I think it\u2019s going to be increasingly important for us to keep on the path that we\u2019ve been on and so we are going to try very hard to do that.", "Relative to the overall capacity out there in the foundry, we work very closely with our foundry partners to make sure that there are enough wafers available for us through long-range forecasts and long-range pricing discussions with them and our experience over the last couple of years, that\u2019s certainly been quite good with both of our primary foundries in that area and we continue to work that issue to make sure that we get all the wafers that we need. ", "But we look at the same charts everybody else does and we certainly talk to them and understand as we go through our due diligence on foundries to understand who is going to be making the investments that allow us to stay on the leading edge of the nodes as we typically are for our industry.", "David Wu - Global Crown Capital ", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Wong - Wachovia.", "David Wong - Wachovia ", "", "Thank you very much. Am I right in assuming that Virtex-5 sells primarily into communications applications, and if so roughly what percentage of Comms is Virtex-5 at the moment?", "Jon Olson", "That isn\u2019t a good assumption, David. Virtex-5 is sold into the Comms market and it is a very important market, but Virtex-5 is also extremely important to the Industrial and Other category and in the surveillance area, for example, there are quite a few applications that it\u2019s used in and, no, we don\u2019t break out our Virtex-5 content within Communications.", "David Wong - Wachovia ", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Uche Orji - UBS.", "Uche Orji - UBS ", "", "Just a follow up on David\u2019s question. So how much percentage of sales was Virtex-5, please?", "Jon Olson", "No, we are not providing that information. We were pleased with where we are in Virtex-5 in the life of its product lifecycle. We did have double-digit unit growth this quarter and some ASP decline as prototyping moved off to more mainstream kinds of activities.", "Uche Orji - UBS ", "Okay. And just very quickly on the next-gen network and deployment in Japan. What kind of growth should we expect in the back half of 2008?", "Jon Olson", "I don\u2019t think we have any forecast on that level of specificity for NGN quite frankly, Uche.", "Uche Orji - UBS ", "Any kind of metrics you can give us in terms of where they are in terms of deployment just for us to gauge the level of enthusiasm that you feel about this in the near future? You don\u2019t have to give me a number; just anything qualitative that helps me understand how this will be a driver in the second half.", "Jon Olson", "I don\u2019t have that information right now. I don\u2019t have anything. I have to see if we published anything out there. But I don\u2019t have the data in front of me. I would answer the question as best as I can if I had the data but I don\u2019t have the data in front of me.", "Uche Orji - UBS ", "All right. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch.", "Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch ", "Thank you, Jon. Just a follow up to your OpEx question. You just announced a 7% restructuring and if I look at your guidance for $180 million it\u2019s only slightly below the $185 million you did in Q4. Where you are spending this incremental savings that you are achieving from the restructuring?", "Jon Olson", "One of the things that occurred in the July quarter because we\u2019re talking about our forecast going forward, is our annual salary planning and focal process of the company. So you are seeing some impact and offset from the benefit that you\u2019ve calculated there from the RIF. ", "As I said before, we are going to continue to work on cost reduction activities that will help over the rest of the year help offset that impact and get us into this 2 to 3% improvement of OpEx as a percent of revenue by the time we exit the year.", "Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch ", "Is it very much a function of higher sales, Jon, or do you see any opportunities or do you see absolute numbers going forward?", "Jon Olson", "We do think our sales in the second half of the year will increase even though if you look at our comparative numbers from last year, this quarter was, year-over-year, 9% ahead. And if you look at our guidance, we will be somewhere in that same neighborhood. ", "Year-over-year, we\u2019re looking pretty good. And we do believe that there will be growth in the second half of the year and it will be seasonal for us. We do believe there will be some revenue growth. But we also are going to follow-up on the spending actions that we\u2019ve talked about and we should get some benefit from that as well.", "Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch ", "If I compare your target model versus Altera\u2019s, they are talking about 15% on the SG&A line and you are saying 17%. I\u2019m just wondering if there is any structural difference between you and them that you need to have 17% in SG&A. Thank you.", "Jon Olson", "I can\u2019t comment on their model and how they are structured. I don\u2019t have much visibility into that. The way we think about SG&A, the sales and marketing effort, we want to make sure that there\u2019s the appropriate level of technical resource to be able to work with our customers in order to develop the platforms and solutions that are important to them from a sales support perspective. ", "I think we\u2019ve demonstrated that that kind of support in the field has helped lead us with our technology to a higher sales pattern than any of our competitors. So we believe that is a source of strength in the company.", "At the same time, we are very understanding of transactional based part of SG&A and we need to improve systems, reduce costs broadly across the company and those are some of the things that I talked about in the analyst meeting that we are working on. ", "Since we are from a position where we are much closer to 19% going to 17%, I\u2019d like to get to us 17% before I start thinking about 15%. You\u2019ll have to ask Altera about their structure and what they are doing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities.", "Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities ", "I had a question for Moshe or Jon; one of the things you talked about is your design wins at 65-nanometers, 90% of the design wins. And then clearly, you were earlier than Altera at 90-nanometers too. ", "I\u2019m a little curious as to why Communications, which is a segment where I would think you would see these leading design wins ramp into volume first, is a segment where you actually lag your competition, at least in recent quarters.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "It\u2019s 42% of our business. Keeping it in that general range it has been growing and has been stable at that level; has been driven undoubtedly by Virtex-4 and Virtex-5 and the wins there are the ones which are keeping it at that level, as we are expanding and diversifying into other areas. ", "I think that is what is driving it and it\u2019s a good and highly profitable business for us servicing those key customers in that area with our leading technology.", "What we have seen which has provided a little bit of downward pressure on that business is there has been a lot of consolidation in that area and as that consolidation has happened and a lot of those key customers have merged and reviewed their product portfolios and that has generated some pressure, there are less players in that market but the ones that are still around, best we can tell are using our 65- and 90-nanometer with vengeance.", "Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities ", "If I could just follow-up on that. I\u2019m not sure I quite understand because that end-market dynamic is witnessed by both you and your competition. Your customer base isn\u2019t dramatically different from what I know. ", "What I\u2019m not able to reconcile easily is your commentary on how well your design wins are doing; the Virtex-5 family was released in mid 2006 and the fact that in reality your Comm business has been stagnant, and Altera has had a couple of squishy quarters here and there, but in aggregate their growth has been much better. ", "Maybe there\u2019s an easy explanation for this. I\u2019m not able to find it.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "The 65-nanometer, at this point, the designs are transitioning from prototyping into volume production. So typically when you look at when we see the sweet spots in terms of revenues, it\u2019s at a minimum three years and more typically four years after the product introduction. ", "You are just seeing the beginning on Virtex-5. Definitely Virtex-4 is at that point now and actually has been growing rapidly recently. Virtex-5 is ahead of us in terms of its huge contribution to growth. ", "I think you are only seeing half of the story; you are seeing the half which is driven by Virtex-4. You are yet to see what will be driven by Virtex-5 in terms of revenue expansion.", "Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities ", "Is it fair to say then that they are doing better at 90-nanometers within the Comm segment?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "I really don\u2019t have access to their numbers and I also make it a policy not to say anything bad about them because I think they are a fine company. But, I think from what I\u2019ve heard they have done really well at the 130-nanometer in comparison, but since I don\u2019t have their numbers in front of me, I can\u2019t quite answer that question.", "Jon Olson", "We\u2019re trying to parse out that some of the information that came out yesterday from Altera in that area, and as best as we can tell, our Virtex-4 increase was double their 90-nanometer product in terms of dollars, and we increased our share on the 90-nanometer basis at the high-end. Forgetting about the end market applications, because I think that\u2019s much harder to understand that. ", "As we said, we are very happy with where we are in the 65-nanometer node, but on the 130-, I think it\u2019s a different story, and I think that\u2019s where they talked about some of their strength. But again I\u2019m only going by what we can parse together from some of their percentage growth information that they provided.", "Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities ", "The target gross margin for September is 63 to 64%, and of course your new range is 63 to 65%. You\u2019re bumping-up against the top end of the old range. Is it going to be a fairly linear progression you think to that 65% mark, or is it going to happen in one or two quarters all of a sudden?", "Jon Olson", "No, I think mix plays a big factor into what happens in our gross margin area, and I think if you think about this quarter versus next quarter and you think about overall flat revenues, you can feel like what\u2019s really going to go on with margin it\u2019s not going to be a great advancement. ", "As the mix changes and you think about the second half of the year where we have been typically stronger in Industrial and Other and higher margin products that might indicate that maybe there will start to be a more trend up. ", "Linear, on our target forecast, whether it\u2019s linear or not, I think we will have an upward slope as we go forward throughout our fiscal year.", "Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities ", "Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Randy Abrams - Credit Suisse.", "Randy Abrams - Credit Suisse ", "I want to see if you can comment on the inventory. It\u2019s been coming down pretty steadily the last six quarters and stable this quarter, but want to see if you need to build in a little bit more buffer given the lower CapEx trends you are seeing at the foundries and now do you need to see that trend back up a bit?", "Jon Olson", "Yes, actually I think you would have typically seen in at least more modern times our inventory lean out a little bit going into the summer where we typically have it flat and you saw it go up a little bit. ", "We do look at the foundry forecast about their capacity and utilization out in time two or three quarters ahead and we do have certain kinds of relationships that allow us to do some build aheads in order to make sure we have the right inventory at the right time. ", "When I spoke earlier and made comments about our working with the foundries very closely on making sure we had enough wafers at the right time, all of that\u2019s part of our overall horizon planning we do with our foundry partners. ", "We put all the things that you mentioned and more things into the hopper and understand what we need. So I think we are pretty well positioned for any potential upsides or even some shortages, if they would happen to occur later on this year.", "Randy Abrams - Credit Suisse ", "Okay. And if I could fit in a quick question, the prototyping, you mentioned it dropped off after a strong March. Are you back to historical rates or does that still need to come off a little bit?", "Jon Olson", "The prototyping comment was specifically around Wireless; generally prototyping was not off. It was just in that one particular sub-segment going on. No, I think there are still lots of prototyping in the hopper particularly in advanced communications designs ahead of us. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s backing off.", "Randy Abrams - Credit Suisse ", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Bouchard - Piper Jaffray.", "Ryan Bouchard - Piper Jaffray ", "This is Ryan calling in for Gary Mobley. Most of the questions have been answered, but I had a question about lead times. You just mentioned special agreements with your foundries but absent those special agreements would you characterize what would otherwise be normal lead times? What\u2019s happening currently versus maybe how the environment was maybe three months ago?", "Jon Olson", "Our lead times to our customers, which is what I know the most about, haven\u2019t changed. Still most of them are four weeks or less. And at this point I don\u2019t see any signs that that\u2019s going to change relative to our supply chain. Again, there\u2019s been nothing abnormal going on in the supply chain with respect to lead times.", "Ryan Bouchard - Piper Jaffray ", "Okay.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra - Robert Baird.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert Baird ", "Looking at Virtex-4, it looks as if there\u2019s momentum again after a couple of quarters where revenue was stable and Virtex-4 seems to now exceed Virtex-II Pro in terms of peak run rate. How much long longer does the trend continue and when should we expect the peak in revenues for Virtex-4, as Virtex-5 is now ramping and meaningful as a percentage of revenues?", "Jon Olson", "Describing exactly what quarter the peak is going to be in is a difficult thing to do, but we certainly are in the time period where we would be getting closer to the peak, sometime in the next several quarters, and clearly as V-5 designs start to kick in there won\u2019t be as many V-4 designs and that\u2019s how all that works and then you get the peak in the profile. ", "We did have a very good quarter in V-4. I don\u2019t know that this was the peak quarter or not, we\u2019ll have to see, but years from introduction we\u2019re in that ballpark for the peak.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert Baird ", "Okay. You mentioned on the call that it looked as if disti resales were slowing down a bit in North America. Are you seeing similar trends outside of North America so far?", "Jon Olson", "I\u2019m not seeing any consistent pattern. In any given quarter we might have had one of them up or one of them down. But then looking forward our forecast will be strong. I think the only pattern I can see anywhere has been just generally in North America, we\u2019ve had several quarters of, I\u2019ll say, small declines or drifting down in our smaller customers.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert Baird ", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ruben Roy - Pacific Crest Securities.", "Ruben Roy - Pacific Crest Securities ", "", "Jon, I think you mentioned Spartan as a group was up 3% for the quarter. Can you break out Spartan-3 and just give us an idea of how that did this quarter?", "Jon Olson", "The entire Spartan-3 family was up not quite double digits.", "Ruben Roy - Pacific Crest Securities ", "Okay. Then in terms of Telco, can you give us the split between the three major segments there; Wireless, Wireline and Networking?", "Jon Olson", "I know we used to publish information in those splits and we haven\u2019t actually done much of that anymore. I would say that Wireless is somewhere in the 20-, 25-ish percent and Networking is probably about 40%; maybe 30% in Telecom, in round numbers.", "Ruben Roy - Pacific Crest Securities ", "Okay. Then the last one Jon, I think you mentioned that we might be able to look forward to a 40-nanometer announcement towards the ends of this fiscal year, is that correct?", "Jon Olson", "Yes.", "Ruben Roy - Pacific Crest Securities ", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Operator", "It appears that there are no further questions. Do you have any closing remarks?", "Maria Quillard", "Thank you all for joining us today. We have a playback of this call beginning at 5:00 PM Pacific, 8:00 PM Eastern.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Lori Owen. ", "Lori Owen", "Good afternoon everyone. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the September quarter then we will open the call for questions.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially.", "We refer you to the documents that the company files with the SEC including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. ", "Now let me turn the call over to Jon Olson.", "Jon Olson", "Thank you Lori, during today\u2019s commentary I will review our business results for the September quarter, I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the December quarter. ", "Revenues in the September quarter of $483.5 million were down 1% sequentially from the prior quarter and up 9% from the same quarter of the prior year. The quarter played out pretty much as expected. The month of July was strong from a bookings perspective, August weak, and September was good.", "Gross margin of 63.3% was in line with our guidance of 63% to 64% but slightly then gross margin last quarter due primarily to higher then anticipated growth from Virtex-5 which had slightly lower then corporate gross margins as well as customer mix which was weighted more heavily towards high volume customers.", "Operating margins of 25.8% was the highest we have reported in nearly three years. Operating income of $124.6 million included $2.5 million in restructuring charges which was slightly more then we had anticipated. ", "September quarter operating income was up 16% sequentially and up 32% year-over-year. Combined R&D and SG&A expense was down 3% sequentially and represented 36.7% of sales, down from 37.6% of sales in the prior quarter.", "We continue to make progress in controlling expenses. In the same period a year ago combined R&D and SG&A expense accounted for 40.1% of sales. We will continue to work towards meeting our corporate targets.", "Other income in the September quarter was $8.5 million, more then $5 million forecasted due to realized gains from our investment portfolio. On the other hand we also recorded a $29 million pre-tax impairment charge on investments during the quarter primarily related to losses on certain cash portfolio investments in the financial sector. ", "The resulting cash loss impact from these impairments is not known at this time but could likely be less then the accounting charge. We continue to maintain very conservative investment guidelines designed to mitigate credit risk by limited investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and diversifying risks across geographies and type of issuer.", "Additionally we have continued to reduce our exposure to financial institutions and have moved more defensively to government and agency securities. September quarter net income was $81.8 million or $0.29 per diluted share including the previously discussed restructuring and impairment charges. ", "Collectively these charges represented approximately $0.09 per diluted share reduction after tax. Operating cash flow for the September quarter was $95 million before $12 million in CapEx. The decrease from last quarter was primarily due to severance and related payments, convertible bond debt interest payment, and a backend loaded shipment profile. ", "In the first six months of our fiscal year we generated $253 million in operating cash flow. We repurchased 4.9 million shares for $125 million during the quarter and paid $39 million in dividends. Lastly the tax rate for the September quarter was 21.4%. ", "Let me now comment on the balance sheet, cash and investments decreased $73 million during the quarter to $1.8 billion. Factoring in the $1 billion convertible, our net cash position is approximately $800 million. Day sales outstanding increased six days in the September quarter to 44 days. ", "Inventory dollars at Xilinx increased by $1 million sequentially in the September quarter representing 73 days. This is up slightly from 72 days in the prior quarter and up from 69 days in the same quarter a year ago.", "Worldwide distributors held 20 days in the September quarter which was down from 21 days in the prior quarter and down from 23 days held in the same quarter a year ago. Combined inventory days in the September quarter were 93 days which was flat with the prior quarter and well within our target of 90 to 100 days. ", "New product sales increased 5% sequentially driven by strong Virtex-5, Spartan-3E and 3A sales but offset by Virtex-4 sales which declined as expected after a strong June quarter. ", "Mainstream and base products experienced sequential declines of 6% and 1% respectively. North America sales were down 6% sequentially, more then anticipated due to declines in networking and defense. European sales were up 2% sequentially, stronger then expected due primarily to increases in both wire line and wireless communications.", "Asia Pacific sales were up 1% sequentially driven by strong sales to wireless customers, but offset by declines in nearly every other end market segment. Japan was our strongest region during the quarter with sales increasing 5% sequentially due primarily from strength from customer, consumer and industrial and other applications.", "From an end market perspective communication sales increased 2% sequentially in the September quarter, representing 43% of total sales up from 42% in the prior quarter. Sales to customers in the wireless space were particularly strong during the quarter driven primarily by next generation wireless activity in China. ", "Wireless sales strength more then offset wire line sales which were weak in all geographies but Europe. Industrial and other sales were down 6% sequentially representing 32% of total sales down from 33% in the prior quarter. ", "The sales decline in this sector was primary attributable to lower sales to customers to defense and industrial, scientific, and medical sectors. The consumer and automotive sector was our strongest end market in the quarter increasing 6% sequentially and representing 17% of total sales up from 16% in the prior quarter.", "Sales growth was driven by customers in the audio video broadcast and pure consumer sectors. The data processing sector declined 8% sequentially representing 8% of sales, down from 9% in the prior quarter. The decline in this category was driven by weakness in both the storage and computing and data processing categories. ", "Let me now turn to guidance for the December quarter of fiscal 2009, we enter the quarter with increased backlog and sales have been relatively good in the first couple of weeks. Over the past five years sequential sales growth in the December quarter has averaged about 4%.", "We remain concerned over the macroeconomic situation, however we are expecting Virtex-5 to have another strong quarter and we are also expecting to see strength from wireless and defense end markets.", "As a result we are forecasting sales to be up 2% sequentially to down 2% sequentially, slightly lower then seasonal. The mid point of this guidance requires a turns percentage of approximately 56%, down from 59% in the September quarter.", "Based on backlog analysis and customer feedback we are anticipating sales from Asia Pacific to be up sequentially and sales from Europe, US and Japan to be flat to down sequentially in the December quarter.", "From an end markets perspective we expect communications to be flat as wireless gains are offset by wire line decline. We expect industrial and other to be flattish as sales to defense customers are offset by declines in test and measurement and medical.", "And consumer and automotive to be up driven by audio video broadcast. We expect sales from data processing to be down sequentially. ", "Gross margin is expected to be approximately 63% to 64%. Combined operating expenses including $1.4 million of amortization are expected to be approximately $180 million down slightly from the September quarter. ", "Other income including the impact of interest expense is expected to be approximately $3 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 276 million shares. Our tax rate for the remainder of fiscal 2009 is expected to be 21% inclusive of the R&D tax credit.", "The December quarter tax rate will be approximately 18% which includes a catch-up benefit of approximately $3 million. ", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you Jon and good afternoon to you all. In a difficult macroeconomic environment we are gratified with this quarter\u2019s significant accomplishments. Sales for the September quarter were up 9% versus the same quarter last year.", "In addition sales for the first half of fiscal 2009 were similarly up 9% compared to the first half of fiscal 2008. I am particularly pleased with our operating margin which continued to show significant improvement reaching nearly 26% for the September quarter; the highest we have reported in nearly three years.", "Jon and I remain very much committed to continuing to improve operating margin through a combination of increased focus and tight spending controls. ", "Moving along to a discussion of our products, the most important highlight of the quarter was the Virtex-5 sales growth which increased over 40% sequentially surpassing 10% of total sales. Virtex-5 strength during the quarter was broad based with wireless activity in China particularly strong. ", " ", "Based on our current design win activity and the comprehensive breadth of this product offering in the market we currently expect the Virtex-5 product to grow to be the largest Virtex family in our history in terms of sales. ", "During the September quarter Xilinx began shipping two new Virtex-5 devices; the SX240T, the FX200T, and announced the new Virtex-5 TXT FPGA platform.

It sounds like you were saying that the first few weeks of the quarter had got off to a fairly steady start. Is that correct? Perhaps you could just clarify what you believe your backlog did directionally, whether it was up or down in the quarter and with respect to the wireless business in particular it sounds like it was strong last quarter and it\u2019s guided up again in the coming quarter. Is that just Chinese TD [inaudible] that is providing the incremental list and how do you see that flowing as you look into the beginning of 2009?", "Jon Olson", "We entered the quarter with a stronger backlog then we entered the previous quarter so that\u2019s point one and we\u2019ve had a couple of pretty solid weeks of turns in the first couple of weeks of the quarter as well.

So if you just use those data points solely, you\u2019d say wow things are clicking on all cylinders and things are going really well.", "However in trying to reach out over the last two weeks to understand more current information from our customers, there\u2019s a lot of confusion out there of what\u2019s really happening. We have had some customers in the communication space that have signaled to us that they\u2019re going to cut their builds.", "We\u2019ve had others who have said absolutely no, I\u2019m set. I think I\u2019m going to take all those products this quarter so there\u2019s a lot of mixed signals going on and certainly erring more on the fact that people are saying things are okay then the ones that say they\u2019re concerned. ", "So we\u2019ve seen pockets of communications that have backed off and pockets in test and measurement that have backed off from us in terms of saying we\u2019re uncertain about the future. So as a result of that, that\u2019s why we took the position we did in terms of our guidance is going below seasonal and reducing our backlog, our turns required to hit our number is a fallout of that to take the posture that we are, its not clear what\u2019s going to happen on the macro environment as we unfold through the quarter. ", "Then you asked a question around wireless and what we see in wireless and yes we had a very strong quarter this last quarter driven largely by Asia Pacific and we do expect a good quarter. We have orders on the books so its not one of those things that we\u2019re looking at and saying there\u2019s promises coming, we\u2019re starting out strong in the wireless space. It is again primarily Asia Pacific and China specifically but it\u2019s also India.", "So the rollouts that are happening or the builds that are happening are really four rollouts that in the Asia Pacific region regardless of which geography happens to be building their customers is headquartered at that we\u2019re addressing with those products.

What we are seeing is a broadening of the set of applications we address to go well beyond communications and this is medical, automotive, high end consumer, military, etc. and to some extent as you go and see all of these customers you get a very strong positive feeling that as they\u2019re transitioning away from ASIC and to some extent away from standard products, to FPGAs there is some comfort in that broadening of the market and which enables us to service more and more applications, which to be honest just don\u2019t have any alternatives.

There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty out there. We certainly considered the situation, what happens if things get weaker at the top line but quite frankly we\u2019re very committed to these goals that we set out about 30% operating margin, etc. ", "Those are our medium and long-term goals and I want to be really careful about how we attack what could or might or might not be a short-term [inaudible] in the top line. So I think first you have to access whether the top line impact is going to be a long-term or a short-term impact before we go in and start doing major surgery on anything we\u2019re doing in OpEx. ", "Its really important to us to keep our portfolio and engineering direction in tact under as many circumstances as is possible because there\u2019s a real opportunity for us out there in these kinds of environment with customers that are choosing ASICs in particular to convert them over to FPGAs in these not very good economic times as they are trying to find ways to cut spending. ", "It probably wouldn\u2019t be in the best long-term interest of our shareholders to just go whacking away on our engineering spending quite frankly. But having said that if the top line gets weaker we are definitely going to look at every opportunity in OpEx and we would probably constrain certain kinds of non-critical items outside of engineering as a result again depending on the severity of the weakness and our estimate of the longevity of the weakness. It\u2019s not a straight forward answer, but it\u2019s also a very difficult question to assess unless you go through and pick a bunch of different kinds of alternatives along the way. ", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs", "Do you think you could keep OpEx flat at current levels?", "Jon Olson", "Again, it\u2019s really situational.

It\u2019s not really horrible but it is relatively softer then the rest of our overall business would indicate. So and that has shown up in the North America primarily. Other geographies really not so much and we\u2019ve been able to at least match any of those declines with sales from our larger customers which are more direct in nature.

And Jon if we have calendar 2009 let\u2019s say the revenues for the full year looks like its going to be down double-digit year to year, what would you do to your operating expenses?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "We have a very big investment in the software world and we actually are continuing to invest heavily. It is true that as the devices are getting a lot more complicated and we typically have the lion share of the largest complexity devices just due to our market position and technology superiority that that\u2019s where the software runs into the most challenges in terms of capacity and routing and turn around time and ease of use and the whole host of abilities, from my perspective its an opportunity. ", "Coming from the EDA world where I spent 10 years prior to joining Xilinx there\u2019s a whole host of issues that need to be addressed as you move from implementing systems in ASIC and standard products to FPGAs and what we intend to do as a strategy is to provide a set of a very comprehensive capabilities. However it is my very strong belief that there\u2019s great opportunity for the EDA companies to continue to provide solutions primarily at the front end on the design creation side and what we are doing as a strategy is making sure that we have an approach that enables our customers to do the best implementation using the internal tools and to the extent that they can benefit from these external tools from third parties and the major EDA companies they will use those.", "I think coming from the EDA world this transition and the rapid reduction in the number of ASIC and the number of standard product that is being designed is forcing those EDA companies to move more and more of their development dollars to products which are front end oriented which will be relevant for the programmable world and if you look at Synopsis for example, the recent acquisition that they made of Simplicity is a good example of that. ", "We work with them as partners and in addition to the tools we provide we enable these tools from these third parties and that will continue to be our strategy going forward.", "Jon Olson", "I suppose if I knew it was going to be double-digit going into the year I might have a slightly different approach to it but you typically don\u2019t know those things all the time but there\u2019s no doubt that we would do things to pare back spending if things started to slip away in that  particular way. We would however though; we would try to protect our current development portfolio of getting our next generation products out. That\u2019s very important for us to do that. We may or may not decide to slip the calendarization of certain of those devices in order to try to make the P&L improve without significantly impacting our customers.", "So there\u2019s a lot of factors that would go into it. We are committed to delivering operating margins and we would do what we think was prudent to pare back what we could pare back in order to have an acceptable level of operating margins. ", "", "Operator", "There are no additional questions at this time; I would like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing comments.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)", "I would now like to turn the call over to Maria Quillard. Thank you, Ms. Quillard; you may begin your conference.", "Maria Quillard", "Thank you and good afternoon. With me today are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the December quarter then we will open the call for questions.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially.", "We refer you to the documents that the company files with the SEC including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.", "This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.", "Now let me turn the call over to Jon Olson.", "Jon Olson", "Thank you, Maria. During today\u2019s commentary, I will review our business results for the December quarter. I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the March quarter.", "Revenues in the December quarter of $458.4 million were down 5% sequentially from the prior quarter and down 3% from the same quarter of the prior year. The months of October and November were in line with our original guidance of approximately flat sales. In the month of December, however, we experienced appreciable weakness in sales across a broad base of end markets resulting in our guidance revision on December 16th. ", "Continued cost reduction efforts contributed to improved gross and operating margins during the quarter. Gross margin of 63.9% was up 60 basis points from last quarter and in line with our guidance of 63% to 64%. It was also the highest gross margin we have reported in four years.", "Combined R & D and SG&A expense was $173 million, lower than our revised guidance of $175 million to $177 million. As a result, operating margin improved to 26.1%, up from 25.8 % reported in the prior quarter and the highest we have reported in three years.", "Net income during the quarter was $139 million or $0.51 per diluted share and was impacted by a couple of factors. First, we spent $146 million in cash to repurchase $241 million face value of convertible debentures. This resulted in a pre-tax gain of $89.7 million or $0.24 per diluted share after-tax.", "This unique opportunity to improve long-term shareholder value presented itself due to the unsettled credit markets causing the overall convertible debt market to trade at deep discounts. In the short-term, we view this as an excellent way to leverage our strong cash position.", "We also recorded a pre-tax impairment charge on investments of $19.5 million or $0.05 per diluted share after-tax primarily related to losses on a certain cash portfolio investment in the financial sector. Almost all of this impairment was due to the write-off of the remainder of a cash investment partially impaired last quarter. The bankruptcy was resolved in a manner that will make it unlikely that we will receive any value from this investment. Collectively, the $89.7 million pre-tax gain and the $19.5 million pre-tax charge represented approximately $0.19 per diluted share gain after-tax.", "Operating cash flow for the December quarter was $128.5 million before $11 million in CapEx. As I mentioned earlier, we paid $146.3 million in cash during the quarter to repurchase $241.1 million of convertible debentures. We also paid $38.4 million in cash dividends. The tax rate was 26.3% higher than our forecast of 21%. The tax rate was heavily impacted by the gain on repurchase of the convertible debentures, which is taxed at US rates. Partially offsetting the increase in tax due to the re-purchase of the convertible debt was the impact of the reinstatement of the Federal R&D tax credit made effective during this fiscal quarter.", "Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash investments decreased $94 million during the quarter to $1.7 billion. We now have approximately $760 million in convertible debt on our balance sheet and our net cash position is approximately $920 million. Day sales outstanding decreased two days in December quarter to 42 days.", "Inventory dollars at Xilinx increased by $8 million sequentially in the December quarter representing 82 days. This is up from 73 days in the prior quarter and up from 69 days in the same quarter a year ago. Worldwide distributors held 17 days in the December quarter down from 20 days in the prior quarter. Combined inventory days in the December quarter were 99, up six days from the prior quarter, but within our target of 90 to 100 days.", "New product sales increased 2% sequentially driven by exceptionally strong Virtex-5 sales, which Moshe will discuss in more detail. Mainstream and base products experienced sequential declines of 9% and 17% respectively. Sales from all geographies declined sequentially during the quarter. North American sales were down 4% with the largest declines coming from wired communication and audio/video broadcast, but partially offset by an increase in defense sales.", "Asia Pacific sales were down 1% as strong sales from wireless communications was offset by weak sales in other end markets. European sales were down 12% in the quarter with all major end markets declining during the quarter. Sales from Japan were down 4% sequentially with gains from Consumer and Automotive partially offset by declines in other end Markets.", "In terms of our vertical markets, sales from wireless communications were up more than 10% sequentially to comprise 18% of overall revenues. Our wireless strength was virtually all related to China 3G infrastructure build. Wireless communication revenues from North America, Europe and Japan were all flat sequentially. Approximately 70% of our Asia Pacific revenues currently come from wired and wireless communication applications.", "Overall, wired Communications declined approximately 10% quarter-to-quarter. Wired communication revenue in North America, Europe and Japan were all down sequentially. Of the total communications revenue for Xilinx about 40% are currently wireless applications and 60% are wired telecom and networking applications.", "The other standout this quarter was our Defense and Aerospace business, which is part of our industrial and other category. Defense sales increased nearly 20% sequentially to comprise 15% of total revenues. While we are expecting defense to be seasonally weak in the March quarter, we still believe that Defense/Aerospace is our most recessionary proof end market. We have a good backlog in defense business for the next fiscal year and the US Department of Defense has already increased its budget for the September \u201808 to \u201809 year and we expect to see our Aerospace/Defense market grow year-over-year. Unfortunately, declines in the industrial, scientific and medical and test and measurement areas in December quarter offset the increases in defense, so the overall category was flat sequentially. All other end market segments, which include audio/video broadcast, automotive, consumer, computing and storage, declined quarter-to-quarter.", "Let me now turn to guidance for the March quarter of fiscal 2009. First, PLDs and Xilinx specifically appear to be laggard into the cyclical downturn due to our limited consumer exposure. As Xilinx business begins to feel the full impact of the recessionary times, we are entering the quarter with significantly reduced backlog.", "Forecasts for the most of our major end market customers suggested the band environment will remain weak in the March quarter with customers working through internal inventory levels. Defense sales are expected to be seasonally weak in the March quarter, as I mentioned earlier.", "Additionally, while 3G activity in China remains healthy in the long-term, we are expecting to experience a pause in the March quarter with sales picking up again in the June quarter for wide-band CDMA and GSM orders. As a result, we are forecasting sales to be down 15% to 25% sequentially with sales from all geographies and end Markets down sequentially.", "Because our visibility is so limited, we are providing a larger than normal range for our sales guidance. In light of the current economic conditions coupled with our wide guidance range, we have decided to provide a business update this quarter on March 3rd. We don't plan to reinstate the business update practice but if circumstances warrant, we will make an exception.", "Gross margin is expected to be approximately 61% to 63%. Combined operating expenses including $1.4 million of amortization are expected to be approximately flat to slightly down from the December quarter.", "Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $3 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 275 million shares. And the tax rate for Q4 of our fiscal 2009 will be 21%.", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. On a relative industry wide basis, Xilinx\u2019s performance was better than most in the December quarter, and expected to significantly outperform the vast majority of semiconductor companies, which are expected to be down over 20% on average. The 5% sequential decline beats our revised guidance on December 16th but was down 6% to 10%.", "In addition, shipments during the last two weeks of the quarter was slightly better than expected. Given our results, we expect to gain PLD market segment share. As we had projected strength from Defense and Wireless Infrastructure business in China, buffered softness in our other end markets.", "Our Virtex-5 momentum and leadership is the unequivocal bright spot this past quarter. Virtex-5 grew 35% quarter-to-quarter and that comprises approximately 15% of our total revenue. Virtex-5 sales should surpass Virtex-4 in terms of overall revenue next quarter to become the industry's largest revenue generating high-end FPGA family. We are very pleased with Virtex-5's strong sales growth and momentum, as several communications customers including China 3G customers, began broadly deploying it for their initial network rollouts. In the March ending quarter we are expecting this family to be flat to up modestly and it is well on its way to becoming a $100 million per quarter product line.", "Furthermore, as promised at our Analyst meeting last week -- last year, we are on track to rollout our next generation product road map later this quarter. In these tough economic times, we are committed to delivering on this road map. Fundamentally, we believe that this downturn provides long-term market expansion opportunities for Xilinx.", "In a recessionary periods as R & D budgets get capped, customers must do more with less. They need to reduce their risk profile. It's in order for them to succeed. They must continue to efficiently differentiate their products. All three of these trends underline the need for the cost effective flexibility, which is inherent to programable logic or what we at Xilinx call, the programable imperative.", "These trends, coupled with financial pressures, are hastening the competitive demise of ASIC Solutions for an increasing number of applications. In parallel, numerous mid to small volume standard product semi-companies used to target specialized niches will no longer be able to maintain competitive investment levels.", "Consequently I believe that as the economy recovers and Xilinx executes on its product road maps, we will come out of this economic downturn better positioned. That being said, both Jon and I are committed to tight spending control and maintaining financial discipline as we manage through this clearly challenging transition.", "Now let me turn the call back to the Operator to open it up for the Q & A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question will come from the line of Tim Luke.", "Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you so much. Jon, I was wondering if you could help us with some sense of what set of terms level may be required in looking at your guidance going forward, and separately, you mentioned in your comments that you expect the revenue in wireless and particularly from China to be sequentially lower this quarter and then perhaps improve in the June period and similarly in the military area, you suggested that having been weaker in March but in this full year you would expect some growth in military. Do those elements help you suggest that you would expect a flattish to slightly higher June or how should we think about that? Thank you very much.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Let me talk about the turns business, Tim. I got number a little bit Tim as well. So, yes, from a percentage basis, it's a little misleading because we do go into the quarter with a much weaker backlog than we normally would see even though we would might have entering January, normally a slightly weaker backlog, but this is substantially weaker. So, the turns number from a percentage basis is actually higher than we've been experiencing in the last few quarters and I\u2019d say more in the low 60's from a percentage basis, but that really doesn't tell the whole story. It's really the dollar value of the turns amount that we're expecting and we set our number at the mid point of our range at a level of turns that turns on a weekly basis that are less than $20 million a week, and we haven't experienced a quarterly run rate that low in the last four years.", "So again, on a dollar basis, I think we've adjusted our turns down into a reasonable number that helps us land in that range, albeit a wide range, but on a percentage basis the way the numbers work out the percentages is going to make it look goofy to some extent. Your second question around the wireless business and a little bit of lumpiness here, and then what's really happening, what that going to mean as we go beyond March and into June?", "Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers", "Yes.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "From a wireless perspective, we see, I want to characterize this correctly. We had a strong September in wireless and improved in December and it's not like it's all going to go away and revert back to the previous June. It's just going to decline, and that decline is really because the initial build out of the TD-SCDMA technology is happening and there is some installation time and those kinds of things that happen.", "As I think we've all seen the licenses have been left for some of the other 3G technologies and some of those suppliers that we have a good customers that we have of ours that we have a good position with, we believe will start to ramp some of that equipment in that time frame. It's really difficult right now to forecast, what June is going to be? Whether there's going to be some sort of an inventory snap back for a short time period or whether we're going to see our normal seasonal down in June. Typically, June is seasonally down for us a few percentage points, so I have a very difficult time picking, which way this is going to be, but that's pretty much how on the detailed part is how I see it.", "Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers", "Hey just if I could a follow-up, it sounds like you're guiding the OpEx flat. Is that how we should think about slightly lower, how should we think about the full year and then the gross margin, is it slightly lower range, how do you see that going forward?", "Jon Olson", "Yes, so the OpEx flat in the December quarter is really a product of a couple of different pressures on us. We had a pretty significant drop between September and December, an $8 million drop. And I think if you look back at our last several quarters, four or five quarters, you'll have seen a sequential drop in OpEx. This is a pretty big drop. There were a couple of one-time items that helped us out here. The currency situation gave us the benefit that isn't likely. It's possible to repeat itself, but isn't likely so that probably won't happen.", "On the other side, as Moshe mentioned, we're going to be announcing our new products, there are tape out expenses that are increasing and so when you balance all that out, being able to maintain it at that lower level, $8 million down from September I think is a pretty good accomplishment.", "Beyond that, we're not making any statements. We're in the process of going through our planning processes; our overall desire on R&D is to continue to deliver to the road map expectations, which will put pressure on R&D next year. It's a little too early to say exactly what we're going to do. We certainly would like to figure out a way to keep it flat, when you look at fiscal year to fiscal year we've got a little more work to do to be able to make that commitment.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Randy Abrams.", "Randy Abrams - Credit Suisse", "Yes, thank you. Actually I'd like to follow-up on that last question on gross margin, which you probably didn't get the chance to answer, but if you could talk about what's driving this sequential decline this next quarter and then if we should consider that range to be the continued range through 2009?", "Jon Olson", "Yes, and I didn't miss the question, Randy that Tim asked so let me address that. So, we set the range at 61 to 63, which is certainly down from our about 64% range and that's really driven by primarily by the significant revenue drop and the impact of what fixed costs we do have relative to labor that gets charged to cost of goods sold and any adjustment there. We are not planning on a gigantic mix shift that's driving it and it's really the drop in revenue.", "On an ongoing basis, beyond that, which is the next part of your question, what do we see revenue declines or improvement beyond the March quarter? It's really too early to tell. As I mentioned in my previous answer, I could actually see an inventory bounce back in June as people are work through inventory over the last four or five months starting from December forward, but then I can also see the seasonality kick in for us where we typically have weakness and typically in communications. So, we're not taking a position yet on next year and we gave a very wide range for the March estimate so as you can imagine, our visibility is pretty low right now with our major customers on what's going to happen.", "Randy Abrams - Credit Suisse", "And it looks like you had a good transaction with the debt this quarter. Maybe talk about if you have any other actions on the debt side or even just cash balance if you're right sized here.", "Jon Olson", "Yeah, so we did see this what we thought was a wonderful opportunity for us to claw back some of that debt at a very extreme discount that really I don't think the markets has seen in certainly recent history in that area, but we are taking each quarter, a quarter at a time.", "And as you can imagine, with a sequential revenue decline like we are talking about and not good visibility into the next quarter, with our cash generation capability, while it's still good, it won't be nearly as good as having a revenue number much higher. So we aren't necessarily going to be jumping in, in any of the debt of the stock buyback market. However, opportunistically if we see the right situation, we still might do that.", "Randy Abrams - Credit Suisse", "Okay, and maybe just to sweep in one last one. For the end markets, I think you mentioned all of them will be down. Maybe if you could put a range if any of them are tracking more severe than the average?", "Jon Olson", "I don't think so. I think the decline in wireless could be less severe than some of the other areas. When you start dissecting some of these pieces, let's just take Communications for a minute, Randy. The network infrastructure people by and large, we had anticipated what was going on there, we had good communications with those people before we gave our guidance for this past quarter, and there could be some declines there but not sequential declines, I don't think at the same percentage as we had between September and December. We do as we said; we stated we will have declines in the wireless space but again, probably around the average of what of the range or a little bit less than that.", "And then there's the pure Telecom play in that, that visibility has been very weak. It was very weak this quarter and it's hard to say what's going on there. Consumer will be weaker for us for sure. We've even though Consumer had some declines in the December quarter, the selling season for Christmas and Chinese New Years will be over. So that will also be weaker and what we've seen throughout our Channel and Industrial areas, everything just seems to be very, very weak. So it's hard to put a finer point on any other individual market other than two or three I was able to talk about.", "Randy Abrams - Credit Suisse", "Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Uche Orji.", "Uche Orji - UBS", "Thank you very much. My first question is for Moshe. First of all, congrats on the strength of Virtex-5, but I would like to understand how, when you rollout your road map, how you think you can close the design gap at 40 nanometers with Voltera, given the software has been out since most of 2008, is your software out already?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, we will be announcing our product roadmap with all of the elements and the entire breadth later this quarter. So I do not want to steal any of the thunder there, and it will enable us to compete in a very attractive way in our mind.", "Uche Orji - UBS", "Okay. Just as a follow-up, in terms of when you talk to your customers, has there been any significant shut down of design activity or is this just production dial down from customers there. I just want to understand from the perspective of your customers how they view this downturn. So what are you seeing in terms of design activity versus just production being cut back?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Intuitively, it appears that it is mostly a production as opposed to a design halt. And just generally, our experience on 30 years of upturns and downturns in the semiconductor industry is that, it takes much longer to get to shutting down on the design side. And in reality, I think since the 2001 downturn in particular, companies have been a lot more cautious with their investment on the design side. So no, I do not think they have gone crazy and hence I think there is less of an opportunity to cut things down.", "If you think about the previous downturn, it was after a huge surge in the late 90's on the design side, where those view it as a tremendous shortage in engineering talent and that just caused lots of companies to over-invest and in particular, they did that in anticipation of huge growth and the bubble that was happening.", "Those same trends have not been evident in the past few years, for companies have been watching their design investments very carefully and obviously, due to the lag between your design investment to when you actually go into production, it behooves them to continue to invest in design at this point in time.", "Uche Orji - UBS", "And just lastly for Jon. In terms of what you can do on the cost side below the gross margin, I'm sure you've answered that question exhaustively, but below the gross margin line, are there anymore levers you can pull in terms of taking OpEx down given the lower run rates for revenues. That's my last question, thank you.", "Jon Olson", "Hi Uche, we certainly are aware of the possibility that this could be a very long, deep recession and we have to make sure that we do everything we can to deliver the best numbers we can while keeping the shareholder value aspect of our business going. We were at this point in time; we do see a possibility of some opportunities. We've been going through our planning cycle. Our annual planning cycle typically happens this quarter as well as March fiscal year.", "We've kicked off a variety of that planning earlier this year and we're in the process of evaluating it. As I think we have said a couple of times here in different ways, we are going to protect our 40-45 nanometer road map activities throughout this downturn and we're going to look at all other opportunities and all other organizations in the company to cut back further.", "Uche Orji - UBS", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung.", "Glen Yeung - Citigroup", "Thanks, Jon, maybe just to follow-up on the last question. Is there something you need to see for you to take more aggressive actions? Is there some level of business, where you are going to say enough is enough and we just got to get aggressive here?", "Jon Olson", "I don't think it's really seeing anything else. I mean, I think it's while we want to be cautious to make sure that we aren't wrong about these kinds of things because taking any serious action that would affect anybody\u2019s job is a very serious thing to consider. But I think it\u2019s really more about the progression of what we\u2019ve been going through over the last year in terms of restructuring the company.", "We\u2019ve gotten ahead of some of this a little bit by doing some level of restructuring last spring and functionalizing the company, taking some dollars out. I think we\u2019ve done a reasonable job of achieving what we said we\u2019re going to do from that particular time period and now its kind of a looking a little more deeply at a few things, now that we\u2019ve got the basic structure of the company, the way we want, we\u2019d like to have it is.", "Okay, so now how can we get a lot more efficient and I\u2019ve talked about this in the past. One was taking out redundancy, the next step was about efficiency and that\u2019s the process we\u2019re going through now. We just don\u2019t want to be hasty because we don\u2019t want to start taking things out that we\u2019d regret and we want to do this in a very metered considerate approach. So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re waiting for any other signs or signals.", "Glen Yeung - Citigroup", "Okay, it makes sense. The other thing I want to ask you about is channel inventory and I have recognized that on a days\u2019 basis I think they were down quarter-on-quarter. But just your sense here as you talk to your distributors and you get sensibility to the end markets, where their level of comfort is, obviously they are still working down inventory, but what's your sense as to when they think they might be coming to an end there?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Yes, I think it's a reasonable question to talk about. If you look at the way our days profile worked out it's pretty clear that with our channel days being so low leaving the quarter, there was not a big anticipation of lots of shipments early in January. So, they didn't take anything early from us. So, we like to keep as much back in Xilinx as we can to be able to manage the customer base properly and as best as I can tell, there's still another quarter of working through the inventory settled out at our overall customer base and I would expect a lot of fits and starts and changes in peoples ordering patterns over this quarter as they work through those issues.", "Glen Yeung - Citigroup", "Okay. All right, thanks, Jon.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Schneider.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs", "Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. First of all, could you comment on, in the comp space what are customer inventories like and if you could separately comment on the wireline, wireless, and networking segments that would be great.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Yes, so let me take that one Jim. The networking piece, I think there was good anticipation by the customers there and I think they are in a position that to work off their inventory and started it much earlier. And I think this, if anything we're going to see some better business and build back Spring/Summer from them then we might experience from some of the others. So, I think they could be in a better overall position just based on what we've seen from some of the conversations we've had with them in the ordering patterns.", "The wireless space is really predicated on these big projects, and how they go through and, I think we feel pretty comfortable about the Chinese spending that will actually happen. And so, while there is quite a bit of inventory build up, and those customers as they get ready for their big push, I think it's all going to sell out, and I don't think we're going to have a big adjustment going on there. And the other, the telecom space and access in those places, I think anything that has that a touch back into the consumer is all up for grabs and I would suspect it may take longer in that particular space.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks. And then this as a follow-up; clearly visibility very limited, but can you speak to your non-military industrial business right now and what you think you're going to see there this year?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Yes, that right now is very weak, and for us it's typified by our mid-sized customers, mid to smaller size customers and I think generally it's been pretty weak. Test and Measurement has got really weak in the semi space and weakened elsewhere, as well. I think the scientific and medical, while it was weaker this quarter. I think there's an opportunity for us there downstream because there is still a big push for more mobile devices in that space, so I think those projects are probably still going to continue, but again, it was sequentially weak.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs", "Great and then just lastly, maybe you could share with us, Moshe, where do you think Virtex-5 revenues could get as a percentage of total by the end of this year, calendar \u201809?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, the percentage is tough for me to estimate but Virtex-5 basically has had for long periods of time a very strong leadership position and has accumulated a very large number of design wins and these design wins are now more or less three years since the product introduction, translating on mass to volume manufacturing. So I would expect Virtex-5, because it's on all of these new products and hitting sweet spot and it has the very strong market position to cross the $100 million and I would like for that to happen this calendar year. And I think that's doable.", "The question is what will happen with the non-Virtex-5, which have a different pattern and are later on in their maturity cycle, and that's the difficulty of pegging it as a percentage but I think Virtex-5 will continue to grow rapidly throughout this year.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Dryden.", "John Dryden - Charter Equity", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Could you go into what you believe is the bigger opportunity, both near and long-term, for market share expansion over your PLD competitor or increased sales of FPGA's over ASICs and ASSPs? I guess, has the interest for FPGA's increased each month of the quarter as the macros deteriorated?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Let me try and share my intuition, I had spent the whole year now at Xilinx and at least half of that time I had spent with customers and without exception in every geography, in every market, in every application, you can see that the customers are transitioning.", "Now, what is happening is that the finances required or the investment required to design an ASIC in an advanced process node and a standard product in advanced process node is in some cases approaching $100 million, which means that you need to sell a lot of these chips in order to just recover that investment. Fewer and fewer companies could afford to do that with the inherent risk involved and as a result we're seeing less ASICs started and actually less standard products being designed for niche applications.", "All of these trends help the programable world, as the programable world comes up with solutions, which can effectively address these. What I would call orphaned or abandoned applications and there are more and more of those. With each generation of technology we can cover more of these applications and the goal is to reduce the price and reduce the power and to come up with a tighter solution that addresses more of these applications and to make sure that we do it in a mode, which can be used for numerous markets, because if it's targeted at one niche market, we are in the same situation that the standard product companies are.", "So just generally speaking, I see this trend -- its imperative continuing to move in that direction. It definitely has moved there in anger on the ASIC side with a number of ASIC designs in particular in new technologies is just dwindling and the number of design teams is dropping. And I expected it to happen and it is happening to some extent in the standard product world and I think the first companies, which are going to have the biggest revelation there are the small and medium-sized companies who have typically focused on niches and their ability to come up with plans to address those niches and the financial investment will be beyond their capacity.", "And I think those companies will start focusing more on sunset environments, where they are looking at older technologies to try and address the needs and all of that helps us because we can afford to march forward. So generally, the [circular] trend is in our favor. We need to run like hell and to execute really well, but this is something I have heard consistently from all of our customers in a huge number of applications.", "John Dryden - Charter Equity", "And Jon, could you update us on Virtex-5 gross margin? Was that negatively impacted again this quarter or with the majority of these sales into the higher margin markets is V-5 now accretive to corporate margins?", "Jon Olson", "Virtex-5 is a little over two years from its existence and this is about the time that it would be clearly in the corporate margin range and then starting to improve from that so and we're certainly in that range and I would say the effect of increased sales is not in that particular product category is not a drag on our gross margin.", "John Dryden - Charter Equity", "Thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets", "Yes, thank you. A question if you can give us some comments on the impact you will see with what's happening with your communication equipment customers Nortel just filed for bankruptcy and one of the bigger customer, Alcatel-Lucent having problems, are we going to see a lot of platform consolidation and what will be the impact of the PLD?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, I mean with respect to that particular segment. In the last cycle that was focused more on communications, there was a huge shake out and business combinations and platform aggregations and things like that going on. And I think what you find just using wireless as an example, I think what you're finding is a lot more multipurpose, multi-band, multi-protocol line cards that they desire to get to right off the bat in order to lower costs and to manage their platform costs better.", "I think we see that, those kinds of requests from a broad set of those customers, but that being said there aren't very many of those manufacturers out there left and with the recent information about Nortel, while it could have some impact on our business, I think much of that business just floats to one of the other people if people don't stick with Nortel as a result. They are stronger, obviously on the wired side and that gets picked up by the other wired folks primarily.", "So, I guess it's possible, Alcatel-Lucent, I don't think they\u2019re on the edge of bankruptcy, but I'm not the guy to ask that question. So, I'm not really too concerned about their viability throughout this cycle quite frankly.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets", "Another question on operating margins, just want to reiterate you are still targeting to go to operating margins greater than 30%. If that's the case, why not use this downturn as an opportunity to be more aggressive on the expenses unless you think that you're going to grow much faster than what you had forecast?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, the operating margin target that we set for ourselves in the last Analyst Meeting over the next few years was 30%, and that didn't comprehend a significant recession or downturn, but it still remains our goal and our target. And sure, if there are longer term structural things that we can do that as opportunities present themselves in this kind of a situation. We'll go after those very aggressively.", "I think we probably would have gone after those things anyway despite that. But it isn't just a matter of, oh, let's just dial down the expenses, and life is better. We actually have to produce the products, serve our customers, get to the best technical solution. This is as much of a service business as it is selling silicon in order to be able to support our customers with some of these very complex solutions. So, we certainly don't want to enter the long term cash flow of the company by knee-jerking, and we want to do this in a more metered considered fashion.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets", "But do you have, I mean at this point with the current structure, do you have a revenue level in mind to get to the 30% operating margin?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "We've not reset a timeline because it's really difficult to tell that until we find the bottom of this recession and it's not clear we have found the bottom yet.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely.", "Chris Danely - JPMorgan", "Thanks. Hey Jon, you talked about your expectations for end markets in Q1. Can you give us a sense of your relative expectations for the end markets for I guess for 2009?", "Jon Olson", "I don't have the great crystal ball on this stuff, Chris, and I basically have to go with I think most of what I have been reading and hearing and try to apply it to where our markets are and what's going on. This certainly feels like we are not going to get to the bottom until the middle of the year and then it's not clear, in terms of I'll say maybe some inventory adjustments and bubbles along the way, but really get to the bottom until the middle of the year and then stability and maybe some growth back in the second half of \u201909, but that's certainly unclear at this point in time.", "I'm not anticipating us to keep slipping off quarter after quarter after quarter throughout the year, but this is definitely going to be a down year based on what I can tell and I don't think this is going to be a bounce back or any sort of we're not planning on some sort of Hail Mary saving fourth quarter or any of those kinds of things for us for next year.", "Chris Danely - JPMorgan", "I guess I was more interested in the end markets, I guess to paraphrase you it sounds like you believe the defense and military end market would be the strongest and then after that would be sort of 3G or China wireless, is that true and then which end markets would you be a little more concerned on for this year?", "Jon Olson", "Definitely defense and definitely what we see in the wireless space, so that would be a correct assumption. I would actually still suspect audio/video broadcast to not stay down and to come back because there is still a huge wave of digital broadcasting implementation that have to be done. So, I still think that's okay.", "I think Automotive eventually will maybe as a fourth level fourth level could come back a little bit more in the second half of the year and that's predicated by the depth of our new designs, not by, not necessarily by sheer volume but introduction of new models and new capabilities. I would not expect Consumer necessarily to come back for us and possibly Scientific and Medical as I pointed out before could come back, but everything else is going to be not great.", "Chris Danely - JPMorgan", "And then just to clarify, you said turns, or your expected turns to hit the middle of the guidance were low 60% this quarter and were they around the mid 50% last quarter?", "Jon Olson", "We were in the mid 50's last quarter and we said -- in the Q&A, I said in the low 60's but do not listen to the percentage because of the way the law of the way the numbers work, and we would prefer to think about this as what we need in dollar turns per week in order to pull this off and we picked a dollar number that's a sub-$20 million a week, which is pretty much of a low point for us.", "Chris Danely - JPMorgan", "Okay.", "Jon Olson", "I think last several --for quite a few years, four or five years.", "Chris Danely - JPMorgan", "Okay. That makes sense, thanks.", "Jon Olson", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Wu.", "David Wu - Global Crown Capital", "Yes, good afternoon. I just wanted to get a clarification on a couple of points. First, Jon, when you talk about gross margin down because of lower revenues, I kind of remember also that the mix that the Defense has the best gross margin in your company and I do not know where comp infrastructure lies because -- is it mix dependent or is it more revenue level dependent in your comments on gross margin? Because I have got to think about the rest of the fiscal year moving forward?", "Jon Olson", "Yeah, so the answer that I gave earlier and I will expand on that a little bit more. It's really driven more by the revenue drop than it is about anticipating any unique mix area. I mean quite frankly, the Wireless business is not quite as good as the Defense business and there's some balance actually going on there and so some declines there kind of balance each other out a little bit, so it's not -- we're not expecting a big mix shift in that number.", "David Wu - Global Crown Capital", "Okay. The other clarification I wanted to get was if you look at your R&D dollars and go back and take a look, the absolute number was back in December of a year ago when you had a $91 million number, and with all your new products at least initial 40-45 nanometers out in the March quarter, should we anticipate a drop off of those absolute dollars as we go into the early part of fiscal 2010?", "Jon Olson", "Well you know, we would still be rolling out the tail end of the families and I do not know about going into our fiscal 10. Well our fiscal 10, no, I think talking about our fiscal 10, David that\u2026", "David Wu - Global Crown Capital", "The June quarter?", "Jon Olson", "That's starting the June quarter so no, we have upward pressure for new product introductions.", "David Wu - Global Crown Capital", "On mass costs?", "Jon Olson", "Yes.", "David Wu - Global Crown Capital", "Okay. And the last one I have was the $3 million of remind me of something, the $3 million of net interest expense in the March quarter that you guided to, is that a function of -- I remember the convertible bonds didn't carry any interest; is that right? And if you use cash to buy that, that's why you get hit on the interest income line?", "Jon Olson", "No. The convertible bonds carried 3.125% interest.", "David Wu - Global Crown Capital", "Okay.", "Jon Olson", "And so interest expense is exceeding interest income and as I think we all know that borrowing money is or just investing your money in treasury doesn't get you very much, in the number of basis points that we are dropping on our average yield this past quarter to the forecast is quite significant, as many of our rates start to reset themselves to the current market levels. So our interest income is depressed relatively to the December quarter quite a bit.", "David Wu - Global Crown Capital", "Okay. Looking forward, I assume that that trend unless things change would continue, that we have more interest expense than interest income?", "Jon Olson", "Well certainly, if we're talking about 70 basis points for treasury in terms of the investment, yes, that would be the case because we don't get into a lot of speculative areas and we try to keep things that the cash is safe and conservative as possible.", "David Wu - Global Crown Capital", "Jon, last question, I'll try. If the revenues ever hit $300 million on the low end, or below, what does it do to your gross margin? I was trying to think one of the quarters in the early part of fiscal 2010 may very well be sub-$300 million.", "Jon Olson", "Yeah, I don't see us going below, out of the 60's if that would happen. The difference was maybe, if you go looking back at history, it's really relative to mix and what happens to our inventory and our inventory position is pretty decent right now and I think I feel we can manage it down without taking any inventory reserves.", "So if you assume no inventory reserves or adjustments there, then it's just a matter of managing mix and the infrastructure of the company and fixed costs to try to keep the margins in the 60's.", "David Wu - Global Crown Capital", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Wong.", "David Wong - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Thank you very much. Can you give us some idea of what your foundry orders will produce in the March and June quarters? If you hit the mid point of your March sales guidance, do days of inventory rise or fall at the end of March? And are you ordering less for June than you have for March?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Yes David, our days will definitely rise because there's really no way to shed that much inventory with the broad mix that we do have, but we don't anticipate dollars rising significantly. In fact, on managing to dollars to take dollars flat to down in inventory even though days will spike up some. And we have been cutting our starts and foundries since basically November.", "David Wong - Wachovia Capital Markets", "So, you would have less coming out in the June quarter than you do currently in the March quarter at least at the rate you\u2019re going?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "We haven't made that evaluation yet, but we certainly had less outs in December than September. We'll have fewer less outs in March than December most likely, and June, it's too early to tell. It may flatten out.", "David Wong - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Right, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Benjamin.", "Adam Benjamin", "Thanks, Jon. If you could just take a look back to the October timeframe, when you were giving guidance for the December quarter and then compare and contrast that to today in giving guidance for the March quarter, just curious to get any differences or similarities between the two periods.", "Jon Olson", "Well I\u2019m certainly more depressed than I was I guess in October, but I think the differences really that lead there is the relative weakness of our backlog going in. We had this strong backlog going into the December quarter. I felt really good about where we were going and what was going to happen, and now I kind of almost have the reverse impact of saying wow, I need customers to start ordering stuff this quarter and etc.", "So, I think we've taken the appropriate conservatism in our forward-looking guidance, but there's a lot of business that has to get booked yet and we're very spending a lot of time with our customers trying to understand what they really need, so we can get it to them and make sure we have the right mix.", "Adam Benjamin", "And when you talk about the business that's not yet to be booked that you're hoping to be booked, can you give a little granularity in terms of what end markets that you're serving in terms of how your business shapes up that you'd expect to see higher level of that turns business to come in?", "Jon Olson", "It's mostly, we go through this large company forecasting process and it's mostly the large guys, who know they can lean on to get stuff at the last minute and things like that, with a short availability, and those are the people that we're going back to and who are not necessarily as booked as we like to see to say look, we're cutting back inventory lots of things so don't hang us out too long because you won't get the parts you need and we're working through that process right now with our sales organization.", "Adam Benjamin", "Okay and then just one last question. Just to clarify on the Industrial segment, the Test and Measurement and Medical, you indicated were pretty weak. Is the 20% range even though the business was only down 5%, is that in the ballpark there for those two businesses?", "Jon Olson", "I think that's probably the case. Remember the 5% in Industrial and other wasn't so bad because we had strong Aerospace and Defense business, which is also in that category and that very strong business offset that very weak rest of the part of Industrial.", "Adam Benjamin", "Right, and that very weak, is that something that, because those have been relatively stable, so I'm just curious if that's something that you expect to see continued big drop offs like that or kind of stabilized at these levels.", "Jon Olson", "Well, I would expect that there's a chance it could stabilize after March in that area because it appears they've been taking, making adjustments to their inventory and that will continue to happen through March. We'll just have to wait and see and give you more information later.", "Adam Benjamin", "All right, that's all I have. Thanks, Jon.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda.", "Sumit Dhanda - BAS-ML", "Yes, hi, guys. A couple of questions. First, Jon, on the gross margins, is there any benefit that might help offset it maybe perhaps a later point in time, the impact you're seeing from higher fixed costs either on wafer pricing or on continued yield improvements or is that really tapped out at this point in time?", "Jon Olson", "Well, yes that\u2019s I've got this question outside of these calls a lot about, is there an advantage for us on wafer pricing because factories want to fill up and things like that. And there could be some there over time, but right now, I don't see a lot. We have some pretty aggressive yield in wafer price road maps that this is not just new because of what's going on. We've had this for the last several years, worked very closely on yield improvement with our partners and throughput improvements with our assembly and test partners and we feel really good about those continual declines that will come to us that will help us in gross margin, relative to opportunistic inventory builds.", "If there was something there that made sense for us and them in terms of what kind of discounts we could get for some other terms and conditions that they would want, I'd certainly be willing to talk about it and we keep an open dialogue with our suppliers there and we'll pursue those opportunities, but there's nothing booked right now so to speak into right now that would suggest there is going to be some sort of huge discount coming to us or impact to the supply chain.", "Sumit Dhanda - BAS-ML", "On the operating costs or expenses staying relatively flat and within the context of that picture, some upward pressure on R&D because of the mass costs that you anticipate. Can you help us perhaps quantify somewhat how much pressure that might be in terms of dollars or when that pressure might start to abate just a broad timeline or --?", "Jon Olson", "Well, the ramp up of our mass take out expenses while we had some in December will continue to ramp I would say in the single digit millions of dollars, increase quarter-over-quarter, low to mid single digits in the first few quarters and then accelerate pretty rapidly in the back half of our next fiscal year and that whole profile is something that we are looking at and trying to understand how to manage over the next four to six quarters in order to not have our engineering dollars increase substantially.", "Sumit Dhanda - BAS-ML", "Okay. And just one other more. On the Defense business, you said the budgets have been set, it's more visibility in terms of available backlog, the seasonality this quarter notwithstanding. Again any, can you help quantify perhaps how much the growth in this market might be on a full year basis, not on an internal quarter basis, just given what you see there?", "Jon Olson", "Well, we've been clicking off some pretty good double digit full year versus full year kind of growth rates and I think we were in somewhere in the 20s year before last and this last year in 10-15ish kind of growth rate or something. I would expect us to be somewhere in the high single, low double-digit kind of a number year-over-year based on what we can see today.", "Sumit Dhanda - BAS-ML", "And then very last question. On the China 3G side, either for you or Moshe, how is your positioning on with W-CDMA or CDMA 2000 or by carrier versus what you've seen so far or TD-SCDMA with China Mobile?", "Jon Olson", "I think wide band CDMA is of equivalent strength of where we are in TD-SCDMA, and I think those are our two strongest areas that impact Asia.", "Sumit Dhanda - BAS-ML", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Jon Olson", "Last question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann.", "Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James", "Great. I made it. Quick question, Moshe, you said the last two weeks business was better than expected. Did you mean the last two weeks of December or the last two weeks here in January?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "It was the last two weeks of December, hence we ended up with a number, which was better than what we had projected in the middle of December.", "Jon Olson", "I would say, we had a pretty healthy first couple weeks of December and it got us pretty spooked about what was going to happen and that low level did not absolutely continue for the last couple of weeks, it was slightly better than it was in this\u2026", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Wasn't great but better than the dismal first part I guess?", "Jon Olson", "Right. It made us have a -- at least our Christmas that we thought was okay to have.", "Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James", "Okay. And then how have the last couple of weeks been? Have they been at that second half of December level or ?", "Jon Olson", "Very choppy, and we haven't had a consistent pattern here. We are kind of early doing our announcement and that our fiscal year end ended before the holiday season was over. So during the holidays people really weren't ordering very much and turns were pretty weak and we had some slightly better numbers for last week but it is way too early right now in the quarter or even this month to figure out what the pattern is going to be. Really choppy.", "Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James", "Fair enough. Good job guys. Thanks.", "Maria Quillard", "Operator, one more question, please?", "Operator", "Your final question in the queue will come from the line of Ruben Roy.", "Ruben Roy - Pacific Crest Securities", "Thank you. Question for Moshe. Virtex-5, a lot of success. Can you just maybe talk about -- you have five platforms.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay, well, two of the five families are relatively recent introductions so we're pleased with the uptick there but they aren't contributing significant revenue, so it's the first three that have the share of the revenue and it's those that are moving to higher volumes and we have with all of our higher volume customers, we have approaches to enable them to stay with FPGA solutions so that's done on a customer by customer basis and there are some definitely on the Virtex-5 which have that solution, and quite pleased with how well it's going.", "Ruben Roy - Pacific Crest Securities", "Okay, great. A follow up Moshe then, are there any conversions to EasyPath today or do you expect any within the next few quarters? Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "You know? We're doing conversions on an ongoing basis on the [ops] technologies and they continue all the time. It's part of the life cycle of the product is to go through those conversions at the appropriate point in time. And yes, it does happen and what typically happens is that these things happen somewhat later than the customers expect because they ramp up a little more slowly and they happen at a lower number than they expect but they do happen and it's part of the general life cycle of the projects. And it just continues, continues on an ongoing basis so I don't think there's any particular uptick at any point in time, it's just part of normal business.", "Ruben Roy - Pacific Crest Securities", "Thanks very much.", "Maria Quillard", "Okay, well thank you all for joining us today. We have a playback of this call beginning at 5 p.m. Pacific, 8:00 p.m. Eastern. For a copy of our earnings release, please visit our Investor Relations website.", "As we stated in our Press Release our guidance update for the March ending quarter will take place on Tuesday, March 3rd, prior to the market open. Our next earnings release date for the fourth quarter of FY \u201809 will be Wednesday, April 22nd after the market close.", "This quarter we will be presenting at the Goldman Sachs Technology conference at the end of February and the Morgan Stanley conference in early March.", "This completes our call and thank you very much for your participation.", "Operator", "That concludes today\u2019s conference call.

I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the June quarter.", "Revenues in fiscal 2009 were $1.83 billion, down 1% from $1.84 billion in fiscal 2008. While Xilinx is not immune to the current recessionary environment, we have benefited from exposure to defense applications, next-generation China wireless applications, and strong Virtex-5 sales momentum which has enabled us to significantly outperform the semiconductor industry.", "As we exited the fiscal year, our sales of $395 million are 19% below our peak sales of $488 million recorded in Q1. This compares favorably to the vast majority of semiconductor companies that have experienced sales declines of nearly 40% on average. Additionally during the year, we made significant progress in reducing our cost and operating expenses. Gross margin improved by 50 basis points in fiscal 2009 to 63.3% as we benefited from improved yields and reduced manufacturing costs.", "From a geographic perspective, sales from Asia-Pacific, a key focus market for us, increased 15% during the year to represent 33% of total sales, up from 29% in the prior year. Most of this growth was driven by strong sales to Communications customers. Sales from all other geographies were flat or down for the fiscal year.", "We continued to carefully manage inventory levels during the fiscal year. Inventory days at Xilinx in fiscal 2009 were 65 days down from 59 days in fiscal 2008, and the lowest level since Q3 of fiscal 2004. We repurchased $275 million of common stock during the year and extinguished over $300 million of convertible debt.", "Our net cash level after factoring in the convertible debt increased over $120 million to $983 million as we exited the fiscal year. Cash flow from operations remained healthy at $443 million for the fiscal year, but down from $581 million in the previous year due primarily to lower interest income, higher tax expense and a decrease in deferred income on shipments to distributors driven by lower distributor inventory levels.", "Let me now turn it to a discussion of the quarter. March quarter sales decreased 14% sequentially to $395 million, in line with guidance we provided during our business update. As you may recall, we revised our sales guidance upwards during our business update on March 2 due primarily to better-than-expected strength from customers serving the China wireless market.", "Compared to the same quarter a year ago, total sales were down 17%. Turns increased significantly during the quarter to 66%, up from 54% in the prior quarter. The bookings linearity was pretty much as anticipated with the month of January strong, and February and March in line with expectations.", "New product sales decreased 6% sequentially, mainstream and base products experienced sequential declines of 22% and 20% respectively. Next quarter, at the start of our fiscal 2010, we expect to reclassify our revenue by products to better reflect the age [ph] of the product and advances in technology.", "Sales from all geographies declined sequentially during the quarter as expected. North America sales were down 11% with broad-based declines in nearly every end market. Asia-Pacific sales were down 11% as flat communication sales were offset by declines in all other end markets. European sales were down 12% in the March quarter with flat communication sales offset by declines in most other end markets. Sales from Japan were down 34% with declines from all end markets.", "In terms of our vertical markets, sales from all major end market categories declined sequentially. Communication sales declined less than the total sales resulting in sales from this category climbing to represent 47% of total, the highest level in nearly three years. Although wireless sales declined as a percent of total sales, they increased to a record 20%, up from 18% in the prior quarter.", "Wire communications declined approximately 10% representing 27% of total sales, up from 26% of sales in the prior quarter. Wire communications increased sequentially in Asia-Pacific, driven by a metro and optical networking application that was more than offset by declines in all other geographies.", "Industrial and other end market experienced broad-based geographic weakness declining 18% in March quarter. Sales to customers in defense, industrial, scientific and medical, and test and measurement all declined in double digits. Sales from industrial and other currently represent 32% of total sales, down from 33% in the prior quarter and the same quarter a year ago.", "Consumer and automotive sales are also very weak across all geographies declining 27% during the quarter. We experienced double-digit declines in audio/video broadcast, automotive and consumer. Sales from consumer automotive currently represent 14% of total sales, down from 16% in the prior quarter and down from 17% in the same quarter a year ago. Lastly, data processing sales were down 5% representing 7% total sales, down from 8% in the March quarter of fiscal \u201908.", "Gross margin for the quarter was 62.1%, down from 63.9% in the prior quarter and in line with forecast. Combined R&D and SG&A expense was $167 million, lower than our guidance of $173 million as a result of continued expense controls and lower than anticipated map [ph] cost during the quarter.", "Net income during the quarter was $70.5 million or $0.26 per diluted share and was impacted by a couple of factors. First, we spent $46.9 million in cash to repurchase $69.3 million of face value of convertible debentures. This resulted in a pre-tax gain of $20.9 million or $0.06 per diluted share after tax. We also recorded a pre-tax impairment charge on our investments of $1 million.", "Operating cash flow for the March quarter was $60.9 million before $6 million in CapEx. As I mentioned earlier, we paid $46.9 million in cash during the quarter to repurchase $69.3 million of principal amount of convertible debentures. We also paid $38.6 million in cash dividends. The tax rate in the March quarter was 27.2% higher than our forecast of 21% impacted primarily by the gain on repurchase of convertible debentures which was taxed at U.S. rates.", "Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments decreased $6 million during the quarter to 1.7 billion. We now have approximately $690 million in convertible debt on our balance sheet and our net cash position is approximately $1 billion. Day sales outstanding increased eight days in the March quarter to 50 days due to a shipment profile that was skewed to the back half of the quarter. Inventory dollars at Xilinx decreased by $30 million in the March quarter representing 73 days. This is down from 82 days in the prior quarter and up from 68 days in the same quarter a year ago.", "Worldwide distributors held 17 days in the March quarter, flat with the prior quarter and down from 24 days in the same quarter of the prior year. Combined inventory days in the March quarter were 90, down nine days from the prior quarter and at the low end of our target of 90 to 100 days.", "I would now like to discuss the restructuring announcement we made last week. As we stated, the global workforce will be reduced by approximately 200 positions. This is a net reduction number that will be implemented over the period of fiscal year 2010. There are two phases to our restructuring plan.", "The first phase is a broad-based reduction impacting most functions of the quarter \u2013 of the company. There will be an immediate impact to the ongoing spending base of the company in the range of $4 million and $5 million spread between operating spending and cost of goods sold. This phase results in a pre-tax charge of approximately $11 million to $13 million in the June quarter, primarily related to severance expenses.", "The second phase of the restructuring relates to the implementation of additional supply chain efficiencies and the transition of certain engineering and transactional functions to our Asia locations over the course of the rest of the fiscal year. More specifically, we will be consolidating most of our logistics, manufacturing, planning and new product test functions in Singapore. All production testing in U.S., Europe and Asia will be outsourced to the current supplier base.", "Production engineering support for these functions will also move to Singapore as will a number of transaction-based functions. Lastly, we will be adding to our existing engineering research based in Hyderabad to support next-generation development activities. Hiring for these positions will begin immediately and will be phased in over the next several quarters. These long-term restructuring measures will result in additional charges totaling approximately $10 million over the September, December and March quarters of fiscal 2010.", "While the timing of these charges are dependent on achieving transition milestones, we expect most of his charge to be incurred in the September and December quarters. In addition to the restructuring activities, Xilinx is implementing other short-term cost saving actions including executive salary reductions, a broad-based employee salary freeze and a reduction in cash compensation of the Board of Directors. This savings is included in the $4 million to $5 million savings I mentioned earlier.", "As we exit fiscal year 2010, we expect to realize incremental savings associated with the second phase of the restructuring measure, although smaller than the initial Q1 impact of $4 million to $5 million. I do not plan to provide explicit operating guidance for future quarters on this call. However, we are expecting fiscal year \u201810 operating expenses including all restructuring charges to decline versus fiscal year \u201809 as recent cost reduction efforts and \u2013 more than offset a significant increase in new product development expense. At this time, our 63% to 65% gross margin target remains unchanged as does our 30% operating margin target, although we will require revenue growth to choose it.", "Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the June quarter of fiscal 2010. There are a number of dynamics impacting the June quarter. On the positive side, we are heading into the quarter with backlog that is up double-digit sequentially. We are expecting China wireless to be strong in the June quarter driven by deployment activity associated with China Mobile, China Unicorn, and to a lesser degree China Telecom.", "We are also seeing isolated instances of recovery in areas like audio\\video broadcast and stabilization in enterprise networking and automotive. Additionally, we are expecting strong sales growth from Virtex-5. However, on the negative side, we are expecting wireline sales to decline primarily due to continued weakness in Telecom offsetting a slight improvement in enterprise networking.", "We are also expecting defense sales to decline sequentially due to product cycle transitions at a couple of large customers. This anticipated decline in defense sales is uncharacteristic of the June quarter and is not expected to continue at the December quarter. As a result, we are expecting sales to be flat plus or minus 4% in the June quarter with growth from Asia-Pacific and Japan, and declines from Europe and North America.", "The communications category as a whole is expected to be flat to slightly up sequentially. We are forecasting the industrial and other category to be down sequentially in the June quarter. Consumer automotive is expected to be up sequentially driven by a broad-based rebound in audio/video broadcast and increases in LCD and PDP businesses. Lastly, data processing is expected to remain flat. We are providing a broad revenue range as our visibility remains poor. The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate in the high 50s.", "Gross margin is expected to be approximately 61% to 63%. Combined operating expenses including $11 million to $13 million of restructuring charges are expected to be approximately $173 million to $175 million in the June quarter. Other income and expense is expected to be at a net expense of approximately $3 million. The share count is expected to be flat, and the tax rate for Q1 of our fiscal 2010 will be approximately 21%.", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you, Jon and good afternoon to you all. Overall, I am very satisfied with the progress we have made over the past financial year.", "Both our functional reorganizations last June and the recently announced restructuring efforts have resulted in a significantly simplified multi-pre-integrated organization driving improved operating efficiencies. These steps while challenging to the entire organization were necessary to position Xilinx for long-term success. They have been taken without compromising our technology leadership.", "On the product front, this past February, we announced in parallel both our next-generation Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families, the combination of an unquestionable engineering (inaudible). Virtex-6 stands our high-end leadership position which is being unquestionably demonstrated by the Virtex-5 hegemony in 65 nanometer volume shipment. Virtex-6 provides the lowest power, highest capacity, and highest performance FPGA on the market.", "In parallel, Spartan-6 is the industry's first and only high-volume 45 nanometer FPGA family provides the lowest cost and lowest power solution shipping today. With the simultaneous introduction of these new products, we have the strongest product portfolio we\u2019ve had in many years. We began shipping devices from both families on track with our plans in the March ending quarter and quoting activity has been exceptionally strong. In fact, it is five times higher than the prior generation of the product the same time of their life cycle.", "Already over 700 customers presenting more than 1,000 different opportunities are engaged with the Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 early exit program. In the current quarter, we are unscheduled to broadly release our newest software capabilities significantly improving runtimes, quality and overall capability. We expect this release to be widely adopted by a broad base of customers as full public access to Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 will occur this quarter too.", "On all fronts, we are tracking extremely well to our initial product \u2013 production plans. Our increased recur in both the design and process technology side has contributed to successful execution thus far promising to be a repeat of our flawless execution with the Virtex-5 family. Scalability of the remaining members of the Virtex-6, Spartan-6 families is scheduled by the end of the calendar year.", "In addition to our base silicon and software, we will be delivering targeted design platform to differentiate us from all other PLD companies. These targeted design platforms improve ease of use, decrease development costs for our customers by providing bundle tools both in IP core into an integrated PLD design solution. As Jon mentioned, our beginning June quarter backlog is up quarter-to-quarter, 3G wireless infrastructure deployment in China is the main drivers of improved backlog along with some inventory replenishment occurring in our other end markets.", "However, beyond the June quarter, we continue to remain cautious about our trail end demand till we see more signs of the true economic recovery. The one thing we are certain about is that our customers must do more with less given these tough economic realities. In order to succeed, they need to accelerate product development, provide product differentiation, while reducing their risk profile and development costs. These trends coupled with financial pressures are hastening the competitive demise of ASIC solutions for an increasing number of applications.", "Perfect example of this trend is a major wired communications customer made the decision to entirely eliminate ASICs in their next-generation equipment used in core network infrastructure. Our Virtex-6 technology meets their applications critical performance and power requirements. Furthermore, its flexibility and scalability enables them to use a differentiated solution deploying fewer design resources and is scalable enough to be used in several different products providing a hedge against uncertain demand.", "The customer was able to validate the design and capability in Virtex-6 \u2013 in Virtex-5 for its chosen Virtex-6 for the final production. At the same time, numerous mid to small volume standard product semiconductor company's, we used to target specialized niches will no longer be able to maintain competitive investment level. This tool will accelerate the transition to programmable solution. An example of this trend is an automotive infotainment customer was chosen Spartan-6 to replace several ASSPs.", "Given the diverse needs, it is not possible to find a single ASSP to meet all of their system requirements and the volumes are not just high enough to justify the standard product investment. Instead, multiple Spartan-6 FPGAs were chosen and within each Spartan-6 FPGA, they are implementing slightly different variant of their base design. Customers currently completing the simulation portion of the design will be moving to the prototyping phase with our Spartan-6 FPGA.", "In summary, I believe that with these new product introductions, the programmable imperative is rapidly becoming a reality and Xilinx\u2019s exceptionally strong new product portfolio positions us better than any other time in our history to capitalize on these future growth opportunity.", "Now, let me turn the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.", "Glen Yeung \u2013 Citi", "Thanks. Jon, I think you said that your order pattern was strong in January, then as expected in February and March. I wonder if you could just put that in different terms, maybe just in terms of month-to-month-to-month growth of decline, what was that pattern like and how has April shaped up in terms of order flow?", "Jon Olson", "Well, if you \u2013 Glen, if you remember back, our quarter began in the middle of the Christmas season, it was like \u2013 December 27 was the first day of the quarter, so we had ahead of us a week or two essentially manufacturers not producing very much. So we clearly went into the quarter \u2013 with a very weak situation and we didn't have \u2013 we did not have the lion's share of our China wireless business booked at that time. So we had anticipated that January was going to be a very strong and brisk month, and in fact it rather was. So I think in terms of relative size, January was the largest turns month for us, because of that I would say pent-up the orders that should have been booked, and then February and March were below that, but relatively equal.", "And I think going into April, we are much better booked primarily due to the 3G business in China and I think we've had \u2013 I would say the first part of this \u2013 the first three weeks of this month we've had I would say reasonable turns, I wouldn't say they are outstanding, but they are pretty solid.", "Glen Yeung \u2013 Citi", "Can I ask a follow-up?", "Jon Olson", "Sure.", "Glen Yeung \u2013 Citi", "Your thoughts on the sustainability of the China wireless business, its sort of the question on everybody's mind is, is it something where you think personally [ph] in your pocket somewhere in the back half of the year or any visibility you may have on how the pattern of that business may look?", "Jon Olson", "Yes. And Moshe talked a little bit about our concerns about the economy going forward. I mean one of the things that, patterns that we do see in our forecast from the China and 3G wireless is, right now we're looking at our September quarter is not being nearly forecasted \u2013 not nearly as strong as the previous quarter and this quarter in terms of wireless business in China. And so is that a pause between phases is that some sort of transition? We don't have enough information \u2013 you have to know exactly whether that hole is going to fill itself, but right now we actually do see a hole in September and then in the second half of the year we're getting at least the indication from our customers that second half of our fiscal year, I mean December and March, if those quarters will continue to be relatively strong. So at this point, I would say if there is a hole right now we would estimate that it's in September.", "Glen Yeung \u2013 Citi", "Interesting.", "Jon Olson", "That\u2019s also \u2013 and think about any longer-term revenue forecast, September is typically a down quarter for us. Anyway because of summer and European sale [ph] weak in particular, right now it's too difficult to predict, but September looks like \u2013 think you have more of a challenge.", "Glen Yeung \u2013 Citi", "Thanks, Jon.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Randy Abrams with Credit Suisse.", "Randy Abrams \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Yes, good afternoon. Wonder if you can comment on the new base for OpEx if you exclude the charge of about 162 million, with the second phase of restructuring were you are doing some more outsourcing on the back end. Do you see opportunity to take that even a step down or is that going to be most of the OpEx flowing in? And then gross margins, do you see some incremental benefits coming through later in the year from that restructuring?", "Jon Olson", "Yes. So Randy, the number of forecasting for next quarter would be charges between 173 million and 175 million, and then $11 million to $13 million charge. So if you net those out, I guess the number that you refer to and that really is driven by the fact that we are \u2013 we have this broad-based reduction in force in the quarter. As we execute the transition of hiring people and doing knowledge transfer to our Asia locations, we would anticipate at the end of the year to have a couple of million dollars more benefit exiting the year.", "However, I do want to caution you about something that I said in the past around the fact that we have a many tape out plan for the new product introductions and that our spending for maps and tape outs is going to start to rise. And so we believe that will raise several million dollars from the current base and peak in the December quarter and then start to fall a little bit. So there's going to be, from an R&D perspective I think you're going to see some upward pressure on the current run rate and you will see benefits in SG&A as much of what we have done has \u2013 more of what we have done has impacted SG&A and our cost of goods sold line.", "Now, with respect to your question around gross margins, clearly the thing that we're doing in consolidating our logistics manufacturing capability, outsourcing more etcetera we are doing that from the standpoint of cost improvement and efficiency in the company and we would expect that by the end of the year to have positive contributions to gross margin. We're just not forecasting the magnitude at this point in time because it's really dependent on how well the execution of those transitions go.", "Randy Abrams \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering if we could stay on the gross margin trend for a second and could give us some kind of sense of how you anticipate the profile of gross margin to go throughout this year, what benefits you will see operationally and then what kind of probations you may expect from mix in the next quarter or two.", "Jon Olson", "Yes. Just from the \u2013 riding the company through this transition period and taking the mix things separately from \u2013 just growing the company \u2013 we actually don't see any swings in gross margin. I would say that we would expect a gentle increase throughout the year from our current position, but not a dramatic one. So I think we will \u2013 we believe some of these efficiencies will accrue to us as we move along through the second half of the year and we have a number of other cost programs in place, not just this consolidation process much like we have been doing over the last couple of years in terms of improving margin. So I would expect some upward drift to open again, not a gigantic shift up.", "The second question \u2013 the second part of the question around mix is that, mix is a difficult thing to know for sure what's going forward, but I will say that we already have seen a mix up in our wireless business and our margins are still maintaining at a reasonable level. So while there is a variety of margin implications to end markets and to mix of high-end or low-end price for us, we are going to able to balance that with a broad base \u2013 slightly higher margins in some end markets, slightly lower margins to some of our high-volume customers and I don't think we're seeing that there is going to be an impact \u2013 a negative impact to mix for sure out of the business that we see over the next two or three quarters.", "James Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, maybe as a follow-up, could I ask you about the industrial customer base, what you are seeing from your broader industrial customer base in terms of any areas of strength or weakness, I think your primary competitor know [ph] that instance is relatively weak? And can you talk about any mix of large versus small customers and what you're seeing in the current quarter?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Yes, the industrial base, I would concur that it is quite weak and we\u2019ve lost quite a bit of business \u2013 quite a bit of our run rate in the broad-based industrial taking our space into defense out of that for a minute. And I think in test and measurement, scientific and medical, we\u2019ve seen a couple of quarters sequentially a weakness there and we are not anticipating much strength in that (inaudible) area, we\u2019re certainly hoping for some stabilization there. Aerospace and defense remains cyclical to us and we still feel that\u2019s a strong business and it should be flat to up overall this year, but it\u2019s \u2013 it will have a different profile.", "And then you asked to comment around small customers to large customers, and we have seen less of a drop at our large customers over the last couple of quarters than we have at the broad-based customers and we got a little investigation \u2013 it\u2019s kind of interesting, our really small broad-based distributor customers that are managed by our distributor for the most part. That did has been sequentially weak for several quarters now and we\u2019ve talked about that starting in North America and then moving to Europe and we don\u2019t really see a lot of improvement there and actually not that much additional declines, some but not certainly a large amount.", "But in this reception kind of middle size that are between the very large and the very small that is what\u2019s dropped the most for us the last quarter or so. So we would describe it more as our midsized customers dropped more this quarter compared to the previous quarter, where our large customers certainly dropped less than the average.", "James Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Wu with Global Crown Research.", "David Wu \u2013 Global Crown Research", "Yes. Jon, can you help me in one thing which is the, if we have a go back to 400 at or [ph] this restructuring, if we have a hit back to the 485 million a quarter, what kind of gross and operating margin should we expect? And then the new cost structure, we got up to I think almost 26% in the last peak.", "Jon Olson", "So David, we certainly have been doing \u2013 taking many steps at the company to lower that point, the revenue level which it takes to achieve our stated operating margin, gross margin and spending targets. It is a bit the moving target with all of the things we\u2019re going on, so I hesitate to give you a number, but at the analyst meeting, you know about a year ago, we \u2013 not quite a year ago, we did talk about it needing to be north of $500 million in order to achieve it and we are south of $500 million in order to achieve a pre-quarter to achieve that. But I'm not hesitant to give you the number because there are a lot of specific numbers, there are a lot of things moving parts going on right now.", "David Wu \u2013 Global Crown Research", "Okay. Just a quick follow-up, I guess this repurchase of your convertible will continue, so you will get these capital gains somewhere every quarter, even though they are supposedly discrete events?", "Jon Olson", "Well, yes \u2013 maybe yes and maybe no. We\u2019ve been treating this as a very opportunistic thing meaning if we can get a significant discount, we would be in the market to do that and we\u2019ve stayed very aggressive on that meaning we want a pretty large discount in order to make those transactions. And you could see the amount that we did this quarter versus the previous quarter went down and that's probably a good indication that the overall market has improved and therefore we don't have the same opportunities that we\u2019ve had in the past. So, we may have, there may be additional buybacks of debt or there may not, we certainly are evaluating the prize in our breakeven and the contribution to move into potential dilution factors in a model when trying to figure out what \u2013 when it makes sense to jump in and when it makes sense to stay out.", "David Wu \u2013 Global Crown Research", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra with Robert Baird.", "Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert Baird", "Hi, good afternoon. How would you qualify the 45 nanometer ramp from a production standpoint versus previous generation products and versus ultimate expectation and when would you expect 45 nanometer to reach 1 million in revenues?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Tristan, this is Moshe. We have already sampled the product. We are moving towards proliferation in terms of the members of the family. This is an exceptionally exciting product for us because we believe Spartan of the 45 nanometer addresses the fastest growing market in FPGAs and one that frankly we have not achieved, as well as I would have liked in the past, it is great opportunity for us. Typically that product ramps to volume faster than the Virtex product line. Virtex product line takes typically around three years to reach the 50-ish million dollar level, but here on the Spartan product line, which typically is the smaller overall number, but nonetheless ramps more quickly. We expect that to start ramping this year and those numbers that you mentioned are not huge numbers, they are actually just \u2013 you could achieve those numbers very easily just by shipping to tens of customers a few prototypes. So, it is not a big goal for us. We do expect to see very, very broad acceptance of the product and for it to hit significant revenue in the 2010 calendar time frames. And so, I don't know between, when it crosses the $1 million point, but I would say that that is largely relevant, what we're tracking at this point is mostly design wins and those are happening in space and we're very pleased with the results there.", "Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert Baird", "Okay and also could you elaborate on the new software launch that you mentioned, is that a second generation software?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Basically it is our 11.1 release, so it is the 11th major release, it has huge benefits over the previous generation in terms of numerous parameters turnaround time, which is very important for the customers, because they are designing larger and larger chips and hence they need the software to operate more quickly. It also reduces the memory footprint very significantly and it adds a lot of features, in parallel it provides the support for the Spartan-6 and the Virtex-6 product lines and those \u2013 that will be available this quarter too. So it is two phase approach and, no, I wouldn't call it a second generation, I think it is a significant enhancement of the previous generation of product we have.", "Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert Baird", "Okay. And just to clarify, this is the first software supporting 45 nanometer though?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "It supports \u2013 yes, the answer is yes, it supports both Virtex and Spartan, so it is both the 40 nanometer high-end and the 45 nanometer high volume product, but it also has tremendous benefits to customers who are using existing technologies like Virtex-5 and Spartan-3, they will just see better results in terms of the turnaround etcetera.", "Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert Baird", "Right, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Luke with Barclays Capital.", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Gentlemen, can just remind us what the tons were in the current quarter and did you give any color on your book-to-bill as you looked at the beginning of this quarter?", "Jon Olson", "Sure, Tim. Tim, in terms we\u2019re in the mid-60s percent, 66% this last quarter, and we stated we needed a pretty high turns number as a percent, but the actual dollar level of transfer that would [ph] require on a weekly basis were on average we are pretty low relative to a three or four year analysis and in fact we did achieve that. So, going into this next quarter, we said we needed, and I tell you in the high 50s, again that is difficult to assess because the revenue level is lower, but we have got, I would say a more, flat view of the world of how turns will happen this quarter in terms of the profile. And again it would take, in the same dollar neighborhood per week as last quarter. So, we don't think, we are hung out too much.", "Book-to-bill to us is, while mathematically it says it is one, it is above one, but it is not really that important to us because it is really, I mean if we still do so much through distribution there can be a lot of stocking distribution shelves in that content. So, it is not a particularly meaningful number to us.", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "With respect to the OpEx guidance, can you give some color with respect to where you see R&D and SG&A, I think that you were saying that the R&D would go up bounced by the SG&A, is the net of that following the restructuring so that you get like a 160 OpEx number by September or where shall we see that? And then just on the gross margin side, Jon any current things occur to you as reasons why you are inferring that your margins may strengthen in the back half possibly while you are, they are probably, were I would have seen this sort of mix issue? And then any offsets, you said China is going to be down in September, does military comeback at all in September or we should broadly expect to decline in their overall revenues in September?", "Jon Olson", "Okay. Let me start with the OpEx statement. So, we did say in my remarks that we would get benefit in the neighbor to $4 million to $5 million on the underlying operating net of the restructuring reserve that kind of a benefit to the run rate and some of it is in cost of goods sold and some of it is in OpEx, but quite frankly most of it is an OpEx. I would say 75% to 80% of it that kind of a number is an OpEx and most of that ends up being in SG&A again probably three fourth of that remainder ends up being in SG&A.", "And R&D, the profile of R&D for the year, does rise throughout Q2 and Q3 fiscal for us because of increased mask expense. So, we see several million dollars being added to each quarter, there'll be a couple million dollars added as we go through the year and peak in the December quarter not because of the underlying spending, but because of the tape out expense. But that being said, if you compare our total operating spending at the end of FY10 including restructuring with the previous year, which we're all set to restructuring and you're going to see that we are still down and R&D has actually going to be in the neighborhood of being flat to may be a little slightly up and so most of the dollars will come out of SG&A. I'm not really going to give you a number, a precise number of what is exiting the year because again there is lots of \u2013 or which quarter will be on the low point, mostly because there is lots of milestones to be done in these transitions and we have to work through that before we are confident enough to forecast the number.", "Gross margin, as I said I think we think that gross margin will be stable for us this year was slight up, I can't explain our primary competitors business or profile, we don't see mix driving anything different than it has ever driven for us in this particular area because we do feel we have a pretty good control of our pricing and good balance between end markets so that we can maintain our strong gross margin number, but moreover we are planning on getting more efficiency that of our organization. Somehow was due to the restructuring comments I made, some of it is ongoing cost reduction. So, we are continuing to press for efficiencies across the company in order to improve the operating leverage and I think we will succeed in that throughout the year.", "And your last question was around the strength of aerospace and defense and military business, it is, we have a couple of customer situations of why it is weaker in June, but we do believe that overall we will continue to grow and continue to grow in the back half of our year much like the seasonal pattern, we typically have were September is okay, December is strong, as well as March.", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "I was just trying to get a sense of your broad expectation for September because it seemed you are saying like China 3G is going to be down, anything broader with respect to the broader revenue picture for September?", "Jon Olson", "Well, I think Europe is going to be \u2013 continuing to be weak and it typically is weak for us in September quarter. To us the, you know for us September, the bright spots have typically been, you know some uptick in aerospace and defense and some strength in communication. And in the absence of at least the telecom leg not being strong and if wireless does take a dip then we're looking at aerospace and defense as being the only potential upward pressure in several other end markets where we have downward pressure. So that's why we are feeling right now and what we see at September could be little more challenging for us. But again a lot of work to that is being done between now and then and a lot of issues to be understood before we can give you a solid forecast.", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thanks so much, good luck.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS.", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "Thank you very much. Can I just have a follow-up on Tim's question on defense? As we watch the defense spending currently in (inaudible) right now possibly coming down, assuming that the trend is currently defense spending goes down, do you think there is any share shift situation that may benefit you in that business, I'm just trying to understand what is driving your confidence in terms of the growth in the later part of the year?", "Jon Olson", "First of the defense budget of the United States is still the largest individual budget of anything else that goes on. So I don't think when they start flashing in everything is going to get flashed. So from an overall perspective, our business may not grow at the rate we had been forecasting because of certain key programs that get cut back or change, we still think relative to other businesses it has, it gives us the opportunity to continue to grow that that particular segment this year, excuse me this fiscal year. With respect to any shares shift, it is unknown because you don\u2019t know which programs are going to be cut or live or die, so it is way too early to know because there is a larger list of things that have been proposed by the executive branch of the government, it is far from being done in terms of legislative branch deciding what they're going to vote for, not vote for so it's just way to premature, you change it to try to pick winners or losers at least to fill these space in my opinion.", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "Sure. Actually specifically I was wondering whether there was a shift from ASIC to FPGA and this kind of leads me to my second question, Moshe, in one of your earlier presentations you talked about the ASIC shift benefiting ASSPs, as well as you guys, but do you think from your open remark it sounded like that shift maybe benefiting as the FPGA products a little bit more, is that the conclusion to draw now in terms of how you see that shift from ASIC into FPGAs and if you can try and \u2013 I know you gave two examples of industries where this is happening and benefiting you, is there any more that you think is more notable for us to, you know look at where we should be able to see more evidence of this shift happening?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Yes. Well, I think the reduction in the number of ASICs is well documented, it is something I run into every time I go to customer visits and I spend about half of my time doing that. The number of ASICs that the customer is doing is going down and continues to go down significantly. The average revenue per ASIC design actually is going up to some extent because the number is going down rapidly, they are focusing on areas where there are higher returns because they can only afford to invest the millions, several millions of dollars in the design process if they have a higher likelihood of return. So, as the customers are doing less and less ASICs, their options are if they want to differentiate it than their only option is to come to an FPGA. If they go to standard products than there are viable standard product companies out there, but if you look at those companies, as done in the past there is a lot of mid-sized companies have focused on niche application. If you look at, you know one example is communications there is probably north of 20 communications infrastructure ASSP companies at a revenue base of over, of under $0.5 billion. Those companies cannot afford to invest in a 40 nanometer product let alone the generation beyond that and besides the customers are now stuck because they can\u2019t afford an ASIC, they are traditional suppliers unless they are in a high-volume market, can't afford an ASSP to the extent that they require hardware differentiation, they come to FPGAs, we've seen that in several markets, consumer markets, communication markets, military markets that just, you know it is not even news there, it is history there. The number of military ASICs that are being signed, you know I think you can count, you know when your two hands or maybe the fingers of one hand it just doesn't make any sense. So this is a trend which is continuing, accelerating, and it is working in our favor.", "In order to reap the benefits, you do need the right product and I would say that the 40 and 45 nanometer is probably the first time that we have products that can effectively replace ASSPs and ASICs on a broad front. And you know in my last trip I ran into customers who were taking ASICs and converting them to ASSPs and the reason they were doing that is their ASIC vendors are going out of business or they needed some ASIC [ph] a change and it was so difficult to make it in an ASIC, but they figured they might as well design an ASSP from scratch. So the extended (inaudible) both in this, this sort of reflects the enthusiasm they have for this trend it just is happening in states and you know the Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 will enable it to accelerate.", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "Thanks. And just one last question for Jon, Jon just for me to understand a sensitivity to China, would you be able to provide us a percentage of your sales or backlog that is China communication equipment, your competitor yesterday talked about while we had 12% of their revenues last quarter, do you have any such metrics, just for us to gauge your account and revenue sensitivity? And that is my last question thank you.", "Jon Olson", "Sure, Uche. We have no customer. Xilinx is 10% or greater than the company, but we would have to expose that as well. Relative to the China business, our wireless business as you said is about 20% of our revenue in this quarter and the business associated with China is less than half of that business you know it is a little less than half of that business that gives you some kind of a ballpark of the scale of our business.", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "And the backlog?", "Jon Olson", "Backlog is, I would say is probably disproportionately high from that percentage for China mostly because most of the suppliers have given us some long-range forecast and given SPO's [ph] to ensure supply of the right mix of products because there are some volumes that are pretty high there. So, I would say our backlog is higher. I don't have the precise percentage, but my guess would be that it would be higher than the percentage implied by what I gave you earlier.", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "All right. Thank you very much. Thanks, Moshe.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Barton with Cowen.", "John Barton \u2013 Cowen", "Thank you very much. Moshe, a moment ago you highlighted on your recent trips, you have seen the dynamics of the economy moving from \u2013 the demand trends from ASICs towards ASSPs towards FPGAs etcetera, in those trips in those customer visits have you seen any significant change in the design activity level, meaning are people slowing down new product introductions to save R&D, or are they accelerating product introductions in an effort to be more competitive in the tough marketplace?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "I would say that the customers are all over the map, but I wouldn't, if you look at the net integration I think it is slightly up in terms of activity. All the companies are focused on making sure that they have differentiated product. So, I don't see that the level of development activities has gone down. You know this may be positively impacted by the fact that we have just announced two new product lines and the sales force is ecstatic of having these leadership products and hence they are pushing them very, very hard and those are the customers that I got to see, but overall my impression is that the design activity on FPGAs has not gone down. I see a lot of customers who, what we call ASIC refugees who used to design ASICs are now transitioning those people to design FPGAs, so that might be the other trend, I would say that over all the number of FPGAs and funds FPGAs which have been designed is going up best I can tell.", "John Barton \u2013 Cowen", "And Jon you had mentioned lower mass cost in the March quarter is one of the things that impacted the numbers, it certainly didn't seem in any other statements as there has been any type of product delays of push outs or whatever the case may be, what was or why were we seeing low mass charges relative to the expectations and am I correct that nothing has slowed down?", "Jon Olson", "Yes John you are correct nothing has slowed down. This was just something that was in the forecast that is happening in the last week of the quarter and pushed over to the first week of the following quarter and it just moves from dollars from the last week to the first week there was no delays or anything it was just an estimated forecast that we had the budget tied to and it moved out a little bit, but there are no product delay implication on any issue going on that caused from a product quality perspective.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with JP Morgan.", "Chris Danely \u2013 JP Morgan", "Hi guys thanks for squeezing me in. Jon you talked about the revenue from China might get a little bit in Q3, excuse me in the September quarter, would you expected it to rebound and be back at the June quarter level by the December quarter?", "Jon Olson", "Well I mean the level that we \u2013 we do think it is going to come back Chris and right now I would say we think it is going to come back to that level and some of that is around the wideband CDMA rollout. We are now selling parts in the wideband CDMA infrastructure, previous couple of quarters ago was only TD-SCDMA, so we are starting to say I will say two technologies different technologies that have their unique cycles and we're trying to match those things up, but I would anticipate that the December quarter for us to be a combination of wideband NTD [ph] technologies and right now I would estimate that it would come back up.", "Chris Danely \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay great and then my follow-up, with all this restructuring and transfer of employees, could your tax rate go down at all because of this?", "Jon Olson", "Not because of what we are doing, we've taken some measures in that area, it has been difficult to reflect them in our ASICs because we\u2019ve had all these other transactions going on like the debt buyback and whatever. So, I wouldn't anticipate any big reset of the download of the tax rate, I think it is going to be pretty stable in the low 20s.", "Chris Danely \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wachovia.", "David Wong \u2013 Wachovia", "Thank you very much. Can you tell is what products before provide sort of biggest market potential for Spartan?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. Spartan, this is Moshe, Spartan is actually used very, very broadly and so it is used obviously in areas that you would align with high volume, which is the consumer market and the automotive market, but it actually has very broad footprint and it is being used on the infrastructure and military applications too in higher volume opportunities, so it is actually in terms of its spread it has tremendous applicability and you know it is one of the areas where having leadership product in the fastest-growing markets, which we believe that inherently these will continue to be the fastest-growing markets even though, you know it is obviously challenged kind now, but this leadership position with the best product, the leadership product will enable us to grow very rapidly in all of those areas and you will see it across the board, you'll see it on consumer, you'll see it on automotive, you'll see it in industrial and military and in communications both on the wireless and the wired side. The product is very attractive product and when you look at the \u2013 what you could do with a leading-edge Spartan chip, this generation is equivalent to what you could do with high end Virtex chip two generations ago so, you know it is a very significant set of functionality and that is why it can be used in numerous applications.", "David Wong \u2013 Wachovia", "Right thanks very much.", "Maria Quillard", "Operator will have one more question please.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Suma Dhondo [ph] with Merrill Lynch.", "Suma Dhondo \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Hi, afternoon guys. John, I just wanted a clarification on the benefit from phase 1 of your program, is that all of that benefit reflected by Q1 or is that phased in over the next few quarters?", "Jon Olson", "So you have to kind of dissect the total spending number less the restructuring charge and then the answer is yes, you know that all that is reflected in our underlying rate. So, we did significantly reduce the number of heads in the company this quarter making a decision to do that very early and then in the second phase is as we start to a higher more heads throughout the year to replace other people that will be leaving later in the company. So, the initial phase is this $4 million to $5 million benefit that's the underlying benefit after you net out the restructuring charge and that is kind of our new true run rate of the company. And then as we do this swap of hiring more people and transferring knowledge, we will get some incremental benefits from that although some of that benefit ends up being spent in these extra mass costs later on the year etcetera and so trying not to confuse you and hopefully I have it.", "Suma Dhondo \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Just to be clear the Q1 number also includes all the benefits on the executive actions that you have taken in the quarter?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Yes, it does.", "Suma Dhondo \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "The second question I have is, you know your competition is being quite vocal about what you \u2013 what they are seeing with their new 40 nm product of statics for product highlighting their projected revenue benefit from that ramp, you know and your clearly very excited about the Virtex-6 launch, I'm wondering whether you'll be providing any benchmarks of milestones in terms of how that revenue ramp in particular is proceeding over the next few quarters so that we can compare, you know was it really getting the upper hand?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "There is no doubt that they announced their products earlier than us and had design wins earlier than us, what we believe we have now is leadership on that product front, we will be rolling out all of the derivatives by the end of this year and in parallel we will have Spartan-6, which at this point has unquestionable leadership in a market which is growing very rapidly in our mind and so now, you know you can look at various things, the initial numbers in terms of reaching a threshold in terms of shipments mean relatively little, it is actually the design wins and how quickly they'll convert to revenue and that takes a year plus on Spartan side and three years on the Virtex side before they achieve large numbers and in the interim what we will be driving our results is Virtex-5 for the next few quarters, you know which is running at a very high level than we expect it to grow. So, the impact will be minimal to be honest and that is just because it takes three years to reach high volume to the point where it is interesting. So, we will try and provide you with some feeling, but you know arguing over who got to $1 million first is not necessarily useful, it is the breadth of the product offering and the range of it and the long-term implication that is a little more difficult to quantify.", "Suma Dhondo \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Maybe just a quick follow-up on that, do you feel that the initial revenue trajectory is even meaningful in terms of determining perhaps who is getting a better share of the prototyping market which your competition assess to be something in the region of a couple of hundred million dollars a year?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. So, on the prototyping market they typically use the company with the most advanced technology and the highest capacity, we are going to have that real soon. And you know, the customers, it is an ongoing event, it is not a one-time, write a prototype continuously and we will have the best product and the highest capacity product for that market and these customers primarily have used us in the past for doing prototyping and I think to be honest both companies where the major players in this market are going to benefit significantly from this transition to 40 nm and I think we are seeing tremendous opportunities as undoubtedly there are to and I believe that these opportunities are not only stealing sockets away from each other, it is actually accelerating the demise of ASICs and replacing ASSPs, which we are both benefiting from. So, I don't think it is a zero sum gain from my perspective, I think we are both going to benefit from it and each of the target application has a different uptick and it is true that prototyping happens a little earlier because they need the largest chip and we intend to have the largest chip.", "Suma Dhondo \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you.", "Maria Quillard", "Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us today. We have a playback of this call beginning at 5:00 pm Pacific Time, 8:00 pm Eastern. For a copy of our earnings release, please visit our IR website.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx\u2019s first quarter fiscal year 2010 earnings release conference call. (Operator instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Maria Quillard. Thank you. Ms. Quillard, you may begin your conference.", "Maria Quillard", "Thank you and good afternoon to everyone. With me today are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review for the June quarter and then we will open the call for questions.", "This quarter we changed our revenue by product category classification. The last time we changed this classification was three years ago. We do this on a regular basis as product families age and new products are introduced making the product categories more meaningful for investors. A five quarter history of both the new and old methodology is posted on our Investor Relations website under the Quarterly Results page. ", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially.", "We refer you to the documents the company files with the SEC including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. This conference call is open to all and is being web cast live. It can be accessed from our Investor Relations website.", "Now let me turn the call over to Jon Olson.", "Jon Olson", "Thank you Maria, during today\u2019s commentary I will review our business results for the June quarter. I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the September quarter. June quarter sales decreased 5% sequentially to $376.2 million in line with the revised guidance we provided on July 2. ", "Compared to the same quarter a year ago total sales were down 23%. Turns business was 57% for the quarter down from 66% in the prior quarter. I\u2019d like to take a couple of minutes now to discuss the supply constraints that impacted Xilinx during the June quarter. ", "These constraints were primarily related to certain Virtex-5 devices which were in high demand. Yields of our wafers out of the factory met our expectation. The biggest factor leading to the constraints pertained to the ramp up of our foundries from a very low utilization level to a high utilization level resulting in through put issues. ", "We were aware early in the quarter that a limited set of V-5 parts were constrained. However achieving our revenue range is dependent on a mix of turns which is difficult to forecast. In the last four weeks of the quarter more turns than we had anticipated were for the impacted Virtex-5 parts. ", "Removing the business impact of the supply constraints we estimate our June quarter sales would have been essentially flat sequentially and Virtex-5 sales would have approached 20% of total sales. ", "As Maria mentioned earlier we reclassified our product categories during the quarter to better reflect the introduction of new products and the maturing of other products. Based on our revised category definitions, new product sales increased 3% sequentially and 60% on a year over year basis. ", "Mainstream and base products experienced sequential declines of 6% and 8% respectively. From a geographic perspective Asia Pacific was the only region to experience sales growth during the quarter increasing 2% sequentially to represent a record 37% of total sales. ", "With respect to communications in Asia Pacific region wireless sales were up sequentially and wire line sales were down. Sales from North America, Europe, and Japan were down 6%, 13%, and 4% sequentially respectively. ", "North America sales were characterized by strength in wire communications that was offset by all other end markets. European sales decreased sequentially in all end markets except consumer which was flat. In Japan consumer sales increased while sales from all of other end markets decreased. ", "In terms of our vertical markets, sales from all major end market categories declined sequentially. Communication sales decreased 2% sequentially representing 49% of total sales up from 47% in the prior quarter. Declines from wire line more than offset slight growth from wireless. The industrial and other end market declined as expected. Defense sales were approximately flat but declining sales from industrial, scientific and medical and test and measurement. ", "Sales from industrial and other currently represent 31% of total sales, down from 32% in the prior quarter. Consumer and automotive sales declined 5% sequentially during the quarter. Pure consumer sales increased driven by growth in flat panel and set top box designs but was offset by weakness in audio video broadcast and automotive. ", "Consumer sales now represents 14% of total sales, flat with the prior quarter. Lastly data processing sales declined 19% sequentially to 6% of total sales down from 7% in the prior quarter due to broad based weakness. ", "Gross margin for the quarter was 61.8% down from 62.1% in the prior quarter as the mix of customers was skewed towards large customers versus small customers. R&D and SG&A expense declined over 5% sequentially to $157 million, lower than anticipated as a result of continued spending discipline during the quarter. ", "Restructuring expense was $15.8 million, higher than our guidance of $11 to $13 million. A greater number of employees impacted by the transition were notified of their status in fiscal Q1 than was previously anticipated. Additionally we anticipate the full year estimate of restructuring reserve required to complete the transition will be approximately $26 million. ", "This amount is slightly higher than the previous estimate of $21 to $23 million due to higher retention expenses and some modification in employee packages. The remaining $10 million post Q1 recognition of expenses are expected to be spread over the September, December and March quarters of fiscal 2010.", "While the timing of the charges are dependent on achieving transition milestones, we expect most of this charge to be incurred in the September and December quarters. Net income during the quarter was $38 million or $0.14 per diluted share. And was impacted by a couple of factors. ", "First we reversed $8.7 million of interest income recognized in previous quarters related to the loss of a court case on tax matters that I will discuss shortly. Secondly as I just mentioned our restructuring charges were approximately $3 million higher than anticipated. Collectively these items represented approximate $0.07 per diluted share after tax. ", "Operating cash flow for the March quarter was $128 million before $5 million in CapEx and we paid $39 million in cash dividends. The tax rate in the March quarter was 18%, lower than the 21% previously forecasted. The reduction is primarily due to the restructuring charges previously discussed, refinements of earlier accruals to our tax litigation and other uncertain tax positions, and the fact that our US income is lower due to the declining revenues associated with the economic realities. ", "With regard to the tax litigation mentioned a few times, on March 27, 2009 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in a two to one decision, reversed an earlier tax court decision and found that the company should include stock options in its cost sharing agreements. ", "This issue impacts fiscal years 1996 and forward. As you can imagine there are many complexities associated with the accounting treatment. That being said, we had accrued a significant portion of the liability. There was an impact to the current period interest income and expense as stated previously, a charge in accruals for uncertain tax positions including a refinement to our reserve for cost sharing of stock option, and an adjustment to various balance sheet accounts associated with the accruals. ", "We believe that the Ninth Circuit Court majority decided the case incorrectly and we plan on filing a petition in Q2 fiscal 2010 seeking a re hearing. Let me now comment on the balance sheet, cash and investments increased $102 million during the quarter to $1.8 billion. We have approximately $690 million in convertible debt and our net cash position is approximately $1.1 billion. ", "In Q1 we implemented a new accounting treatment for convertible debt, FSPAPB 14-1. This required accounting treatment impacts how the nature of our debt instrument is reflected in the balance sheet and through the P&L and also adjusts our historic presentation of the balance sheet and income statement. ", "Specifically we have reclassed approximately $338 million of the outstanding balance of $690 million from long-term debt to the equity section of the balance sheet in the June quarter. This amount will be amortized over the remaining 28 year life to the long-term debt category with some charge to the interest expense line. ", "Our obligation to debt holders remains at $690 million at the end of the quarter regardless of the accounting presentation. Day sales outstanding decreased three days in the June quarter to 47 days. Combined inventory days in the March quarter were 78, down from 90 days in the prior quarter and below our stated inventory target of 90 to 100 days. We are expecting inventory levels to grow to the low end of our corporate target in the September quarter. ", "Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the September quarter of fiscal 2010. Our backlog in the September quarter is up in double-digits but primarily a result of our increased delinquencies. We continue to be cautious about the overall demand environment but have observed signs of stability in selected end markets. ", "On the positive side however we are experiencing growth from Virtex-5 during the quarter as supply constraints are relieved and this product continues to gain traction in the market. As a result we are expecting sales to be up 2% to 6% sequentially in the September quarter with all geographies flat to up slightly with the exception of Europe. ", "From an end market perspective we expect communication sales to be flattish sequentially with potential declines from wire line communications offset by potential increases in wireless communication. ", "Industrial and other business is expected to increase slightly sequentially as increases in test and measurement and defense sales are offset by decreased industrial, scientific and medical sales. We are expecting consumer and data processing to be up sequentially. The mid part of our sales guidance is predicated on returns rate in the low 50\u2019s. ", "Gross margin is expected to be approximately 61% sequentially due to the fact that we expect to experience stronger than typical growth in our new products which are slightly below corporate gross margin coupled with customer mix which we are anticipating to be skewed to our larger customers that drive high volume business.

However first I\u2019d like to emphasize that Jon and I have worked in concert during the past 18 months to establish and operating structure that prioritizes financial rigor and efficiency.", "To that extent I am exceptionally pleased with the progress we have made in introducing our next generation product while working in a far more disciplined framework. The March quarter we introduced and began sampling initial devices in both Spartan-6 and Virtex-6 product families. ", "This quarter we released our newest software to the public which significantly improves run times, quality, and overall capacity. This latest software which supports both and all of the Spartan-6 and the Virtex-6 FPGA devices is currently being widely adopted by our very broad base of several thousands of customers. ", "Our Spartan-6 family is the industry\u2019s first and only high volume 45-nm FPGA family shipping today. This is a very important milestone for Xilinx because it makes us far more competitive in the high volume arena. As the lowest cost and lowest power FPGA solution on the market customer demand for Spartan-6 is high. ", "Spartan-6 LXT devices which for the first time offer low cost integrated transceivers along with PCIE are beginning to be designed into our customers\u2019 next generation products including digital displays, software defined radio, ultrasound equipment, and driver assist programs. ", "Furthermore we are encouraged by our foundry partner, Samsung, and their progress to date. Samsung was a natural foundry choice for Spartan-6 giving their proven manufacturer of advanced high volume, low power solution. ", "In addition to the silicon and software [pre verified] reference designs targeting Spartan-6 devices, with fully integrated evaluation kits are now shipping. These kits are expanding our customer base by providing tools which [inaudible] PGA designers can very quickly learn to use to program FPGAs. ", "They help our customers shorten their development cycles, focus their engineering resources on creating greater product differentiation. On the high end our 40-nm Virtex-6 FPGA family extends our undisputed leadership position. Virtex-6 is the lowest power, highest capacity, and higher performance FPGA on the market. ", "Virtex-6 has 15% higher performance and 50% lower system power consumption compared to competitive 40-nm FPGA offerings. Quoting activity has been strong and we are very pleased with design win momentum so far. ", "Like Spartan-6 we are shipping Virtex-6 FPGA evaluation kits. These are the first in a series of kits that Xilinx will offer throughout this year designed to simplify the evaluation and development of our latest generation of programmable technology. Coming later a more specific evaluation kits aimed at engineers in a particular technical area such as connectivity or DSP. ", "After that we will be introducing market specific kits aimed at unique high growth end markets. In summary I am extremely pleased with our next generation product development efforts. In parallel our continued focus on operating model improvement has allowed us to develop these products while improving our expense structure.

", "Xilinx\u2019s strong new product portfolio should allow us to take advantage of future growth opportunities as we continue to benefit from accelerated ASIC and ASSP replacement. All of this is being accomplished while operating with a more financially disciplined framework. ", "This is reflected in the reduction of our operating expenses. The June quarter SG&A expense is down 21%, R&D expense is down 8% versus the same quarter of the prior year. Simply put we\u2019re spending more responsibly while improving our product portfolio and competitive position. ", "Now let me turn the call over for your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "Let me start off by asking a quick question as to what confidence you have now that the supply chain constraints that you had in the initial ramp last quarter is completely dealt with now and for the guidance you have in the current quarter, that those issues will not be repeated. Then secondly I just want to get a sense of what, where gross margins could go going forward if you can give us a sense as to what the long-term model will be. There was a kind of expectation from last quarter that we should be heading up, but given the poor [inaudible] in gross margin in the current quarter is there any sense that we should get as to what the long-term model should be. ", "Moshe Gavrielov ", "With regards to our guidance this reflects all of the data we have today and there is always some uncertainty but we believe that the issues have been addressed and we\u2019re moving forward with vigor to supply all of the parts that our customers have ordered from us. ", "Jon Olson ", "I\u2019ll just make one comment about the supply chain, we certainly have gone into quite a detailed level in going through this handful or so of parts that we are limited on and I think we\u2019ve been working very closely on I\u2019ll say at least a daily basis, maybe even closer to an hourly basis with our foundry partners to fill that gap up. ", "So consistent with what Moshe said, you don\u2019t know what could happen but we think we\u2019ll have for the most part we\u2019ll have this alleviated in a quarter. With respect to your gross margin question of where it could go, I think in the last call I was probably a little more bullish about how fast gross margin might go back up but quite frankly it really is dependant on a lot of different kinds of mix issues and just to give you a little bit of information, if you look at our top 50 customers and the decline, the percentage decline in our business from them from the peak which was one year, a quarter ago, Q1 in fiscal 2009 then look at the remainder of our customers so the broad base of all these other customers, the revenue impact is pretty stark. ", "Its approaching three times the percentage decline for the broad base customers and the top 50 and that customer mix if you will, has a pretty significant impact and can be a point or two drag on our margin in terms of our model, a point or two changing is pretty significant for us. ", "In addition to the fixed cost absorption issue that we do have with lower revenue as I would anticipate, as revenue picks up we will pick up some of those broad based customers and in those situations we tend to have better margins because its volume based issue. They pay us a higher price for a lower volume than the very large customers that we have. ", "So I\u2019m still confident that our long-term model is 63 to 65. The question is when does that mix start getting back into balance as the economic situation comes back on balance. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Randy Abrams \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Randy Abrams \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I want to follow-up on the margin mix issue and if you could talk about how much is coming from having sequentially in the third quarter from the small customer mix and how much of it is a factor of the 65-nm business that pushed out booking next quarter and is that a function that a quarter or two from now you could get further along on the yield curve if its less of a factor. ", "Jon Olson ", "Clearly as we move along the yield curve and the foundries get up to high utilization again at the tool set, I think all those things tend to work in our favor. But even though our yields out of the factory are reasonable, we\u2019re just not getting enough wafers and we need to get enough wafers out and we need to get to the other side of that and I think we will get the normal acceleration of that margin on newer products. ", "With respect to the next quarter, our Q2 fiscal 2010 which is Q3 calendar, the customer mix will be a little more skewed. It will continue to get a little more skewed to the top customers particularly because the delinquencies are focused on these larger customers that are focused on a variety of applications. China wireless is probably the leading application for that and that tends to have some downward margin pressure which is why we\u2019ve guided the mid point down, the mid point of our range down effectively a point. ", "Randy Abrams \u2013 Credit Suisse", "A quarter ago you mentioned the concern about the gap in third quarter and the push out obviously helps a bit but did anything else change in terms of the China program on bookings to give you a bit more confidence and if you were to say forward visibility, if you were to think about into second half of continued momentum there. ", "Jon Olson ", "It\u2019s hard to have a lot of confidence going forward with the supply situation we\u2019re in and the long lead times. So we have the issue of our key customers in the China area knowing that we have longer lead times so their ordering patterns have had to I would assume have had to have changed some. That gives us some mixed signals. While we\u2019re catching up we\u2019re certainly aware that the contracts for the next phase are starting to be whispered and rumored who\u2019s winning and there\u2019s been some adjustment of cancellations, push outs, changes, what parts they want among the broad base of customers that are supporting China. ", "So I would expect this sorts itself out in the next quarter as the awards become more public and they get their ordering patterns together, but right now it\u2019s a little hard for me to look ahead another quarter with much confidence just because I think we\u2019re in the realignment of backlog period right now. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung \u2013 Citi", "Glen Yeung \u2013 Citi", "If I were to look at the nitpicky numbers here and did some math on your September quarter guidance its actually slightly above normal seasonal, I wonder if I\u2019m being to nitpicky or is there something I read into that. ", "Jon Olson ", "In speaking of the revenue guidance, actually I think its fairly in line with seasonal. We said that the delinquencies essentially would have had us more in the mid point of our range and if you add that back to, then compare that, add that to where we\u2019re going to end up, we\u2019re within a few million dollars of revenue of that and seasonally we\u2019re normally flat to down a little bit, a point or two. ", "And so that kind of explains adding back the five percentage points that we\u2019re off and the mid point range is the 4% growth and so that would put us net down 1%. If you could kind of rebalance those delinquencies. ", "Glen Yeung \u2013 Citi", "I think I might be getting different math but the net of it is you\u2019re suggesting that your guidance is largely seasonal at this point. ", "Jon Olson ", "Yes. ", "Glen Yeung \u2013 Citi", "And then I heard your commentary about China wireless, I understand its always hard to pick and choose especially when those orders haven\u2019t been defined yet, but what about on the wire line side there, what\u2019s your sense as to one the trajectory of demand, and then perhaps I don\u2019t know if its more importantly but also I guess the conditions of inventory change in that business. Are we at a point now where people are no longer reducing inventory and are actually trying to build some back into the wire line business. ", "Jon Olson ", "If I think about the wire line business and first talk about the networking infrastructure piece, I think we are seeing stabilization. I think that\u2019s one of the points that I made that were in terms of some of the pieces where we are seeing stabilization. I think we do feel in the network infrastructure piece that orders are more stable, they\u2019re done cutting inventory and now we\u2019re back to more normal demand sell through kinds of situations. That doesn\u2019t mean every quarter goes up from here but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see, if you drew a line starting with this quarter out in time, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see a big trend down or much of a trend down at all. I think you\u2019ll see some ups and downs of a few million plus or minus. ", "I think we feel pretty good about that environment being stabilized. The rest of the wire line is not necessarily that case. We continue to experience downs this quarter in the rest of the wire line so its, I can\u2019t predict that we\u2019re stabilized there yet. [inaudible] and those kinds of things, I don\u2019t necessarily feel like its stable yet. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert Baird", "Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert Baird", "Given that the supply constraints appear to be behind, do you expect Virtex-5 to reach 20% of revenues in the September quarter and also when do you think Virtex-5 margins get to the corporate average. ", "Jon Olson ", "We do think Virtex-5 will be in that range of 20% next quarter. I\u2019m not giving you a hard number but plus or minus a percent or so. We should be in that range. Virtex-5 [yields] and margins are not far off that corporate margins. I hope that didn\u2019t get characterized too negative but nonetheless I think on average as the broad base of V-5 demand picks back up and even with the price pressures of the very large China wireless business, I think overall those margins within a quarter or two are pretty much dead center of the corporate model. ", "Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert Baird", "And also you mentioned OpEx guidance for the year, looking at SG&A and R&D so excluding the restructuring we\u2019re still at level higher than a few years ago or in other words if we had basically the same OpEx when your revenues were 15 or 20% higher how much room is there to further cut operating expenses and maybe give us a sense of what can be done longer-term beyond the near-term steps you\u2019ve been taking. ", "Jon Olson ", "The data that I looked at, remember that we did have restructuring in last year\u2019s expense number as well so you have to take out, if you\u2019re trying to do this without this one large lump in both years, you take those out, and then if you just compare that to all the historic years before that plus or minus when stock option expensing started to hit OpEx, I think you\u2019ll see a pretty significant decline over the last three or four years in spending. ", "And I think Moshe was trying to point that out that we\u2019re very committed to continuing to run in an efficient operating model and clearly as revenue goes back up we\u2019re not going to be adding spending at the same rate that we had declined in those time periods. ", "So we continue to look for opportunities to take cost out of the company broadly. We announced last quarter this multi quarter transition plan which is what\u2019s the driver of the restructuring expenses in there which is a matter of taking some positions out of the company now and then throughout the next several quarters and then building up that capability in Asia and that is ongoing and as we get to the end of it at the end of our fiscal year we should see some more spending improvement on top of that. ", "That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re at the end, that just means that we\u2019re at the end of this particular phase. We have other ideas and other things that we\u2019re thinking about in order to take more dollars out. So we are committed to taking dollars out and getting more product out per engineering dollar over time. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely \u2013 JPMorgan", "Chris Danely \u2013 JPMorgan", "I know you\u2019re not talking about anything beyond this quarter but can you give us a sense of what now that things are getting back to normal I guess somewhat, what do you think normal seasonality will be for the December quarter. ", "Jon Olson ", "I don\u2019t know are we normal, what does the manifesto say about that. I\u2019m not sure. We still think, we think there\u2019s a seasonal December quarter ahead of us and we think that\u2019s again will be helped supported by A&D and to some degree consumer business. While the consumer business is not showing the same level of seasonality as it has in the past it is going up and we\u2019ve been very successful in our designs in that area. ", "And so we still feel that that has growth in this next quarter and the following quarter as well. So those are two bright spots. If the wireless business is at least stable at this higher level, I would think we would end up seasonally up in December if I were estimating sitting here today. ", "Chris Danely \u2013 JPMorgan", "By the way, I\u2019ve changed from the manifesto to the Dairy Queen, I guess that\u2019s the only way I\u2019m going to get a double dip. As my second question, on the OpEx side, going forward is there anything we need to look out for in terms of [mask] costs or can you expect OpEx to trend up but less than sales from here on out. ", "Jon Olson ", "So we clearly are still in the adding several million of [masks] per quarter between this last quarter that we just announced and the coming quarter that we\u2019re in right now and then again in the December quarter, going up and then they will come back down, start to come back down a little bit. ", "I think we still are going to experience some rollercoaster up and down but because we put both product families on top of each other even though we\u2019ve done a number of things to control our costs by the way, things have gone, we\u2019re going to see this trend up for two quarters and then back down a few quarters. ", "The other thing that\u2019s hitting us in the December quarter which is not necessarily something that\u2019s easy to talk about but we do have a even week calendar in this company and we happen to have a 53 week year in fiscal 2010 and our extra week of spending is in the December quarter. So that 14th week of spending is in the December quarter and that accounts for approximately $8 million of spending increase that\u2019s going to hit us. ", "So there\u2019s going to be a spike up in December on spending for this extra week of spending along with a few million dollars of [mast] increase. ", "Chris Danely \u2013 JPMorgan", "But then I guess the spike down in the March quarter, right. ", "Jon Olson ", "Yes. Then you\u2019ll see that $8 million going away in the March quarter along with mask expense going down several million dollars. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "I just want to make sure I\u2019m totally clear on your guidance for the OpEx sequentially, can you just talk us through, you\u2019re saying that if you, excluding the $5 million of restructuring the OpEx number which was 157 excluding the $15 million of restructuring is now going to be flat or you\u2019re saying its going to be 175 basically minus 5. Can you just talk through that and then maybe talk through what the expectation should be for December just to be clear.", "Jon Olson ", "So the forecast for the September quarter was $175 million of OpEx and included in that was $5 million of restructuring so that\u2019s $170 million. ", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "So actually its going up $10 million in OpEx.", "Jon Olson ", "No actually its going up\u2014", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Once you exclude the restructuring but you add it to the June period. And that\u2019s just mask costs. ", "Jon Olson ", "So in that $11 million is several things, one is mask costs are going up $3 to $5 million, that kind of a range. If you dissect the same numbers for Q1 you\u2019ll see that we under spent our base OpEx and specifically what happened is we didn\u2019t hire people into the transition positions like we had anticipated. And that was worth several million dollars of lower spending in Q1.", "We will catch up with that hiring. So we have the catch up of that hiring going on in Q2, let\u2019s say a few million dollars along with the mask costs, and our revenue is higher so we have a couple of million dollars of commissions and other profit dependent kinds of expenses that we have. That sort of explains this $10-ish million that you threw at me. ", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "And then for December. ", "Jon Olson ", "So then for the December quarter we have slightly less restructuring, a small decrease in restructuring and we also have several million dollars of mask costs that are going up but we also have this extra week of spending because of the 14th week in that quarter which is approximately $8 million. So you\u2019ll see us go up again. ", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "It seems a little more elevated than the ranges in the sort of 165-ish that you had outlined previously. Does that mean the masks costs are in some ways sort of accelerated in terms of spending or what is the key variable. ", "Jon Olson ", "There\u2019s only a little bit of mask costs. Some of it is this 14th week I really didn\u2019t talk about a lot and I didn\u2019t give a full year forecast last time in this kind of granularity and decided that because I think that I wasn\u2019t as clear as maybe I could have been, I thought I would do it this time and give you a little more detail. ", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "And then in guiding for the gross margin to go back up in December the revenue inference you referred to seasonality in December what do you perceive the fairly normal seasonality to be for the December quarter. ", "Jon Olson ", "I don\u2019t know, I think our history has been a pretty wide range but its typically a few, two to four, three to five kind of a percentage range is typical but I\u2019m not necessarily forecasting that, I\u2019m just giving you what the typical range. ", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Maybe you could remind us what March is usually. ", "Jon Olson ", "March is usually up a few more percentage points as well from that. ", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Just on the industrial side, just to clarify, you said that I think in the quarter that the military was slightly up and how did the other segments do and how do you see industrial broadly into the second half. ", "Jon Olson ", "Industrial is a bit of a quandary for us because broad based industrial is really weak and since we also classify aerospace and defense in that category we do have the seasonal effect of flat to up this coming quarter and then usually up in December. And we are experiencing weakness in broad base industrial that speaks to a lot of these smaller customers that I talked about earlier on the call that those percentage of small customers are declining as a percent of our total revenue and then scientific and medical is also been sequentially weak for us.

", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Wu \u2013 Global Crown Research", "David Wu \u2013 Global Crown Research", "Can you give a little bit more clarity on the September quarter because if I assume that your let\u2019s say roughly $20 million number that should have been in the June quarter got transferred into the September quarter and is that, or is it half of that actually you play catch up in the September quarter because when I look at the numbers at least my numbers would say that roughly half of that $20 million catch up in September quarter and also can you remind us what kind of a turns assumption are you assuming for the September quarter. ", "Jon Olson ", "My math on this is that the decline that we had which was a minus 5%, 5% of that number would be in the neighborhood of $25 million if we were trying to be whole, and we\u2019re going back only 4% back up 4% at the mid point of that 5% so we\u2019re about $20 million being added back. And that happens to be relatively close to our delinquency number and so to me I think it still is self, at least for my number set is self consistent. ", "David Wu \u2013 Global Crown Research", "The assumption about the turns business\u2014", "Jon Olson ", "Low 50\u2019s for turns, so we\u2019ve gotten cautious in terms of the turns business we have although we\u2019re obviously we\u2019re fairly well booked on our China wireless because of the delinquencies. From a dollar base turns perspective we\u2019d have to have about the same dollars, slightly lower dollar turns in the quarter in order to achieve the mid point of our range. So I think we\u2019re being both fair and a little cautious that some end markets are still not stabilized.

", "Jon Olson ", "That\u2019s a really difficult question. I think in the I\u2019ll say in the more advanced SOC spaces, think of line cards and things like that, a lot of these people were converting V-4 designs to V-5 but we also have a lot of older Virtex cards, V-2 Pro, Virtex and Virtex E that still are in designs and particularly in wire line applications they have been in designs and now converting over to V-5. ", "Moshe Gavrielov ", "The other thing to keep in mind is that as we continue to move forward aggressively with new process nodes you are seeing more ASIC convert to FPGAs because the new FPGAs have the appropriate level of serial connectivity in terms of bandwidth. They have the higher performance and they have higher capacity so we\u2019re seeing quite a bit of that. This isn\u2019t just an old FPGA being replaced by a new one, or several old ones being replaced by one new one. ", "Its also ASIC and other applications now being redesigned into FPGAs and we see a lot of that too. So I would say there\u2019s two branches. There\u2019s conversions of old FPGAs and then there\u2019s just new business which is enabled by the enhanced capability and we\u2019re seeing more of the latter with each generation of product as less and less ASIC are viable due to the cost and the risk and all of that. ", "Plus in some cases ASSPs are getting phased out in particular in key communications functions. And that\u2019s a trend which we expect, we\u2019re seeing it, it has already started and we expect it to accelerate in the future.

", "Jon Olson ", "I don\u2019t have, we did this percentage range thing that\u2019s the 2% to 4% without restructuring. We had about $22 million of restructuring last year\u2019s OpEx and this year we\u2019re saying we have $26 million, so you have to subtract both those numbers from our OpEx and you can figure it out.

I\u2019m just wondering if given the OpEx increase and the margin decline, other than revenues coming back is there anything else that you could do here to kind of take the margins up from these levels toward your longer-term model.

", "Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets ", "Maybe you won\u2019t have that answer in front of you but what will help if you can sometime circle back and talk about, say if we go back to September 2008 quarter if that was a normal quarter, now that there is so many things changing if you come back to that level, where should be the gross margin and OpEx, that will be a good comparison to have so that we can model properly. Are you in a position to give us some idea on where your R&D and SG&A would have trended at these levels\u2014", "Jon Olson ", "Well again, there\u2019s customer mix and product family mix and those kinds of things, since I haven\u2019t looked at all the mix implications of that from either our peak revenue and gross margin which was Q1 of fiscal year 2009, or should say September of 2008, but that was back even a year. We\u2019ve changed so much of the company since then its kind of difficult. I would certainly expect if we got our revenues back up into the high $400 million a quarter number like where we were before we would be back in the same relative range of gross margin that we had back when we had that in Q1 of 2009.", "Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets ", "How about operating expense. ", "Jon Olson ", "Operating expense is coming down, it would definitely be lower. Again I gave the comparison for what we think FY10 is versus all of FY09 and what the drop is going to be even with these increased mask costs that we had year on year we still had this drop which is pretty significant. That would indicate that on a go forward basis we\u2019re going to enjoy some better comparative percentages of R&D expense as a percent of revenue particularly as revenue comes up. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Benjamin \u2013 Jeffries & Company ", "Adam Benjamin \u2013 Jeffries & Company ", "I was wondering if you could comment a little bit about the China mobile that just got awarded and if that\u2019s factored into the guidance that you\u2019ve given. I know that these things come quickly and there\u2019s fits and starts so I\u2019m just curious. That\u2019s very recent, I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s factored in and then secondly in terms of your exposure are you significantly exposed to ZT and Walway specifically. ", "Moshe Gavrielov ", "Generally speaking these rollouts take quite a long time and the guidance we\u2019ve given you for the current quarter has the rollout as we understand it. And as our customers have placed and are placing orders and there\u2019s a bit more visibility just due to shortages which have extended lead times. So the short answer is yes and we have broad penetration in several of the suppliers actually, best I know, in all of the suppliers in different programs at different levels and so it\u2019s a bit of a difficult matrix to figure out because there are numerous suppliers and there are numerous standards and they\u2019re being rolled out in difference cities at different times. ", "But we think we\u2019re getting a good portion of the revenue and this is driven by our very strong Virtex-5 position and as new ones get designed then Virtex-5 and Spartan-6 and Virtex-6 in particular are very well designed or developed and targeted to address those specific markets. ", "So no, we expect to continue to benefit as that continues to rollout. I wouldn\u2019t say regardless of the mixes but generally speaking we are in a good position in all of the scenarios. ", "Jon Olson ", "One of the things I mentioned in my comments was about we did have some push out, changes of parts, etc. going on, changes in the backlog particularly in June and I think that was the beginning of the awards and people readjusting their backlog for the right parts at the right time. While I can\u2019t guarantee all those have worked itself through our backlog for next quarter I think some of those have and I think our estimates are pretty decent. ", "Adam Benjamin \u2013 Jeffries & Company ", "Maybe asked a little bit differently you at one point talked about a little bit of a hole in Q3 for wireless and now you\u2019re talking about some slight growth there, so I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of your ability to accurately forecast given the fluctuations in those customers and so given the past how would you say your accuracy has been in terms of forecasting that segment. ", "Jon Olson ", "Well actually I think our accuracy has been pretty good because we did have a hole and while the hole was slightly shallower than what I saw a quarter ago, the delinquency rollover has filled up the hole. It hasn\u2019t exceeded the hole much but it has at least filled that up so I think our accuracy at least in the one quarter out horizon in the China business has been pretty accurate. ", "Adam Benjamin \u2013 Jeffries & Company ", "And then a follow-up as it relates to the gross margin ticking back up in the December quarter I think you talked about a mix back to small customers, just in terms of your lead times and your turns business what gives you the confidence there, is it just the mix issue and the mix to aerospace and defense and what other puts and takes are there that would support that higher margin. ", "Jon Olson ", "So it isn\u2019t the smaller customers in the December quarter but it is aerospace and defense and consumer for sure. Those are two areas and probably automotive goes up in that quarter as well as new designs are rolled out in that area. So those are the segments that I would think would probably be better for us in terms of the typical seasonal impact for that.", "The small customer, large customer thing, its not clear to me how that\u2019s going to change dramatically until the overall economic situation gets better. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Wong \u2013 Wells Fargo", "David Wong \u2013 Wells Fargo", "A clarification, you said that the Spartan-6 I think is done at Samsung, is Virtex-6 also done at Samsung and is Samsung the only fab that you\u2019re using for these two product lines. \\", "Moshe Gavrielov ", "We typically for each new generation of technology we have two foundries, the foundries for Spartan-6 and Virtex-6 are UMC and Samsung. ", "David Wong \u2013 Wells Fargo", "And the samples are coming out of Samsung at the moment or are they coming out of UMC. ", "Moshe Gavrielov ", "Spartan-6 are coming out of Samsung. ", "David Wong \u2013 Wells Fargo", "And Virtex-6.", "Moshe Gavrielov ", "They\u2019re coming out of UMC. ", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda \u2013 BAS-ML", "Sumit Dhanda \u2013 BAS-ML", "Earlier in the year when you implemented some restructuring actions, you had suggested that you would see benefits from supply chain efficiency efforts, are all those benefits factored into the down 2 to 4% ex restructuring expense guidance that you pointed to today. ", "Jon Olson ", "All the actions leading to those benefits are there but you don\u2019t see the, you\u2019re not going to see the run rate benefit in that because we\u2019re talking about all the spending it takes to do the transition that are in FY10. So if you think about FY11, you would say the restructuring is gone for that particular activity and all the benefits including some benefits we think will derive in our March quarter which is our fourth quarter of our fiscal year as most of the transitions will be completed just in the early part of that quarter so we should see some run rate benefits there. ", "And then you could extrapolate that into next year that should mean some goodness in the absence of anything else that might come up. ", "Sumit Dhanda \u2013 BAS-ML", "Would you care to take a stab at what that quarterly benefit might look like when normalized. ", "Jon Olson ", "Well we said that, I did talk about in the absence of mask expense growth that we would be in the low to mid 160\u2019s and then by the time the exit rate of the fourth quarter we would be more in line with low 160\u2019s or maybe even a little below. So a couple million dollars of benefit, some of that comes in the gross margin line versus OpEx so its not all these benefits necessarily accrue to us in OpEx.", "Sumit Dhanda \u2013 BAS-ML", "Just in terms of the visibility anything you could say about how bookings have trended thus far this quarter and the pattern or the linearity of orders through the June quarter. ", "Jon Olson ", "June was actually a not all that great of a month for us in terms of bookings. I wouldn\u2019t say that we had really horrible bookings but we had quite a few weeks where the turns weren\u2019t as we would have anticipated but again on a seasonal basis, maybe I\u2019m just jaded by the fact that our business is already low and I didn\u2019t like more slow down going into summer but I think we did sense slow down and we typically would see July and August being slow in terms of bookings and September being strong in a normal seasonality. ", "But so far in July they\u2019ve been okay. ", "Maria Quillard ", "Thank you for participating today. We have a playback of this call beginning at 5:00 Pacific, 8:00 Eastern.

(Operator instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Maria Quillard. Thank you. Ms. Quillard, you may begin your conference.", "Maria Quillard", "Thank you and good afternoon. With me today are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the September quarter, then we will open the call for questions.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially.", "We refer you to the documents the company files with the SEC including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. ", "This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.", "Now let me turn the call over to Jon Olson.", "Jon A. Olson", "Thank you, Maria. During today\u2019s commentary I will review our business results for the September quarter. I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the December quarter. September quarter sales increase 10% sequentially to $415 million, higher than our original guidance of up 2% to 6% sequentially and in line with the revised guidance we provided on September 23rd.", "Compared to the same quarter a year ago, total sales were down 14%. Turns business was 57% for the quarter, flat with the prior quarter. Virtex-5 sales posted exceptional growth during the quarter above and beyond the delinquency carry-overs from last quarter\u2019s supply constraints. Sales from this product family currently exceed 20% of our total revenues. While delinquencies on a few parts remain, by the end of the December quarter, we believe that inventory will largely be at full safety stock levels. ", "New product sales increased 36% sequentially during the quarter, driven primarily by the Virtex-5 and Spartan-3 FPGA families. Mainstream products increased 4% as we experienced strong growth from Virtex-4 family and base products, which consist of our oldest products, experienced only a slight sequential decline of 1%. ", "All geographies increased sequentially during the quarter with Europe and Japan posting the strongest growth of 15% and 26% respectively. Strength in Japan was driven by consumer and communications applications, while strength in Europe was related to a broader base of end markets, including communications, industrial, and audio-video broadcast. ", "Japan sales now represent 9% of total sales, up from 8% in the prior quarter. European sales represent 21% of sales, up from 20% in the prior quarter. North American sales also posted double-digit sales growth in the September quarter, increasing 12% sequentially to represent 35% of total sales, flat with the prior quarter. ", "Strength in North America was driven by enterprise networking, defense, and audio-video broadcast. Asia-Pacific sales were more or less as expected, increasing 3% sequentially with growth in wireless and consumer offset by declines in wireline. Asia-Pacific sales now represent 35% of total sales, down from 37% in the prior quarter. ", "In terms of our vertical markets, sales from all major end market categories increased sequentially. Sales from the consumer automotive and data processing categories were particularly strong, increasing 27% and 31% sequentially with strong double-digit growth in all sub-segments. ", "Consumer and automotive sales now represent 16% of total sales, up from 14% in the prior quarter. ", "Data processing sales represented 7% of total, up from 6% in the prior quarter. Sales from the industrial and other category increased for the first time in five quarters with growth from all sub-segments. This category comprised 31% of total sales in the September quarter, flat with the prior quarter. ", "Communication sales increased 4% sequentially, representing 46% of total sales, down from 49% in the prior quarter. Wireless business increased during the quarter while sales to wired communications were flat. ", "Gross margin for the quarter was 61.9%, up slightly from the prior quarter and above our forecast due to higher-than-anticipated sales growth, lower costs, and the sale of previously reserved inventory. ", "Operating expenses were $175 million, including $6 million in restructuring charges, in line with our original guidance as higher variable spending associated with higher sales was offset by lower mass cost and overall expense reduction efforts. ", "Operating margin increased to 20% for the quarter, up from 15% in the prior quarter. Net income during the quarter was $64 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, including the $6 million in restructuring charges, or approximately $0.02 per diluted share. ", "Operating cash flow for the September quarter was $118 million before $4 million in CapEx. We paid $39 million in cash dividends. ", "Our durable business model has enabled us to continue to generate healthy cash flows throughout the recent economic downturn. As a result, we announced a $0.02 per common share increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.16 per share. This translates to a dividend yield of nearly 3%, among the highest in the technology industry. ", "The tax rate in the March quarter was 20%, higher than the 16% previously forecasted. The increase is primarily due to a change in the jurisdictional mix of our profits. As I stated in the call last quarter, as our sales increase in the U.S., our tax rate will increase. We believe that revenue for our fiscal year will exceed previous expectations and as a result more profits in the U.S. are also anticipated. ", "Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased $95 million during the quarter to $1.9 billion. We have approximately $690 million in convertible debt and our net cash position is approximately $1.2 billion. ", "Day sales outstanding increased three days in the September quarter to 50 days. Combined inventory days in the September quarter were 75, down from 78 days in the prior quarter. We have increased our wafer starts in order to keep pace with the increase in orders. As a result, we expect inventory levels to increase to the low-end of our corporate target of 90 to 100 days in the December quarter. ", "Now let me turn to a discussion of guidance for the December quarter of fiscal year \u201910. Our backlog heading into the December quarter is up double-digits sequentially and is broad-based across our end markets. As we stated on the call last quarter, we will observe an additional accounting week this quarter. We expect this 14th week to contribute to incremental sales growth for the quarter. Given this week occurs at the end of a holiday impacted quarter, our expectation is that it will contribute less than a full week of incremental sales. Additionally, we expect continued growth from Virtex-5 as well as substantial growth from our Virtex-6 and Spartan-3 families. As a result, we are expecting sales to be up 6% to 10% sequentially in the December quarter, with the strongest growth from North America and Europe. ", "We expect sales from Asia-Pacific and Japan to increase slightly. From an end market perspective, we expect communication sales to be up sequentially, driven by wireline communication, as wireless sales takes a breather. Industrial and other business is expected to increase again, driven by particular strength in test and measurement and industrial, scientific, and medical. We are expecting consumer and data processing to be flat to up slightly sequentially. ", "The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 53%. This is low relative to our turns rate over the last several quarters but we believe it is prudent in light of prior quarters long lead times on certain devices and the uncertainty of the impact on sales of the additional week. ", "Gross margin is expected to be approximately 62% to 63% sequentially as higher sales are partially offset by strong new product growth. As previously forecasted, operating expenses in the December quarter will be impacted by the additional accounting week, as well as an increase in mass costs, including approximately $3 million of restructuring charges. We are expecting operating expenses to be approximately $186 million in the December quarter. ", "Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $1 million. The share count is expected to be 278 million shares. ", "The tax rate for the year is expected to be 19% for the same reasons discussed previously impacting our fiscal Q2. ", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Thank you, John and good afternoon to you all. I am very pleased with how our second fiscal quarter turned out from all perspectives, including sales, operations, development, and ongoing cost controls. Definitely a great quarter by all these measures. ", "During the first half of calendar 2009, Xilinx revenue was driven primarily by our China wireless business. Now we are beginning to see a resurgence in nearly all of our other end markets, strong seasonal growth in our consumer business and with recovery in our industrial, scientific, and medical, automotive, test and measurement and data processing are very encouraging trends. ", "In the September quarter, we satisfied the majority of pent-up demand for Virtex-5 parts. We also accelerated our ongoing 65-nanometer wafer starts. We expect to build sufficient safety stock for Virtex-5 in the December ending quarter. The lead times for these devices are expected to return to normal levels. Consequently we are well-positioned to address our customers\u2019 supply needs. ", "Our 65-nanometer leadership position is unparalleled. Virtex-5 continues to be the industry\u2019s largest revenue generating FPGA family shipping today and demand for this product remains strong. Orders in backlog are broad-based across end markets and customers. We expect this family to continue to be the primary sales driver throughout both this fiscal year and next. ", "In the September quarter, Virtex-5 revenue surpassed 20% total sales and we estimate our 65-nanometer high-end FPGA market share to be over 80%. We expect to see additional growth from Virtex-5 sales in the December quarter as it is approaching $100 million per quarter, a sales milestone achieved by only two previous products in our history. We are building upon our Virtex-5 success with our next generation of FPGA products, Virtex-6 and Spartan-6. By applying all that we have learned from Virtex-5 near flawless execution, we expect the Virtex-6 family to have a faster ramp to volume production than Virtex-5. To date, we have met every key milestone with both our foundry partners, [inaudible] on 40-nanometer with Virtex-6 and Samsung on 45-nanometer with Spartan-6. We have significantly improved our development quality and turnaround cycles versus prior generation. Virtex-6 design wins are outpacing Virtex-5 design wins; at the same point in time, the number of opportunities identified is significantly greater. ", "I am very encouraged by our product positioning on the high-end of 40-nanometer Virtex-6 FPGA family extends our undisputed 65-nanometer leadership position. Building up on this success, Virtex-6 is the most complete full-featured high-end FPGA family on the market. ", "In addition, this quarter we announced support for our 11-gigahertz serial technology which is optimized for ultra high-end bandwidth systems in the wire telecommunication and data communications markets. In parallel, Spartan-6 is the industry\u2019s only 45-nanometer high volume FPGA family and the only high-volume FPGA family with embedded transceiver technology. This is an incredibly key technology for Xilinx because it makes us far more competitive in the high-volume arena, as lower cost and lower power -- as the lowest cost and lowest power volume FPGA solution on the market, design wins for Spartan-6 are very strong. Spartan-6 LXD devices are currently being designed into our customer\u2019s next generation products with design win strength coming from consumer, defense, and wired communication. Several Spartan-6 devices are currently shipping. We continue to hit the key milestones in our rollout with this product family. ", "I am delighted that our R&D success is being delivered while operating within a more financially disciplined environment. We are delivering on our commitment to return more value to our shareholders. The increase in our quarterly dividend this quarter is yet another way that Xilinx is creating additional shareholder value. ", "To summarize, I am extremely pleased with our performance this quarter and the excellent execution on all fronts. As John mentioned earlier, our backlog position entering the December quarter is strong. In our outlook, we believe we have appropriately taken into account changes in consumer ordering patterns due to tightening capacity across the semiconductor industry. ", "Our exceptionally strong new product portfolio positions us to further capitalize on future growth opportunities. These are presented both by the recovering economy as well as the more favorable competitive positioning. This relates both to markets historically serviced broadly by ASICS and selectively in some segments by ASSPs.", "Now let me turn the call back to the Operator to open it up for the Q&A session. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of  Uche Orji with UBS.", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "Just very quickly, two parts to one question -- the first is when do you think that Virtex-6 will be ready for volume production and for transitioning from initial R&D wins from your [customers and start to go for volume]?", "And then secondly, following on top of that, when do you think that we shall start --what will be the -- when should we start to think about your 28-nanometer development and what impact will that have on your R&D say next year?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Okay. Well, we -- no, as I mentioned, we are doing really well on all of the deliverables in the Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 programs are on schedule and they are expected to move into production by the end of this fiscal year or earlier. ", "And then obviously we do all of the programs staggered in time, so we are working on numerous generations of products in parallel and so the next -- we are working on the generation beyond the 40-nanometer as we speak and most of our engineering resources have already moved to implement the new generation of product. ", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "And just one quick follow-on to that -- John, if I look at your gross margins, you are guiding 62 to 63. You know, as we start to see recovery in some of the higher gross margin areas like industrial, should we not expect to see a higher fall-through to gross margins or -- what are the things that are going on within gross margins that drive the high end or the low end of that guidance? Thank you. ", "Jon A. Olson", "There is a lot of dynamics going on right now, particularly one of the things we\u2019ve learned in the recession is there isn\u2019t anything that\u2019s typical about much of what\u2019s been going on in our business from a lot of perspectives. And in margin, in the margin area, we certainly have been impacted by a customer mix situation in this recession, meaning the small and medium sized customers have not -- you know, went away in larger percentages and proportions than the large customers. And this quarter we saw a slight improvement there, meaning that we got some business increase disproportionately from the medium-sized and small customers and I think as that mix improves, assuming it does depending on how the recovery of the recession is, I think that\u2019s going to be an upward pressure on our margins. ", "At the same time, there was always a product mix going on, depending on what\u2019s going on out there. We continue to work very strongly towards cost reduction activities on both the new products coming out as well as our V4 and V5 product line that is generating so much of our profit at the company and we will continue to improve those margins out in time, which then also should help our margins go up. ", "We are committed to our 63% to 65% range in our model and so we are working towards that. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of  Glen Yeung with Citi.", "Glen Yeung \u2013 Citi", "Thanks. So my question is kind of looking back on the one hand and then looking forward on another. You know, I know you -- neither of you were at Xilinx's back in 2003 so kind of a question as industry veterans -- if you look back at 2003 and you compare that to now, I wonder if you can give us a sense as to what you think the similarities and differences are broadly from an industry perspective. ", "And then the second part of this question is as you look into the fourth quarter and to the extent you can look beyond that, that\u2019s great. Just your level of confidence in your  three month view here. And I ask this because a lot of chip companies have given guidance and I sense varying degrees of confidence and I just want to know where you fall out on that scale. ", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "John, why don\u2019t you do the confidence thing and then I\u2019ll think about comparing it with 2003. I assume that the veterans is a euphemism for being old, but I\u2019ll take the compliment. ", "Jon A. Olson", "The confidence in our December quarter I think is quite high, as we sit here. Going into the quarter with a strong backlog that we have and then knowing that the breadth of end markets that we have booked relative to I would say what had been holding us up for the most part this calendar year has been wireless business and to some extent, aerospace and defense. And we are certainly seeing strength in a variety of different areas and a broader base of customers coming for increased orders. You know, the enterprise network business is pretty significant for us and we certainly have seen strength of late in there, both a little bit this past quarter and in our booking patterns going forward for the December quarter. ", "So quite frankly, we are feeling pretty good as we sit here right now in the position, even though there are still a lot of turns dollars that have to be booked but by and large our confidence is pretty high for the quarter. ", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "And when I compare this downturn to the previous one, the previous large one, what we -- what characterized that downturn was it was narrow in terms of the applications and it was primarily communications driven but also there was a huge build-up of inventory and to some extent, if you look at the current recovery, the downturn was broad but we are seeing now thankfully broader recovery in numerous areas, so that is good. What didn\u2019t happen this downturn is there wasn\u2019t any huge multi-year inventory build-up and that build-up in the year 2000 was driven by the fact that communications was assumed to continue to grow at a very aggressive compound rate and when we went into this downturn, I think the expectations were a lot more rational and there was a huge focus on inventory management, maybe too much of a focus, hence there was some difficulty in addressing the recovery once it started. But we are seeing breadth now and -- which is encouraging and we are not seeing the issues with inventory that happened then. ", "Jon, do you want to add -- ", "Jon A. Olson", "I think from an internal Xilinx perspective, I\u2019ve been here since the middle of \u201905, we\u2019ve certainly focused a lot more on the supply chain, both backwards to us but also forward looking through our customers and we really tightened up the signals, shortened them up and I think some of the impact that impacted Xilinx back between 2001, 2003 not just because of the over-supply, it was also Xilinx's inability to get the right mix of product and inventory and we\u2019ve leaned that out tremendously and we have much better systems now to manage those kinds of things and our customers are much -- we\u2019re much tighter to them and it just feels like we know what\u2019s going on a lot better than maybe we did three or four, five years ago. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of  Ruben Roy with Pacific Crest. ", "Ruben Roy - Pacific Crest Securities", "John, can you talk a little bit about the data processing segment? I realize it\u2019s the smallest contributor to revenue today but going back a few years, it was up around 13%, 14%, 15%. Can you just remind us what that consists of? In the past storage has been a big contributor and do you expect growth to continue to the point where that segment can get back up to that type of revenue contribution for Xilinx?", "Jon A. Olson", "Today this business is largely been bounced around by what\u2019s going on with GDP and with the -- what\u2019s been going on in the server space. We don\u2019t have -- we haven\u2019t had for a couple of years a very strong penetration into the pure storage business and so mostly we are ancillary devices in -- somewhere in this chain of servers or processing and storage kinds of devices. ", "Of late there has been a resurgence of penetration into some new technologies, solid state memory going into the mass storage market for network attached devices, et cetera. And we\u2019ve been participating pretty heavily in that particular segment as a controller device in there and that is actually providing a lot more value in the value chain then maybe the more common glue logic, so it has been a decreasing emphasis of ours over the last few years in terms of trying to find a new opportunity there, mostly because there is not -- it\u2019s not a rich area for SOC kinds of things where we have primarily been focused on. ", "That being said, we found several opportunities there and I really can't say if it\u2019s ever going to return back to the levels that it did before or not but I think we will always participate in that segment at some level. ", "Ruben Roy - Pacific Crest Securities", "Thanks, Jon and then just quickly on the gross margin, can you tell us what the contribution from the zero cost inventory was this quarter and is that going to -- are you going to see that in the December quarter as well?", "Jon A. Olson", "The things that are in there, the zero cost inventory was not super significant but we are talking about in the neighborhood of less than a half a margin point but still positive there, so it\u2019s not something that is likely going to repeat itself. It just happened to be some devices that we found homes for that we didn\u2019t think we were going to find some homes for and managed to sell through. ", "Ruben Roy - Pacific Crest Securities", "Great. Thanks a lot, Jon. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of  Tim Luke with Barclays Capital.", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Just with respect to what you are outlining on guidance, it sounds like the wireless is going to take a breather -- I just want to clarify that means lower sequentially, I\u2019m imagining. How do you see that shaping going forward? Should we think about the China stuff being sort of flat to lower for the next several quarters with the wireline -- I\u2019m imagining wireline includes all the networking stuff -- increasing going forward? What sort of opportunities do you see in com there? ", "Separately, it just seems that your turns are lower and you talked about lead times stretching a bit -- could you give us some color on that? I noticed that your primary rival was talking about a 40% turns level with the stretching inventory lead times. And they also separately talked about a 40-nanometer, 60% to 70% share that they are anticipating. Could you give us some color on kind of just what you see there, given that you are now ramping production? Thanks. ", "Jon A. Olson", "I saw the wireless statements for December, so yes, the interpretation of what I said on the breather means it is going to be -- our wireless business in total will be lower in December, we believe, than September, and that\u2019s driven by the ending or the ramp-down of phase 3 of the TDS CDMA rollout not being offset by additional devices we\u2019re selling into the wide band CDMA business segment. So we are -- overall our total 3G number will be down and for the most part, that\u2019s been driven by China and not by anything else going on the rest of the world. And we do believe that next quarter that our wired business driven primarily by enterprise network activities will increase. Beyond December, we\u2019re really not making a call, other than from the wireless business from China. We do anticipate next year that phase 4 is going to be happening. We have been very active in quoting there\u2019s no -- anything significant in our backlog for that yet and so it\u2019s just really too early to tell exactly when that is going to start and come in, so we are not talking about that at this point. ", "The turns piece are definitely lower than our run-rate and I think that\u2019s a combination of the fact that our lead times for the last several months have been longer because of the supply constraints and we believe there has been some early positioning in our backlog, therefore we don\u2019t think turns levels will be back I would say to our historic norm of the mid to high 60s in this particular quarter. ", "Our lead times -- I want to be clear though -- by the end of this quarter our lead times are going to be back to normal more -- pretty much broadly four week lead times as the safety stock will be built up. ", "Your third question is around share count. ", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Yes, let me answer that -- so this relates to what is happening at 40-nanometer and so a couple of things are happening. The first thing which I think is most important is that the 40-nanometer is really a transition point to where a larger, much larger number of applications cannot afford ASICS and are moving to FPGA so my expectation is that generally that transition is happening, we are seeing it across the board. Everything except ultra-high volume applications just need to -- if they won't differentiate the hardware, they go to FPGA. ASICS are no longer viable there, and so our expectation is that from 40-nanometer onward the market potential for FPGAs is growing. ", "Typically what we have seen in the past is we have had on the high-end 60% of the market, 65-nanometer was -- you know, there really was not very significant competition and our market share rose to 80%. Our expectation is as each of these new generations has a multi-year design in cycle and the designs don\u2019t happen during six months or during a year of these products -- even for design-ins have a multi-year design-in cycle and that design-in cycle we expect to extend due to the transition away from ASICs. Our expectation is that we will have in excess of 50% of the market are traditional customers who have always gone with us, best we can tell are staying with us for most of their designs going forward. ", "So we view the 40-nanometer node both on the Virtex and in particular also on the Spartan side as a very attractive node for Xilinx.  ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra of Robert W. Baird", "Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Did you get any sense from your customers, and I understand it\u2019s still early, in terms of the size of phase four spending relative to phase three in China? ", "Jon A. Olson", "Based on the quotes, you would say it\u2019s an equal or maybe even slightly larger than phase three but that doesn\u2019t -- just because they are asking us to quote certain volumes over certain time periods doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee that\u2019s the case but the way the quote activity is shaking up and is shaking out on the size of the orders for us, if those would come in based on those quotes, we think we\u2019d be equal or greater. Some of that could be penetration also and higher penetration into the base stations, for example, of FPGAs versus alternatives that they have. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of  James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "First of all, could you tell us, John, give us an update on whether you still expect to be in terms of OpEx at the low $160 million level exiting this fiscal year? And then separately, do you expect the same strength you saw in the quarter in terms of small customers to continue into the December quarter? In other words, is that continuing to accelerate as far as you can see?", "Jon A. Olson", "On the OpEx number, I wouldn\u2019t characterize the 160 as the right place to be, so we had talked about 186 is our forecast for December and in that 186 was $8 million of impact, approximately, from the extra week and then we would see mass costs, which are still significant, in the March quarter decline $3 million to $5 million, so that essentially takes $12 million reduction off the 186 and that puts you in the range of 170 to 175, all things being equal. We still have quite a bit of mass costs going on in the March quarter, so the trend has been up -- this is the peak quarter coming up in December, then we\u2019ll decline in March and next fiscal year there should be a lower mass cost profile for the company in total. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with JPMorgan.", "Jon A. Olson", "Chris, before you ask me a question, I want to answer the second question that Jim asked around the small customer increase in December, so yes because of the broad base around our end markets growth that we think we will have next quarter, I would anticipate small and medium sized customers to grow. ", "All right, Chris, sorry. ", "Chris Danely \u2013 JPMorgan", "No problem -- you guys talked about your lead times coming back to normal. I guess that\u2019s about four weeks -- how long did they get?", "Jon A. Olson", "I think we had some devices that were 14, 16 weeks, that kind of range. Again, not all devices -- this was a handful of V5 or maybe a dozen in the peak of V5s that we had this issue with and it stretched out to be in the 14, 16 week category and then we\u2019ve moved them back some and then by -- basically by the end of December we\u2019ll be back to four weeks pretty broadly. ", "Chris Danely \u2013 JPMorgan", "And then as my follow-up, you talked about getting back to your gross margin target of 63% to 65%, I believe. Can you just put a little more color on how you expect gross margins to trend following this quarter? Should they be gradually up next calendar year?", "Jon A. Olson", "I don\u2019t really want to venture an answer on that and get too specific because of the dynamics of product mix and customer mix and the fact that the recovery, if it happens as interestingly as the recession hit us, it\u2019s really difficult to forecast kind of quarter by quarter going forward. I would anticipate a -- like I said, a positive contribution from the customer mix and a positive contribution from continued cost reduction and we have quite a few cost reduction programs lined up with contribution scheduled over the next four quarters, so I\u2019m hopeful it will keep moving up but it\u2019s too hard to know for sure. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Wu with Global Crown Research.", "David Wu \u2013 Global Crown Research", "I was wondering, Jon, on the issue of product mix, if we are going to be in a ramp phase for both Spartan-6 and Virtex-6 in fiscal \u201911, would the usual hit in -- newer products tend to get lower gross margin show up in terms of your improvement in gross margin for fiscal \u201911 relative to what progress you have made to date? And the other thing I was just wanting clarification on, what\u2019s the mix of your large versus small customers, small, medium-sized customers in terms of percentage revenue contribution?", "Jon A. Olson", "So David, on the first one on product mix, well clearly the introduction of a new product family, and in our case two new product families, doesn\u2019t -- those products don\u2019t come out of the chute with high margins and it\u2019s dependent on how many units we put through and how much yield earnings is going on and all the classic things, so yes, just categorically they are a drag on our overall margin but at the same time, I want to remind you that Virtex-5 is a huge contributor to our profits and we\u2019ve been doing a really good job of increasing our yields there and improving margins there and there is more capability to do that in our -- we would do everything we can to try to help make sure that offset any of the decline and hopefully even make up more than that through a broad-based cost improvement. So it is a fact that product mix has a downward pressure but we have a lot of other things we are working on to try to offset that and improve margins overall. ", "On the large customer versus small customer mix, I think the way I characterized it in the past is we look at our top 50 customers and describe how much our top -- how much revenue is defined by our top 50 customers and we\u2019ve been -- in the worst point we\u2019ve been in in the recession, it\u2019s been in the low 60s, low 60% number and it\u2019s starting to move its way back up a little bit. So you can do the math on that. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA.", "Srini Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA", "Jon, you said the extra week is helping you in terms of the revenue impact for the December quarter. As we look out to the March quarter, I guess my question is what kind of impact do you think that will have on your normal seasonality? And also if you can share with us what your normal seasonality for the March quarter is, that would be great. ", "Jon A. Olson", "Well, I don\u2019t think having 14 weeks in December has much to do at all with March, other than there\u2019s a few percentage points of revenue maybe that we are getting out of it. You know, when you look at the way the calendar has worked for us, our 14-week ends on January 2nd, so essentially we\u2019ve gotten our calendar back to more normal and closer to the monthly cycle. So in and of itself, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a huge detractor or contributor to any change one way or the other. ", "Basically it\u2019s way too early to understand how this recovery is going to impact us. There\u2019s no seasonal patterns anymore, it seemed like. I mean, what we would have normally anticipated for a September based on seasonal or December on a seasonal seems to be kind of out the window. We\u2019re not growing a few percentage points in the recovery -- we\u2019re growing 10 in each of these quarters, or eight and 10 and eight respectively and that\u2019s really not what you would look historically about the company. ", "So it\u2019s really hard to say gee, our normal seasonal pattern is up in March and you know, you can count on us being up because I don\u2019t know if that is the case or not.         ", "Srini Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA", "Okay, and then quickly on the wireline, coming back a bit here. I\u2019m just wondering if you have any visibility into saying that whether this is just a year-end [inaudible] or if these are new programs -- if you can provide us any color, that would be great. Thank you. ", "Jon A. Olson", "I don\u2019t know about the budget flush issue. I think one of the things that is encouraging in the wireline area is that some of our medium-sized customers there are forecasted to order more parts, which would indicate that there\u2019s more breadth going on in the wireline  than just the networking people holding us up. And so that\u2019s kind of encouraging from that perspective. So it does feel like this isn\u2019t just the network guys getting better and starting to sell more products through. It does feel like there\u2019s a little more breadth going on. ", "Srini Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital.", "Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "The industrial segment, you said that most of the growth is coming from that. Usually Q4 is a strong defense quarter. You didn\u2019t call out that one. Can you give us the color on how defense is doing?", "Jon A. Olson", "Defense was up some in the September quarter and we are really not anticipating it to grow I would say to our typical rate of increase in the December quarter, and that\u2019s really predicated on a few specific programs that we\u2019ve been monitoring and the buying patterns, and maybe some of that is explained by getting caught up in some of the program budget changes going on in the Department of Defense, even though we believe over the long haul we are a net benefactor from some of those changes. In the short-run, that could be part of the explanation. I\u2019m really not sure of that. ", "So we are expecting I would say a flat to modest increase in defense in the December quarter, but not our usual jump up. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wachovia Wells Fargo.", "David Wong \u2013 Wachovia Wells Fargo", "Thank you very much. Can you give us some idea as to wafer supply? Are you seeing any tightening in wafer supply? Does this affect the pricing or is there some reason to think that there might be constraints in the future?", "Jon A. Olson", "I don\u2019t think we are really seeing any tightness in overall wafer supply now that we are -- you know, we started a huge number of wafers and we feel that we are going to be caught up this quarter pretty much. We don\u2019t see to be having an issue getting any starts for this quarter. It will be delivered into the March quarter, so we are really not experiencing any significant tightness there. And the pricing patterns really haven\u2019t changed a great deal either. I mean, we negotiate on a multiple rolling quarters going forward and we typically have price declines as technologies become more mature every quarter or every other quarter and those have continued per our roadmap and our budgetary negotiated prices.          ", "So we are not experiencing anything there that\u2019s detrimental. ", "David Wong \u2013 Wachovia Wells Fargo", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Adam Benjamin with Jeffries.", "Adam Benjamin \u2013 Jeffries & Company", "Thanks, guys. I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the wireless business and the extra week and if you can just talk about the linearity of the orders in Q4 for what you expect, just in terms of the business being down if the extra week has an impact or not, in terms of how we should be thinking about that business. ", "And then secondly, if you can talk a little bit about competitive lead times which we\u2019ve heard from several of the semi companies stretching out and impacting them. I\u2019m just curious what you are seeing and where you are seeing the most significant lead times right now in terms of end markets. Thanks. ", "Jon A. Olson", "From the wireless perspective, I would say we are average to above average book for the quarter business for the December quarter. I think some of the strength that we\u2019ve seen or some of the issues around our long lead times earlier over the last few months has caused them to do some early booking and some of that would be in the wireless business, hence our lower turns number. ", "The 14-week, I don\u2019t think that has a huge impact, again because we\u2019ve encompassed both the Christmas and New Year\u2019s week in this 14-weeks and it\u2019s just kind of -- you know, typically we\u2019ve been relatively slow in at least one of those two weeks, pretty slow in one of those two weeks and historically and so that is why we are counting on it to be a small impact. ", "Lead times, I\u2019d say the only thing that we might be experiencing that\u2019s considered more tightness on lead times has been in the assembly and test areas. We\u2019ve been pretty clear as we\u2019ve gone through our transition of moving more tests to outsource, as we\u2019ve described in our restructuring of the company a couple of quarters ago, working very closely with suppliers, both assembly and test in this case in order to reestablish our volume expectations there. And I think because we were very early in going through all that, we certainly aren\u2019t experiencing any issues with respect to Xilinx builds going on but I think there is a sense that there\u2019s more tightness going on overall in that part of the supply chain. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.", "John Pitzer - Credit Suisse", "Jon, you alluded to earlier the fact that with the Virtex-5 family you still think there\u2019s some cost-savings there. Is it meaningful? Can you help me quantify it? If you look at where yields are today versus where you think you can take them, how much of a gross margin driver is left there or is it mainly volume?", "And then my second question, just quickly, when you look at the automotive and industrial segments, help me understand your concern around the sustainability, especially in automotive, given some of the stimulus that we had in the calendar third quarter relative to end demand?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yeah, on the V5, let\u2019s start with the V5 cost-savings -- I mean, every point of yield that you can lower, you know, we\u2019re talking about $1 million or more than you can benefit yourself, right? So there\u2019s -- at this stage of our volume, in terms of cost of goods sold, so the more we can work on these things and find improvements, not just back at the fab but anywhere in terms of cost reduction, in terms of negotiating better prices with suppliers on substrates and packages and things like that, it\u2019s really a full court press that could -- you know, that can contribute these things and we are certainly aware that with new technologies coming on, that there\u2019s going to be downward pressure with product mix and we need to find ways to offset this to support our business model. ", "I\u2019m not -- I don\u2019t know that this is any -- usually different than maybe some past generations but we certainly are keenly aware of it and it\u2019s a big focus of ours. ", "On the auto area in terms of the auto part of our business, we definitely had strength there and we do feel like we are returning from the depths of hardly anything, it seemed like, to some business there, which is good but it\u2019s got to move up and down with the GDP and the automobile sales over the long haul. You know, the stimulus package obviously had some impact on builds of automobiles and I am sure we are participating in that but we are not expecting a sequential quarter after quarter increase necessarily in that part of the business. It will be choppy, I suspect. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sumit Dhanda with BAS-ML.", "Sumit Dhanda \u2013 BAS-ML", "A couple of questions -- so the first question I had, Jon, was the current assumption of 53 versus 57 in the September quarter -- and that\u2019s 53% based on a full 14 weeks, meaning that if you compare it apples to apples, 13 weeks, are you assuming flat turns because of the holiday week and the assumption that they will do -- that you will do very little business then?", "Jon A. Olson", "Well, it is the turns considered in the full 14 week quarter. I haven\u2019t tried to quite trace that through my head yet about what normalizing it to 13 weeks would be. I think the two factors that are impacting us on the lower turns assumption is the fact that we think we are reasonably booked going in and because of the long lead times that we had a couple of few months ago, and the fact that that last week isn\u2019t -- that last week isn\u2019t going to contribute very much. I think those are probably the biggest factors to why that number is lower than our historic. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.", "Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James", "More a strategic question for Moshe -- your foundries, Samsung and UMC, are these strategic partners or are you going to hold with them for the next node beyond 40-nanometer? Are you considering using perhaps DSMC? What\u2019s the foundry strategy going forward?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Hans, every process node we look at everyone how is available and trust me, they all want do business with Xilinx and we choose who are the best partners based on having the technology, having the right commercial arrangements, and so we are very good at doing this. We\u2019ve done it several times very successfully and we\u2019ve managed to demonstrate leadership throughout, so no, at any point we feel very comfortable in our ability to use the best foundries available. We don\u2019t have anything to announce at this point in time. When we do decide and we will roll it out, we\u2019ll definitely figure out who the right foundry partners are and communicate that. ", "Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James", "Okay, fair enough. And then a more technical question -- ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.", "Glen Yeung \u2013 Citi", "Could I just clarify that when you talk about a recovery, a return to normal in your safety stock, are you referencing Xilinx safety stock or distributor safety stock? And then the second question is Moshe, at the beginning you mentioned that you are seeing more breadth in your business. If you were to kind of say one is the limited amount of breadth that you saw in the worst part of the down cycle and 10 is normal breadth you would see in an up cycle, where would you characterize your breadth today?", "Jon A. Olson", "The safety stock issue, I was referring to Xilinx's safety stock, which is generally typified by what we hold in tie banks, so the distributor safety stock issue isn\u2019t really appropriate. Our distributor inventory is based on their order patterning and keeping them as lean as we possibly can jointly in order to reduce their working capital and to increase our flexibility in die bank to build the right part. So I was referring to Xilinx inventory, primarily die bank safety stock. ", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "And with regard to your question on the breadth, no, there was a period of time during the downturn where there were two sources of light at the end of the tunnel. One was Chinese wireless and the other was [AND] and in reality, most if not all other markets were suffering and shrinking. They hadn\u2019t gone away but they were down significantly. ", "What we are seeing now is across the board, across all of our markets and across all of our geographies and the numbers Jon has shared with you we are seeing much better results and we are seeing a recovery in terms of orders and so it went down and there were two points of light and now it\u2019s coming across -- it\u2019s coming back up and there\u2019s significant light in all areas at this point and significant interest and a lot of shipments in all of our markets. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.", "Brendan Furlong - Miller Tabak", "My apologies -- I thought I took myself offline. Sorry, I\u2019m good. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Mr. Furlong has withdrawn his question. Our next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Robert W. Baird. ", "Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Just a quick follow-up -- how much more decline do you expect in mass costs beyond the March quarter in fiscal \u201911? And also, when do we expect 65-nanometer crossover with 90-nanometer?", "Jon A. Olson", "On the first one, we are really not characterizing our fiscal year \u201911 yet in terms of mass costs but I would expect just generally the quarter following March, we would again see a similar kind of decline again that we did -- that I stated between December and March, so I think it will gradually come down over two or three quarters. ", "And then the 65-nanometer crossover with 90 -- is that what -- ", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Well, if you are referring to mass costs, they don\u2019t cross over. ", "Jon A. Olson", "Right, but -- ", "Operator", "There appear to be no further questions at this time. Maria Quillard, do you have any closing remarks?", "Maria Quillard", "No. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We have a playback of this call beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific, 8:00 p.m. Eastern.

My name is Tiffany and I will be your conference operator. I would now like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx fourth quarter fiscal year 2010 earnings release conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) Please limit your questions to one to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone.", "I would now like to turn today\u2019s call over to Maria Quillard. Thank you, Ms. Quillard. You may begin your conference.", "Maria Quillard", "Thank you and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the March quarter then we\u2019ll open the call for questions.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially.", "We refer you to the documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Investor Relations website.", "Now let me turn the call over to Jon Olson.", "Jon Olson", "Thank you, Maria. During today's commentary, I will review our March quarter and fiscal 2010 business results. I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the June quarter. For the second consecutive quarter, Xilinx achieved record sales. In addition, gross and operating margins increased to their highest level in nearly six years. These results speak not only to the increased customer acceptance of Xilinx PLD solutions but also to our increased focus on expense management and return on investment.", "After bottoming in the June quarter of this most recent fiscal year, sales increased in each of the remaining fiscal quarters. Fiscal 2010 sales were $1.8 billion, flat with the prior year. Gross and operating margin improved in each consecutive quarter of the fiscal year.", "SG&A expense declined by 5% for the year, due to restructuring efforts as well as continued cost improvement efforts. R&D expense for the year increased by 4%, primarily due to increased expenses associated with the roll-out of 40-nanometer products. From an end market perspective, wireless, defense and automotive sales increased during the fiscal year while all other end markets declined.", "Turning to the March quarter, which was a 13-week quarter; sales were $520 million, a sequential increase of 3% and a year-over-year increase of 34%. Gross margin of 64.9% was up from 62.1% in the same quarter of the prior year.", "Operating margin of 29.5% was up from 19.8% in the same quarter of the prior year. Operating expenses were $187 million, including approximately $3 million in restructuring charges. In addition, operating expenses for the quarter were impacted by the resolution of a litigation matter and increases in variable spending driven by revenue and profit improvement. New product sales increased 13% sequentially, while mainstream products decreased 4% sequentially and base products remained flat.", "European sales were particularly strong during the March quarter, increasing 25% sequentially. Most of the incremental sales growth was related to wired and wireless communications, but sales from nearly all other end market categories in Europe increased.", "Asia-Pacific sales increased 1% sequentially to 35% of total sales, with gains from communications and storage, slightly offsetting declines from consumer.", "North American sales decreased 5% sequentially to 33% of sales, with sales from communication and industrial and other decreasing sequentially, but partially offset by strong audio/video broadcast sales.", "Lastly, sales from Japan declined 4% sequentially, primarily related to declines from wired communications and consumer applications. Overall, communication sales increased 7% sequentially, driven by increases in wireless sales. Wireline sales were essentially flat for the quarter after a very strong December quarter.", "Industrial sales decreased 4% sequentially, as an anticipated decline in defense sales more than offset increases in industrial, scientific and medical and test and measurement applications.", "Consumer and automotive sales increased 5% sequentially, driven by strength in automotive and audio/video broadcast applications. Sales from pure consumer applications declined as expected. And lastly, sales from data processing increased by 7% sequentially, as increases in storage more than offset decreases in computing and data processing.", "Net income during the quarter was $149 million, or $0.54 per diluted share including $3 million or approximately $0.01 per diluted share in restructuring charges. Included in the Q4 net income is a tax benefit of $23 million or $0.08 per diluted share, primarily related to the impact of our recent favorable ruling in the Ninth Circuit that dealt with the treatment of stock option expense.", "Operating cash flow for the March quarter was $104 million before $11 million in CapEx. We paid $44 million in cash dividends and spent $125 million on share repurchases during the quarter. During the fiscal year, Xilinx generated over $550 million in operating cash flow. The tax rate in the March quarter was 8%, lower than expected, due to the previously mentioned decrease in tax expense.", "Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments decreased $24 million during the quarter to approximately $2 billion. We have approximately $690 million in convertible debt and our net cash position is approximately $1.3 billion.", "Days sales outstanding increased one day in the March quarter to 45 days. Combined inventory days in the March quarter were 79, down from 85 days in the prior quarter and lower than we had anticipated due to foundry supply constraints impacting a number of our products. Moshe will elaborate on this in a minute. In the June quarter, we expect inventory days to be approximately flat.", "Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the June quarter of fiscal year '11. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up. We are expecting to see continued strength from Virtex-5 as well as strong growth from our new Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families.", "From an end market perspective, we are expecting sales from communications to be up, driven by strength in wireline and wireless communications. Industrial and other is expected to increase, driven by defense and test and measurement. Consumer and automotive is expected to be up slightly as increased consumer sales offset decreased automotive sales and flat audio video broadcast sales. Lastly, data processing is expected to decline driven primarily by storage.", "As a result, we are expecting total sales to be up 9, 5 to 9% sequentially in the June quarter. With sales from Japan declining and sales from all other geographies flat to increasing. The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 50%. This is down from 56% in the March quarter but appropriately conservative given our higher backlog and extended lead times. Gross margin is expected to be 65% plus or minus a point. The slightly wider range in gross margin is related to the variability around yields of our 40, 45 nanometer product family which will ramp sharply in the coming quarters.", "Operating expenses in the June quarter are expected to be approximately $182 million. Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $2 million. The share count is expected to be 276 million shares, and the tax rate for fiscal 2011 is expected to be approximately 21%.", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you, Jon and good afternoon to you all. Across the semiconductor industry, the customer demand side of the business has been very healthy. For Xilinx, we are delighted to have delivered our second consecutive record revenue quarter. In addition, with our 5 to 9% growth in revenue guidance for the June 2010 quarter, we are expecting better than normal seasonality.", "As demand strengthens our customers are giving us increased visibility by placing bookings and driving down our trends requirements for the quarter. As Jon mentioned, our backlog is up significantly. We are predicting lower turns in the 50% range for the June ending quarter.", "Furthermore, as we discussed last quarter, many of our secondary markets have yet to reach the levels of our prior revenue peak during the June 2008 quarter. Currently, four of our 10 secondary markets, wired, industrial, testing measurement and computing are still below their peak revenue. This improved end market outlook is encouraging as the new 65, 40 and 45 nanometers yield is poised to grow significantly. Encouraging growth rate is a testament the programmable imperative that is occurring all around us.", "Increasingly, advanced technology node Programmable Logic platform are replacing ASIC and some selective ASSP solutions. I encounter this trend frequently whenever I meet with our very broad based customers. While the demand side has been very strong, supply side of semiconductor business has been constrained, primarily by foundry capacity.", "Xilinx is not impervious to these trends this past quarter. Our top line results were at the high end of our guidance. However, our forecasted demand particularly for some of our Virtex families coupled with very tight foundry capacity constrained our sales from growing further this past quarter.", "By and large, we're serving our customer needs and delivering to our commitment. Our lead times have stretched out but generally are 10 weeks or less with some Virtex-5 parts extending beyond this range. As we enter the June quarter, our ability to deliver continues to challenge us given the healthy demand. We currently expect to see overall lead time improvement in the September quarter. Even though we couldn't ship all the Virtex-5 devices we had on order, this family grew double digits sequentially, establishing yet another new record.", "In the June quarter, we are expecting Virtex-5 to increase yet again, building upon the success of our Virtex-5 family are the Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families. Both of these families have achieved full qualification and are now shipping in volume production.", "In the June quarter, several of our 3G wireless customers will take significant deliveries of our Virtex-6 devices. They've been designing with Virtex-6 and expect to have their end products shipping volume in the coming quarters. As a result, we expect to see sales from this product family increase significantly.", "With respect to our 28-nanometer product, we expect to be sampling silicon by the end of our fiscal year. We'll be disclosing more details about our unified 28-nanometer sector and specific products in the months to come.", "Yesterday, we unveiled our revolutionary ARM-based extensible processing architecture that combines an ARM Cortex A9 processor with integrated 28-nanometer, low power, high performance programmable logic. This new programmable platform will deliver unrivaled levels of performance, flexibility, integration to developers of a high \u2013 of a wide variety of embedded systems. It is a key element of our company's overall growth strategy as articulated at our analyst meeting in February.", "Target markets include automotive driver assistance, intelligent video surveillance, industrial automation, aerospace and defense and next generation wireless. By employing familiar embedded software environment and its vast ecosystem, we can leverage open standards and extend the reach of embedded systems, providing significant incremental growth opportunities for Xilinx in the future.", "Summary, fiscal 2010 was a great year with a number of key accomplishments. I'm pleased by what we have been able to achieve through steadfast execution to our plan. During this period, Virtex-5 became the industry's most successful product offering in terms of quarterly sales. We began production of the next generation of Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families and have improved our profitability significantly through a number of proactive cost reduction and efficiency programs.", "As we enter fiscal 2011, we plan to continue to focus on operating efficiencies for overall execution. Additionally, we have an exceptional new product pipeline that I expect to drive continued growth and market expansion.", "Now, let me turn the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Tim Luke with Barclays Capital.", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thank you very much. Moshe, with respect to the capacity constraint, could you clarify again which products were affected by this, is it just the Virtex-5? And do you have any framework for us in terms of the degree of impact there or what sort of range you might have seen of further upside, if you hadn't been constrained?", "And can you give us some sort of milestones in terms of when that was most affecting you and when it's likely to affect you less? Obviously you're guiding for some slower sequential growth, notwithstanding the constraint and I think you said that it would be done by the September quarter, but could you just give some clarification with respect to that? Thank you.", "Jon Olson", "Let me take that one, Tim. So generally it's been Virtex-5, although there has been some tightness also in our Virtex-4 family as well. So, even at 90-nanometer technologies, we've had some tightness with the foundries, and as you know, they juggle their tools around to do different things and maximize output. But they're just generally at the most advanced technologies seem to be the tightest. But it has been largely Virtex-5 related products.", "Now, the degree of the impact from this last quarter, we haven't really specifically put a dollar amount on it. It's in the neighborhood of a couple of percentage points, so it's 2 percentage points, in the neighborhood of 10, $11 million. It's in that range and we do anticipate that this tightness continuing throughout this quarter and it's quite possible we would leave the quarter even with a greater level of delinquency than that.", "It kind of depends on the mix. When you're really tight and you sucked up the lion's share of your safety stock which we have in certain devices on Virtex-5 it is actually really dependent on what orders come in and what device so-to-speak.", "So we do expect that by the time we get into the September quarter, we're going to get some relief and hopefully that will not have delinquencies. But again, it's too early to tell because it really is dependent on how strong demand is overall throughout the summer.", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "So, is this something that you're seeing at both of your foundry partners or primarily at one rather than the other?", "Jon Olson", "Well, I mean, we do build product at two foundries and that's actually been one of the advantages of our two foundry strategy. We have been able to get a little more out of one versus the other, but quite frankly they're both very tight.", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Benjamin with Jefferies.", "Adam Benjamin \u2013 Jefferies", "Thanks, guys. Can you just talk a little bit about gross margin and kind of what is affecting the gross margin, kind of going forward here and how we should think about the puts and takes there?", "Jon Olson", "Yes, sure, Adam. Yes. Gross margin, we're actually been very pleased with the improvement of gross margin throughout the year and all our efforts getting up to the 65% level or 64.9 this quarter and then forecasting 65 for the next quarter. And I would anticipate us to be in that 65% range for a few quarters, again, plus or minus the point. And it really is because generally the new technologies are a drag on our margins, but we've been able to increase yields, lower costs in other areas to offset that as we go through this period of ramping yields on 40 and 45-nanometers.", "So I'm actually feeling pretty good that we can keep things stabilized at what was the high end of our range is now the midpoint of our new forecasted range for a business model for the company. And kind of, work through these yield improvements and then as we get to the end of the year and the next year hopefully they'll tail up some more.", "So I think we've done a really nice job. If you go back on our history and look at 90-nanometer and 130, you'd see a pretty marked drop in gross margin for us when we introduce new technologies, and we're doing a much better job with our own design and yields, and work with our foundry partners to not make that impact our margins so predominantly.", "Adam Benjamin \u2013 Jefferies", "Got you. And then on your commentary regarding lead times out at 10 weeks and stretching but then you expect them by the September quarter. I think you indicated to come in. I'm just curious if you can give some more color as to what that expectation is based on as to why you think they would come in by that point?", "Jon Olson", "Yeah. Sure. First off, we believe we're getting more capacity, more capacity allocated to us as we work through this quarter for out into the \u2013 I mean, wafers out into the September quarter. So, we're getting more wafers out, number one. And, second off we are working through a lot of yield improvements which give you more die per wafer therefore we think we're going to end up with more absolute die as a result. Our inventory dollars we're not worried about inventory dollars, the inventory dollars have been flat, we would like to actually have this go up.", "Days have been coming down some and we think they will stabilize in the 70s \u2013 in the mid to high 70s which is lower than we would like to run the company at. So, even if we were able to add some dollars we are still well behind on broadly filling our safety stock. So, it's not like we're over soaking things in my mind.", "Adam Benjamin \u2013 Jefferies", "So it's not a reflection of your expectation for orders, it's more purely just capacity?", "Jon Olson", "Yes. It really is, it's purely capacity. We do believe that there is strength throughout the June quarter and into the summer particularly in all the wireless business that we see, so we are planning on really a strong June from the wireless area. Particularly because of the China, beginning of the China ramp so that's quite significant for us. So we do think orders have stayed strong for a while but after \u2013 as we go into September, it becomes less clear what's going to happen.", "Adam Benjamin \u2013 Jefferies", "Got you. Thanks a lot for the color.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung from Citi.", "Glen Yeung \u2013 Citi", "Thanks. Jon, maybe just to follow-up on that last one. When you say you're getting more wafer allocation. Are you suggesting that you\u2019re getting more wafer allocation relative to your competitors or \u2013 not your competitors but your other people who are acquiring those wafers or that net wafer supply is going up?", "Jon Olson", "For us, it's net wafer supply is going up. I can't really speak to how our foundries are allocating among their customers. But I think that more wafer capacity starts to come online towards the end the second half of the calendar year. And that's where we're getting \u2013 able to get commitments for relief on some of our issues that we have are short-term right now.", "Glen Yeung \u2013 Citi", "Can I assume there is no meaningful change in wafer pricing that you see and maybe the same question with respect to you to your customers any meaningful change in pricing?", "Jon Olson", "Yes. On the pricing front, we're not seeing any substantial increases in wafer across the board, but quite frankly, we're not seeing the decreases that we have planned on in our long-term road maps and have typically been able to negotiate. So it's fairly clear the foundries are trying to bolster prices to some degree but we're not getting increases.", "Glen Yeung \u2013 Citi", "And do you pass the lack of decrease through to your customers as well?", "Jon Olson", "Typically not. And the reason Glen, is that, first off, a lot of our revenue is done by our top 10, top 15, top 20 customers and they generally have volume price agreements that are negotiated anywhere from quarterly to annually. And so a fair amount of our pricing is locked in and so you don't typically have opportunities to pass those on until the renegotiation time and of course, we'll do everything we can at that point to make sure we can maintain our margins. And the second point is business is generally quoted far enough in advance, more broadly that it is difficult to come in after the fact, after you've made a quote and raise it. So as new quotes are coming along, we certainly are mindful of what's going on in the environment and doing our best to hold prices up. But in terms of a radical change that you\u2019d see in the P&L, just because we're trying to pass on, quote a surcharge, all our airlines [ph] becomes immediate that doesn't happen in our business model.", "Glen Yeung \u2013 Citi", "And just one quick one. Obviously, falling short of your own shipment potential in the quarter, should we assume then that customers are not able to build inventory or do you really see some customers explicitly trying to build inventory of your parts?", "Jon Olson", "This is a question I know, because every semiconductor company has been asked, are people building inventory in excess of their needs and what's your profile and etcetera. And quite frankly, from the Xilinx perspective, our growth has come from new products, which generally means new designs, etcetera. We've done a lot of work with our customers to try to understand whether they're really selling through and \u2013 or whether they're buffering inventory. And by and large, the response is coming, they're not buffering inventory and sell-through is good. However, we do know of certain customers, even large customers that we believe are buffering some inventory and are ordering farther in advance and they don't seem \u2013 as we've had some difficulty with lead times, they don't seem to be complaining broadly that theirs lines down or whatever. So even though we can't find the data and anybody admitting to us that inventory is being built maybe in excess of their needs, it sure feels like some of what's going on is that. But on the other hand, we're selling a lot of new products and we're pretty confidence those are being sold through.", "Glen Yeung \u2013 Citi", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS.", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "Thank you very much. Let me just ask you about your proposed ramp for new products as the yields improve. What kind of impact should that have on margins as we go into the second half of the year, are you going to be able to maintain your target range of 64 to 66% range?", "Maria Quillard", "Yeah Uche, I really think we're going to be able to maintain in that range of 65 for a few quarters, despite some of the drag that's going on and then hopefully improve after that. And there's a lot of different things that go on in margin relative to product mix and it's not just all about short-term cost changes, based on yields, etcetera. But what we see as a very rapidly improving yield environment on 40, 45-nanometer right now as we start building a lot of product, we think that we can maintain that range, 64 to 66 or 65ish kind of a number while we're going through this yield ramp and then we'll see what happens as get to the end of the year.", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "Sure. Just one more question. On the relative impact of your being constrained, obviously outgrew [ph] you this quarter and also within the guide they seem to be outgrowing you. How much of \u2013 granted, you both have different seasonality (inaudible) but one can't help but notice that it looks like you're losing market share. How much of this do you think you can regain once you start to see capacity ease? And then just how confident you are, I mean, if one looks at UMC's CapEx spend at the high end SoC [ph] TSMC, is it fair to just conclude that it's inevitable you're going to lose market share?", "Jon Olson", "So let me get the first part of that question. So while we are constrained, we don't think we're losing any customers or designs as a result of these short-term constraints. So I don't think that this situation that we have on these selected products has any bearing in the pure, does somebody get more share, win share or lose share. So of I don't think that really has anything.", "If we had a prolonged situation that might cause customers to redesign but it's pretty costly to redesign when you are in these very sticky, complex SoC situations. And by and large, there is a lot of other semiconductor companies scrambling to make to provide product to some of our same customers. And I don't believe we're on the top of the constraint list quite frankly for most of our large customers.", "And then with respect to the foundry differences and CapEx expanding and capacity as to any sort of market share shift one way or the other, I don't think that has any bearing on the situation at all. I think if you look at the seasonality, it's typical that Altera has outgrown us in the front end of the year and then we outgrow in the back end of the year. So I don't see any huge share shifts going on this year.", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "Great. Just one last question for Moshe. I mean, Moshe, you are kind of design into com equipment and this market tends to be traditionally mix or power PC and how do you plan to kind of drive acceptance of this? I mean, what are the relative merits of this strategy you've adopted? Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Uche, if you look at the list of markets that we've gone through as targets, it goes well beyond com equipment. So this is a very broad product offering, is by far the most successful embedded architecture. It continues to grow its market share. The other popular architectures that you have just mentioned are actually losing market share in spades in all of the markets including in communication. And so this is the beginning of an expansion beyond our traditional market and this facilitates our growth in the best way possible.", "So, having very tightly integrated applicable ARM Core, probably the easiest decision to make for this family. And we have tremendous expectations and it wasn't product announcement, it was more of an architecture announcement we made. But as we come up with the product announcement I think you'll see that this provides unparalleled capabilities for huge range of applications and this is one of those products that absolutely will enable us to accelerate the programmable imperative. And in particular replace ASSP. I've gone on the record on that and I know you guys will continue to needle me on that particular point. We have data which shows that that is happening and it's happening in spades now.", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.", "John Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Yeah, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Jon, I want to make sure I understand on the supply constraints. You said about 10 to 11 million in revenue in the March quarter. And you could expect to see a like amount in the June quarter. Is that \u2013 did I read that right?", "Jon Olson", "Yeah. John, I think it will be that much and maybe even a little more.", "John Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And so help me understand. As we move into September, do we think about sort of a phantom backlog of 25 million to catch up as your supply starts to come on or how does that business then migrate into the back half of the year?", "Jon Olson", "Yeah. So, since we're not really forecasting what the overall profile in September is. September, the September quarter has typically been a slower quarter for us as generally particularly wireline but generally communications, customers are off a lot in the summer and Europe is paused and whatever. So, I want to be hesitant to say that gee, we're going to roll over 15, 20 or some amount and that's going to be additive to some run rate. I don't really want you \u2013 I don\u2019t want you to walk away with that statement. But, I do think what I'm trying to indicate is this 10 to maybe $15 million we left this quarter we could have shipped. It's going to be that much and a little bit more than that potentially. It could just be that much. I doubt that we'll be fully caught up.", "John Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And then I guess, Jon. I apologize if you had mentioned this but as you look at the profile of revenue growth in the June quarter by end market, any big differences that you see out there?", "Jon Olson", "The biggest is going to be wireless. So we had a very strong wireless business this last quarter driven primarily out of our European customers, you could see that in our European revenue split. And then as we move into June, it's the wireless business we think is even going to increase more and that's going to be driven both out of the European customer base that's serving the world as well as the China 3G phase IV business which is starting to ramp and those customers are starting to take product in a big way basically this quarter.", "John Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And then my last question, guys. I know the design cycle is relatively long but Altera did put up some outsized gross margins in their quarter. Just kind of curious if that gives you a pricing umbrella to get a little bit better pricing and or an opportunity to go out there and try to gain some share.", "Jon Olson", "Yes. So we did. We certainly have, we did talk about this a little bit earlier. And it's really hard to have short-term pricing in fact to show up on the P&L immediately. But we're aware of the environment and our supply chain and what's going on there and while, we don't want to lose business out there. We certainly are going to do everything we can to get the most value out of our products and if that means raising some prices then we'll do that.", "John Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Perfect. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess you as well as many of your peers have talked about increased visibility going into the back half of the year or customers placing longer dated backlog on you. First of all, I just want to confirm that that's indeed what you're seeing. And then in the context of that what are you seeing from your Asian comps customers into the back half of the year of the calendar year. Do you think that's going to continue to see the strength you're expecting in Q2 or might that tail off a little bit?", "Jon Olson", "Yeah, sure, Jim. The backlog situation, we're definitely seeing products being booked out farther, so out farther within the current quarter and also more into the following quarter. And I think that's really more of a function of lead time increases on selected parts than anything else. Our overall backlog going into the quarter was up 20% over the backlog going into the previous quarter, so quite substantially. But a lot of that was our leading product families as the constraints are becoming clearer to people and they're ordering out to make sure they get supply. So I don\u2019t \u2013 I view this as kind of a fleeting thing that when lead times start to move back in, that the backlog will return to normal patterns for us by and large. If the second question was around our Asia communications customers and the second half of the calendar year. I really don't have much visibility on that. I know that they're going \u2013 they certainly are telling us they're going to ramp very strong this summer relative to phase four business. But beyond that, we have pretty limited visibility as to whether this is going to continue or not.", "James Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "That's very helpful. Thanks. And if I could just do a follow-up on the OpEx. What should we expect in terms of the profile of spending throughout the fiscal year? And specifically, if you just exclude the effects of variable SG&A related to higher sales or lower sales?", "Jon Olson", "It's pretty hard to do the latter because it is part of what we're doing. I mean we forecasted 182 for OpEx for next quarter and I think you can see that as reasonable number for the next several quarter going forward. There would be some \u2013 there could be some adjustments relative to \u2013 if we have sharper spikes in revenue up or down or profitability up or down that deals with those variable expenses but I think if you're trying to draw some sort of a line for us, pretty flat this year.", "James Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "So no big spikes due to tape-outs in the R&D line?", "Jon Olson", "No, there is a little \u2013 there is a beginning of the tape-outs for the next generation in the back half of our fiscal year, more likely the fourth quarter of fiscal year and there's some leftovers going on right now in this quarter and then in the next two quarters there are a few other things going on to help offset that. That's why it ends up being relatively flat.", "James Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie.", "Shawn Webster \u2013 Macquarie", "Yeah, thank you. In terms of \u2013 Jon, I think you mentioned that there were some customers you weren't sure out there that may have built extra inventory maybe just stepping back a bit if you can assess by end market, are there certain end markets that you feel like they're sufficiently supplied or their inventories are normal versus others which are leaner than normal?", "Jon Olson", "I don't think I can draw any specifics around that at all. It's really different by different end market, whether certain sub-segments within those end markets are really well-populated or not, with inventory. So, I would say we know \u2013 I know of a communications customer or two that sounds like they're buffering inventory. I see some industrial customers that are doing that. So, you know, it's really kind of spread around.", "Shawn Webster \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay. And then in terms of the tightness that you experienced, when \u2013 maybe not it's not exactly, but when did you start seeing the tightness or unexpected tightness in your products over the course of the March quarter end, could you share with us what your mix of 40-nanometer is or was in the March quarter?", "Jon Olson", "So we're not segregating out individual technologies within our new products to talk about that. But the tightness, we've been tight probably for four or five months but because demand has been slow growth for Virtex-5, which is where the primary issues are, that's where we're experiencing the tightness. It got to be a bigger issue for us because the ordering patterns were so strong for V-5.", "Shawn Webster \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra with Robert Baird.", "Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert Baird", "Hi. Good afternoon. Is your reason for automotive to decline in the June quarter based on difficult comparison or is there anything else happening in that end market?", "Jon Olson", "I'm sorry, Tristan, I didn't get which end market you are asking about. Could you repeat that?", "Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert Baird", "In automotive, I think you mentioned that you expected some decline in the June quarter.", "Jon Olson", "Yes. So, automotive has been really strong in the last couple of quarters, the last three quarters, actually, and some of that was the snapback from just the auto industry going up, but then, as things picked up it kept getting progressively stronger. Some of that is just a more healthy auto industry but some of that is also us taking more share within the automobile, inside the car from alternative sources.", "Again, this is a great example of ASSPs being supplanted by PLDs and some of the designs that we've been talking about over the last year or so are now starting to kick in and we're starting to see the beginning of more penetration in addition to more just autos being sold.", "Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert Baird", "Okay.", "Jon Olson", "Now the decline aspect is mostly just a little bit of a leveling off and a slight decline, not a significant decline.", "Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert Baird", "Okay. And then your gross margin is currently at about a five-year high and you said that you have confidence you're going to hold to those levels in the second half of the calendar year. But at the same time, as pricing comes down we should also expect consumer mix to pick up in the second half. You are also going to ramp at the 40-nanometer chip, if you know. Are yield improvements the only reason to offset those factors and giving you the confidence that your gross margin can hold?", "Jon Olson", "Well, certainly the yield improvements as we go through the next couple of quarters have pretty sharp yield improvement that does help. But also as we get into the back half of the year, in addition to consumer growing, aerospace and defense also typically grows for us. And that's a good offset. So, the end market mix, we\u2019re not necessarily believing that's going to have a huge impact on us.", "The headwinds on next quarter quite frankly are the fact that we have a lot of V-6 that we're starting to ramp up and it's being sold into wireless, which is one of our \u2013 of all of our end markets, maybe the most challenging on pricing and margin, but at the same time we have a number of cost reduction efforts that have been kicking in and helping give us an offset. So, the forecast is 65 plus or minus a point, so it could be down a point, could be up a point, it's really dependent on how all the factors I just talked about turn out.", "Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert Baird", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.", "Christopher Danely \u2013 JP Morgan", "Thanks, guys. I guess just a little bit of history on lead time issue. I think I remember last year somewhere towards like mid late year we first started talking about delivery issues and lead time problems. So, is this an extension of that same issue? Was it different? Is it different products or is just that same problem just lasting until now?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Totally different. Chris, this is Moshe. It's totally different. Last year if you remember and it's sort of amazing when you think back the semiconductor industry was dead and being buried at the end of Q1 and as a result all of the foundries were shutting down. All of the infrastructure for the foundry business was shutting down and then it turned snapped back in the most amazing way and there was some major issues as the foundries had been closed to reopen them and to bring capacity back online. And, we got impacted by that. I believe it was the second quarter or the second calendar quarter in a big way. A lot of other players got impacted by that actually later in the year. What is happening now is just incredibly robust environment where the foundries are operating at their peak capacity and they're scrambling to bring up additional capacity in particular in advanced process nodes. So, I wouldn't say it's the same. For us, it hit us for one quarter, June quarter of 2009 and once it snapped back and the capacity came online. As Jon pointed out we've now going into we are in our second quarter and we're going to the third quarter of challenges in terms of expanding capacity. But it's a different problem. And it's predominantly at the most advanced process nodes but not restricted to them.", "Christopher Danely \u2013 JP Morgan", "And this time around, have there been any yield issues or is it purely been demand that's been much better than you expected and the wafer supply has not ramped as much as you expected?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "It's the latter for sure.", "Jon Olson", "Yes. Certainly 65-nanometer, we're continuing to focus on improving yields there because the leverage for us is so significant both for parts and units and margin there. And the other 40-nanometer process while we are the lead customer for UMC on that process, we are on our road map for yields in that product family generation. So, we aren't, we've not deviated from our road map.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Great. And then last question. Now, that we're sitting on tons of cash provided the government doesn't come and take it away from you. In terms of usage of cash between paying debt down, buying back stock, increasing dividend. Can you maybe discuss that a little bit?", "Jon Olson", "Yeah. Sure. Our net cash is at $1.3 billion which is higher than we \u2013 than our target; we would like to be below $1 billion. Buying the debt back at the current price is not a good MPV situation for us at all because of some of the tax advantages we get out of that that particular instrument that we did. So, we did raise our dividend in this past year a couple of quarters ago. We're continued to buy back shares in this last quarter $125 million worth. So, we are committed to both increasing dividends on a go-forward basis and taking any other cash above our targets, cash targets and doing buy \u2013 share repurchase with that.", "Christopher Danely \u2013 JPMorgan", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.", "Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks for taking the question. I need some help in understanding the wireless revenues. And if you can put it in context of the wireless CapEx. Last year, your wireless revenues grew I'd say close to 30% and you're running at record level and looks like if you stay on this course you can grow about the same amount where as we hear on the headline numbers the CapEx \u2013 wireless CapEx going to be flattish. Can you help in reconciling, is it your content increasing or what's \u2013 how should we take the headline CapEx number and think of your wireless revenues?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "From my perspective, Mahesh, it is true that maybe there is a reduction, but primarily on the news protocols and the upgrading of the equipment to the \u2013 for example, 3G in China that continues at a very fast rate and they're doing it in phases and this phase \u2013 this coming phase, fourth round is a very significant one. And we're seeing it in China. We're seeing an upgrade in North America and potentially Western Europe to 4G over time and they're still waiting for the Indian portion to pan out. But it's continuing to grow and the wireless continues to do well and best we can tell it's going to continue to be a driver going forward. It is possible that it could have been even better or it could be even better if they increase CapEx. But we don't see a slowdown on these new deployments. We really see that happening. If you look at what is \u2013 everything that we're aware of as this insatiable demand for bandwidth, all of the new widgets that everyone is using now are data and video-driven and there's just huge demands and basically the networks, the data communication networks are having great problems and they have to be upgraded. And you've seen cases, very public cases where some of the big carriers have actually stopped selling devices because their network can't handle the bandwidth. That's not a viable business for them to continue to stay in that model. So, I'm quite bullish on wireless and it's possible that it could be even greater, but we see it continuing at a very positive level.", "Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you. And one more quick one on that 10 million and 15 million probably you will lose. So what happens to the customer, which didn't get your part, is it that they just are not able to ship those parts or are they going to get it late? Where does that requirement go away? I mean, because you're saying that you might not get back \u2013 get it back in September, necessarily. How do we reconcile that missed revenues?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "I couldn't call that missed revenues. I think you misconstrued what Jon said. Some of the customers are building inventory. If we had additional product we could help them short-term. If not, these products are typically sole sourced. So, as long as they continue to build and sell their equipment. And keep in mind that we're in an infrastructure play as opposed to consumer play, so the upgrades do happen, then we do get that business. And it will hopefully build up and that's why we're scrambling to get it to those customers as soon as we can.", "Jon Olson", "Any specific customer that doesn't get their parts in week, in the last week or the second to last week of the quarter will get it two weeks later, and it's a series of events that create these delinquencies over time. It isn't like the same customer won't get everything that they want at the end of this quarter and at the end of next quarter. It's not necessarily \u2013 doesn't work that way. We have so many customers and such a broad focus and we are responding with getting more parts out to meet the customers' orders. So it could be different part packages for different customers that could be short at the end of one quarter versus another quarter.", "Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. All right. I get it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA.", "Srini Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA", "Jon, a couple of clarifications. On OpEx I was hoping that it would come down in the second half of the year. Just wondering if you're planning to spend on any additional tape-outs or if this is mostly revenue related?", "Jon Olson", "So, the back half of the year is strictly our fourth quarter of our fiscal year is definitely impacted by 28-nanometer tape-outs, so the ramp for the next generation begins. So that's what \u2013 that\u2019s one of the things that's impacting it. But we do \u2013 we're holding the line on our resourcing level, and with that putting out more products including the follow-on announcement that will come from our ARM relationships. So we are I think doing a good job of not growing R&D dollars, while being able to address additional markets in addition to the traditional PLD segment.", "Srini Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA", "Okay. And then on the defense business, Jon, you said it's down sequentially which is somewhat different from what some of your peers are reporting. Just wondering, I'm talking about the industrial business. I\u2019m wondering if the defense decline explains all of the weakness in industrial or if the segment is somewhat also supply-constrained.", "Jon Olson", "Now the defense \u2013 no, it's not supply. Generally, that\u2019s not supply constrained. Defense decline does explain the drop in our industrial and other category. The other sub-segments were flat to up. So, it really is just the defense and there is a seasonal pattern to defense that we've had pretty pronounced over the last five years as we've grown our defense business substantially. And it\u2019s typified by a weaker March and June and stronger September and December, which September quarters and December quarters bracket the beginning of the government\u2019s fiscal year where the purchasing \u2013 lots of the purchasing activities tend to happen.", "Srini Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA", "Thank you, Jon.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo Securities.", "David Wong \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "The ramp in 40-nanometer, the 45-nanometer products, do they open up any particular new segments or new product types for you that you're selling into?", "Jon Olson", "We definitely do because as they bring down the power, as they bring down the price, they enable us to address a whole host of new markets and actually to replace ASICs and ASSPs in a more aggressive way so it does broaden and deepen our reach into the applications we can address. Even in some of our traditional markets, for example, if you look at military or communications infrastructure. When you move into the 40 and 45 node, we can compete with ASICs and ASSPs in a more aggressive manner. So, it's both new applications but also deepening inside the existing traditional applications we have.", "David Wong \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Can you point to any new types of systems you haven't been in before? Can you give us any specific examples?", "Jon Olson", "Well. You can look at examples in the high end of the consumer world where we're seeing the next generation of a lot of the displays. You know, that is something where I think we will expand our reach and it continues, we had some in past generations but it I believe becomes a lot more attractive when you have something like our 45-nanometer, Spartan-6 product and if you, that's sort of at the most cost sensitive side of our business. If you go at the high end of our business actually in the military space, you can address a whole host of new applications where they're actually significant volumes of these products and those in the past were not accessible to us and in the distant past used to be served just by ASIC. So, it really raises the water line for across the board in terms of applications we can service.", "David Wong \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Apurva Patel.", "Apurva Patel \u2013 Ticonderoga Securities", "Hi. In terms of your ARM-based architecture, unified architecture. Do you believe you need to have additional software capabilities?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well. Software is a lot of things. So when you look at the implementation software which is necessary in order to design the FPGA in of itself, you do need additional capabilities because you now have a very applicable high performance ARM core and you want to make that accessible to the customer and so that requires an expansion which is targeted at the embedded hardware that we have. When you go beyond that then there are layers of software which get closer and closer to the target applications. Those by and large are not provided by us, they are available through the extensive ARM ecosystem which is unparalleled in terms of the support it has for a broad set of applications. So, yes. There are demands but they are serviced in some cases by us in other cases by the ecosystem and of course ARM does provide quite a bit of that too.", "Apurva Patel \u2013 Ticonderoga Securities", "And in terms of comms business you referred that wireless again is driven by bandwidth and wireless side but when did the pull come in on the wireless side?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "When did the what?", "Apurva Patel \u2013 Ticonderoga Securities", "On the wireless side.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well. So the wired side, a lot of wired side is related to network infrastructure associated with Internet and that particular part of the bandwidth pipe. So that strength has been happening particularly as IT departments and companies are starting to buy more equipment. So we're obviously very active in routers and in data switches and things like that. So, that business has come back very sharply for us over the last couple of quarters and we think that's going to continue.", "Apurva Patel \u2013 Ticonderoga Securities", "Thank you.", "Maria Quillard", "Operator, one last question, please?", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.", "Sabi \u2013 Raymond James", "This is Sabi [ph] on behalf of Hans. Thanks for taking my question. I was just kind of hoping if \u2013 could you give a little bit more color on kind of within the new products and main stream, how the groups perform in 1Q and kind of how you \u2013 fourth quarter and how you expect it to perform throughout the year?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Yeah. So our new products are generally based on when the product was introduced into the market and they tend to be obviously then as a result our highest technology. So 40, 45-nanometer products, 65-nanometer products and then the very tail end of 90-nanometer and we every two years or so we realign those obviously as the generations move forward. We anticipate the new products to continue to grow throughout the fiscal year in the way things look right now, quite strongly and then sequential quarter growth every quarter throughout the year. The mainstream and base products are by definition then are older and oldest generation and they tend to have a different kind of profile. So the base being the oldest of them generally declines quarter-after-quarter-after-quarter. And the mainstream declines a little less quarter-after-quarter and that's depending on how older designs, the long tail FPLD designs what the pattern is for replacements out in the market or not. So if you were drawing a set of lines, you'd say new products, very positive slope and up to the right, mainstream, generally a gentle slope down to the left. And then base products, a more sharp decline down to the right \u2013 sorry, both down to the right.", "Sabi \u2013 Raymond James", "All right. And then just a quick follow-up on that, just on kind of the examples that you give on the automotive where you're seeing kind of bigger market share take from the ASSPs, any other examples that you can give, more recent?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "There are lots of them. There's a whole host of industrial applications where the \u2013 there used to be some traditional ASSP solutions which \u2013 and now they're at the end of the life and there's no roadmap for them, so we're actually seeing a lot of those devices in military, even another example, where that device it could have been a dedicated microcontroller is now being implemented inside in FPGA. So this is pervasive. It's not limited to automotive. Automotive may be one interesting application, but this does happen across the board pretty broadly and it's driven by the fact that at new process nodes it becomes prohibitively expensive to design and ASSP. So \u2013 and so of these ASSPs were designed at 130-nanometers, for example, and the companies that design them can't afford to take them forward to new aggressive nodes and the customers are stuck and you can implement those 130 and even 90-nanometer ASSPs sometimes quite cost effectively in advanced state-of-the-art FPGAs and that is what is happening on a broad basis.", "Jon Olson", "Motor control and industrial would be one, solid state storage device controllers, there is examples of where people have typically used ASSPs in order to perform those functions. Now, needing custom algorithms to improve energy consumption and motor control, for example, et cetera, are using FPGAs for that, not ASSPs.", "Sabi \u2013 Raymond James", "All right. Thanks, guys.", "Maria Quillard", "Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us today. We have a playback of this call beginning at 5 PM Pacific, 8 PM Eastern. For a copy of our earnings release, please visit our IR website.", "Our next earnings release date for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 will be Wednesday, July 21st, after the market closes. This quarter we'll be presenting at the JPMorgan Technology Conference in Boston, and the UBS Tech Conference in New York City. This completes our call.

My name is Kerry and I will be your conference operator. I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Please limit your questions to one to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Moshe, you may begin your conference.", "Rick Muscha", "Well, thank you and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the September quarter and then we\u2019ll open the call for questions.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially. We refer you to the documents the company files with the SEC including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.", "This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations\u2019 website. Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.", "Jon Olson", "Thank you, Rick. Before I begin my remarks about the quarter, I would like to formally introduce Rick Muscha, our new leader of Investor Relations. Rick has been with Xilinx for 10 years in a variety of financial management positions, most recently Corporate Planning. He has strong finance knowledge as well as a solid understanding of products and the industry.", "I believe he will be a strong contributor to our Investor Relations group. And you can expect the same high quality of support that you are accustomed to from both Rick and Lori Owen who remains a key interface to you all.", "During today\u2019s commentary, I will review our September quarter business results. I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the December quarter. September quarter sales increased 4% sequentially to a record $620 million. The September quarter was a strong quarter setting records for both sales and operating income.", "Turns business for the quarter was 48%, down from 53% in the prior quarter. The lower turns number was indicative of a strong backlog going into the quarter with the turns level resulting close to the level we had anticipated. Supply constraints eased during the quarter and Xilinx exited the quarter with reduced delinquencies and lower overall lead times.", "Gross margin at 65.6% was slightly higher than guided primarily due to both yield improvement and mix towards more profitable products. This is up from 61.9% in the same quarter of the prior year.", "Operating expenses of $184 million represented 30% of sales down from 42% of sales in the same quarter of the prior year. This resulted in record operating income of $223 million, an increase of 170% from the same quarter of the prior year. This compares to a 49% increase in sales during the same time period.", "Operating margin of 36% was up from 20% a year ago and a new record for Xilinx. New product sales increased 17% sequentially in the September quarter, 34% of sales driven by exceptionally strong growth from the Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families. Combined sales from these families nearly doubled sequentially. Virtex-5 sales -- excuse me -- more than doubled sequentially. Virtex-5 sales also increased during the quarter. Sales from mainstream and base products both declined sequentially.", "Japan was our strongest geography during the quarter with sales increasing 22% sequentially, driven by consumer and wired communications. Asia-Pacific sales increased 7% sequentially due primarily to increases from communications and data processing.", "European sales increased 4% sequentially, driven by wireless and industrial and other. North American sales decreased 3% sequentially with declines from defense and communications more than offsetting increases in audio/video broadcast and test and measurement.", "From an end market perspective, communication sales increased 5% sequentially driven by increases in wireless sales. Wireline sales decreased sequentially during the quarter.", "Industrial and other sales were essentially flat as decreases in defense offset were offset increases in test and measurement. Consumer and automotive sales were up 7% sequentially, driven by increases in consumer and audio/video broadcast and data processing. Sales increased 6% driven by computer and data processing applications.", "Net income for the quarter was $171 million or $0.65 per diluted share. Other income and expense was a net expense of $3 million and included approximately $4 million of investment gains.", "Operating cash flow for the September quarter was $42 million before $15 million in CapEx. Cash flow was impacted primarily by an increase in receivables and to a lesser extent an increase in inventories. As we reported in our last 10-Q filing, we are temporarily providing extended payment terms to our primary distribution partner in exchange for a significant increase in technical selling resources designed to broaden the reach to customers worldwide, consistent with the sales strategy of the company.", "Given distributor compensation for creating new business lags the investment, our temporary credit arrangement was designed to help offset working capital at the distributor. The impact to Xilinx is timing of cash collections only as we gradually return to historic credit terms by mid calendar year 2011.", "After factoring in the impact to cash flow of the temporary credit terms, we are expecting FY \u201811 operating cash flow to exceed $600 million.", "During the quarter, Xilinx repurchased 1.3 million shares for $33 million. We also paid $42 million in cash dividends. The tax rate of the September quarter was 22%.", "Let me now comment on the Balance Sheet. Cash and investments was essentially flat during the quarter at approximately $2.1 billion. We now have approximately 1.3 billion outstanding convertible debt. And our net cash position is approximately $800 million.", "Day Sales Outstanding increased to 82 days in the September quarter. We expect DSOs to decline quarter-over-quarter consistent with the explanation on cash flow provided earlier. Combined inventory days in the September quarter were 89, up from 80 days in the prior quarter. We were able to build inventory during the quarter easing supply constraints for most devises.", "In the December quarter, we expect inventory days to grow as we return to full safety stock models and we build for the ramp of 40-45-nanometer product families. We expect days of inventory to be towards the high end of our model of 90-100 days.", "Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the December quarter of fiscal year 11. Our backlog heading into the quarter is down slightly sequentially but at historic high levels. We are expecting to see continued strength from our Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families.", "From an end market perspective, we are expecting sales from communications to be approximately flat as increases in wired communication are offset by decreases from wireless communications.

New product sales drove our growth during the quarter.", "Sales from all product families increased sequentially with particularly strong incremental gains coming from our newest Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families. Combined sales of these 40-45 nanometer products more than doubled sequentially driven by wireless communications and 3D TV.

Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, if you could comment on the customer order patterns that you saw as you progressed through the September quarter and what you seen so far in the December quarter. And I guess specifically with respect to the communications vertical, any color you can provide on wireless, wireline and networking would be great?", "Jon Olson", "Sure, Jim. Let me take that. So the pattern throughout the quarter was pretty much as we expected. We were very well booked going into the quarter. And so we felt it was more a mid-to-end of quarter turns kind of environment for us and while there was certainly better weeks than some weeks and worst weeks -- other weeks along the way in the second half of the quarter, it was actually a little more back-end loaded as we had anticipated.", "That being said, if you think about another way to look at it is do we have lots of rescheduling cancellations, rebalancing of inventory, I would say we had a modest amount greater than we normally have and it does start. We are certainly seeing signs of stabilization along customers in terms of their demand, not us. So the demand is still very solid. It\u2019s still at the higher level but the growth rates are certainly have mitigated to some degree.", "And so the sense is generally across communications that where things are starting to get a little bit more balanced. Wireless is very strong for us this quarter. I\u2019d say enterprise was flattish kind of thing and Telecom was a little bit down for us. And I\u2019d characterize the wireless business as still being very, very good. And we\u2019re still very bullish on wireless over the long-term and the enterprise business still is quite solid for us.", "James Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thanks, Jon. That\u2019s helpful. And then as a follow-up, I guess one can\u2019t help but kind of notice the divergence between the rates in terms of a sequential growth that you\u2019re seeing relative to your largest competitor. So I was wondering if you could give us any kind of sense for what you\u2019d chalk that up to. Is it the fact that your lead times have come down to faster than your competitor? Is it end market or customer exposure or some kind of competitive thing?", "Jon Olson", "Well, let me take a [path at] it. I know, it\u2019s kind of all of the above. I think you cut all, all of the best. If you look at just as best as we can tell about the 40-45 nanometer share between the two, we shipped significantly more product this particular quarter. And our estimates based on what Altera said yesterday, we\u2019re in the neighborhood of 40% share at this point in time acknowledging that we started later than they did in terms of shipping production worthy products.", "And Moshe talked in his commentary about the strong high speed transceiver uptake in the optical area and other areas for us. And so I think we\u2019re starting to gain lots of traction across-the-board in design wins and beginning to equalize that. And again, we have the only high-volume product out there on the market and that\u2019s really doing very, very well particularly with the device of transceivers.", "So all that feels really good. But having said that, you do look at their numbers and our numbers and clearly, there\u2019s some elevated growth. And that I think is attributed to the different profiles of inventory. We have a lot of consigned inventory locations across and so any inventory \u2013 might there is any inventory adjustment that could be coming downstream, might be a little more muted with us.", "Again this is a theory because I can only see what our business is doing. And we do play in different parts of some of these end markets. For example, we\u2019re very strong in 3D TV. And they have strengths in other areas. So it\u2019s a bit of a timing thing going on here, I would suspect as well between us relative to end markets and customers. ", "James Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Uche Orji of UBS.", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "Thank you very much. Can I just ask you to explain a little bit more about the lead time contraction you\u2019re talking about. Any way you can quantify that and also if you can talk about what\u2019s available to you now from the foundries as you talk about stabilization? Is it, with all of the delinquencies going forward what should we be thinking about as long-term growth rate for Xilinx now?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, from a pure lead time, leaving last quarter we had -- I\u2019ll just talk average lead times about last quarter means June quarter, average lead times of about 12 weeks and then leaving this quarter or more in the nine week on average. And by the time we get to December, we think we will be pretty much fully across the board back to our normal four week lead time. So that should characterize for you that both we are getting more wafers quarter after quarter and then that should also say we\u2019ve been able to manage through our delinquencies better than we anticipated in our level of delinquencies in this quarter, we\u2019re significantly smaller than they were so certainly ahead of schedule.", "And I talked about -- we\u2019ve talked about the stabilization of our customers demand and some reshuffling of inventory and orders. I think what you\u2019re seeing is the beginning of flushing out some of that inventory that our customers are holding and getting themselves a little more back in balance. I think we\u2019re seeing that happen right now.", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "Just a different question. If I look at the communications area, anymore detail as to what\u2019s really going on with the wireless? So how should we expect and what are the key things that will drive wireless growth near term and over the next year and specifically we can talk about the differences as what\u2019s happening in China versus India and also any comments on LTE at this stage? And then on wireline, also when you talk about inventory correction, this really weighs almost of the inventory correction within your customer base and just for me to understand why wireline is going to be down in your guidance for Q4.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Yeah. So we talk a little bit about wireless first and then we\u2019ll go to wireline. So the wireless piece, China is still very strong for us and we\u2019re doing very, very well there, shipping into the Phase IV and the view there is that there is always a kind of a hump around these phases, but there\u2019s also other providers and other technologies that are being deployed in China. So this isn\u2019t like an all-or-nothing thing that ends and goes to zero towards a law, at the end of the cycle over the next quarter or so. There is a base business there and I think there will still be underlying strength that\u2019s going on relative to the wireless business there. We are shipping products to customers that we do believe are ending up in India. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s been a strong uptake relative to deployment yet from the new licenses, but there is a beginning of thins going on there and we are definitely participating in that area.", "In the LTE rollout and HSTPA expansions in the United States those are going quite well. And I do believe those will continue to ship in high volumes over the next several quarters as well. So we are still very positive about the wireless environment going forward and we\u2019ve had a very significant growth rate year-over-year in wireless and we do believe we\u2019ll be able to keep that going if you will based on all those data points I just talked about. On the wireline, I believe I heard you say that we\u2019re forecasting wireline to be down or actually\u2026\u2026", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "Maybe I misheard you, sorry.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Yeah. We forecasted it to be up and the strength of that is both from the Telecom players that we see and then broadly, customers that we have and then broadly from an enterprise perspective, that also is a positive going in this quarter. So both of those areas for us we think will be up.", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "All right. Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung of Citi.", "Glen Yeung \u2013 Citi", "Thank you. We\u2019re at a period now whereas you say lead times are coming down and just mathematically your turns requirements this quarter are a little less and John I think when we talked in September you\u2019d mentioned cancellations are a little higher than normal. All these things cyclically point to risk and yet the sense is that there\u2019s some degree of orderliness if that\u2019s a word in the demand environment or in your customer demand environment. I wonder if you could just look back at past cycles either Jon or Moshe and give us a sense if that\u2019s an accurate statement. Does it seem more orderly despite the fact it should be more chaotic?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Yeah. My view, Glen, your statements were accurate I believe, in terms of what you and I have talked about and I do believe at least at this point in time things still feel very orderly and not frantic from our customers in either direction meaning people are so frantic to get more inventory they will do anything and the other side is they are so frantic they are canceling everything across the board. Neither of those thins are happening. It feels very as you say orderly and non-chaotic and who knows what the environment will be another quarter from now, but it doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re in some sort of a, we\u2019re just about to have some horrible cycle ahead of us but again, it does feel slightly different than previous cycles but maybe it also it could be early, you never know.", "Glen Yeung \u2013 Citi", "Okay. And then second question is really just a clarification. Did I hear you say that the level, sorry, I know you said that level of cancellations and rescheduling were a little higher than normal in the September quarter. Did I hear you say that it started to stabilize and that has come back to normal or is it still relatively high at this point?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, I didn\u2019t want to characterize in the beginning as it was high absolutely. I said the level increased a little bit from a little above normal, I wouldn\u2019t call it high because I don\u2019t want to project things are frantic because they really aren\u2019t, but the stabilization comment was more about our customers changing their orders, swapping this part for that part, oversupply, undersupply, those things going on that when those things, when you start seeing those things happen, it isn\u2019t, it changes from the environment.", "I\u2019ll take whatever you can give me of all these parts to now I\u2019m rebalancing my supply chain, to be either consistent with what I need from an end market perspective or be consistent with what I\u2019m getting from other semiconductor companies because we\u2019re still hearing that some communication, some bills are being held up because of other semiconductor companies not being able to provide parts. So there still is a sense that there is some pent-up demand out there from some of our customers, but there have been not as frantic as they have been in the past and they are rebalancing supply.", "Glen Yeung \u2013 Citi", "That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria of RBC Capital Markets.", "Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you. Jon, a quick question on the segment for the December quarter you gave. Just want to make sure that I got it right. You said that the communication flat, industrial that one flat and data processing down and consumer up. And if that is correct, if I enter that number, I guess data processing will be down something like 40%. Is that accurate and if that is, is there a program ending, what\u2019s going on in that segment?", "Jon Olson", "No. Because we didn\u2019t give you the degree of up and down, I guess it\u2019s a little hard to extrapolate that number but no, data processing is definitely not -- we aren\u2019t expecting that to go down 40%. I guess I\u2019m not really sure how you got all that, but -- ", "Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Well you have two segments flat, one up and there is only one small segment down and to have the overall revenue down 2% that segment has to be down a lot.", "Jon Olson", "I see what you\u2019re saying. Yeah, so the fact that the mid point of our range is down 2% that might indicate that maybe communications is -- when we say flat, flat could be plus or minus a percent or two, so I think I\u2019m a scribing flat to be within a maybe a slightly broader range than absolute zero is what you are so. I think there\u2019s a little bit of -- I would say potential rounding kind of things going on between the [two] and his dialogue but anyway.", "Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Okay. That clarifies it. And again if you look at your sub segments, where would you think that there is most risk often inventory correction and is it ISM because that\u2019s more broad based or can you point to a sub segment?", "Jon Olson", "Well, I would say -- history would say whether it\u2019s a concentration of high volume with large customers there\u2019s more risk than if it\u2019s broadly distributed because if it\u2019s broadly distributed then some customers designs could be more successful than others. So I\u2019d have to normally say it would be something in the communications line where the biggest risk could be if there was a slowdown in telecom, capital spending or somehow wireless orders started getting cancelled or something like that.", "Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster of Macquarie.", "Shawn Webster \u2013 Macquarie", "Great. Thank you. So on the days of sales you said you expected to normalize as we get into the middle of 2011. Does that mean it goes back down to the 40-50 range or is there a new range given the new programs you have in place?", "Jon Olson", "So the answer to your question is, yes, by the middle of the year it will get back to more of a historic range and I think you can look back at history, we\u2019re always somewhere into the I\u2019d say 45 to 55 day range, somewhere in that range. It can bounce around depending on how back end loaded the shipments are at any given quarter but no we\u2019re not setting a new model for DSO. We truly will get back to our historic range.", "Shawn Webster \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay. Great. And then on the operating expense, as we get into the March quarter maybe beyond, can you give us a sense of how you expect your operating expenses to evolve recognizing you might have had some restructuring charges I guess in December?", "Jon Olson", "Yeah. The March quarter, we will start to have some tape out activity relative to 28-nanometer. So mass could, costs could move up a little bit in R&D and there will be a little bit of additional restructuring we believe in the March quarter as well. So there will be a little bit of -- again the same kind of up -- a little bit of upward bias but not to a great deal. And at this point in time we\u2019re really not talking about the next Fiscal Year, but I will make the statement that we do believe mass and wafer costs will go up, just will cause engineering to go up next year, because we will be taking out a large number of 28-nanometer products and those mass costs significantly more than the last generation.", "Shawn Webster \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay. And then two more things if I may? On the 28-nanometer, do you expect to still be shipping those to your customers in Q1 and then also can you give us, on the programmable logic displacement theme, you\u2019ve been talking about unique design wins last quarter they grew 50% sequentially. Can you give us an update on that for the September quarter?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. So we definitely expect to be sampling devices to our key customers in the first quarter of 2011 and that program is on schedule to deliver. And with regards to ASIC and ASSP displacement, I believe the growth was about 15 to 20%, something like that, vis-\u00e0-vis the previous quarter. So it\u2019s in the hundred and it didn\u2019t grow by 50% but it continued to grow in absolute numbers but significantly. This is something we\u2019re tracking and this trend is just continuing to gather steam and with 40, 45 and then 28, it becomes much more prevalent whereas with 90 and 65, it was just the tip of the iceberg.", "Shawn Webster \u2013 Macquarie", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Luke of Barclays Capital.", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thanks so much. Jon, were you saying that your inventory was going to be higher as you exited the quarter? Could you just clarify what you were saying there? Could you also just clarify, with the $200 million rise in the accounts receivable, what is it that your distributors are doing for you to prompt that and what is going on there? Thanks.", "Jim Olson", "So on the inventory growth, inventory did grow a little bit. Net inventory was up like $18 million this quarter and we expect it will grow some next quarter and it\u2019s really a function that we do have this higher revenue level rate, so we do need inventory to support it to get back to obviously a full safety stock. But also in the beginning of a -- what happens in the beginning of a ramp for new product introductions is the product always costs more in the beginning and therefore it becomes a \u2013 a few quarters it becomes a very significant part of your inventory balance just because of the cost content and that\u2019s causing inventory to rise and I would expect then inventory to start declining after that towards the end of our fiscal year and into the next fiscal year.", "So I\u2019m really not too concerned about inventory dollars going up right now. From that perspective, I think we have a pretty good handle on things right now and we are getting caught up with all of the wafers we need from foundries and will adjust our wafer requests as appropriate in order to keep our inventory in balance. We think we have a pretty good shot at doing that, understanding how to do that.", "On the increase in accounts receivable and therefore the impact to our cash flow and the question of what\u2019s the distributor doing for us that\u2019s so important. As I said in our remarks, they are putting in a significant number of technical resources and I think we\u2019ve talked about in our Analyst meetings and some other conversations around how much focused and important it is for us to get the growth from our largest customers. And so it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re forsaking all of the other customers by any means, but there is some level of redistribution of where the focus is going to be from Xilinx sales initiatives and demand creation and where the distributor is going to focus on. And in order to do that we have to stay very tightly coupled with our distribution partner and we together have made the decision of where we want them and which customers and how those technical resources are deployed. And it\u2019s basically a win-win for both of us along the way, because we can focus in what we think are the right things for high growth from our sales force and then get an opportunity to bring in a variety of new business for us in some areas and develop customers that we were beginning to develop on our own through our own sales force.", "So as we talked about in previous calls, we have ended our relationship with another distributor and given all our business to Avnet as one worldwide distributor. There\u2019s always a lag in when the compensation flows to the old guys and when it comes to the new person. And in order for us to really get this moving faster, it needed some of our help in anyway we can in order to do that. And it seemed like a reasonable way to do it was to help them through improving or offsetting their working capital penalty for investing earlier and faster like we asked them to do.", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "But it normalizes by the middle of next year?", "Jon Olson", "Yeah. Totally normalizes by the middle of next year.", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "And then on your interest expense, it seems the jump from negative 3.5 to \u2013 well, from 3.5 million to 9 million, what\u2019s the dynamic there? What should we think about it going forward?", "Jon Olson", "All right. So in the 3 million that we had, there was a $4 million gain, so if you normalize for that, the number would have been more like a $7 million number. And we always have some positives and negatives that drag in addition to just interest expense and interest income. In the forecast that we have is 9 million, it\u2019s kind of vanilla if you will. It\u2019s the -- what ends up being about $13.5 million of quarterly interest expense offset by the interest income that we have which by the way -- how low the interest rates are, so the offset is it\u2019s not as big as it was years ago. And so the negative 9 million is for the most part the pure interest expense offset by our income from our portfolio.", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Lastly, in March, having stabilized as you would put it in terms of the lead times and the availability of products. The beginning of the years has historically been a firmer period for you. Given the rate of momentum and the market seems to be slowing, do you have any kind of broad color in terms of how you\u2019d expect that to be now?", "Jon Olson", "We\u2019re really not going to forecast that quarter today, Tim. Our visibility still isn\u2019t the greatest in the world on what\u2019s going on and certainly, we feel like we can manage through any inventory adjustments etc. appropriately. But I think it\u2019s premature to kind of pin an estimate or too much color on March at this point in time. ", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Benjamin of Jeffries & Company.", "Adam Benjamin \u2013 Jeffries & Company", "Thanks, guys. First just on wireless, I know it was asked a little bit but if you look at your business versus your main competitor, there is a divergence here and I was just curious if you can maybe elaborate, is it in terms of your specific customers that you think that you\u2019re penetrated in or is there some other specific share loss that you think is explaining that?", "Jon Olson", "I think from an actual -- from September quarter I don\u2019t know that I see the diversions the same way. We grew our wireless business double digits, so we had a very strong wireless business performance I think this quarter. With respect to the forecasted quarter, December quarter, I think that what we\u2019re seeing is that the lead time issues that we were experiencing were heavily weighted towards our Vertex-5 family and that is a very, very strong performer in our overall wireless business.", "It\u2019s very a over weighted part if you will by a long shot in terms of our wireless suppliers and as lead times are shifting and changing, I think the order patterns from our customers are changing a little bit and this is probably -- I\u2019d say rest of world taking China out and it\u2019s just I think it\u2019s just a matter of rebalancing the inventory flow and it\u2019s not a long-term pattern that you\u2019d see that much divergence between the two of us.", "Adam Benjamin \u2013 Jeffries & Company", "Okay. Got it. And then as it relates to the turns rates that you\u2019ve guided to, can you just give a little more detail as to typically how you look at that and why you came up with 48% this quarter, I think historically that\u2019s right around where it is but its been lower over the last several quarters. So I was just curious if you could give more color as to how you get to 48% this quarter.", "Jon Olson", "Sure. The turns rate for us is really a function of how the lead time and how well we\u2019re booked going into the quarter and we had even though we\u2019re down slightly in our backlog, we\u2019re not down very much, we said a couple of percentage points so it really isn\u2019t much of an adjustment down. And so we still continue to be very, very well booked and we kind of feel that if anybody was out there trying to take inventory early because of lead times and trying to scroll some things away if they were actually doing that out there, then they are not going to be doing that as their lead times come back to four weeks by the end of the quarter. So we look at all those patterns and say the December quarter with all its \u2013 its strength or the historical pattern. Looks quite a bit like the September quarter in terms of a good strong backlog in that turns level to deliver our number. That\u2019s the thought process we went through.", "Adam Benjamin \u2013 Jeffries & Company", "Great. Thanks a lot guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra of Robert W. Baird.", "Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Hi, good afternoon. You started the year more supply constrained then your competitor and now your supply constrain are diminishing assumingly faster. Is this related to fundamental shift in market share or is it due to timing as you mentioned earlier and also if you could expand on the consigned inventory arrangements that you have and perhaps quantify that?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Yeah. So the supply constraints are related to our supply chain which isn\u2019t, we don\u2019t have the two companies on the same supply chain with different suppliers, so I can\u2019t really comment on their supply chain versus ours. I can only comment on ours and we spent a lot of time with our foundry partners were the primary shortage has been working through this with them and as certainly as they\u2019ve gotten freer, they\u2019ve allocated more and more wafers in our way because we still really need them, so I think from that perspective, the supply side, our objective was to get well and we\u2019re getting well by December.", "On the demand side relative to delinquencies and again, there is some timing going on and I\u2019d just point to the fact that we have supply models that we think are helping us mitigate any gigantic adjustment pending some macroeconomic set back going on in the world, but we think we\u2019re pretty confident of that and the reference to supply chain models like consigned inventory, we really don\u2019t disclose the percentage of what we have but they certainly have been growing in their favor with our large customers and we\u2019ve been shipping more and more directly to them, to these very large customers and less and less using distribution models in order to do that because they want a lot more of a just in time, just in time model. And given the fact that we are -- our top communications customers are very large for us and most of them have moved to some variation of that model, within our top 10, there\u2019s are quite a bit of that revenue is supplied that way.", "Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Great. That\u2019s very useful and finally, since the delinquency rate is falling, should that trend into a higher gross margin because I think you had a comment earlier this year that this was putting -- sitting on your gross margin as a result.", "Jon Olson", "I think the delinquency -- the only thing that related to the Supply Chain and the gross margin with the delinquency is as the foundries have been very, very full, the rate of cost declines that we\u2019ve been getting has been more difficult to achieve. And at this point in time, I\u2019m not changing that statement because the foundries still are full and we\u2019ve been doing everything we can to expedite things for our customers. And there\u2019s been cost pressure as a result of that.", "Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely of J.P. Morgan.", "Chris Danely \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Thanks guys. Jon, just to follow-up on your response to the previous question, so when do you expect your foundry supply to be all set, done and normalized, I guess, in terms of wafers?", "Jon Olson", "We believe by the end of the quarter, we\u2019ll be back in, what I would call the historical shape of getting everything that we want and need both is kind of how I\u2019d describe it. So by the end of December, we should be in that state. And we should be -- well it won\u2019t be everything won\u2019t be -- all products won\u2019t be at safety stock -- full safety stock levels, a majority of them will be.", "Chris Danely \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Great. And then so you guys laid out your 28-nanometer ramp and ship schedule. I\u2019m sure you listened to your competitors call yesterday and seen their press release. How would you compare your pace of 28-nanometer product introduction versus your competitor, sort of better, worse or about in line?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "I think the approaches are very different. We have product which is targeted at scalability, low power with the highest capacity possible. They have somewhat of a different approach. They are targeting the very high end of the product offering. They haven\u2019t yet revealed the rest of their product line, which I\u2019m sure they will. I\u2019m very confident in our ability to deliver this in the dates that we have committed to. And the way that the family has been defined, designed and in particular, the unified architecture should enable us to roll it out very efficiently during the year. And that\u2019s sort of the core of what we\u2019re doing.", "We feel very comfortable with that approach. And again, I can\u2019t overstate how important the low power is. It is even at the high end. It is by far the biggest issue. And as a result that\u2019s why we have -- we can enable a part which is close to 2X larger than the competitor\u2019s largest part. Because we focused on power and it\u2019s actually thermal envelope that precludes reaching these levels of density and the low power enables us to get there. So I like our strategy and we\u2019re going to focus on the execution and deliver to these programs.", "Chris Danely \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Great. And I guess just one more longer-term question. In terms of foundry supply, if we\u2019re looking out, let\u2019s call it a year to two years, what would be your ideal mix of supply between UMC, TSMC and everybody else?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, TSMC is the key foundry that we\u2019re using for 28-nanometer and the FPGA business it takes time until you get to very, very high volume. UMC has been a fabulous partner for us and they will continue to carry the majority of our shipments for a very, very long time and if anything, since the 40-nanometer now is just starting to ramp up, there\u2019s room for huge growth with our business with UMC. So overall, the balance should remain that way until the 28-nanometer becomes the largest shipping family and that\u2019s going to take quite a few years.", "Chris Danely \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Berenbaum with Auriga USA.", "Daniel Berenbaum \u2013 Auriga USA", "Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the call. A question on the industrial segment, I\u2019m just wondering how we should think about the growth there. It looks like you\u2019re shipping now about, sort of, 20% above prior peak in industrial and just wondering how we think about the long-term growth in terms of increased adoption of FPGA or would I expect that to kind of normalize or flatten out a little bit?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, when you look at industrial, it\u2019s really an umbrella for a lot of small-fragmented markets. Those small-fragmented markets, you just can\u2019t justify ASSPs and/or ASICs. So if anything the transition in industrial away from historic old ASICs and away from standard products to FPGAs should continue to gather steam. It\u2019s somewhat similar to the trend that happened in the middle aerospace a few years ago where the volumes there were low. They used to do ASICs, they stopped doing ASICs almost across the board at any level and they moved to FPGAs, that\u2019s happening now in the industrial market and we expect that trend to continue.", "Then, of course, the industrial market does depend on world economy and GDP and things of that sort because that\u2019s the nature of that. It\u2019s very broad and very diversified. So it will have fluctuations driven by that but I have no doubt about the secular trend in industrials.", "Jon Olson", "And with the new product offering, with the ARM-based processor, I mean, that\u2019s going also be I think a very popular alternative to those using ASSPs and industrial and scientific and medical areas, certainly a target market for that product family as it rolls out. So our commitment is very strong and we think that\u2019s a growth area for us.", "Daniel Berenbaum \u2013 Auriga USA", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Srini Pajurri of CLSA Securities.", "Srini Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA Securities", "Thank you, Jon. Clarification, I want to make sure I heard this right. Did you say the operating cash flow for the fiscal 2011 will be more than $600 million?", "Jon Olson", "I did say that and if you look at our actual numbers through the second half, you\u2019d say do I understand my arithmetic, right Srini? But yeah, what happens here is as the credit terms start to come back down towards normal and we kind of work through this model, our belief is our modeling shows a tremendous amount of cash generation next quarter and the quarter after in order to get to that greater than $600 million number.", "Srini Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA Securities", "I guess you\u2019d have to assume a certain amount of revenue growth in Q1 to get to that number or is it something that I\u2019m missing here?", "Jon Olson", "Well, we\u2019re not forecasting the March quarter.", "Srini Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA Securities", "Nice try.", "Jon Olson", "That was a really good way. I know that\u2019s not what your intent was but I\u2019m not going to go there yet \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t -- I\u2019m not counting on some sort of astronomical number to drive that. It really is the timing of our invoices with the distributor and our credits and how they get applied that driving this unusual pattern for this quarter and those things work themselves out in a quarter. And then we start generating quite a bit of cash.", "Srini Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA Securities", "Okay. Fair enough. And then on the OpEx number, Jon? Once you\u2019re through the tax as well as the restructuring, is there a steady state number on a quarterly basis that we should think about?", "Jon Olson", "Well, I can\u2019t really provide you a steady state number because there\u2019s a cycle here. Every other year we have is a big increase and then it goes back down to a more normal rate. We aren\u2019t counting the underlying R&D headcount and expense, we aren\u2019t counting on some large growth rate out in time in the next year or so and that\u2019s not what we\u2019re planning on doing. There won\u2019t be some significant like a 20% headcount increase in R&D and those kinds of things. We\u2019re not planning that right now.", "Srini Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA Securities", "Okay. And maybe for Moshe, as you look out to 2011, where do you think you have an advantage versus your main competitor, whether it\u2019s in a process node at a region or end market or should we expect to pretty much grow in line with the PLD industry in 2011? Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, 2011 will be the design win, massive design win year for 28-nanometer. And that\u2019s a very big family and we\u2019re introducing it as quickly as we can across the entire product offering. And then there\u2019s a derivative product which Jon had mentioned, which is the one we announced several months ago, which is the embedded ARM solution which will enable significant design wins in new markets that we have not had the same level of penetration and that\u2019s the design win year. It translates into revenue in the following year and the year after that.", "So that\u2019s when the full impact of this great new product, which not only is it a market share changer but it actually is a market expander and enables us to win more business against ASICs and ASSPs, which we already have been winning. And that\u2019s when that new generation has the impact. So it\u2019s not 2011, it\u2019s as a result of the 28-nanometer moving into revenue as opposed to the major design win phase.", "Srini Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA Securities", "Thank you.", "Rick Muscha", "Operator, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Your final question will come from the line of David Wong of Wells Fargo.", "David Wong \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Thanks very much. You estimated that currently your 40-45 nanometer market share is about 40%. How rapidly are your 40-45 nanometer revenues ramping? And does that percentage go up going forward or does it settle out at the 40, 50% range even as the node matures?", "Jon Olson", "Well David, the growth rate has been very rapid. I think we said more than doubled from last quarter. And we really don\u2019t forecast market share. I was just trying to give a data point from -- since our competitor announced their actuals and made some comment about their number from a percentage perspective. We were just doing a Xilinx calculation on it and it came to that level.", "And so that\u2019s the best information we know. We certainly are planning on growth of revenues of that node over the next several quarters, but we aren\u2019t going to forecast specific numbers at this time.", "David Wong \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay. Great. Then I could try a different one. As you transition to different fabs at 40-45 nanometers and another set at 28-nanometers, do you expect an impact either positive or negative on your gross margin from different cost or yield assumptions?", "Jon Olson", "So certainly we go into any relationship with any foundry with a joint understanding of what the yield curve looks like and the rate with which our experience has typically demonstrated itself on previous generations. And we\u2019ve done the same thing in 28-nanometer. And it is true that this time working with TSMC, they have a tremendous scale. And I\u2019m certainly counting on benefiting from lots of companies running things through the same tools and will it end up having a positive impact?", "As Moshe said, it\u2019s a while before the revenue becomes significant enough but downstream, I think it very well could have some positive impact, but way too early to tell.", "David Wong \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Rick Muscha", "Thanks for joining us today. We have a playback of this call beginning at 5 PM Pacific Time, 8 PM Eastern Time today. For a copy of our earnings release, please visit our IR website. Our next earnings release date for the third quarter FY \u201811 will be Wednesday January 19th, after the market close.

My name is Kristen, and I will be your conference operator. I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rick Muscha. Thank you. You may begin your conference.", "Rick Muscha", "Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the December quarter, and then we'll open the call for questions.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially. We refer you to the documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website. ", "Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.", "Jon Olson", "Thank you, Rick. During today's commentary, I will review our December quarter business results. I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the March quarter.", "December quarter sales decreased 8% sequentially to $567 million, in line with the revised guidance we published on December 21. Turns business for the quarter was 44%, down from 48% in the prior quarter. Gross margin of 65.7% was slightly higher than guided, primarily due to proactive cost reduction efforts at the company as well as more favorable product and customer mix. This is up from 64.1% in the same quarter of the prior year and represents the fifth consecutive quarter of improvement.", "Operating expenses of $189 million were inclusive of $4 million in restructuring charges and were slightly lower than guided due primarily to lower variable expense associated with lower sales.", "Operating income was $184 million or 32.4% of sales in the December quarter. This is up from 26.6% in the same quarter of the prior year. This operating income performance represents a year-over-year increase of 34%, over 3x the rate of sales increase during the same period. This speaks to the aggressive cost reduction efforts and spending discipline undertaken by the company over the past year.", "New product sales decreased 10% sequentially in the December quarter to 43% of sales, driven primarily by Wireless Communications sales declines for Virtex-5. Sales from mainstream and base products both declined sequentially. Sales from all geographies declined sequentially during the quarter. European sales were down 22% sequentially, driven primarily by declines from Wireless Communications. But Wired Communications, audio/video broadcast and test and measurement were also weaker than expected.  ", "North American sales declined 7% due to declines in most end markets. Asia-Pacific sales were down 1% sequentially as Wireless sales decreases were partially offset by increases in Wired Communications and Industrial. Sales to Japan decreased 3% sequentially with increases from Communications, offset by Industrial and Consumer applications. ", "From an end market perspective, Communications sales decreased 14% sequentially, driven almost entirely by Wireless Communications. Industrial and other sales decreased 2% sequentially as increases in Defense sales were offset by decreases in test and measurement and Industrial/Scientific/Medical. Consumer and Automotive sales decreased 6% sequentially due to declines from Consumer and audio/video broadcast, while Automotive increased sequentially. Data Processing sales were down as expected during the quarter with declines coming from computer and Data Processing and Storage applications.", "Net income for the quarter was $152 million or $0.58 per diluted share. Other income and expense was a net expense of $3 million. This is better than the $9 million net expense that we had forecasted, primarily due to the settlement of a previously written off investment and other investment gains.", "Operating cash flow for December quarter was $333 million before $15 million in CapEx, the highest quarterly operating cash flow figure Xilinx has ever reported. As we discussed with you during the October earnings call, we temporarily extended credit terms to our primary distribution partner in exchange for a significant increase in technical selling resources designed to broaden the reach to customers worldwide. The impact to Xilinx was a significant increase in receivables in the September quarter, which negatively impacted our cash flow. As we begin to return to historic credit terms, we will begin to experience a positive impact to cash flow stemming from a reduction in receivables as we did in the December quarter. We now expect the fiscal year '11 operating cash flow to exceed $650 million.", "During the quarter, Xilinx repurchased 106,000 shares for $2.6 million. We also paid $41 million in cash dividends. The tax rate in the December quarter was 16%, lower than guided primarily due to the recent extension of the R&D tax credit.", "Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments were $2.4 billion, an increase of $314 million from the September quarter. We now have approximately $1.3 billion in outstanding convertible debt, and our net cash position is approximately $1.1 billion.", "Days sales outstanding decreased to 59 days from 82 days in the prior quarter. We expect days sales outstanding to continue to decline in the March quarter, consistent with the explanation on cash flow that I provided earlier. Combined inventory days in the December quarter were 130 days, up from 89 days in the prior quarter with nearly all of the build occurring at Xilinx as we have returned to full safety stock models. For the next several quarters, we expect to be outside of our 90- to 100-day inventory target. ", "While we did have higher inventory levels as a result of lower-than-expected revenue, there are two other factors that will drive our inventory days to be higher than model in the coming quarters. First, in order to assure supply on high-running products and advanced technologies, we have made the decision to increase safety stock levels on certain parts in the face of tight capacity at our foundry partners. Secondly, we are building ahead a number of legacy parts due to the closure of a particular foundry line. This will result in a buildup of inventory ahead of our end-of-life process with customers. The impact of the build ahead to the fiscal Q3 inventory ending value was approximately $29 million. This amount will increase over the next six quarters and then begin to decline as our end-of-life process with customers begins to offset the builds. As a result of these changes, we expect inventory to fluctuate between 120 and 130 days for the remainder of calendar year 2011.", "Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the March quarter of fiscal year '11. Our backlog heading into the quarter is down sequentially. Lead times have returned to normal. We are expecting to see particular strength from our Virtex-5 family. From an end market perspective, we're expecting sales from Communications to be up sequentially, driven by gains in Wireless. We are expecting Industrial and other sales to decrease, driven by declines in Defense, Industrial and test and measurement. Consumer and Automotive sales are expected to be up, driven by increases in Automotive and audio/video broadcast. And lastly, Data Processing sales are expected to increase. ", "As a result, we are expecting total sales to be flat to up 5% sequentially in the March quarter with sales in North America expected to be flat to slightly down, sales in Europe expected to increase and sales from Asia-Pacific and Japan expected to be down sequentially. The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of 54%, higher than last quarter but consistent with a normal lead time environment.", "Gross margin is expected to be 65%, plus or minus a point. Operating expenses in the September quarter are expected to be approximately $195 million, which includes $6 million in restructuring charges covering a range of costs associated with continued realignment of resources and driving overall efficiency. Other income and expense is expected to be an expense of approximately $9 million. The share count is expected to be 266 million shares. The tax rate for fiscal 2011 is expected to be approximately 21%.", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. Declining sales in the December quarter were primarily attributable to a large customer rescheduling in the Wireless Communications end market. While we did not achieve a fifth consecutive quarter of record sales, my conviction in the programmable imperative remains strong. Calendar 2010 marked a tremendous year of growth for Xilinx with sales increasing 36% over 2009. According to iSuppli, ASICs and ASSPs grew 7% and 25%, respectively, during this time period. This means that Xilinx grew more than triple the rate of ASICs and easily surpassed the ASSP growth rate as well. ", "Increasingly, FPGAs are becoming the default solution in next-generation customer systems where the need for low cost and flexibility are making FPGAs a preferred alternative to ASICs and ASSPs. Combined sales of our 40-nanometer Virtex-6 and 45-nanometer Spartan-6 product easily exceeded $100 million in accumulated sales in the December quarter, one quarter earlier than we had anticipated. Sales from our 40-nanometer, 11.3-gig Virtex-6 HXT devices increased significantly in the quarter. The customer traction we're gaining from this product family, coupled with having the industry's only 45-nanometer high-volume FPGA family with embedded transceivers are significant drivers of the leadership we have in transceiver shipments.", "During the December quarter, we made two key announcements, which are integral to our 28-nanometer strategy. We announced the industry's first stacked silicon interconnect technology, which will allow Xilinx to deliver breakthrough capacity, bandwidth and power savings using multiple FPGA die in a single package. We expect this innovative platform approach to enable Xilinx to overcome the technical boundaries of Moore's Law and to offer customers unparalleled power, bandwidth and density optimization for the large-scale integration of their systems. We also announced our Virtex-7 HT FPGAs and demonstrated 28 gigabit per second serial transceiver performance required for next-generation 100 to 400 gig applications. The 28 nanometer FPGAs enable communication equipment vendors to develop integrated, high-bandwidth proficient systems to keep pace with the insatiable bandwidth in the wide infrastructure and data centers. These new devices are equipped with the industry's high-speed and lowest [indiscernible] serial transceivers available in an FPGA to support extremely stringent optical and backplane protocols.", "As we begin 2011, the focus on a successful rollout of our 28-nanometer family is paramount. We are executing to plan and last month taped out the industries first 28-nanometer FPGA device. The 7 series FPGAs will offer the industry's lowest power, highest density devices in the market. This portfolio of 28-nanometer product is built in the industry's only unified architecture scales from low cost to ultra high end. This unified architecture allows customers to design their systems independent of FPGA family selection and reuse their IP across families, resulting in tremendous improvement in their productivity. We expect to augment our 28-nanometer leadership and expand the market for programmable logic with our ARM-based extensible processing architecture in 28-nanometer. I look forward to providing you with updates in the near future. ", "In summary, I'm excited about our next-generation product portfolio, and I remain confident that we have a product leadership position at the 28-nanometer node. Our 7 series FPGAs and ARM-based architecture provide game changing innovation and accelerate our market expansion. Having recently taped out 28-nanometer silicon, we remain on plan to deliver product samples in the March quarter. Look forward to providing you with an update on our 28-nanometer strategy through our annual Analyst Meeting, which is currently scheduled for March 14 in New York City. ", "Let me return the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Uche Orji with UBS.", "Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank", "So let me just ask you quickly. The $35 million that was lowered during the last quarter preannouncement, is that now fully incorporated in the March quarter guidance?", "Jon Olson", "So yes, I mean, we were -- from the midpoint of our original guidance to the actual numbers, it was more like $40 million, right? But sure, I mean, our next quarter's guidance is reflective of what we view next quarter to be at inclusive of a recovery of our Wireless business.", "Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank", "Just sort of quickly, I mean, I just want to understand how you think the competitive dynamics has changed in the industry since you rolled out your 40-nanometer products. And also part of that, if you can also talk about the recent comment about pushouts or delays in India, whether that had any impact on you and whether we've started to see that come back through either now or when we think that can come back in 2012.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "There's a series of questions there. So with regards to our competitive position, it is clear that we were later than our major competitor on 40-nanometer, and we also actually had been suffering from skipping a generation on the high-volume 65-nanometer. That's why we brought out both the 40 and 45, and at this point, the 45-nanometer has had unprecedented success. And so that should enable us over time to recoup the market share on the high-volume side. When you add that to the fact that we have the broadest product offering and we are committed to being out there as early as possible with that product offering at 28-nanometer, we expect to shift the market share back to where it has historically been. So combination of all of these elements, the 45 high volume, the 28 with its full breadth, and then that gets built upon with the ARM solution, which we are well on the way to implementation, we've already shared with the customers, that will enable Xilinx to regain market share.", "Jon Olson", "And in your Wireless question, we don't really have a great picture by sub-segment right now of the next year given our fiscal year's the end of March. But I've seen the same things about India and the concerns over the absorption of the kind of price that it would take for the average India cell phone user to absorb 3G, and there's some speculation about all that. But quite frankly, most of our shorter term demand, meaning the next quarter or two, is coming from very strong LTE shipments and expansion of U.S. networks as well as the European networks and then followed by continued growth in China. And I think one of the things that also adds on to the first part of your question is very apparent also in the Wireless segment is the penetration of PLDs into that segment continues to be more and more. So even if CapEx is down year-on-year, we could very well have flat to up revenue in this segment because of the penetration. And this is just validation of our technology overall. But specifically about India, we're really not counting on a, I would say, very large number in the coming quarters for India. The big wireless uptick is really around the LTE generation starting to take foothold and the expansion of the AT&T environment. Also, over the last couple weeks, we've seen that AT&T has started to change the names of things to 4G, and they're going to pull in their real 4G deployment by a year. So all those things are very positive for us.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Tim Luke with Barclays Capital.", "Timothy Luke - Barclays Capital", "You described how at the higher end of 40-nanometer you'd seen pressure, but you feel that you're seeing traction in high-volume 40-nanometer. And then you're suggesting that your 28-nanometer should help you. Do you think that your share will start to stabilize such that your revenue growth will be similar to your peers by the middle of your coming fiscal year? Or when should we think about you returning to sort of a more stabilized share position?", "Jon Olson", "I think we'll talk a little bit more about that in March. But I believe from a high-volume product family perspective that the kind of traction that we're seeing with our Spartan-6 45-nanometer product is that by the end of the calendar year, we should see stabilization of share in the high-volume segment and then an increase, starting to see an increase in share. The high-performance end of things is a little fuzzier because we're bifurcating the product family to some extent. And as Moshe pointed out, we were late to the party on 40-nanometer, so it may take a little longer for that to move the other direction. But the way we're coming out, the speed at which we're coming out with technology of 28-nanometer, we're pretty confident that that's going to start around in '12.", "Timothy Luke - Barclays Capital", "Also, just, Jon, could you give us some feel for how you think the year, the calendar year or the fiscal year is going to play in terms of which segments you think may grow and which may grow more? And whether you think, now that your lead times have normalized, et cetera, that you're going to see fairly traditional seasonality in the June quarter and onward?", "Jon Olson", "Well, I would expect that we'd start to return to overall more seasonal patterns just in general just because of that because we're at a level of business where still can be obviously still be volatility in certain end markets. But the economies are at least seemingly stable for now, and all that looks pretty good. We really aren't -- I'm not going to venture our forecast on which end markets are going to be better next fiscal year or not. We'll do that in March.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ruben Roy with Pacific Crest Securities.", "Ruben Roy - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.", "I'd like to follow up with you, Jon, on the commentary around the LTE. And if you look at kind of the near-term strengths that you're seeing in Con and Wireless related to European OEMs perhaps and then U.S. rollouts of LTE, would you say that, at least the initial designs and maybe through the end of the year, the design activity for LTE is behind us? And following on, when is the next real design win opportunity as it relates to perhaps next-generation LTE? And is that what you guys are talking about when you talk about 28-nanometer and potential market share gains at that node as you look out to maybe the middle of this year?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Yes, Ruben, yes. This is all kind of confusing to some extent if you start to equate LTE to 4G and 3G kinds of activities and then the providers changing their names of what their networks really are providing, et cetera. What's really happened here is then a consolidation of technologies on to FPGA so it handles all the protocols and waveforms in one line card. So while they may be selling into an HSDPA-plus kind of a network, it also can support LTE going forward. So most of the base stations that we sell into have some level of LTE capability so that providers don't have to replace everything all the time. That being said, at least from what I've read and certainly what we know, is most of the capabilities of the base stations are at the full range of what the LTE spec says. And what that means is that the bandwidth that they're providing under the name of LTE now will increase over time as they do improvements in terms of the base stations and et cetera. And those designs, I would say, would be kind of the next generation. Those designs need to be won in 2011, and those products will start rolling out in 2012 and 2013. And that's why we're pretty confident about our new 28-nanometer product family and having designed products specifically to win those designs.", "Operator", "And your next question is from Glen Yeung with Citi.", "Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc", "If we were to take out or that move from last quarter into this quarter, technically you're guiding for declines in the March quarter. And I looked back at your history. In 16 years, you've only had three March quarter where revenues declined. Can you give us a sense as to what you specifically think is going on in the first quarter? Is it your customers working down inventory? Is there something there that looks particularly weak?", "Jon Olson", "Well, I think we did note that even in the December quarter, there was weakness more than we had anticipated. But one of the phenomenon -- and we specifically said that in the audio/video broadcast area was a little bit weaker than we thought, for example, and we think that's bouncing back. And some of that, specifically on AVB, was inventory correction at the customers we serve. So there has been a broader based inventory balancing going on, which I think started in the September quarter and continued on in the December quarter in markets other than communications. Now with respect to the Wireless business and what's going on there, China, while it was still significant amount of business for us, but the fourth phase of the TD-SCDMA is now wrapping up. So from a geographic perspective, in Q1, there's actually some declines going on in that part of the Wireless business, while the other parts that we serve primarily through the larger European customer are growing extremely rapidly. So there's a lot of gives and takes going on. And while the overall demand is still really, really strong for us in the Wireless, we had this giant lump, a negative lump that we had in the December quarter.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "On the inventory side, even if I strip out the increase that you attribute to the legacy products and the shutdown of the line there, I'll have to look back until almost 2001 to see an inventory absolute dollar number that was this high as it is today. Well, so I guess my point is, what's your level of confidence in terms of the strategy of maintaining that high an inventory level going forward even if excluding the legacy products? And how do you make sure that that doesn't stay or really get out of control?", "Jon Olson", "Jimmy, that's a good question because we are taking a little more risk than we normally would have here. But I will also point out that we're operating at a much higher revenue level than we were back in that time period. So you do need the inventory in order to support that. But that being said, we've also gone through a couple of periods the last two to three years of not being able to deliver to our customers. And that's not lost on us in terms of a customer service level perspective. And then since we're taking this position that we feel that things still could be tight at foundries, we wanted to be cautious about how we adjust our capacity. So we've taken this position to add a little more inventory. But we are going to be very watchful of what's going on in the revenue line so we can manage this on a go-forward basis. We have no intention of getting ourselves out of line here in a big way. It is a kind of part by part we're managing this, and we have a monthly review meeting where we, in tremendous amount of detail, going through this to make decisions on which wafers we start out in time.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Patrick Newton with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Patrick Newton", "I wanted to dig a little bit into your product results. And if I heard you correctly, you said that Virtex-5 sales declined sequentially. I was wondering if you can discuss the magnitude of the decline, and perhaps your thoughts on the potential that Virtex-5 revenue has peaked as a family?", "Jon Olson", "Yes. So we did talk about new products being down about 10% and Virtex-5 is the largest revenue contributor of the company. So therefore, it would be the largest percentage of the new products. So you could look at that 10% decline and use that as a surrogate for the number you ask. I mean, it's not precise, but it's close. And the additional question?", "Patrick Newton", "Well, has it peaked?", "Jon Olson", "Oh, has it peaked? No, we don't believe it has peaked yet. Even though it went down this quarter because of the situation with the one Wireless customer, we don't believe it's peaked yet.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Just a question on the architectural differences. Timing seems to be -- so both you and Altera are on the same time for 28-nanometer. Just help us understand what are you guys targeting versus Altera, whether it's end market, and then what are the architectural differences that you have confidence and that will enable you to regain some market share on the 40-nanometer side?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, if you look at our product offering, we use -- there are a couple of key elements. First and foremost is we are targeting the HPL process at TSMC, which is a process that we co-developed with them and has since been adopted by several additional customers. Basically, that's a process that enables you to achieve very high performance at a lower power point. And as a result of having that, generally speaking, we can use a unified architecture to implement all of the three major product families. So it's the Virtex, Kintex and Artix. So it's the high end to mid-range and the low-end. That's unique. That will enable us to roll out products at a much faster rate than we ever have before. It will enable our customers to scale the designs, which is something they've asked for across the product families because they do need that very frequently. It will provide us with lower power points overall. And actually, having a lower power product will enable us to achieve at the high end a higher performance product because actually, it's the power capacity which is the big issue and we can achieve high capacity. So if you look at our product offering at the high end, it's actually significantly higher than everyone else, and one of the elements is the lower power process. The other element that enables us to do that is the stacked silicon interconnect, the SSIT, and that's another area that we're pioneering. So even though in terms of rollouts there's no doubt that generally, first availability of silicon is more or less equivalent to all of the companies that care to be at the front end, and we do care, it's the speed at which we'll be able to roll out the family, the breadth of the family and the transition between the different elements of the family which should be significant differentiators. The other element is we've been working on the ARM-based solution for a long period of time. We actually have emulation boards we provide our customers, and we believe that, that is a breakthrough product. Integration of the most popular microprocessor family in the world with the most powerful FPGA fabric will enable us to break into additional markets. So when you look at all of those elements, I'm extremely confident in our product position at 28.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie.", "Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research", "So other logic vendors in the market have been talking about accelerating their operating expense growth. I was wondering if you could share your view on calendar '11 or fiscal '12 OpEx trends for Xilinx. And then I was wondering if you could quantify also what your lead times are currently. You mentioned they were nine weeks roughly for September.", "Jon Olson", "Yes, so we're not forecasting our spending level for next fiscal year at this time. We'll do that in March. But we will have an increase because of the very rapid rollout of 28-nanometer, and those mass are quite expensive. So we will have an increase, and we'll share more about that in March. We are not planning, I would say, any large-scale headcount increases in the next fiscal year. So the dollars will be driven -- increase will be driven heavily by the mask and wafer increase and, to a much smaller degree, by any headcount and other kinds of spending at the company. And we'll be more specific about that in 60 days, or a little less than 60 days actually. On the lead time perspective, we have this metric that's the percentage of our product lines that are four weeks or less in terms of lead time, and the target we have is 85%. And in this current quarter that we're in, we're back into that milestone of being greater than 85% of our products are less than four weeks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Moshe, if you can just talk a little bit about your product with embedded processor. I know that you are ahead of your competitor in that area. If you could just talk about what significant applications you are targeting and what is additional market you can address and something on the timing of when does that becomes significant.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So this family was announced quite some time ago, and we haven't yet disclosed the details about the family members. But that program is being executed in parallel to the 28-nanometer mainstream, and it will definitely tape out this year. And we expect to provide samples to customers this year, too. It's a unique product in that it, for the first time, addresses the low and medium range of the market with a very powerful embedded microprocessor. And when you look at the embedded market, there is quite a few applications that are ideal for that. To mention just a few, if you look at Industrial, Scientific and Medical, if you look at Automotive, if you look at some elements on the Communications side, they actually are ideal for a product of this sort where the integration, the higher performance and the lower power are very important. So this is a breakthrough product. We have had embedded microprocessors in the past, but they were more targeted at the high end of the midrange and the high end of the market. This sort of goes to another place and should enable us to expand our footprint very significantly. We're having tremendously positive customer traction on this product. We have emulation platforms we've given to our customers so they can actually start developing software way ahead of the silicon availability. And it's probably one of the most exciting products to come out in the recent years in this logic space.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Sukhi Nagesh with Deutsche Bank.", "Sukhi Nagesh - Deutsche Bank AG", "Jon, can you just clarify a little bit on the inventory side again? Did you say that roughly $30 million of the buildup was due to the closure of the fab line, which should indicate roughly $40 million? The incremental $40 million was due to the higher node product, is that correct? Am I reading that right?", "Jon Olson", "So the $29 million that I talked about is part of our $240 million of inventory. So the amount of that ending balance for the quarter in that was $29 million of this build ahead, if you will. And that $29 million number is going to increase over the next several quarters as well, and we'll talk about how much as we go through because it's about a timing with the line closure and the amount that we have to build ahead in order to intersect with our customers' need. I didn't really try to reconcile every bit of the inventory growth number, of how much was associated with the revenue drop. The $40 million was the decline in revenue from the midpoint that we originally gave in guidance. So the midpoint of our original range versus our actual results was approximately $40 million.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Srini Pajjuri with CLS Securities.", "Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Jon, just wondering why the Turns business declined in the December quarter and why do you think it'll come back up in the March quarter. And also, one more on the gross margin side. Just wondering, you said that you achieved some cost savings in the quarter. Wondering how sustainable those cost savings are going forward.", "Jon Olson", "Yes, the first one on the Turns decline. Because the downward impact of our -- or the revenue decline was at a customer that we have on a hub situation where they did demand pull essentially when they need it. The turns for us, it's not that the POs are in our backlog, all right? So all that meant was is that the revenue got lower by this $40 million. That didn't show up as a turn. And therefore our turns -- it was anticipated to. And therefore, our turns percentage was lower. So it really wasn't much more than that. And that's kind of the same story going forward as we have higher turns. The reason we're confident is we have a tremendous amount of our -- a large portion of our revenue increase associated with customers that have this kind of vendor hub situation. And therefore, as it becomes a turn as they pull it, there isn't a PO in our backlog. And that's really what's kind of making this turns percentage kind of a more volatile number than we might have experienced under more stable times in our history. Relative to the gross margin cost savings, I've said this before, we have a variety of projects at the company that are always trying to contribute. There were a lot of defect density improvement, price stabilizations, et cetera. Most of our cost reduction efforts are sustainable over some time period, but it's also -- the mix of our customers and the prices, depending on which those customers are up or down, does have an impact as well. So if I ever look at the two things that have the biggest impact on our gross margin, it is typically our customers/end market mix and then whether we've been able to sustain a cost reduction through, for example, sustained defect density improvement, et cetera. In this case, I think we're able to sustain most of this cost improvement.", "Operator", "And your next question is from Chris Danely with J.P. Morgan.", "Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I guess can you just talk about your relative growth expectations for the four end markets you have for the rest of the year? And what gives you confidence that we're not going to have anymore, I guess, bugaboos in Con end market?", "Jon Olson", "Yes, so Chris, we're really not going to forecast long term our end market at this point. We'll do that in March. I think overall, we do feel good about the Communications business, but there's a lot of other end markets that we need to look up at a little bit harder. So yes, a lot of bogeymen and bad things are going to happen to us on a macro basis. But we react to what our customers are giving us as long-term forecasts. And even though there's been some volatility in some places like Network Enterprise business and things like that and then this big Wireless thing, at least for the next couple of quarters we don't feel like there's anything going on out there. Obviously, macroeconomic issues have an impact, but we're getting very strong signals from our top customers. And they're very strong signals not just about their confidence in being able to sustain revenue levels, but also there's signals that they're adopting FPGAs more and more. And we're winning more and more complex designs and supplanting other technologies. As Moshe pointed out, some of the percentages in his remarks about the design starts and design wins and growth in areas, that we're outpacing ASSPs and ASICs.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Sumit Dhanda with Citadel Securities.", "Sumit Dhanda - Citadel Securities, LLC", "First, the restructuring charge that you're taking, can you talk about the timing and the extent of the benefit that you will see based on those charges in future quarters?", "Jon Olson", "Sure. So the restructuring charge, all in for this last quarter of actuals in our forecast, is $10 million. And if you go back to the previous quarter's call, I think I indicated that we thought the total amount for the March quarter would decline over December, but it actually increased. And the biggest reason that it increased is that we are closing our software development operation in France. And I think many of you are aware how costly it is to extract yourself from a situation in that particular country, and the costs rose more than we had anticipated. So that isn't the only thing going on in the restructuring area, but we do expect a benefit in the neighborhood of $4 million, I guess, on an annual basis from that overall $10 million expense number. Now at this point in time, we don't anticipate any further restructuring charges in the following quarter. We don't have anything that we have. This is kind of the December and March quarters. The $10 million is it for our current plans.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.", "Brendan Furlong - Miller Tabak & Co., LLC", "A question on Wireline side, just sort of something different. Seems to be a lot of buzz out there about the build out of 40 and 100 gig in the optical space. And I'm just wondering how you think you're positioned or the potential opportunity for that over the next year to 18 months.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "That's an excellent observation. And there is this transition and it will happen. And the high end of the Virtex-7 product offering and the fact that it has the lowest power, the highest service, the highest bandwidth and it actually has the highest capacity in our mind puts us in a incredibly strong position to win the plurality of the business in that area. And the product was defined exactly to address the requirements and its own schedule. It will be rolling out this year, and we're in great position there.", "Operator", "And your next question is from Sandeep Shyamsukha with Auriga USA.", "Sandeep Shyamsukha - Auriga USA LLC", "Actually, my first question was regarding if you could give me more color on the Wireline side of the business, how it fared in the December quarter, how do you expect it to do in the March quarter and the inventory situation at your largest Wireline customer, if that's impacting your business there?", "Jon Olson", "So the Wireline business overall was pretty flat for us in the December quarter relative to September. And there were some adjustments going on in the network area. The telecom side was pretty flat to maybe slightly up. But generally, this kind of hit a flat spot with us. The uptake of enterprise, the network enterprise piece in terms of routers and data switches are still very strong for us. And I think you were probably alluding to the Cisco cautiousness that they've put out relative to their business, but at this point, we don't see a great deal of disruption in our business for, I would say, our core network business there. And we do think Q1 overall from an IT spending perspective, meaning Wireline, Cons, things that we sell into and, to some extent, Data Processing that we sell into still looks pretty good. And from a seasonal perspective, we still think IT spending overall is okay, which will contribute for Q1, meaning calendar Q1, the March quarter, and we should see good network business. So all their Data Processing segment.", "Operator", "Your next question is from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "John Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Jon, just a clarification. I think I heard you say that the $40 million miss in the December quarter from original guidance was all mostly due to one customer in Europe. When you look at the March quarter guidance, do you expect to recoup all of that within the March quarter?", "Jon Olson", "So John, all of the $40 million wasn't attributable to that. The largest individual contributor was that. But there was also some softness in China Wireless, and then I've pointed out audio/video broadcast was also softer than we had. So there were several contributors, but there was one large blip that made it such a large number for us. And I'm really not going to talk about specifics of our revenue forecast or any specific customer, but the forecast is quite strong for the Wireless business and we had forecasted up in Europe, and I think that's enough said about that particular area. So we're pretty bullish in that particular segment for the March quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.", "Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates", "The dynamics on the foundry side of things that you're seeing tightness, is that at most of the nodes that you buy? And is that with multiple foundries or just one foundry?", "Jon Olson", "I don't want to be a soothsayer for the foundry business too much in this particular comment. I'd like you to think about it as we got a little burned in not getting what we needed for our customers over the last couple of years. And so we're taking, I would say, a higher risk position on inventory to make sure that it doesn't happen again. And so there would be an uptick in the next year. But back to your point question, we are seeing full capacity in most technologies at most of our suppliers. And while you can still sit here and forecast and say, well, two quarters from now or three quarters from now the industry is not going to have that situation, we don't know that. And we've been surprised in the past, so we don't want to be surprised again.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ian Ing with Gleacher & Company.", "Ian Ing - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "But for Moshe, first, can you talk more about the silicon stacking applications? Do you have to go really on the higher density of multiple FPGAs or would you consider combinations with other silicon vendors, I mean, vendors perhaps?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, the current usage and what we've announced enables us to have the largest FPGAs in the market, and that's because FPGAs are inherently scalable. This is true that if you take this to the next level, you can do additional things. And that is not lost upon us, but you know that it's not -- we can go into a long discussion. This is a very compelling topic and everyone has opinions. But at the minimum, this enables us to bring FPGAs out, which are larger, it enables us to reduce the complexity. It actually should enable us to impact defect density at the very low FPGAs. Just with the technologies that we control directly, it gives us a lot of interesting opportunities. Integrating other semiconductor elements, there's a whole host of issues related to that. But this is the first step that enables going in that direction.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Adam Benjamin with Jefferies.", "Adam Benjamin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "I was just curious if we can just go back to the share discussion. You talked a little bit about the share stabilizing by the end of 2011. If you can clarify, are you talking in terms of share in revenue or in designs?", "Jon Olson", "So yes, so let me -- I think you asked about my specific response. I was talking about share stabilization by the end of 2011 in the high-volume category. And I was talking about revenue, not designs. So some of the share loss that we're experiencing now is because of the high-volume base product family. And we have the only game in town, quite frankly, at the 45-nanometer, and our design win rate has been quite significant. And we start shipping in more volumes. The primary competitors, older technology will have peaked, and we'll be growing . And therefore, the share loss should stop and then we should be gaining share back in 2012 in the high-volume category.", "Operator", "Your next question is a follow-up from Uche Orji with UBS.", "Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank", "Just to understand your optimism around this product, how do you -- you're probably the first company we have heard talk about this a bit more  aggressively. What gives you the confidence that this can be effectively manufactured?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, you're talking about the stacked silicon interconnect? Was that the question?", "Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank", "Yes.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "This is a technology we've developed for several years, and we've worked with the entire supply chain. Now we've prototyped it. We're moving into -- we have the plan to move into volume production. The technology risks are very well contained, and we're doing this in a phased approach. And we're highly confident that those risks can be addressed with the approaches we've taken, and we have the entire supply chain in place in order to address it. So this is obviously a big step forward. That's what leaders do. And we're very confident that we will deliver there and facilitate the higher capacity products that our customers yearn. That enables us to even more rapidly grab market share away from ASICs because one of the few areas that ASICs have an advantage is at the very high end because it is a denser technology. But this way, we can actually compensate for that, and that enables us to eat into that market at an accelerated rate. So very confident that we've done everything that needs to be done in order to move that into the volume arena.", "Jon Olson", "Operator, do we have time for one more question?", "Operator", "Yes, sir. You do have a follow-up from Sumit Dhanda with Citadel Securities.", "Sumit Dhanda - Citadel Securities, LLC", "Jon, the excess wafers you're running both at the leading-edge node and then for the end-of-life products, is there any benefit from small fixed cost absorption? I know you're a fabless operation. That's showing up in gross margins, which will be a headwind when you're done with the extra inventory build.", "Jon Olson", "Nothing significant. We've done a lot of cost reduction over the last couple of years and particularly in that area. And as this kind of a throughput goes through, it's a pretty diminishing amount of overhead impact from a fixed cost perspective. So no, there's not a significant benefit. And then kind of a snapback, that's really not a material number at all.", "Company Speaker", "Thanks for joining us today.

Gross and operating margins also reached record levels of 65.4% and 33.6% in fiscal 2011, up from 63.4% and 23.6%, respectively, in the prior fiscal year. Improvements in our profitability were a direct result of sales growth as well as continued focus on efficiencies and cost reduction by the company. ", "During the fiscal year, Xilinx generated over $720 million in operating cash flow, up from $554 million in the previous year. We repurchased $469 million in stock and paid shareholders $169 million in dividends during the year. In this recent quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend by $0.03 per share to $0.19 per share, continuing our commitment of returning shareholder value. This strategy is a clear competitive differentiator. ", "During the March quarter, Xilinx sales were $587.9 million, an increase of 4% sequentially, outpacing the competition in capturing PLD market share. Gross margin was 65.3%, slightly higher than guided, due primarily to better-than-anticipated yields on Virtex-6. ", "Operating margin was $181 million or 30.8% for the quarter and up 16% from the same quarter of the prior year. Operating expenses were $202.9 million, $8 million more than guided due primarily to higher-than-expected legal expenses associated with patent defense activities, acquisitions and contributions to support the disaster in Japan. ", "New Product sales increased 10% sequentially during the quarter led by Virtex-5 increases. Mainstream Products increased 1% sequentially, and Base Products declined 5% sequentially. ", "European sales were particularly strong during the March quarter, increasing 40% sequentially to represent 30% of total sales. With the exception of consumer, all secondary end markets increased sequentially with Wireless Communications posting the largest incremental gain. Asia-Pacific sales decreased 5% sequentially to 35% of the total sales due primarily to decreases from wired and Wireless Communications. North America sales decreased 8% sequentially to 27% of sales driven primarily by Communications, defense and test and measurement declines. Lastly, sales from Japan declined 7% sequentially to 8% of total sales primarily related to declines from Communications and Consumer. ", "With regards to the recent tragedy in Japan, we are very thankful that all of our employees are safe. From a business perspective, the impact was immaterial to the guidance we provided at the beginning of the March quarter. We believe that we have sufficient inventory in place to minimize near-term disruptions to the supply chain. In addition, we have qualified additional suppliers as necessary and we'll continue to carefully manage customer demand to help mitigate future disruption. ", "Let me now turn to a discussion of end markets. Communication sales increased 8% sequentially to represent 47% of total sales. Strong wireless sales during the quarter significantly outpaced a slight decline in Wired Communications sales. Industrial and other sales decreased 1% for the quarter to represent 32% of sales driven by defense and test and measurement while Industrial/Scientific/Medical  increased sequentially. Consumer and Automotive sales also declined 1% sequentially to 14% of total sales due to declines in Consumer that were nearly offset by sales increases from Automotive and audio/video broadcast. Lastly, Data Processing increased 12% sequentially to represent 7% of total sales driven by increases from both storage and computing and Data Processing. ", "Net income for the quarter was $160 million or $0.59 per diluted share. As a reminder, this amount included $6 million or $0.02 per diluted share impact for previously announced restructuring charges covering a variety of actions associated with continued realignment of resources and driving overall efficiency. Additionally, included in Q4 net income was an investment impairment of $5.9 million or approximately $0.02 per diluted share related to an equity investment. Other income and expense was a net expense of $6.5 million and lower than anticipated due to higher than expected interest income, a hedging gain and a realized capital gain from our investment portfolio. ", "Finally, tax expense was lower than expected primarily due to a change in the non-U.S. investment profile of the company. As our investment levels have increased outside the United States on a relative basis, the result is an overall lowering of the tax reported on our financial statements. The impact to EPS of the tax change for the full year of fiscal year '11 was reflected in Q4 net income and was approximately $0.10 per diluted share. The impact of this change will carry through to our fiscal year '12 tax rate estimate which will be stated later. ", "Operating cash flows for the March quarter was $245 million before $17 million in CapEx. We paid $42 million in cash dividends. The tax rate in the March quarter was 5.2%, lower than expected due to the previously mentioned decrease in tax expense. ", "Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased $268 million to $2.7 billion. We have approximately $1.3 billion in convertible debt and our net cash position is approximately $1.4 billion. Days sales outstanding decreased to 15 days in the March quarter to 44 days as expected. This is in line with our corporate target of 45 days and a result of the cessation of extended credit terms with our primary distributor. Combined inventory days in the March quarter were 133, up from 130 days in the prior quarter and slightly higher than anticipated. In the June quarter, we expect inventory days to be approximately 120 to 130 days. ", "Let me now turn to the discussion of guidance for the June quarter fiscal year '12. Our backlog heading into the quarter is slightly down. We are expecting to see continued strength from Virtex-5 as well as strong growth from our new Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families. From an end market perspective, we are expecting sales from Communications to be up driven by strength in Wireless Communications associated with LTE and phase 5 of China mobile deployments. ", "Industrial and other is expected to increase driven by Defense applications. Consumer and Automotive is expected to decline sequentially due to decreases from audio/video broadcast and consumer while Automotive sales increase. Lastly, Data Processing is expected to increase driven primarily by high-performance computing applications. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be flat to up 4% sequentially, with sales from Japan and APAC flat to down and sales from Europe and U.S. increasing. ", "The mid-point of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 56%. This is higher than the 53% in the March quarter, what we believe it is appropriately supported by forecast from our major customers. Gross margin is expected to be between 64% and 65%. The primary contributors to the slightly lower margins are product mix and higher costs associated with the ramp of the new products. ", "Operating expenses in the June quarter expected to be approximately $206 million, including approximately $2 million in amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Research and development will increase consistent with the 28-nanometer product rollout, and SG&A will be higher than historic levels primarily due to legal expenses associated with ongoing patent litigation. ", "We expect slightly elevated legal spending to continue but we do not believe that will have a significant impact on our full year spending estimates. Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $8 million. The share count is expected to be 274 million shares. The tax rate for fiscal 2012 is expected to be approximately 16%. ", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. Our 4% sequential increase in revenue in the March quarter caps an outstanding fiscal 2011 in which sales increased by 29% to $2.4 billion. According to iSuppli, ASICs and ASSPs grew 8% and 16%, respectively, during the 2010 period, which means Xilinx sales grew more than 3x the rates of the ASIC market, nearly twice the rate of the ASSP market. This type of growth clearly speaks to the programmable imperative that the need for lower-cost design, increased flexibility on making FPGAs a preferred alternative to ASICs and ASSPs. My only disappointment for the year is our decline in PLD market share. We've been working for multiple years on the plan to regain this market share with clear technology leadership and are executing to plan. ", "The March quarter, New Product sales drove our growth with a double-digit percentage increase. Combined sales for our 40-nanometer Virtex-6 and 45-nanometer Spartan-6 products for fiscal 2011 was approximately 50% higher than our initial plan. We continue to have the industry's only 45-nanometer high-volume FPGA family with embedded transceivers and we are gaining broad acceptance with this product family in all of our end markets. Additionally, sales from our 65-nanometer Virtex-5 family increased more than 20% sequentially presenting more in quarterly sales than any other PLD family in history. ", "We made 2 key product announcements in the March quarter to enhance our 28-nanometer leadership position. We announced the Zynq-7000 family, the industry's first Extensible Processing Platform, which tightly integrates complete ARM Cortex-A9 processor-based system with 28-nanometer, low-power programmable logic. With what we believe to be at least a full year lead over the competition in accelerated design win ramp, we expect to drive incremental market opportunities in areas such as video surveillance, automotive driver assistance, factory automation, audio/video broadcast. ", "On March 18, we also shipped the industry's first 28-nanometer product, the Kintex-7 K325T, mid-range FPGA. Kintex-7 FPGAs are designed to provide optimal price performance at the lowest power to meet requirements for key applications. We anticipate having a 20% performance towards competitive advantage coupled with at least a 9-month time to market advantage over our competition. ", "Already, we have won key designs in a variety of applications including video processing, optical networking, wireless communications and avionics. This family is winning against ASICs, ASSPs and the PLD competition. ", "In addition to delivering Kintex product to customers in the March quarter, we taped out our first Virtex-7 device. We expect to ship product samples to customers in the June quarter. We anticipate sampling members of our entire 7-series FPGA product family by the end of this calendar year. As stated, the rollout of our 28-nanometer family promises to be the fastest next-generation product rollout in our history. This is enabled by the unified architecture, which is shared across the 7-series. The unified architecture also benefits customers by enabling them to begin FPGA development using any product family for designs that may ultimately migrate to any other family. ", "Numerous designs are underway today in our 7-series FPGA product family, presenting hundreds of millions of dollars in design wins. 28-nanometer success would not have been achieved without the exemplary technology partnership and collaboration with TSMC. TSMC's HPL process is optimized for performance and power has provided us a significant time-to-market advantage. In addition, this collaboration has enabled us to extend our technology leadership by recently taping out the industry's first stacked silicon interconnect product. This innovation is game changing as it allows us to introduce a 2 million logic cell device on 28-nanometer, effectively, a full-process node ahead and representing a 2x density advantage over any competition. ", "Additionally, our stacked silicon interconnect technology enables a superior integration approach for the highest quality 28 gigabit per second transceivers unmatched by anything. Finally, this technology allows us to ramp complex parts faster with superior defect densities and associated cost advantages. ", "In summary, I'm very pleased with our financial performance and the successful production of our 7-series FPGA product family. Xilinx was the first PLD company to tape-out the 28-nanometer product, the first to deliver silicon to multiple customers and the first and only company to demonstrate working silicon at the recent NAB Conference and the Globalpress Summit. Our clear technology leadership of 28-nanometer and game changing product strategy will make fiscal 2012 an exciting year. ", "Let me now turn the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.", "Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc", "Thanks for taking my question. Jon, can you go to a little bit more detail about the backlog being down in the quarter, just if there is something specific that drove that or just normal course of business? And then given that your turn requirements are up slightly for the June quarter, what your sense is of visibility, was there something -- is there something there that's going on or is it again just something in the normal course of business?", "Jon Olson", "Sure, Glen. It's actually not that much of a dollar amount or percentage amount lower, it was just slightly lower so first let me just characterize it as actually kind of minor. But the thing that -- there's a couple of things that I can point to you. I mean, first, the Japan earthquake hit about, I guess that's the second week of March in that time frame. And during that time period there was a lot of confusion around supply and a lot of things written about BT resin and all those kinds of things that are important to us. And 1 of the things we decided to do was to not schedule orders for a time period of around 10 days. We accepted orders but we didn't really schedule them out. And that caused some disruption in terms of people not sure whether they could place orders and not orders and what the story was going on. So because it's such a really minor amount, when you look at the distribution of where end markets of where that backlog is, it's pretty typical to what we run. So there really isn't anything that really stands out in the whole process, and I would just say it's not that big of an issue. What's more important to us is our large customer forecast and the growth rate with which some of our larger customers are growing this next quarter and taking on products. So that's why we feel pretty confident that the growth is really there because again of our outsider top 20 customers in terms of their forecast to us of how good business is overall.", "Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc", "And then maybe the second question. In the quarter, you printed 47% of your business as being from Communications. When you think forward, I guess in 2 timeframes, 1 in the second half and then 1 next year, how do you think Communications looks as a percentage of your business?", "Jon Olson", "I think it still -- it maintains itself somewhere in the 45% to 50% range but 47%, plus or minus, 1 or 2 on either side, it jumped up because of a very strong wireless business. I think we are going into another solid year for wireless. And we do think we're making some gains in the wired side as well. So we're pretty bullish on -- overall on it. But again the industrial category's also growing very rapidly. It grew at a higher percentage full year on full year than even Communications did, that's still a very strong growth area for us.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Thanks for taking my question. How important is incumbency at a particular node to leadership by the next node. For instance, it's widely believed that your competitor has a larger share at 40-nanometer. What does that say in reality about your ability to regain that share at 28-nanometer?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So basically, incumbency has some value and better product earlier has more value.", "Jon Olson", "Yes, I think, Vivek, if you think about it at a Virtex-5 or 65-nanometer level, we have the -- a very, very high percentage of the business. And that's we're obviously seeing that strength in our numbers. And we had incumbencies. So how much does that matter when the competition came with their product earlier. So it really kind of depends on, as Moshe said, being first. But there is some value in incumbency just because of whose IP that might be used, et cetera, and those things are more sticky. So it's not to say there aren't sticky pockets but being there first, it seems to mean a lot more by actual example of history.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Got it. And just 1 other quick one, Jon or Moshe, either one. You described the strength in Communications. How do you think we should think about the overall year in terms of sales growth for you?", "Jon Olson", "Well we're not giving a full year top-line growth because, again, if you look at history, we're not very good at forecasting individual years but more on trends, which is why we gave a 5-year CAGR in our analyst day in the 8% to 12% range overall. Coming off a very, very strong year that we had in this industry, I don't think we're going to end up with anywhere near 29% again but we are pretty bullish on the penetration of programmable logic, and we certainly are planning on growth this year.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Moshe, a question on the 28-nanometer. Now that you have an offering in the mid-range, could you just help us understand what are the relative sizes of the 3 segments, high end, mid-end, as well as the low end? And does that change with 28? And I have a follow-up as well.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, generally speaking, what we're seeing is now if you break the overall FPGA market down into the traditional high end and high volume, it was 2/3 high end and 1/3 high volume. Now there are 2 things that are happening. First and foremost, there absolutely is tremendous growth where FPGAs are replacing ASICs, and that is happening at the high end of the market fastest. And so that's expanding the high end. In addition, as you move from generation to generation forward, there's just an expansion of the markets that can be addressed, which are more cost sensitive and they are higher volume based. If you look at all of that, finally, after several years, it has been demonstrated and hopefully everyone is a believer in the fact that the FPGA market is growing overall. It's not stuck at the $3 billion level. And the numbers prove that it's looking more like $5 billion and growing to a much larger potential serviceable market in the next few years. And as such, there is room to partition it into more categories. And I would say that there's in my mind, actually, 4 major categories: there's the very low end, low power; there's the low end; there's the mid-range; and then there's the high end. If you break it into those 4 categories, then we actually believe that the fastest growing market is in the mid-range. And that even though that's still isn't a large market, it's the market which is growing potentially fastest. And that's why we felt a need to target it earlier. If you look at breaking it down in terms of percentage points, then the very low end is probably 5% of the market. It's a small part of it. The low end is probably approaching 30%, the mid-range is 30% and the high end is 40%. And okay, that's more than 100% so you need to sort of round some of those down. I just realized my math is fluid here. Sorry, but I'm just the CEO.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "And then my -- that is helpful, Moshe. And then my follow-up is on the embedded segment. You guys are -- with your stacked approach and you're talking about design wins, what -- the embedded market is huge, what kind of revenue opportunity you are seeing and what kind of time frame should we think as we look out in '12 and when you will start to have some meaningful revenues?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay, so you're right. It's actually an enormous market of tens of billions of dollars. And we're focused on a sub-set of that market. And the parts, which potentially is in the billions of dollars in terms of serviceable market but it'll take more than 1 generation of product to address that, and this is a market where there's a need for a high-performance or a mid-range microprocessor, tightly knit in order to do streaming applications with an FPGA fabric. The part is on schedule. We expect to tape it out this year, to deliver samples to customers this year and for it to move into production in the second half of 2012 most likely, and then the revenue will start happening in 2013 and 2014. We already do have customers who are designing for this product. And we have an emulation platform, which actually has several key customers who are doing designs because they need to develop software on this product ahead of availability of silicon. And so we expect the ramp up to be significant in calendar 2013. Anything before that is unlikely to be something you guys would worry about.", "Jon Olson", "Yes, we definitely will have revenue in calendar '12. But as Moshe says, it's not going to be -- it's not going to show up in a way and just say, \"Oh, the game changer is realizing itself.\" But it's coming and the design wins are pretty solid even early on.", "Operator", "Our next question is from James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Thanks for taking my questions. Just with respect to the guidance if I got it right, I think you were guiding all of your end markets to be up except for the Consumer Automotive market. So you can help me square that with the guidance of flat to up 4% and why it may not be a little bit more than that? Is it just conservatism or something else?", "Jon Olson", "Well, I mean I realize that all this end markets -- if all of them grew 0% to 4%, I guess, they would -- proportionately, that will be the case that they'll all be up. So we are -- we do believe that there's a -- for example, let's take defense, which is part of our Industrial category, there is generally a low point for us and then we bounce back with individual designs. So that may or may not be up even a slightly higher than an average. And we do think Wireless will be up at the high end of that range, and everything else is, I think, is pretty much in the mid-to-lower end of that range.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay, fair enough. That's very helpful. And then with respect to what wireline telecom and networking did in the quarter, you didn't mention that, did that decline in the quarter? And what do you expect for that in the upcoming quarter, please?", "Jon Olson", "Yes, it was somewhere in my conversation. It did decline very slightly, wireline, and which for us is wire plus networking together, is that it was down just a little bit. And we do expect that to increase in the next quarter.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Great. And just one follow-up, are you seeing any kind of spending priority changes from either the carriers or enterprise in terms of more of a shift towards wireline going forward?", "Jon Olson", "No, I don't think so. I mean, we're seeing positive trends, very positive trends in wireless and reasonably positive trends in our network and wired business. I'm not sure I understand your question, maybe I'm not...", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I guess -- I'm sorry, I guess I should have been clear. What I meant is wireless has been strong for a very, very long time while wireline has lagged a little bit. So I'm wondering if you think carriers or other people are going to sort of shift back that spending priority for backhaul or other applications going forward?", "Jon Olson", "I see. Yes, I mean I think there's also -- there's always also competitive things going on amongst our customers since we do serve everybody. So sometimes it's a little hard to ferret out what is who's taking a share and in what proportion. But I do think we feel like the backhaul business generally has been strong. And for the most part, we've seen IT spending being pretty robust overall, and that's helping drive switches as well as some other -- some carrier backhaul improvement.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Shawn Webster with Macquarie.", "Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research", "On the inventory side, it popped up a bit. In the March quarter, you expect it to come down. What is the optimal split going forward would you say between the inventory held on at Xilinx as well as your channel? And then I have a quick follow-up.", "Jon Olson", "Yes. So the inventory is up. And we do expect it to come down, and we want to manage it down. Just to remind everyone that we are building up inventory because of a foundry line that is being closed on an older product family that we have announced end-of-life buying request to our customers. And later on this year, those forecast will be solidified and we'll start to ship some of that product out. So we are every quarter building up for some build ahead for older products that will become end-of-life. But even taking that off, off the table, our base inventory has grown, maybe a little more than we'd like because of things like what happened in Japan and our concern about certain supply chain we've allowed to flutter up. But again, I really want to make sure that we manage that down in the coming quarters. With respect to the balance between distribution and what Xilinx owns, we're pretty good in this low 20 days or less kind of a number that distribution has. We've been able to service through our -- customers through our distribution partner without having them hold excessive amounts of inventory. And we've been doing a pretty good job of that. So we think it's pretty -- keeping them lean is just fine, and they seem to be very pleased with the customer service level.", "Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then sticking with the inventory thread, can you give us some color on channel and OEM inventories from your standpoint? Are there any end markets or application areas that look particularly lean or have probably a little bit too much right now? And then on SG&A, since you're sticking with your full year guidance, should we expect that to come down in the next several quarters? Thank you.", "Jon Olson", "So from a channel perspective, a lot of our big customers are now through VMI arrangement of various types. So we're getting -- from our view from them, we're getting very direct pulls when they're building products. And our sense is that nobody is warehousing. Of note, certainly, the communication side is warehousing lots of product either at a component level or their end level. In other words, their demands seem to be pretty good because their pulls seem to be quite regular and that's really a good way of managing or viewing those kinds of things. In terms of any end markets where we see things are lean, I don't think so. I think the whole, I'll say the bounce back and the recovery from the last 8 quarters or whatever, I think things are back to more normal. I'd characterize it more normal in terms of flow and inventory. And then on SG&A, ER SG&A will be up. It will start to trend down. Hopefully, we'll get through some of these issues around our defense of patent trolls and things like that which are causing a little bit of the gap. From a profile perspective, it's popping up and it should gradually come back down throughout the year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Tim Luke with Barclays Capital.", "Timothy Luke - Barclays Capital", "Thanks so much. I was wondering, Moshe or Jon, if you could give some sense about given that you've seen growth in March and you see growth again in June, how are you guys feeling about the year? Do you think that you're returning to an environment where you may be able to see some steady sequential growth? Or what are the broadest puts and takes on that overall?", "Jon Olson", "Yes, let me take a round at that. So I do believe we will grow this next year. So we do believe that not just the strength of existing traditional FPGA designs but the fact that we are penetrating ASIC and ASSP at a more rapid rate, we're getting a lot of very positive signs out there from our customers. And the fact that we grew in the March quarter and it grew and we're forecasting we'll grow again in the June quarter and the relative strength of our backlog and large customer signals, we're feeling pretty good over all about growth and hopefully not sitting at some new plateau or whatever as we sat there for $1.8 billion for a number of years. It feels good. It feels very solid pending any macroeconomic whatever that goes on.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, and it's sort of driven by the fact that regardless of macroeconomic trends and you can factor them in however you want, we are -- by moving forward to more advanced technologies, we're servicing larger markets. And that's sort of by far the biggest trend which is driving our business. Today, you can do with FPGAs amazing things in the whole host of applications, and that is by far the biggest secular driver. When you sort of build that on top of the macroeconomic trends then you can appreciate that sometimes it can be muted but generally, as long as we can continue to move forward, we can address more markets than we ever have before. ASICs are less viable, ASSPs continue to be very viable but due to the expense of the design, they're only valid for high-volume applications. And that's generally the picture as we see it. And with 28-nanometer, which is going to be deployed broadly this year and next, you can basically do away with anything up to and including the 90-nanometer node in alternatives. You can design it very effectively than FPGA, that's sort of the growing market.", "Timothy Luke - Barclays Capital", "With respect to that, you have said in the past that you thought your share overall for growth may begin to stabilize as you go into the second half of the calendar year. Is that still the case? And obviously, last night, the compactor [ph] was inferring that you're strong in the mid-range in 28, but did they sustain leadership in the high and low end? If you could give some color as to why that may or may not be the case. And possibly all say kind of what does the stacked silicon thing really do for you, that will be very helpful. That's it.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. First and foremost, the 40- and 45-nanometer, even though they have grown quicker than we had expected, they're not yet significant. And where we have in the past lost market share is in the low end, and the 45-nanometer Spartan-6 is in our mind the ultimate solution for turning that around. That will likely start to be visible in the second half of the year. Overall, we had the issue on 40-nanometer where we came out late vis-\u00e0-vis the competition in the high end. Between the Kintex and the Virtex, both being -- earlier with the Kintex and actually having a superior product offering, which on the Virtex side, we believe that when that moves into production, which that starts in 2013 -- sorry, 2012, when that moves into production and there's a delay until it's significant, that sort of will enable the market share to change. If you look at other elements and think it's something that we believe we a huge time advantage over any competition, something we've been working on for several years, and we expect that to again, given the previous question start being significant in terms of revenue in the 2013 timeframe. So those are the 3 elements: Spartan-6, second half of this year; the 28-nanometer starts being significant in terms of revenues; and it moves into production in 2012 and become significant revenue in 2013.", "Jon Olson", "I think, one other comment on that, you made this comment, and Moshe made a comment earlier about how the mid-range is expanding at a much more rapid rate and part of is what he talked about in his remarks about the ability of the HPL process to scale power and performance in a way that really broadens that in a different way than the mid-range has ever been talked about in the past. So it's not even -- I don't think it's even valid to compare it to the previous mid-range. It's actually a different class of product in a lot of different ways. And that, I think -- we've been trying to explain this by the mounting design wins we received already on this product and this is really going to be a pretty significant driver of revenue for this company.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities.", "Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Thank you. Jon, just a clarification on the OpEx. Given the increase in the first quarter and also in Q4, did you say that you still expect to reach your target that you gave us at the analyst day, I believe that was 14% growth year-on-year?", "Jon Olson", "Yes, overall, I gave a range and I'm not going to say where I'm going to be in that range in total but we still believe we'll be in the range for the year. And the biggest -- R&D profile is pretty much as we -- as the underlying numbers that supported that range for R&D. SG&A is taking off at a much higher rate than I anticipated because of some of these pseudo-onetime things going on. I would say pseudo onetime because we have few quarters of elevated legal expense. But we do think we're going to be able to with other efficiencies in the company to have the SG&A come back down on a quarterly run rate and still stay within that range.", "Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Okay, great. And then on the Wireless segment. Obviously, you're seeing pretty solid strength there. I'm just wondering what kind of visibility do you have into the next few quarters to see if this trend is going to continue. It looks like the strength is coming from the Western markets. And you also mentioned that China, something about China phase 5, I'm just wondering how big that opportunity is versus what we saw in phase 4? Thank you.", "Jon Olson", "The phase 5 thing, I really don't have good information on how big it is. It is -- it will be somewhat significant, I think. And I think that's positive, and we're getting some signs that, that is beginning this quarter, which is the current quarter we're coming into, we're in right now. And that's why we mentioned it. It is true that the U.S. market as well as India is driving, but primarily the U.S. market is driving a big upswing for us. We feel pretty good about the first half of the year in terms of visibility. The second half of the year, visibility isn't nearly as good. And we're working very closely with our customers to make sure we have the right product for them. So I would say, there's pretty good visibility in the first half and we still got away to see a little bit for the second half.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Christopher Danely with JPMorgan Chase.", "Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Thanks, guys. I guess just a quick follow-up on the OpEx/model. So you're sticking to your SG&A and R&D targets for this year. Does that imply that R&D could be down on an absolute basis for next year as well as SG&A? And then also if you could comment on the trajectory of gross margins, they've been down the last couple of quarters. It looks like we're at the lower end of the range. Do you expect that to hold for the rest of the year?", "Jon Olson", "On OpEx Chris, the diagram I was showing at the analyst day implied that overall, R&D would go down in our fiscal '13 on the basis of a lower mass cost, not that our base in the number of employees and that spending would necessarily go down. That probably still trends up a little bit. But because of the very large increase in mass cost in this fiscal year, because of so many tape-outs that we're able to do so rapidly, that was driving it. And there's nothing changed from what we said in the analyst day on that at this point in time. So I still feel that way. SG&A, I didn't really make any comments about fiscal year '13, and so typically SG&A for us has been relatively stable, a very slight upward trend. I wouldn't expect it to be that much different on a go-forward basis. Gross margin -- yes, gross margin for this next quarter is trending a little bit lower. There are definitely costs associated with the fact that we're starting up new products and we have a large inventory balance that we've built up and does have cost decline impacts to it. Again, we still think we'll be in the range for the full year. So with whatever, will we trend to the bottom end of that range? I'm sure as heck going to try to make that not happen. And we'll see how the second half turns out. We got a lot of energy around here to keep our margin up, and we're working very hard to do that.", "Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Great. And as my follow-up, I guess, could you guys just sort of give us your take on how much of a lead do you think you have at 28 versus the competition? And then maybe give us a synopsis of what the rollout schedule has been, you versus them, so far, and then what you expect the rollout schedule competitively to be, you versus them, for the rest of the year?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So, we have limited visibility into their actual plans or no visibility into their actual plans. But the best we can tell based on feedback we get from our customers is we're 9 months ahead on the Kintex side, neck-on-neck on the Virtex side and we've taped that one out. So yes, they taped out the first version ahead of us but we are just around the corner on that. We expect to have the Artix, which is the higher volume, lower cost, low power version, ahead of them. And we believe that we are likely to be a year ahead on the Zynq front, which has the embedded core. One of the reasons that you're seeing this huge investment in masked sets is once you have the time advantage, you really want to exploit it. And that's why we're driving forward aggressively to exploit that position.", "Jon Olson", "I think, there's another thing to look at, Chris, is the maturity of the software. And we have -- all of our product families instantiated in our software for some time now. And I actually don't know today what the status for our competition is but for the longest time, they only had their Stratix, they didn't have the rest of their product families available. I don't really know what the status of that is today. So I think we have a bit of a softer lead. But the second thing that's even more important is this unified architecture. This allows people and this is what our customers have been asking us is how do you implement something in your software and be able to scale it to different devices as we change our mind. And because we have -- what device we need to have is the ultimate production device and because we have all our devices defined in the software, it allows those customers to with confident pick our product family and know that they're going to be supported. And that is something that I believe is unparalleled out there than anybody in any of the competition. So I think that is an additional first mover advantage in addition to what Moshe had talked about.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.", "John Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Thanks for letting me ask a question. Jon, maybe another way to ask the sustainability on the Wireless business question. Can you help me understand how much of your business today in Wireless you think is 3G versus LTE deployment? And what happens to kind of your revenue opportunity as you mix from 3G to LTE and maybe differentiate between developed markets and developing markets there?", "Jon Olson", "Actually, I don't think I have all that data available. I mean our content is certainly more at LTE than it is in 3G, and we've talked about that being kind of 1.5 multiplier in terms of content for us meaning the LTE is higher. It's actually because our customers in some cases don't actually tell us with the 3G and LTE sometime because they have system level products, they can do either depending on how they populate it is actually somewhat difficult. But I do believe that of the growth rate of the last couple of quarters for us, a greater than 50% has been driven by the LTE North America aspect. And that's kind of a combination of that business getting stronger and the China phase 4 ending, which is clearly a 3G capability. I think that's about the best I can do on that in the absence of doing a whole lot more data mining.", "John Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Jon, just to be clear, you said 50% of the growth you think over the last few quarters was LTE-developed?", "Jon Olson", "In our Wireless sub-segment I believe is LTE meaning North America deployments for Verizon and AT&T. They call some of these things 4G and they're using LTE. I'm not going -- whether it's 3.5G or 4G, I don't want to get into all that. But I believe it's the LTE platforms that they're -- from our customers that they're using.", "John Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "As my follow-up, Moshe, you talked about the 28-nanometer, the opportunity for this to kind of be the fastest node ramp in company history. Can you help me understand when we should start to think about maybe the $100 million in revenue milestone? And when you think about this as being the fast potential ramp, is this because you do fundamentally believe at 28, the ASIC, ASSP replacement storage starts to accelerate?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So I absolutely am convinced that it starts to accelerate. We're hearing our customers are doing less and less ASICs.  That's a trend that started several generations ago. By now the ASICs are really few and far between. At 28-nanometer you can obviate the need for ASICs except for ultra high-volume applications, and there are very few of those. You're seeing less customers start those. If you look at what is happening, this is sort of traditionally been a trend in FPGA. If you think about the FPGAs 15 years ago, they used to be used predominantly for glue logic on the board. And if you looked at the board at that time, there was a big set of SRAMs on them from very good companies who were SRAM companies. Today, that businesses does not exist. Guess where those SRAMs are. It's not standard products. They've been swallowed by FPGAs. After that, the same thing happened with DSP capabilities, with embedded controllers and with transceivers. So we are grabbing a larger portion of the silicon real estate. With this new generation, we can continue to move forward. And to some extent, if you look at the 28-gigahertz transceivers, which we have announced and we've demonstrated already, those are almost impossible to find in anything except the most advanced ASICs. But because you can't afford to do the most advanced ASICs, my belief is that, that will accelerate the transition and will consume the ASIC space even faster. Now with regards to when we expect the 28-nanometer to reach $100 million, if you look at the prediction we gave for the 40- and 45-nanometer, we gave a certain prediction, we actually hit the $100 million accumulated on that 1 quarter ahead, and I think that was -- originally, it was 5 quarters from the introduction and it happened 4 quarters from the introduction. Here, I think, it could happen faster than that by an additional quarter and that sort of accelerates from that point on.", "Operator", "Final question will come from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo.", "David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Thank you very much. So when you gave your guidance, your June guidance, does that assume any demand suppression in Japan that might rebound at some later point?", "Jon Olson", "No. There are certainly issues with the Japanese customers meaning they're not all online and in production. But I don't think this is a situation when there's going to be some sort of pent-up demand that's all of a sudden going to get released in Japan. We're -- forecast from I would say our normal run rate are off single-digit million kind of a dollar number, not that significant, quite frankly.", "David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Right. Thanks. And on the 28-nanometer, you have several product lines. Do you expect roughly the same gross margin for each of them? And how do cost of 28-nanometers compare to your prior generations given that you are using a different foundry?", "Jon Olson", "We do expect gross margins to still, in the aggregate, still be in our business model. I don't see there's anything different about that. And our experience with the new foundry is low at this point in time, but what we've seen is quite positive and yields coming through quite well. We are expecting kind of a relative basis to the previous generation, some improvements in yields and the overall cost structure.", "Rick Muscha", "Well, thanks for joining us today.

My name is David, and I will be your conference operator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx First Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.", "Rick Muscha", "Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We'll provide a financial and business review of the June quarter, and then we'll open the call for questions.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially.", "We refer you to the documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It could be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website. ", "Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.", "Jon Olson", "Thank you, Rick. During today's commentary, I will review our June quarter results. I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the September quarter. ", "The Xilinx sales were $615.5 million in the June quarter, an increase of 5% sequentially. Sales were slightly better than guided due primarily to better than expected strength from Wired Communication, Industrial, Scientific and Medical and Data Processing applications. Wireless business on the other hand was weaker than anticipated due to non-PLD component constraints at a large customer following the Japan earthquake. Essentially, these constraints resulted in a push out of our PLD business to the September quarter. Offsetting the impact of the wireless push out were pull-ins from a few communications customers. ", "Gross margin was 63.7%, slightly lower than guided due primarily to product mix, which was impacted by stronger than expected growth from our Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families concurrent with declines from our Base and Mainstream Product families. ", "Operating expenses were $204 million, $2 million less than guided due to lower than expected acquisition expense and lower share-based expense. Operating margin was $188 million or 30.6% for the quarter. ", "New product sales increased 17% sequentially during the quarter, led by Virtex-6, Spartan-6 and Virtex-5 increases. Mainstream Products decreased 6% sequentially, and Base Products declined 5% sequentially. ", "Sales from all geographies about Europe increased sequentially. North America sales, which represented 30% of total sales, increased 14% sequentially driven by strength from communications and defense applications. Asia-Pacific sales represented 35% of total sales and increased 6% sequentially due primarily to increased sales to communications and industrial customers. Japan sales increased 18% sequentially, representing 9% of total sales with strength driven by industrial and test and measurement applications. European sales decreased 8% sequentially due primarily to declines from Wireless Communications, which I mentioned previously. ", "Let me now turn to a discussion of end markets. With the exception of Wireless Communications and audio/video broadcast, all secondary end markets increased sequentially. Communications sales increased 1% sequentially to represent 45% of total sales. Strong wired sales during the quarter outpaced the decline in Wireless Communications sales. Strength in wired was driven by metro, access and enterprise networking applications. ", "Industrial and Other sales increased 11% sequentially to represent 34% of total sales with all secondary end markets increasing. Consumer Automotive sales were flat sequentially at 14% of sales with strengths from Automotive applications, offsetting declines from audio/video broadcast applications. Lastly, Data Processing sales increased 15% sequentially to represent 7% of total sales driven by increases from both storage and computing and Data Processing sales.", "Net income for the quarter was $154 million or $0.56 per diluted share. Other income and expense was a net expense of $7.8 million, in line with expectations. ", "Operating cash flow for the June quarter was $238 million before $14 million in capital expense. We paid $50 million in cash dividends and repurchased 1.9 million shares of stock for $65.7 million. The tax rate in the June quarter was 15%. ", "Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased $180 million to $2.9 billion. We have approximately $1.3 billion in convertible debt, and our net cash position is approximately $1.6 billion. ", "Days sales outstanding decreased 8 days in the June quarter to 36 days due to higher cash collections in the last week of the quarter. Combined inventory days in the September quarter were 117 days, down from 133 days in the prior quarter. From a days of inventory perspective, we have returned to our approximate target range inclusive of the build ahead associated with the closure of a legacy fab line. ", "Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the September quarter fiscal year '12. Our backlog heading into the quarter is slightly up. We are expecting to see exceptional strength from our Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families. From an end market perspective, we are expecting sales from communications to be flat to up with strengths from Wireless Communications associated the with LTE and India deployments, offset by declines from Wired Communications. ", "Industrial and Other is expected to decrease due primarily to test and measurement and Industrial, Scientific and Medical declines. Consumer and Automotive sales are expected to be flat sequentially. Lastly, coming off a very strong June quarter, Data Processing sales are expected to decrease sequentially. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be up 1% to down 3% sequentially with sales from Europe expected to increase, sales from Asia-Pacific expected to decrease and sales from North America and Japan expected to be approximately flat. ", "The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of 55%. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 63%. The primary contributor to the lower margin is the faster than anticipated ramp of Virtex-6 and Spartan-6. Sales for both products are currently ramping ahead of their predecessors at the same point of the product life cycle. We expect yields to improve measurably on these products over the next several quarters but to be offset somewhat by the aggressive introduction of our 7 series products. The net result is that we expect to be back to the low end of our corporate model of 64% to 66% by the December quarter. We remain committed to this model and anticipate gradual improvement over time as we drive yield improvements in these product lines. ", "Operating expenses in the September quarter are expected to be approximately $218 million with almost all of the increase occurring in research and development. The R&D increase will be primarily related to high mask and wafer costs associated with our 28-nanometer roll out. Inclusive in the increase is approximately $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and approximately $6 million of expense related to a recent workforce reduction that impacted the satellite office.", "We continue to be comfortable with the OpEx spending range we provided at our Analyst Meeting in March. Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $7 million. The share count is expected to be 278 million shares. The tax rate for fiscal 2012 is expected to be approximately 14%. This is lower than the previous year estimate of 16% and driven by a forecasted change in the mix of geographic profit. ", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. Our 5% increase in revenue in the June quarter was driven by the fact that 7 of our secondary end market segments grew sequentially by double digits. This very broad-based end market strength resulted in revenue growth that exceeded the high end of our revenue guidance and speaks to the continued displacement of ASICs and ASSPs by PLD. ", "In the June quarter, new product sales drove our growth with a 17% increase. A portion of this is attributable to our 65-nanometer Virtex-5 family to increase 15% during the quarter. This is driven by applications in wired and wireless communications, image processing and storage. This family remains the industry's largest FPGA family, in terms of quarterly sales with ongoing design win momentum well beyond initial projection. Notwithstanding the unparalleled success of Virtex-5 in the market, it's worth -- it is worth noting that cumulative sales of Virtex-6 actually surpassed the cumulative sales of the Virtex-5 family the same point in its life cycle. I'm very pleased this combined sales for our 40-nanometer Virtex-6, 45-nanometer Spartan-6 products grew by more than 40% and now represent nearly 10% of total company revenue. We expect these families to experience significant growth in the September quarter as well based on customer forecasts. We continue to see strong design win momentum in our 40, 45-nanometer family. ", "Virtex-6 family provides our customers with significantly lower power, lower costs and up to 12 gigabit per second transceivers. Spartan-6 family continues to be the only 40 and 45-nanometer low cost offering from major FPGA vendor enabling 40% lower power, 10% performance advantages with up to 3 gigabit per second integrated transceivers in a low cost device. ", "Our 28-nanometer product family roll out continues at an accelerated pace. Last month, we sampled the first device from our Virtex-7 product family. Coupled with Kintex-7, which was the industry's first 28-nanometer product which we sampled in the first calendar quarter of the year, we have now sampled members from 2 of our 428-nanometer product families and in addition, taped out the core technologies for a stacked silicon interconnect based offering. ", "We are also the first to deliver full year release 28-nanometer design software supporting all families. To enhance the design process, we recently released our ISE Design Suite 13.2 which provides increased design of productivity, proved quality of result for our 28-nanometer 7 series families, including the Virtex-7 2000T device, the industry's largest density FPGA both using stacked silicon interconnect technology. We are confident that by early 2012, we will be sampling members from our entire 28-nanometer family. The roll out of our 28-nanometer family continues to be the fastest next-generation product roll-out in our history. We are exceptionally pleased with the design win activity of our 28-nanometer family, which significantly exceeds previous generations at the same point of product introduction and currently represents several hundreds of millions of dollars. ", "Based on our leading customers' feedback I'm convinced that our 28-nanometer strategy most effectively addresses the 3 industry mandates: Scalability, optimization and integration. Scalability is enabled through our unified architecture which allows customers to gain their designs independent of FPGA family selection, reuse IP across the family. ", "A key element of optimization is enabled by our world-class technology partnership with TSMC, now proven with actual silicon that the usage of the TSMC HPL process delivers superior performance with the industry's lower power. Further, 7 series optimization is provided with industry-leading connectivity, DSP memory solutions, each of which is tailored for the unique needs of different end markets. ", "Finally, we've developed 3 leadership technologies for systems integration. First of these is the Zynq-7000 family. It's the first industry's extensible processing platform that integrates an ARM Cortex A9 processor-based system with a 28-nanometer low-power programmable logic. ", "With the Altix family, we offer high-volume customers superior performance and lower power with a significant bill of material cost savings through the integration of programmable mixed-signal function. Lastly, with our stacked silicon interconnect technology have a superior strategy for integrating multiple dye for 2x total capacity and bandwidth relative to all alternatives in the market. ", "I'm confident that Xilinx has clear technology leadership at the 28-nanometer node is the only venture currently addressing all 3 of the industry mandates; scalability, optimization and integration. We expect our innovative and differentiated product offering coupled with time to market leadership will enable us to accelerate our ASIC and ASSP share gains to gain future PLD share as well. The combination of the continued Virtex-5 design win strength beyond our initial projections, the rapidly accelerating 40, 45-nanometer momentum and now the fastest design win ramp in the history of the company with 7 series gives me tremendous confidence in the depth and breadth of our customer base and product portfolio.", "Let me now turn the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Christopher Danely of JPMorgan.", "Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "You talked about gross margins bouncing back in the December quarter. Can you give us any sense of what we should think about OpEx in the December quarter and beyond? And then what, if anything, should we be thinking of normal seasonality for the December quarter?", "Jon Olson", "Yes, Chris. We are -- from an OpEx perspective, we're still sticking to the ranges -- full year ranges that we gave at the Analyst Day. The R&D number was $460 million to $475 million, and SG&A was $365 million to $375 million. Or it's probably attending towards the high end of those ranges. And so the -- it's hard for me to tie -- to be real precise on what's Q3 versus what's Q4 because of the alignment of the tape-out strategy, which has a lot of things sometimes towards the end of the quarter, so it might move from one quarter to the next quarter. But we're still confident we'll stay in those spending ranges that we gave. And with respect to seasonality, you know that I'm really bullish about the -- some of the segments, meaning, the Wireless segment, we still think is extremely strong and we think we've proven that our Industrial segment has a lot of legs and it's been -- grew 11% this last quarter and a lot of strength in the scientific and medical area as well as broad-based industrial. So from an end market perspective, I'm feeling pretty good about the second half of the year. But I don't think I want to venture giving a growth rate and with that little granularity for the second half.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of James Schneider of Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Just returning to gross margins for a second. Given the strength you just mentioned, you saw that industrial -- I'm a little surprised that gross margins were that negatively impacted by the Virtex and Spartan-6 ramp in the quarter. Can you talk about the level of confidence you have in getting back to that 64% number in the December quarter? And what factors might swing that either way or might prevent you from getting that? Or, like, might provide the upside of that?", "Jon Olson", "Sure, Jim. If you think about the factors that I talked about, there were actually 2 areas. One is the strength -- relative strength that we had in Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 over our expectations. And I think our Spartan-6 family, it's very clear that we're pretty unabated with the competition in that particular area. And we've been really racking up design wins, so we expect that to take off very strongly. But the second factor was around a precipitous drop of both our base and mainstream sectors, which I think if you look back at history, we haven't had both those drop at that level of percentage all at once. And I think that was one of the bigger factors that is kind of resetting us for this past quarter. And then the current quarter, which is still impacted by the fact that we built ahead a little bit on some of the 6 series products because of what we thought was tightness in the boundaries. And so we're kind of flushing through that more expensive Virtex-6 inventory that we purchased. So then the confidence comes from 2 things: One is the volume levels that we're now putting through the boundaries so, therefore, we get cost improvements and defect actually declines, a. And then b, overall, we have a variety of our cost-reduction programs kicking in and contributing in a bigger way in the second half. And so that's why we believe that the second half will have very much stronger gross margins.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava of BMO.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Jon, just following up on the margin. What caused the precipitous decline in both the mainstream and the base? And then my quick follow up was, is there any unusual pricing activity going on? It's for 2 just -- or coincidental more that both you and Altera have guided lower for the coming quarter as in the reported quarter?", "Jon Olson", "Yes. And so again, on the gross margin. The base and the mainstream, we declined more than we -- it's more than we had anticipated. Now some of that was contributed by the fact that there were some last time buys in the previous quarter, and we did some, I'll say, end of life of some older products, but then there was some additional downward mix. And there's no question that over time those 2 decay, and they have very high gross margins for us because they're very old products. But nonetheless, the applications that they're selling into are far from dead. So I think it was just a little bit of bigger impact than we thought for the last time buy in the previous quarter and then just a customer/product mix issue. Now with respect to the pricing competition, I really don't sense any stronger competition than normal, if you will, out there between the other FPGA supplier and us. I think we generally are -- it's an opportunistic thing for both of us where we bang heads and other places it's not a big deal. So I don't view this is as some sort of a decay of the segment from a profitability perspective on a long-term basis.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Ruben Roy of Mizuho Securities.", "Ruben Roy - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "First question, Jon. On the wireless commentary, you're expecting some growth coming up here in the September quarter. If you x out kind of the push out that you saw in Q2 at your large customer, I think in Europe, if you x that out, would you still grow the Wireless business? And then secondly, on the R&Ds that appears, just reactionary at all to any feedback that you've received on the current shipping Kintex- or Virtex-7 products?", "Jon Olson", "So on the wireless comment, if we didn't have strong European wireless sales, I suspect we would be a little bit down in the Wireless segment. So obviously, we're counting on that. And we've all -- and we made appropriate judgments there on that revenue account in that forecast. And the revenue coming out of that region is very significant for us. So it is important that those shipments happen in order for us to grow wireless. From an R&D perspective, no, there's really nothing in the dollars that's significant at all related to anything other than continuing our tape-out strategy or rapid roll-out of products. There isn't anything extra in there for any other reason.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Sandeep Shyamsukha of Auriga USA.", "Sandeep Shyamsukha - Auriga USA LLC", "Your competitor mentioned yesterday that they are not seeing any quotes from you on the high end of the 28-nanometer family. Given your comment that you're already sampling a high-end family you started sampling last month, could you give us some indication of the competitive level there in terms of -- have you won design wins at the high end also? Or your 28-nanometer design wins are more concentrated in the midrange of the family?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So from our perspective, our midrange actually covers a lot of the high end, and our high end is actually higher end than their high. So we see a lot of activity there both on the Virtex side and on the high end of the Virtex side, which is the SSIT where there's a unique product, which actually has no competition. The 2000T and the 1500T are much larger than the monolithic dyes, which we have and anyone, any competitor has. So that's a place where we actually have no competition. The activity there is very high. It's driven by prototyping, by Wired Communications, by test and measurement equipment. All of these will typically stretch the edge of the envelope, and we're on schedule and we made the choice to address the midrange first and then within 2 months have the high end part out. It's out. It's working -- no, we're working on the tweaks that are necessary to bring it into production. We're very confident that we have a good footprint there.", "Jon Olson", "Yes, I will just point that in Moshe's remarks, he talked about several hundred millions of dollars of design wins. And a significant amount of that is Virtex family, Virtex-7 design wins. So it's not like that all those are related to Kintex by far. That's not true by far, Kintex was very strong in that accounting of things, but Virtex has also got significant numbers.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Shawn Webster of Macquarie.", "Deepon Nag - Macquarie Research", "It's Deepon for Shawn. I just have a question about order linearity to the quarter. And also, if you could talk about lead times, that'd be great.", "Jon Olson", "Yes. We were actually pretty linear this quarter, even more linear than maybe I've ever seen it. We've had turns other than maybe a big bubble towards the beginning of the quarter. Turns were extremely level and within the average tolerance level of the average turns number after the big bubble, so it was pretty interesting from that perspective. And then the second question was related to -- I'm sorry, I missed that?", "Deepon Nag - Macquarie Research", "Lead times, please?", "Jon Olson", "Oh, lead time -- oh to lead times. Yes, our lead times have all moved back to our stated goals which is to have 85% of our line items at 4 weeks or less, and we are at -- just at that level right now of 85%. And then there are -- if you go out to 6 weeks, then we actually cover up to like 90%, 95%. So we're in very good shape on lead times, even though our inventory is, on a days basis, has dropped quite a bit.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Hugh Orgy [ph] of UBS.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Moshe, I just wanted to ask you about the wireless ramp we've talked about in the emerging markets in the past. Can you give us any update as to what you're seeing in China, particularly as we start start to talk about it transition now to TD-LTE and also any update on what happened with the next phase of TD-SCDMA, that's one. And then also, if you can touch on India, just to recall that this is one of the areas that we are expecting to see growth for the wireless infrastructure sites. Any update on those 2 markets will be helpful.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So if you look at our Wireless business, there's tremendous strength in the end market in North America and there's tremendous strength in India. China is at a bit of a lull at this point and we expect it to grow somewhat. But most of the bounce we see at this point is driven by deployments in North America and India and less in China at this point.", "Jon Olson", "Yes, I think our best Q2, Hugh, in China was that sometime in this quarter that we're in, some orders could be let overall and then we'll start to see some ramps. So it's been -- I think it's been pushed out a little bit from at least what I think our expectations were a quarter ago in this call. I think I was a little more bullish on what would happen in the June quarter and, in fact, it's pushed out.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Brendan Furlong of Miller Tabak.", "Brendan Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC", "I'm going to return to the gross margin question, if you're seeing potentially better yields on your selling down the inventory of the expense -- the more expensive product in the next coming quarter and industrial and comps continue to hold up, should we expect the more to the mid- high range of your gross margin guidance as we go into fiscal 2013?", "Jon Olson", "So yes. So our current statement is for the second half of this year be to the low end of the margin, and there's no doubt that we believe that we'll continue to work on that. And our goal is to operate 64% to 66%. It isn't just to be sitting at the bottom during the whole time. So I think there's a reasonable chance that based on the information we can see today is that we will be up at least in the midpart of that range in '13 based on what I see today.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Glen Yeung of Citi.", "Delos Elder", "This is Delos for Glen. you mentioned some acceleration of the design activity at 40- and 45-nanometer, I believe, on the Spartan product. Could you describe a little more about where you're seeing that activity? And is it enough to catch up in terms of market share at that node?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So it's really broad, and we clearly, in terms of introducing the product, we're behind the competition on the high end. But on the Spartan side, we are the only guys who have a solution, and it's a very good solution. And between the 2 of those, those 2 together, we expect to, at that node over time, reach the 50% point. I think that's our target, which sort of clips the fact that we -- it isn't where we traditionally have been just due to the lateness, but we target is to get 50%. And we have a very strong product offering on the Virtex-6 side now, which is out. Transceivers are working. We're told that they are the best in the industry on the Virtex-6 side. They beat anything else that the competition may have in terms of the quality of the signals and the I, et cetera and the [indiscernible] of those characters. So we're seeing increased design win at the high end. And obviously, it's still up and running at the low end. That will continue for some period of time best we can tell.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda of Citadel Securities.", "Ian Eigenbrod", "This is Ian in for Sumit. Jon, I know you commented the backlog was up for the quarter, but were bookings also up?", "Jon Olson", "Yes, well, the fact that our backlog was up, that would indicate bookings were equal or greater actually than our billings for the quarter. So if you look at our book to bill, I think that's a reasonable conclusion to draw from that, yes.", "Ian Eigenbrod", "Okay, and then on the restructuring, did you quantify the timing or magnitude of any savings from that?", "Jon Olson", "So the reserve will all be taken in the September quarter because the employees all been informed of their status, so that will occur in that quarter. And we expect to be able to save on an annual basis $1 million to $2 million. Some of that gets put back into some headcount and low-cost geographies. But generally, there will be some help on the R&D line over time.", "Operator", "And you have a follow-up question from Shawn Webster of Macquarie.", "Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research", "Just quick follow-up. For the defense market, you mentioned in your previous remarks that was strong for you. Your competition actually pointed as a sign of weakness. And ethanol also came out today and about some push out of military orders. Have you seen anything of that effect? Or is this something different?", "Jon Olson", "No, I mean, I think certainly in the Defense business, there are designs that you win or designs that you win. We've continued to be able to grow our Defense business on an annual basis, and we're still very positive about that segment. We had a very strong quarter. We tend to have more strength towards the middle and the end of the calendar year because of the timing of things. And I would say we're pretty much on track, and I'll say seasonal from the standpoint of the Defense business in that area. So we're not seeing any pullback from any of the programs that we're associated with at this point in time. So everything's pretty much on track for us in the defense side of thing.", "Operator", "And you have a follow-up question from Hugh Orgy [ph] of UBS. ", "[Technical difficulty]", "Jon Olson", "Or not.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "That's a bad signal.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And there are no further questions in queue at this time.", "Jon Olson", "Okay.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin.", "Rick Muscha", "Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the September quarter, and then we'll open the call for questions.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially.", "We refer you to documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. ", "This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.", "Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.", "Jon A. Olson", "Thank you, Rick. During today's commentary, I will review our September quarter results. I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the December quarter. ", "Xilinx sales were $555.2 million in the September quarter, a decrease of 10% sequentially. This was in line with the revised sales guidance we provided on September 20, but lower than the forecast we provided during our last earnings conference call due primarily to weaker than anticipated business from customers in the communications and industrial and other categories. ", "Gross margin was 63.9%, slightly better than anticipated, driven primarily by favorable customer mix and product mix. Operating expenses were $200 million, less than guided due to lower than expected restructuring charges as well as lower variable, R&D and legal expenses. ", "Operating margin was $155 million or 27.9% for the quarter. New product sales decreased 5% sequentially during the quarter due to declines from Virtex-5 which were impacted by decreases in wired communications that more than offset increases in wireless business. ", "Spartan-3 sales were also impacted by declines from wired communications during the quarter. 40 and 45-nanometer product sales increased sequentially, led by strong gains from Spartan-6. 28-nanometer products, particularly Kintex-7, contributed to new product sales shipping units to more than 50 customers during the quarter. ", "Mainstream products decreased 15% sequentially and base products declined 14% sequentially. Sales from Asia Pacific were particularly weak during the quarter, declining 21% sequentially due to weak sales from wired and wireless communications business. Asia-Pacific sales represented 31% of total sales in the September quarter, down from 35% in the prior quarter and down from 35% in the same quarter a year ago. ", "North American sales were down 11% sequentially, driven primarily by declines from the Communications and industrial and other categories. For the September quarter, North American sales represented 29% of total sales, down from 30% in the prior quarter and flat with 30% in the same quarter of the prior year. ", "European sales were essentially flat for the quarter, as the sales increase in Communications was offset by sales declines from all other end market categories. European sales represented 29% of total sales in the quarter, up from 26% in the prior quarter, as well as the same quarter of the previous year. ", "Lastly, Japan sales increased 5% sequentially in the quarter, representing 11% of total sales with strength from all end market categories, with the exception of Data Processing. ", "Let me now turn to a discussion of end markets. Communications sales declined 12% sequentially, representing 44% of total sales driven predominantly by wired communication decreases. ", "Industrial and other sales decreased 10% sequentially to represent 33% of total sales, driven primarily by decreases from industrial, scientific and medical and test and measurement. Defense sales were down slightly. ", "Consumer and Automotive sales increased 2% sequentially to 16% of total sales, as increases in consumer and audio/video broadcast offset a slight decline in Automotive. ", "Data Processing sales declined 17% sequentially as declines in computer and Data Processing more than offset a slight increase from storage applications. ", "Net income for the quarter was $126 million or $0.47 per diluted share. Other income and expense was a net expense of $8.6 million, slightly higher than guided due primarily to slightly higher interest expense associated with the fair market value of certain elements of our convertible debt. ", "Operating cash flow for the September quarter was $200 million before $18 million in CapEx. We paid $50 million in cash dividends and repurchased 4 million shares of stock during the quarter for $122 million. The tax rate in the September quarter was 14%. ", "Diluted shares for the quarter were 267 million. There was no dilutive effect from our convertible notes, as the average stock prices during the quarter did not exceed the conversion price. To provide greater clarification regarding the dilution associated with our convertibles, we have recently posted a convertible FAQ to our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com. ", "Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments decreased $17 million to $2.8 billion. We have approximately $1.3 billion in convertible debt and our net cash position is approximately $1.5 billion. ", "Days sales outstanding decreased one day in the September quarter to 35 days. Inventory dollars at Xilinx declined by $28 million sequentially. Combined inventory days at Xilinx in distribution in the September quarter were 126 days, up from 117 days in the prior quarter. This is inclusive of approximately 17 days related to the build ahead associated with the closure of a legacy fab line. ", "Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the December quarter of fiscal year '12. Our backlog heading into the quarter is down sequentially. We are expecting sales from Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families to increase and sales from our 28-nanometer families to significantly increase sequentially. From an end market perspective, we are expecting sales from Communications to be down sequentially with wireless declines offsetting an increase from wired communications. ", "Consumer sales are expected to be approximately flat, as Consumer and Automotive growth offsets declines from audio/video broadcast. Industrial and other sales are expected to decrease sequentially primarily due to declines from test and measurement and Industrial, Scientific and Medical. We're expecting defense sales to increase. ", "Lastly, coming off a weak quarter, Data Processing sales are expected to increase sequentially. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be down 3% to down 8% sequentially, with sales from all geographies expected to be down. The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 57%. ", "Gross margin is expected to be approximately 64% as yield improvements and cost reduction efforts offset strong growth in our newest products. We remain committed to our corporate model of 64% to 66% and anticipate gradual improvement over time as we drive yield improvement in these product lines. ", "Operating expenses in the December quarter are expected to be approximately $203 million, including approximately $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Nearly all of this increase will be associated with higher R&D spending associated with 28-nanometer product development. ", "For fiscal year 2012, we now expect total operating expenses to be approximately $820 million to $830 million, including amortization of intangibles as well as the recent restructuring charge. This is a decrease from the guidance we provided at our last Analyst Meeting last March of approximately $850 million, including amortization of intangibles. Most of this decrease is related to lower variable spend associated with a lower sales base, in addition to the impact of cost controls as a result of the weaker macro environment. ", "We will provide fiscal year 2013 guidance at our upcoming Analyst Meeting on February 15 in San Francisco. Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $8 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 266 million shares. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 14%. ", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. Weak sales in the September quarter and lower than seasonal guidance for the December quarter suggest we are in a period of inventory adjustment across many of our end markets. While the PLD industry is certainly not immune to macroeconomic forces and short-term corrections, believe that Xilinx is better positioned than ever for long-term growth. First the micro trends driving programmable solutions of our ASICs and ASSPs has never been stronger.", "Second, our competitive position has improved dramatically with clear leadership at 28-nanometer. ", "Third, our industry-leading innovations enabling programmable systems integration, driving a new level of bond [ph] and system level customer value. ", "The September quarter, while new product sales declined 5% sequentially, sales from our Virtex-6 40-nanometer and Spartan-6 45-nanometer products increased, now represent more than 10% of total company revenue. Spartan-6 devices experienced strong growth from communication, industrial and consumer applications, and sales from our Virtex-6 HXT devices with 11.1 gigabit per second transceiver speed increased over 30% sequentially. We expect these families to show continued growth in the December quarter as well based on customer forecast. ", "In the September quarter, we achieved a number of key milestones that significantly boost customer value with 3 key elements enabling programmable systems integration. ARM-based processing integration with the Zynq-7000 family, the integration with stacked silicon interconnect technology and mixed signal integration with our Agile Mixed Signal technology. ", "Last quarter, we take out the PLD industry's first embedded system platform. The Zynq-7000 device will be sampling in the December quarter, building on what we believe to be well over a year time-to-market advantage with customer designs which started over 18 months ago using our emulation platform. The Zynq-7000 family is the first of its kind to integrate a world-class 800 megahertz dual core ARM processing system, 28-nanometer low power programmable logic combined with a software-centric use model. It enables a great system and bond [ph] level value through the integration of the processor, DSP and FPGA functionality in one device. ", "Design win momentum is also very strong and broad-based. Current design wins include applications in the automotive, defense, test and measurement, industrial, scientific and medical market segments. ", "With regards to stacked silicon interconnect technology, SSIT, the Virtex-7 2000T FPGA has generated significant design win activity in this quarter. This device, which is scheduled to sample to multiple customers in the December quarter, is industry's -- has the capacity programmable logic device and delivers twice the capacity of the competition, almost 3x the system's bandwidth and 50% to 70% reduced system-level power and cost through single-chip FPGA integration. This is a game-changing innovation. It provides us with a generational time-to-market advantage over the competition. ", "Lastly, we have also delivered the third generation integrated Agile Mixed Signal at 28-nanometer. Now available across all of the product families, highly flexible integrated AMS block eliminates a wide range of discrete analog functions and delivers a typical cost savings of $2 up to $7 armed with greatly enhanced system-level performance, board savings and reliability. These bill of material cost savings are most highly valued by customers designing with Artix-7, our 28-nanometer high-volume FPGA family. ", "I'm delighted with the rapid rollout of our 28-nanometer product family, which is unquestionably the fastest new product generation rollout in Xilinx's history. We have taped out 6 devices to date and are confident that by early 2012, we'll be sampling from our entire 28-nanometer product family. Design wins now total more than 200 designs, well over $600 million of lifetime revenue. Last quarter, we sold thousands of units to 50 discreet customers who are anticipating significant revenue growth in the December quarter. ", "To summarize, I've never been more confident in Xilinx's opportunity for growth and in our expanded product portfolio. Despite some uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, remain convinced that the overall larger trends are intact and expand our opportunity as our 28-nanometer leadership has led to significantly improved competitive position that our innovation in enabling programmable systems integration is creating a new level of customer value at the system and bond level. ", "As a result, we expect our 28-nanometer product families to ramp significantly faster than our 65-nanometer and 45 -- 40 and 45-nanometer families and expect our game-changing product strategy will drive continued share gain against ASICs and ASSPs as well as PLD share.", "Let me now turn the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "If I look at your guidance relative to some of your peers with similar communications exposure, or some of your customers or coms OEMs, it seems better, and it seems to me like some of that differential can be explained by the fact that you expect wireless to be up. So can you talk about why you have confidence that wireless will be up when in past quarters, you've had various levels of customer pushouts in that area?", "Jon A. Olson", "Jim, this is Jon. So first, relative to data points, I really haven't studied many of those data points because there are as many out there, relative to the supply chain in the communications at this point in time. So our guidance is impacted by a few things. One is last quarter, I did talk about the build aheads that were being done in some of our Communications business, so that was -- it kind of exacerbated our down situation and there was more inventory adjustments than we had even anticipated some of those large communications suppliers. So we are seeing some bounce back, particularly in Asia, from that area. So I think there's a little -- part of your --  the answer to your question is a little bit of timing of when they took it versus when they're going to take it in the supply chain.  The second part is, I think you may have incorrectly heard us that we think wired is going to be up next quarter and not -- and wireless is not going to be up; it's going to be down for us. So from a wired perspective, again, many of the same inventory adjustments that occurred were in the wired space and we do think we're going to get some bounce back from that perspective. On the wireless side, we had a very strong wireless showing that this quarter and again, there is some moderation in that across our big customer base.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Thanks that's very helpful. And then just a follow-up on the OpEx guidance. You talked about most of that reduction being on the SG&A and variable expense side. Can you talk about any kind of pushouts or anything on the -- that's affecting R&D? Because I think there was some R&D effect in the September quarter that you had talked about during the pre-announcement.", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. The OpEx thing has got a few twists in it, so kind of let me go through it. The reductions overall for the year are actually mostly in R&D. It's mostly us pulling back some in headcount and so a little bit of smoothing going on and masking the wafers between this fiscal year and next fiscal year. And that's really just the way we've realigned a couple things in our product roadmap, so nothing really significant to the production worthiness of our product family and our fast rollout that we've talked about before. But we are pulling back some in R&D just because we were pretty aggressive in some of the hiring plans, and so we're trying to find places that we can save money here and there because of the macro environment to make sure our bottom line still looks pretty good. While it is true that variable expenses, which hit both R&D and the sale on the SG&A side, because we have quite a bit of re-compensation which is variable. Then again, variable on the sales side would be commissions, those kinds of things. Unfortunately, some of that is being, that savings is being offset by higher legal expenses. Even though we said we had lower legal expenses this quarter, they're popping back up again in the second half of the year, as we continue to be -- to get -- I guess attack, maybe is the word. If people -- the trolls keep coming after us for things and so we have a strategy of vigorously defending ourselves in these particular IP litigations. And so we're having a protracted period of higher expenses which are offsetting some of the expenses in SG&A. So net-net, we see SG&A going down not very much, and we see R&D going down the most.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Merrill Lynch.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the demand environment. On the one hand, PLDs are supposed to be the secular growth market and should be somewhat immune to the cycle. But on the other hand, when I look at your guidance and trends, they're only slightly better than, say, the more mature analog sector as an example. I understand there's perhaps a bit more lumpiness among some of your customers. But I'm really interested to hear what you're seeing in the end market. Is it just customer lumpiness? Or are you seeing perhaps a slowdown in this ASSP and ASIC replacement by PLDs?", "Jon A. Olson", "Let me give a little end market color and then maybe Moshe can jump in with a little more customer trend kind of thing. Essentially, what you're seeing is a lot of weakness in the midsize and small customers and a lot of this is in the industrial and other categories. So broad-based Industrial, Scientific and Medical has had a very good run over the last 4 or 5 quarters for us, and we're seeing much more caution in inventory adjustment and just general reticence to jump into things in that particular area. So it's not all communication story here. There's a broad base of customers that are definitely having slowed down. Having said that, the communications side of the business, there is lumpiness going on with large customers. Very strong wireless, particularly out of our European customers serving -- as they serve the rest of the world. But then a lot of lumpiness coming out of Asia-Pacific where you saw such a strong decline for us, 21%, but then we do think that bounces back some in the next quarter. So there is a fair amount of lumpiness. One more statement before I turn it over to Moshe is, there is -- in terms of all the new designs and some of the existing designs from our last 2 or 3 generations of products that are still in the mill, we are not seeing people, our customers, push out design cycles for them. They are being more cautious, but no one's canceling -- at this point we don't see canceling of design activities going on. So I'm trying to kind of be cautious about the macro environment but say there's a lot of inventory adjustment and caution going on overall.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Yes. I can reinforce what Jon said, and the trends that we are seeing in terms of our customers' new systems is that a larger and larger portion of the solution is being implemented inside the FPGA and the primary change there is that ASICs are becoming really quite rare. And as we move forward to the 28-nanometer, then this trend accelerates. And so our expectation, and this is fully supported by what we're seeing as the number of new ASIC design starts, is that FPGAs are becoming -- replacing a significant part of ASICs. Those trends are now starting to manifest themselves. They were apparent at the 40-nanometer node and they're accelerating at the 28-nanometer node. Unfortunately, in terms of revenue, that's still a small part of our revenue and hence, that gets drowned out when there's sort of a macroeconomic downturn. So that trend is very, very solid and ASICs definitely are on their way out. And in some areas and in lots of applications, we're finding that what we're competing against is, if it's high-volume application, then we're competing against ASSPs. We're being quite successful there, in particular at the -- with the 28-nanometer solution. Now where that gets accelerated is due to the 2000T, the newest device we have, which has twice the capacity of what you can achieve on a monolithic device, and that enables us to compete with higher end ASICs than we ever have before, and that will enable us to capture market share. But again, you shouldn't confuse the short-term trends with the longer-term ones. And the short-term ones are driven somewhat by macroeconomics, but the strategic direction of more FPGA content is definitely continuing to strengthen and I'm absolutely confident that, that trend is going to continue.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.", "Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "As you guys think about what's clearly an inventory reduction that's going on now, can you give us a sense, one, if you have any idea if we're coming to a bottom. Some of your peers have suggested that we may be in that inventory reduction. And then maybe in response to that, could you also compare and contrast to the environment that you saw in 2008?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. I'm reticent to say that we're approaching the bottom or not, because I don't really know. I mean, we're certainly -- and I'll kind of go to the second part of the question and kind of circle back to the first one. If it ends up looking like 2008, we have a lot more bottom to go because there was a lot lower drop -- precipitous drop in the industrial segments than we're seeing right now. And our indication of what's different at least at this point in time from 2008 was really around design win activity and cancellation of programs that were in flight or close to our production level, and we are definitely are not seeing that now. That's why I kind of wanted to emphasize that in the answer to the previous question is, this doesn't, right now, feel to us like it's a 2008 scenario, but I don't have enough visibility to really forecast whether we're at the bottom in the December quarter or not.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS.", "Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Can I just start off by asking you about Automotive? Your comment about Automotive being slightly down, you're being contrast with Linear, as I reported today, and their comment was, this is one area where they're going to see growth. Obviously, I know you sell different things, but any comment as to what you can make to round out the module [ph] would just be helpful.", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, we're very bullish on Automotive, Uche. This quarter was -- I would say again, has something to do with inventory adjustment and a kind of a platform switching to our latest platform, we have even more content. So we actually -- I do believe Automotive continues to be a strong growth area for us. I think if you -- last quarter when we were on the call, several people had said Automotive was weaker and ours was actually stronger. So there's obviously some timing differences between when those things occur for us versus others, and what are the value position that we're in, in the automobile is, versus maybe other people. We're seeing much more -- much bigger adoption of FPGAs and when I think about the SoC level device of a Zynq platform, we're seeing even a larger uptake of that across the Automotive platform for the in-car kinds of things that we do, driver assist and infotainment, that level of product. So we're still very positive about Automotive.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Question on margins. Good to see you guys deliver on the promise of keeping margins -- having them go up in December. As we think through the next couple of quarters, your yields have come up on the 40, 45, but then you're also wrapping 28, albeit it's going to be a very small number. How should we think about margins, everything else being equal?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. So the challenge for us always when we're ramping new products is, and particularly we have this fast ramp, is that as we throw a 100 wafers into the foundry early to get engineering samples and then early customer samples and then we move into production; the more of those you do, the more margin drag you end up having in the process, but we've been cautious about talking about margins from the standpoint of, we know those things are coming at us, but we also know that we had cost reductions in the form of both internal things we've done, and also price negotiations for wafers that were giving us second half benefit. And so the way we have things modeled now is, those things can offset each other and give us a little bit of a positive along the way. So assuming all those elements happen as we estimate it, we should be okay. So we have counted on the fact that we're going to be ramping new products in this whole algorithm. And barring any serious issues with the new products, we should be in reasonable shape.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital.", "Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I guess on the OpEx side, the implied midpoint there is about $218 million or up 7% in the March quarter. I'm just curious there, should we be reading that as largely legal? Or are you seeing increased mass set designs, tape-outs, et cetera? How should we interpret that?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, I would say it's probably at least 2/3 R&D because of mass sets, and not so much headcount growth -- some, but those expense is related to that, and then a little bit in SG&A due, again, primarily to the legal forecast.", "Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And I guess just a follow-up in terms of gross margins. As you think about the ramp of series 7 and I guess yield implications from series 6, how should we be thinking about that, as that -- as we go through the next couple quarters? Is that an important part of the gross margin story here? Or are there other factors that we should be thinking about?", "Jon A. Olson", "That is probably the biggest issue outside of our customer mix is the rate of ramp and the rate of improvement of the defect density in the foundries. And we've been very pleased with the results we've got on the new products, particularly all the 28-nanometer products in terms of yields. And so if we stay on that yield path that we are on, again, I think that we've got other things going on elsewhere in cost reduction to help offset any drag that would give us, but that is the biggest factor other than customer mix.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra with Robert Baird.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Given the lead time contraction versus a few quarters ago, do you expect any changes in your ASP trends going forward, notably from mainstream and base products? And also you mentioned that there was some weakness at small and midsize customers. Does this have any gross margin implications?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. So from a lead time perspective, there's no doubt that our lead times have been shortened tremendously and you that our turns estimate from a percentage basis for next quarter is quite high from our last 4 or 5 quarter trend at 57%. So we are -- we do definitely believe that because of the short lead times and people's caution, they've waited in terms of placing orders on us, so that gives a fairly high turns number. From an ASP impact of all that, not really much because our ASPs are generally baked in, I'll say in the medium term. For large customers, they might have as much as a year in advance pricing. And then smaller customers, unless they just do spot buys, they typically are running 3, 4-month kind of price commitment. So we have a pretty good understanding on an order-by-order basis of what the margin's going to be. Then mix, both the customer and the product mix have the biggest impact. But I don't think we're going to -- we're really exposed on ASPs in particular on that. And then relative to the weakness of the midsize and small customers, there's no doubt that midsize and small customers pay us higher prices and that has a drag effect on gross margins. If you look at the impact or the percentage of our large customers, our top 50 customers as a percent of total revenue, it's about the same as it was last quarter. So therefore, everything kind of moved down in the same percentage and the same proportions, if you will. So that weakness, if it's greater than our large customers, it could have some drag on gross margins, but right now, we are -- we think things are pretty well balanced going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.", "John Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Two quick questions. Jon, maybe just a follow-on to your last answer. You mentioned turns were higher for this quarter than they have been in prior quarters. Can you put that into perspective as far as where we are in the cycle? How worried should we be about this turns level given where we are in the cycle for guidance? And I have a follow-up for Moshe.", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. So -- I mean, that totally is a $64 question, or $64 million question or whatever relative to why we have high turns, and we're saying that business is off for us. What's our confidence level in all that? And the way we go through our process is we do a buildup of both large customers forecast, short-terms and long-term forecast and then we also have an order patterning coming from both -- all our sources for the medium and small-sized customers distribution, our own salesforce if they happen to take care of the medium-sized customers, and then we sit down and we look at all those trends and we track those actually on a daily and weekly basis, just on a go forward, rolling basis and look at where the trends are. And so, while it is a high number, we do feel confident that even if quite a few customers took the same or less, we'd still be able to meet it because we do have a fair amount of our top 50 that have convinced us they're coming back for more products and more revenue than they had in the last quarter. So it's just the overall amalgamation of all that as a downward trend.", "John Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And then I guess, Moshe as a follow-up, given that it's still early days in 28. When you look at the momentum that you guys have there. How much of this is, kind of, rewinning sockets you lost at 45 versus, kind of, new market opportunity with ASIC replacement? And as you guys think about regaining those sockets, how should I think about incumbency and the benefits of that as you try to get back share?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Well, incumbency has value, but it has limited value because most of the customers actually are capable, at least the big customers are capable and have strategy -- have some level of balance between the 2 major providers and they have the tools and they can do designs with both. And obviously, we felt that because we clearly had the majority of the business -- vast majority of the 65-nanometer node and then at the 40-nanometer, at the high end, it clearly went the other way. Being first, having a broader product portfolio, rolling it out as quickly as we are and having tight market advantages in our mind are compelling reasons. And that's why we expect to see our share inside the FPGA or PLD market start growing again as 28-nanometer goes into production. And then this will just benefit from the fact that the market is clearly expanding as FPGAs are replacing ASICS in more and more applications. So we see the pie growing and we see our portion of the pie growing back with the 28-nanometer. Now it's difficult for me to sort of size those 2 trends, but I think the pie, overall, is growing at a fast rate and market share tends to shift over time. And the market share becomes more evident, but it takes longer for it to be visible whereas growth of the pie happens faster. And so if you're looking for numbers, I would expect that market growth -- overall market growth is 2x faster than the implication of market share and that's somewhat intuitive, but that's the best I can do.", "Jon A. Olson", "I mean, of the things I will just add to that, is that Moshe talked about, the design win lifetime revenue is over -- greater than $600 million, and now it's just [ph] quite a bit bigger number than a quarter ago when we talked about it. There's no doubt that some of that $600 million is winning things back that we had lost at 40- and 45-nanometer. Just like there's no doubt that it's expanding the market through Zynq, our SSIT platform, large FPGAs. Both of those are gaining significant tractions and those are largely expanding the market beyond traditional PLDs against ASSPs and/or ASICs.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie.", "Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research", "Just a couple of mix questions, and -- but before I get to the mix question, my first pre-question is on cancellations and pushouts. Did you see anything near the end of the quarter? Maybe if you can comment quickly on linearity.", "Jon A. Olson", "So, yes. There's no doubt that we, throughout the quarter we saw pushouts and -- because we were -- that was really the source of our pre-announcement relative to a lower revenue number. We had quite a few pushouts and there were cancellations in that. But then we also saw that after the cancellations, there were some re-bookings. So it's really a mixed bag and you kind of feel for a few weeks there like you're in a freefall, because you're not really sure where the hard ground is, but we definitely have seen both of those more on the pushouts than cancellations though.", "Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research", "And do you expect the December quarter to be fairly linear? Or are you counting on certain months being your stronger months?", "Jon A. Olson", "December is typically fairly linear for us. It gets a little soft at the Christmas timeframe, but generally pretty linear for us.", "Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then -- sorry my mix question is on -- you talked about the 40-nanometer -- your 40- and 45-nanometer revenues grew. Can you quantify that for us and maybe share with us what your mix of 40-nanometer is today?", "Jon A. Olson", "So generally we talk about these things kind of in one generation, so 40 and 45 to get us on -- if you're asking me to parse this to you, I'm not going to be able to do that. As a group, they -- it did grow and relative to -- I'm trying to recall how you asked the question, sorry.", "Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research", "Well, how much did it grow? Can you quantify it?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, it grew 10%, excuse me -- between 5% to 10%, sorry.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Devgan with Morgan Stanley.", "Sean Hazlett", "This is Sean Hazlett dialing in for Sanjay. It looks like the last time you reported earnings, about 85% of the lead times of your line items were 4 weeks or less. How does that compare to lead times today?", "Jon A. Olson", "Well, that's our metric is -- the percent of lead time is over 85% and we are, I'd say we're higher than that. I would say we're -- excuse me, we're less than 4 weeks, I'd say we're 95%, maybe 95% plus.", "Sean Hazlett", "Okay. And then another quick question. When can we, kind of, expect to see a meaningful percentage of revenue from your Zynq-7000 product?", "Jon A. Olson", "Zynq won't be significant for us for quite a few quarters. I mean, we have some very significant early design wins, but there's a lot of work to be done to integrate a SoC in a customer's application, so they're working way ahead of that. And it's also a new category, and we're being very expeditious about making sure we can support processor-like support for everybody in terms of the ecosystem and we've been focusing on a handful of end markets to make sure we're very effective, they're like Automotive, scientific and medical, broad-based, industrial, and then some in Communications, but I think it will be several quarters before you see anything really significant.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.", "Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "There's a view out there that the wireless network topology shifts to smaller cells and less expensive base stations to accommodate the higher wireless data demand. And I'm wondering if you could share your thoughts on how you see this trend playing out and how this impacts you. And if you could maybe give us some kind of relative metric as to the kind of typical content you might have in a large base station versus a smaller base station.", "Jon A. Olson", "Well, there's a lot of different topologies relative to what different companies are talking about, what the future is going to look like in terms of how much is sitting out close to the antenna and how much is back in the Central Office or how much is being run in the cloud and et cetera. The small cell has been getting a tremendous amount of talk lately and things. But quite frankly, even -- any of the OEM's strategies always have -- still have macro cells at some level involved in all this. Small cells are something that we continue to look at and look for opportunities to play in those, but we see this as -- it's not going to merge for quite a few years before there's any significant percentage of the overall infrastructure revenue coming out of small cells. It just doesn't seem to be well worked through yet in terms of how it's going to roll out, which providers would adopt it, and how it -- they can't throw away all of what they have today, so it is pretty interesting how -- when think you think about how the new thoughts are going to play with the old thoughts when a lot of it -- a lot of your money comes from expanding existing -- coverage in existing cities. And so there's a lot of things to be worked out there and we're definitely in the middle of that from a strategic perspective, trying to figure out exactly how it's going to roll out and we're confident we'll be there and still play in a significant way in the wireless infrastructure even if small cells become the thing.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ruben Roy with Mizuho Securities.", "Ruben Roy - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Jon, just returning to that question about 40-, 45-nanometer. Can you give us an idea of what percentage of revenues you've gotten to today? And then as a follow-on to that, you talked about Spartan-6 starting to ramp here. In terms of your 28-nanometer products also ramping, do you expect Spartan-6 to be a meaningful product? Or eventually in next year and the year after, do you think Kintex and perhaps Artix  will take over for Spartan-6?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. So 40- and 45-nanometer collectively was greater than 10% of revenue in the quarter, so get that question out of the way. And Spartan-6 has really been our -- been an extremely strong competitive answer to the fact that our competitor did not do a high volume base product at that node, the 40-, 45-nanometer node. And the reason that we're getting very strong design wins and starting to have some pretty significant revenue ramp there is because we kind of have a free reign relative to design wins for this -- devices that have a certain scale that have transceivers associated with the small form factor. In fact, our biggest competition is likely the small -- one of the smaller PLD competitors versus Altera in that situation. We're doing very strong, very well because of the transceiver capability there and the low power capability of Spartan-6 versus all other alternatives out there today. So those are the winning dynamics for that. So while it's true that Artix will come in and certainly play a role for the next generation in that same category, it's going to be a while before that -- there's traction there. We're just going to be sampling the first Artix early and that seems -- early sampling early in January and it will be -- excuse me, early in the January -- the March quarter and it will be a while before we -- there's real traction on the Artix family. Also Artix brings some different characteristics like the mixed-signal capability that we talked about. So it's going to have, also, some different play and it's going to move up in -- the high end of Artix will move up and play a role and some of -- where traditionally the midrange has been for our competitors. So it's actually a pretty broad family relative to what Spartan-6 was.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities.", "Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Jon, on the wireless and wireline being little bit lumpy here, just trying to understand -- if you look at from a different geographic standpoint, just trying to understand what are some of the trends you're seeing in China as well as in the U.S. And also and on the wireline side, I'm a little surprised to see that it's actually coming back up in Q4, if you could kind of tell us what's driving that?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. So from a wireless perspective, we had a really strong quarter in that particular area, I mean in wireless area that was driven out of our -- you can tell our geographic -- from a geographic perspective that Europe was essentially flat and it was the only geography that was in that situation, so you can imagine that a lot of that came from our strong wireless business there. And some of that was a little bit of catch up from the previous quarter, but generally, we do feel wireless will be, in that area, will be strong for us again another quarter. It's been -- if you look at the Asia-Pacific sales, our Asia-Pacific sales were down significantly 21%, in terms of it's down, and a lot of that was due to our communications businesses there which has soft in both wireless and wireline. So the view that things are coming back in wireless, excuse me, wireline is really one of an inventory adjustment that had happened -- pull-aheads in the previous quarter and those customers are going to be taking some product this quarter. So there are customer-specific situations where we think the inventory adjustment will be over and that's now over, and therefore, they're going to get back to, obviously, a normal run rate and those happen to be more associated with our Asian -- Asia-Pacific customers and in the wireline area.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Johnson with Pacific Crest Securities.", "David Johnson", "I want to come back to the OpEx. I talked about R&D in the March quarter being impacted by higher amount of mass cost. I was wondering if we should expect the majority of that to roll off exiting the March quarter. And then second question was just on the stacked silicon technology. I'm just wondering if you could remind us whether that technology is going to be fairly limited to the high end or if you anticipate it proliferating throughout a broader set of your product groups.", "Jon A. Olson", "So I'll take the OpEx one and give Moshe the stacked silicon one. From an OpEx perspective, so yes -- so we do continue to see an increased number of tape-outs quarter-by-quarter for the next several quarters as we continue to roll out our 28-nanometer family. We aren't -- the peak for that in this fiscal year is going to be the March quarter. We aren't providing a forecast at this time for FY '13, but we will not be done rolling out our 28-nanometer product, taping them out by the end of March. There's still more that will come in the next year. But we're going to provide more color and information around that when we talk about our OpEx number for next year and we get to the analyst day in mid-February.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "And with regards to SSIT, it started at the high performance in the high end of the family and it addresses 2 portions. The first is with regards to capacity or density, and all of the high-capacity devices are implemented using SSIT. And in addition, we're going to use that technology for integrating our ultra high performance transceivers. And that will enable us to have, what we believe is transceiver performance which is second to none using that technology. So both fall into the high end of the product offering and they're both Virtex derivatives: one is high capacity; the other is high transceiver count and high transceiver performance.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo.", "David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "For the generation of product following the 28-nanometer technologies, are you going to stick with a similar design manufacturing plan? In other words, are you going to have a unified architecture manufactured on a single HPL-type technology with a single foundry?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "So we obviously haven't announced what our plans are in that regard, but we are delighted with the benefits we've seen on the 28. And you can bet that we will continue to use similar methodologies as it makes sense. And we are in the midst of advanced definition and starting the implementation of those products. So it's a little too early to give away the recipe at this point in time, but it's going to be a wonderful product. We're very excited about it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Sandeep Shyamsukha with Auriga USA.", "Sandeep Shyamsukha - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division", "For 40-, 45-nanometer, now that you have announced that it is more than 10% of your revenue, would you be able to estimate what sort of market share you expect this family to have once the family is completely mature? And also, if you can speculate or estimate when you expect to hit a similar milestone for your 28-nanometer family.", "Jon A. Olson", "From a 40, 45 share perspective, where our strengths have been is in the Spartan class of products where there really isn't significant competition for us, as we have said in the high volume category, we expect to start gaining share next year all across all high-volume products. From a balance perspective though, of 40, 45 together, since we did introduce our 40-nanometer products later than our competition, I think if you aggregate the whole thing, we're -- we'll be approximately 50%. From a 7 series 28-nanometer perspective, our 7 series product family, I really can't estimate right now when we'll be at 10%. One would think that we could get there sometime in the next fiscal year, but I'm not going to exactly say when. I'm not sure yet.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.", "Brian Peterson - Raymond James", "This is Brian Peterson filling in for Hans. Just a clarification on 28-nanometers. Could you guys discuss what percent of sales that was in the quarter and what the split was between Kintex and Virtex?", "Jon A. Olson", "So the most significant thing here, Brian, is the fact that we shipped for revenue to a very broad base of customers -- 50 customers and we shipped thousands of units. Really aren't disclosing anything specifically about the revenue number. I mean it was significant, but I mean, from a new product perspective, but it's not significant relative to the totality of our revenues. It's very early and the message for us has really been around the strength and the breadth of number of customers and across designs. From a product, individual product, there was certainly a higher percentage going to Kintex than Virtex because Kintex was the first part we taped out, the first part we sampled to customers. So Kintex was the leader, I'd say relatively significantly the leader in what we ship, but there's no doubt we ship significant numbers in revenue dollars of Virtex-7 products as well.", "Rick Muscha", "Thanks for joining us today.", "We have a playback of this call beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time, 8:00 p.m. Eastern time today.

Operating expenses were $199 million, flat with the prior quarter and a little less than guided, primarily due to lower variable expenses associated with lower revenue and increased attention to fiscal discipline. Operating margin was 26.8% for the quarter.", "New product sales decreased 13% sequentially and increased 5% on a year-over-year basis. Virtex-6, Spartan-6 and our 28-nanometer product families all posted solid sales growth during the quarter. The new product category, however, was impacted by declines from our Virtex-5 customers in the wireless segment. Mainstream products declined 1% sequentially, and base products were flat. ", "Let me now turn to a discussion of end markets. In the face of a continued weak wireless demand environment, communication sales declined 10% sequentially, more than we were anticipating heading into the quarter. Wired communications, on the other hand, increased during the quarter with particular strength from enterprise networking. ", "The industrial and other category was down, as expected, with sales decreasing 7% sequentially, driven by industrial, scientific and medical and test and measurement applications. Consumer and automotive sales were weaker than anticipated during the quarter, driven by declines from audio/video broadcast, consumer and automotive applications. Data processing sales were approximately flat.", "Net income for the quarter was $127 million or $0.47 per diluted share. Other income and expense was a net expense of $7.2 million. Third quarter net income included a tax benefit of $15.3 million or $0.06 per diluted share related to one-time items, including the lapse of the statute of limitations with respect to certain previously unrecognized tax positions.", "Operating cash flow for the September quarter was $181 million before $19 million in CapEx. For the past 4 quarters, cash generation from operations was $863 million, a new company record. We paid $50 million in cash dividends and repurchased 1.1 million shares of stock during the quarter for $32.5 million. The tax rate in the December quarter was 2%.", "Diluted shares for the quarter were 268 million. There was a 2.5 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes due to an increase in the average stock price during the quarter. For questions relating to the dilution associated with our convertibles, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com.", "Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased $95 million to approximately $3.0 billion. We have approximately $1.3 billion in convertible debt, and our net cash position is approximately $1.7 billion. Days sales outstanding increased 3 days in December quarter to 38 days. Inventory dollars at Xilinx declined by $2.2 million sequentially during the quarter. Combined inventory days, both at Xilinx and distribution were 142 days, up from 126 days in the prior quarter. In the March quarter, we expect both dollars and days of inventory to decline significantly as we realign our supply with the demand trends.", "Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the March quarter of fiscal year '12. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up sequentially. We are expecting strong growth from our 28-nanometer and 40-nanometer product families. From an end-market perspective, we are expecting sales from communications to be up slightly sequentially, with wireless up modestly after a weak December quarter and wireline sales approximately flat. We expect industrial and other sales to increase as normal spending patterns return to many of our customers following 2 quarters of inventory drain.", "Additionally, we are expecting defense sales to increase during the quarter, driven in part by last time buy activity, but more significantly by the commencement of a large program.", "Consumer sales are expected to be approximately flat, and data processing sales are expected to decrease sequentially. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be up 2% to up 6% sequentially, with sales from Europe expected to increase, sales from Asia-Pacific expected to decrease and sales from North America and Japan to be approximately flat.", "The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 55%. Gross margin is expected to be between 64% and 65% as we absorb new product ramp costs and customer mix returns to normal historical levels.", "Operating expenses in the March quarter are expected to be approximately $207 million, including approximately $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. The majority of the growth in spending compared with the December quarter is in R&D and related to the 28-nanometer ramp as our tape-out activity remains high. There's also some growth in SG&A related primarily to variable spending increases as result of higher revenue and growth in some key marketing and sales programs. The full year spending number is approximately $810 million, lower than our previous estimate of $820 million to $830 million. We will provide fiscal year 2013 guidance at our upcoming Analyst Meeting on February 15 in San Francisco.", "Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $10 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 270 million shares, and the tax rate is expected to be approximately 14%.", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. While we obviously have not been immune to the weakness in the current economic environment, I am pleased with the nearly 20% combined sequential growth from our Virtex-6 40-nanometer and Spartan-6 45-nanometer families. Virtex-6, in particular, experienced very strong growth from wired comms and storage applications. We expect these families to show continued growth in the March quarter based on the beginning backlog and customer forecasts.", "As we begin 2012, I've grown ever more confident about the competitiveness and customer value of our next-generation 28-nanometer product portfolio. This is because our top customers around the world are consistently telling us we're delivering indisputable leadership in terms of 28-nanometer technology. I'm extremely pleased with the execution of the 28-nanometer rollout, which is without question the most aggressive and complete new product rollout in our history. We have now delivered more than 10 tape-outs and are confident, by the middle of this year, to be sampling members from our entire 28-nanometer family.", "Additionally, the industry's first 28-nanometer product, the Kintex-7 K325T, recently passed rigorous qualification criteria, would release for production shipments, as planned, in the June quarter. 28-nanometer success would not have been achieved without our exemplary technology partnership and collaboration with TSMC. TSMC's fully qualified HPL process optimized for both performance and power has provided us significant time-to-market advantage and is providing yields that are in line with our aggressive roadmap and better than what we had experienced in previous generations.", "This past quarter, we achieved 2 very significant 28-nanometer milestones. First, we began shipping the industry's first extensible processing platform, the Zynq-7000 device. This family enables a new level of hardware-software systems integration with a complete ARM Cortex processing subsystem and low-power programmable logic. With a very significant time-to-market advantage over the competition, design wins already totaling well over $100 million, this new class of product is creating an unprecedented level of excitement value in our customer base.", "We also began shipping the first device from our SSIT, Stacked Silicon Interconnect Technology family. The Virtex-7 2000T device is the industry's highest capacity programmable logic device, with 2 million logic sales, delivering twice or more of the capacity of competitive devices through single-chip FPGA integration. This innovation is absolutely game changing, conservatively providing us with at least a 2-year time-to-market advantage. Design win momentum has been exceptionally strong with over 30 wins valued at more than $100 million.  Our only challenge at this point is our ability to more quickly ramp supply to meet all of the demand for this product. We're very actively working through all constraints and are confident that we'll be able to align our supply with the demand for this product line.", "We now have four of the five 28-nanometer product family shipping in the market. The Zynq and Stacked Silicon Interconnect initial shipments were preceded by the shipment of key Kintex-7 and Virtex-7, both mid- and high-end family members. With 28-nanometer design wins now totaling nearly 350 and well over $1 billion in terms of design win value, we have approximately 90 discrete customers currently designing in members of the 28-nanometer product family, demonstrating the broad-based acceptance of it.", "In the March quarter, we are anticipating continued strong sales growth and by the June quarter, expect to comfortably exceed $10 million quarterly sales for this family.", "Finally, after reviewing input from over 120 customers on our 28-nanometer leadership position, I can tell you that in my more than 30 years in the high tech industry, I have never seen a single product generation which has the level and breadth of customer impact as our existing 28-nanometer portfolio.", "I look forward to providing you with an update on our 28-nanometer momentum at our annual Analyst Meeting, which is scheduled February 15 in San Francisco.", "Let me turn -- let me now turn the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering on the wireless communication side, could you talk a little bit about the visibility you're seeing in terms of your customer programs there? It sounds like you're expecting that to increase slightly in the March quarter. When do you think that might bounce back more materially? And are you seeing that bounce back happening more in the 2G, 3G or 4G areas?", "Jon A. Olson", "Jim, this is Jon. The visibility on wireless is really not very good for us. And while we still have, I would say, a reasonable level of business broadly across older generation technology, the uptake, particularly in North America, has been much weaker than the trend has been over the last 4 quarters. And then I think it's also pretty widely known that the next wave in China has yet to materialize in the same way that's being talked about. So we're kind of, in some respects, we're in a bit of a holding pattern waiting because the information we're getting from our customers doesn't really give us a precise quarter that they think the capital spend is going to start increasing at all those various providers. So it would be premature for me to speculate on when that might be. I still strongly believe it's just a matter of when, not if, just because of the strong need for bandwidth and the move towards LTE more globally, where we have an extremely strong position. So I'm not being very helpful, I know, relative to telling you exactly which quarter, but we think it is coming.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then maybe as a follow-up, I'll ask you maybe a similar thing on the wireline side. It sounds like that really hasn't even bounced back cyclically at all at this point, and we heard anecdotally from a lot of carriers that they were postponing a bunch of new wireline programs into sometime in 2012. Any more visibility on -- I know you have limited visibility across the board, but do you think that wireline comes back later than wireless when it does?", "Jon A. Olson", "I don't know exactly what specific programs you're referring to but -- and if you can tell, I probably couldn't give you specific customer data anyway. But we've seen a recent, I'll say, mini-surge off a low inventory point at several key customers. And so we're trying to read that ourselves to figure out whether it's an inventory replenishment above all others or it's got more legs. I think if you listen to the network guys, what they're saying, it's a little patchy as to whether they're highly confident or less confident going forward. So I think we're still in choppy waters there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS.", "Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Moshe, let me just follow by asking you about some of the comments you made on 28-nanometers. First of all, congratulations on the very strong design wins. But can you help me understand your 28-nanometer design wins today compare that with 40. And over the next year, my assumption is that 40 will still be the main revenue driver even though 28 design activities going on. Where do you see your 40-nanometer market share versus 28? And how do you see the growth of 28 ramping between now and, say, the end of 2012?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Okay. So let me first talk about 28. We have an extremely broad product line at 28, 5 distinct families: Altix, Kintex, Virtex, SSIT, which is a high-end and unparalleled in terms of density so it actually opens up a new market for us, and then there's the Zynq product line, which again is -- opens up a whole new set of market. When we look at our competitive position, our expectation is that we will have 70% of the market at least, and that's based on the fact that in 2 of the 5 areas, there is no competition now, and we expect that competition to take a long time to come. And on the other 3 areas, we actually feel we have an incredibly strong hand. Now in terms of how quickly we expect it to come out of the gate, it is coming out very quickly, much faster than the previous 2 generations of product. And because the yields are also very high and the demand is there because it either can enable capabilities that aren't possible with the previous generation of technology or if they are possible, then it's a lower power point and over time, a lower cost point, we expect that to grow at a very fast rate. So if you look at Virtex-5, which was our previous generation, a previous more successful generation, then that took 3 to 5 years to reach its peak. Here, we expect that the peak A will be much higher because it opens up significant new markets, and we actually feel that we have a much better competitive hand. So we would expect, as we indicated, $10 million or more in what is the April, May, June quarter, and we expect it to grow rapidly from that point forward. So we aren't giving predictions, but that's much faster than we've seen previous generations of product. The 40-nanometer and 45-nanometer, we clearly came out later than the competition. Our strength there is driven by the fact that we have a low-end product in the 45 and that is doing well. Overall, our goal on the 40 and 45 is to close in, over time, on 50% market share. We're clearly not there now, and it's going to take us some time to get to that point. But in parallel, we expect the 28-nanometer to totally flip the way the market share has grown over the past few years and enable us to win back significant market share. When that will become extremely visible? It becomes visible when the 28-nanometer moves into significant volume. If you look at the numbers, given that we're -- the market in of itself is between $4 billion to $5 billion now, then it requires more than $10 million per quarter to make a significant dent there. But at the rate that it's growing, by the end of the year, this should be very visible.", "Jon A. Olson", "I'd like to add one more thing. When we looked at this last of how we're doing versus the ramp on 40-nanometer, it actually wasn't this quarter. It was a quarter ago when we talked about having accreted $600 million of the design wins. We were 60% ahead of where we were on -- we were on 28 versus where we were at 40. And I actually didn't have a look at it at the end of this quarter, it could even be a bigger percentage. We'll try to give a little bit more information about that at the Analyst Day.", "Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Can I just ask you one question? Of the $10 million revenue you have now, how much of that is the SSIT product? Because from the numbers you provided, Moshe, it is a very high ASP product, and I don't know whether that is something that could be a sustained growth beyond the accumulation phase. So I'm not sure how to think about the sustainability, what the mix of that is and what the sustainability of the SSIT product would be.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Yes, so the projection we made for $10 million is in the April through June quarter, and that does not require a huge amount of SSIT revenue. And so you shouldn't assume that SSIT is necessarily a huge percentage of that. And the reason that we believe that it has longevity is that if you look at the capabilities there, there's no way to get to those capabilities unless you design a high-end ASIC, which obviously is becoming less and less viable. So we actually are seeing 2 -- no, sorry, 3 very large markets using it, one is prototyping and you can say that's the one which tends to surge and then decline, but the 2 which have longevity are the wired communications, where it replaces ASIC and the Mil/Aero where there's a huge demand for very high-end devices. And both of those, obviously wired communications happens at a faster rate typically than the military market, but both of those tend to have long life cycles.", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. I also want to point out a couple of other things about the SSIT family, is that we have more than one member of that family, there's 3 members. And some of those members have a very high capability and total bandwidth for transceivers as well. And so this will get used a lot in communications design. So as those get taped out and through the sampling phase, et cetera, we think there's going to be a lot of legs in this particular family.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Just on gross margin, guys. You guys have done a really good job in committing to the Street and then executing on that. I was just curious, despite the big comp customers coming back, you had a slight upside. How should we think about margins? What are the puts and takes around the 64%, 65% target that you guys have set? And then a quick follow-up, on inventory, Jon, is this a continued buildup from the end-of-line legacy that caused the total inventory to go up in the last quarter as well?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. So on the gross margin, Ambrish, it spiked up in part by, we talked about customer mix, which essentially means we had a lower percentage contribution from large communications customers. And that had an impact of somewhere less than a point, but in that general neighborhood. So that brings us back down into more in the normal range that we have. And then as we tape out, we have many, many tape-outs going on right now, all going on at various stages in parallel, and that causes us to produce units that engineering has to test, et cetera, and some of those are salable, some of those aren't. So some of those things end up impacting our margin, but we've been able to hold ourselves at least within our model even to the start-up phase. So those are some of the bigger impacts. One other impact is that as we are cutting wafers pretty significantly, we have been the last 2 quarters, and that will kind of, I'll say, overrun our revenue decline now and therefore we'll see a precipitous drop in inventory dollars next quarter. And that has some high costs falling out that had some downward pressure to our gross margins and puts us in that 64% to 65% range. So those are the factors. So I would expect as we continue to have the ramp and get rid of the start-up costs, I suspect that we'll have, out in time, upward pressure going on in the gross margin number. We're kind of at a low point, if you will, at this point in time. From an inventory perspective, look, as you know, dollars went down very slightly, but let's say inventory was flat and days just shot up, and that's just a function of the arithmetic because revenue is down, and you use the cost of sales number to create the days number, so it was in absolute dollar, a lower number than in previous quarters. So days happened to shoot up even though inventory dollars really didn't go up. There is some of the last time buy inventory that is in there. It stays relatively constant for the next few quarters, just like our last time buy revenue will stay relatively constant for the next several quarters, so we're not seeing any real revenue blips because of last time buy or any significant declines in revenue coming because of the last time buy. It just takes a -- we've had to build so much of it because of the fab line that's being discontinued. We're just trying to manage that to a flat dollar level over the next 4 quarters.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with BoA Merrill Lynch.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I'm trying to compare your current visibility versus how it was, I think, in December or so when you gave your outlook. What end markets are you more confident about now? What end markets are still sort of uncertain? Where I'm going with that is your March guidance is suddenly getting closer to normal seasonality, but I'm still sensing some uncertainty in your comments about end markets. I'm just trying to read the lines here on what the underlying turns are? What end markets do you like, what are still sort of uncertain right now?", "Jon A. Olson", "I gave some comments earlier about the communications market. I think by our tone in the words, you'd probably come to conclusion that we think wireless has bottomed out for us, and we're -- now we're kind of waiting for whether there's additional CapEx spends by our customer's customer or not, even though we do see some modest increases going on there. And in the wireless segment, still choppy, not easy to predict where that's going or where the IT spend is really going to go or where the cable and satellite provider spend is really going to go. So I would say there, it's not really whether we like it or we don't like that. I'd say that the confidence level is -- we feel like we're pretty close to bouncing on the bottom, and we're not really sure when things are going to, I'll say, more fully recover to where they were 3 or 4 quarters ago. Almost the same statement on industrial and other. We do feel that that's more of an inventory drain situation, and that people have corrected their inventory and we're seeing a lot more orders coming. One of the reasons that revenue was a little higher than we thought, both primarily communications customers, but distribution also ended up being stronger in December than we had anticipated. Overall, we've pretty much counted on the last week or 2 to be very sparse with factories being closed because people didn't have a need to build stuff so they gave time off, and that was some of the word that we were getting through distribution. But then that actually didn't happen in the same way that we had anticipated. So a lot of our industrial customers come through our distribution networks, so that gives me a very positive feeling around. Again, we feel like we've reached the bottom on industrial. When is it going to come back? Consumer typically a little weaker in the March quarter anyway, so that's pretty much in data processing. That doesn't move the needle one way or the other that much for us. So I hope that's helpful.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Very helpful. And just a follow-up clarification and a question. What was the 40-nanometer as percentage of sales mix? And then the bigger question is very impressive design wins at 28-nanometer. I'm curious; when do you expect that to be, I don't know, say, take 10% of industry sales? Is it more a 2013 or 2014 time frame?", "Jon A. Olson", "I'll deal with the second one first. So the 28-nanometer design wins are a myriad of end markets, end customers in various stages of rolling out their products. So you can't really project the size of the ramp, if you will, or the speed of the ramp. But because we have so many different customers and so many designs, just our experience is that ramp is going to manifest itself faster than we've seen in the last couple of generations. So in some respects, we're going on some very specific information from specific customers. In other respects, where it's a very broad set of customers, we're kind of going on the way trends have worked in the past. So again, we try to give the best information we have, not overcommit on things and we think we've given you a pretty fair statement on that. Your question on 40-nanometer was around percent of sales. We really did not provide that this quarter. I don't think we're going to provide that number.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital.", "Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I guess first question, and I realize visibility is somewhat limited here, but curious how you see the shape of the cycle off of the trough here?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. I'll give you my two cents. I don't know if Moshe has anything to add to that. But having lived through some of these before and see that there's certainly some end markets here where this is more -- it's a demand driven in addition to inventory correction, I view this generally as kind of a slow movement off the bottom over the next couple of quarters and then a better second half. But that's just an experiential thing, I don't think we have any data that necessarily supports that, because I think we look at the same reports that you guys do.", "Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "That's helpful. And as a quick -- sorry, go ahead.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "My prospective, this is Moshe here, is that the one market which unquestionably is on fire relates to the smartphones. And if you look at what is happening there and the demands that they're putting on the underlying infrastructure, at a minimum, as those -- when people are moving away even in emerging markets and lower-cost markets, they're moving away from what I call feature phones, these smartphones. These phones generate huge, huge, huge bandwidth demands and as such, definitely, the systems need to be upgraded to support those. So on communications, both in particular, wireless communications infrastructure, coming back to Jon's comment at the very beginning, that can't continue. It has to be upgraded; otherwise, people will revolt against the fact that their phones, while flashy, can't be used for anything. And it's a huge business opportunity, and I'm very convinced that that's a question, as Jon put it, of when as opposed to will it happen. It definitely needs to happen soon. And we're seeing similar trends in other markets, which has similar characteristics but maybe they're not as visible because it's not driven by consumer smartphones which everyone knows about. So the other thing I'm hearing is in the whole host of ecosystem plays, there's been a huge bounce back from a very significant trough to now everyone building up to support the imminent requirements. And so I feel that good things are happening and timing might still be a question mark but just generally, I'm very bullish about the secular trends which are driving all of these needs.", "Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "That's very helpful. And if I could just ask a quick follow-up. When you think about 28-nanometer growing as a percentage of your mix, I'm curious, given the increased capital intensity at the foundries growing roughly 50%, we're in the move from 4x to 28-nanometer, what impact that will have on your gross margin? So how should we think about that? I know it's down the road a bit, but we'd love to hear your thoughts there.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Well, every generation becomes significantly more expensive and 28-nanometer, vis-a-vis 20, if you just look at the wafer prices, there's no doubt that they're going up there, there's less suppliers and the equipment is more expensive and the number of customers who are driving at the leading edge is much smaller so as a result, you don't see the normal, more slow, that's one trend. The other -- on the other side, to balance that, there's huge amount of engineering, which is being put in place in the product design, in the product design for manufacturability and in the operations flow, which makes us very confident that we can, to some extent, compensate for those. So in terms of margins long term, we're shooting for the same margins, and in the short term, as Jon mentioned, we're actually being able to absorb this new technology, which is a lot more expensive for us, better than we have before, a lot of it due to these elements plus obviously, there's the higher yields we're seeing, which are helping out. So we're not, at this point at 28, expecting negative impact on margins for our business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.", "Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So you guys are guiding -- if I look at the numbers, kind of in line with what I would view as normal seasonal for the first quarter. I wonder if -- I guess just some questions about the relative expectations for the year. And 3 things: One, do you think normal seasonal is a pattern that is sort of the benchmark you're going to use for the rest of the year? Two, do you think that your business will outgrow the overall chip market? And thirdly, do you think that you should outgrow the end markets because you'll benefit from an inventory replenishment on top of just demand growth?", "Jon A. Olson", "So, no, even though it does appear March is in much seasonal line with this, I'm not sure I feel like we're -- the whole year ends up being seasonal, because I think there's some recovery that comes on this year, and so that kind of wipes out the seasonal -- the underlying seasonal activity that would normally go on end market-by-end market. So I don't see that seasonal affect naturally holding on this year. So I guess maybe I'm a little more bullish this year than maybe what seasonal or 5-year trends would say -- averages would say for us. I do think we are going to outgrow the rest of the semiconductor industry. I think we've been saying that for some time, I still believe that. We tend to talk about this in longer-term CAGRs, so any given year could look one way but we do think on the whole, it will be better. And then the intensity we have in terms of penetration at our large customers is growing, and the breadth of our new technology is helping us get there just as Moshe talked about today. So I guess that's a no, yes, yes.", "Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then let me ask you a question just by bringing it closer to now, I suppose. Can you just talk a little bit about how your order patterns looked as you exited the year, and then how that may have changed, if at all, in January? And then you talk about sort of an uncertainty as to whether or not this will stick. I just wonder what are the kind of things you'll be looking for from your customers. What do you need to hear from them to give you confidence this is a recovery or it's not?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, so the order patterns, again, we left -- we ended the quarter stronger than we thought. We ended with backlog higher than we entered the previous quarter. So these were all things that we viewed as very positive signs, and we were probably a little more bearish during the December month than we should have been, obviously. And so I think we -- we're bolstered by what we see in the backlog and how things are going so far in the first, very short 2 weeks of January. But quite frankly, we need the large customers to order parts and not push out what's on the backlog today, and that will give us some good signs. To me, that's the biggest sign, when the top 25 are in the game and they start putting orders on us and in some cases even expediting, that's what's going to make me start feeling a lot better.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie.", "Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research", "Well, it sounds like you'll give us an update on the trajectory of OpEx next year. But I was wondering if you could talk about maybe when you're -- when you expect the peak quarter to be in your 28-nanometer tape-outs? I believe in the past, you thought OpEx could decline next year. I'm just trying to figure out what the trajectory could look like at this point.", "Jon A. Olson", "So I have a hard time answering that question without actually answering the question I said I'm not going to answer, which is talk about spending number for next year. And we -- part of lowering our, and I've said this on the investor conference, or a good part of the lowering of our spending engineering number this year, our OpEx number for this year lower than we had anticipated was because we've moved some things from one year to the next. We've re-calendarized some of our tape-outs in addition to taking out discretionary spending, and that's what's caused our number to be going down from the $850 million or so kind of number down to -- $850 million or $860 million number. We're talking about million dollars of operating spending, now down to $810 million for this fiscal year. So that does imply that there is some of that going on. But because we haven't talked about what the full year is going to look like, I'd be hesitant to say exactly what the profile of engineering spending is going to be next year. That's what we're going to talk about in 3 weeks.", "Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research", "You can't talk about when you think the peak tape-outs will be, if they will be in the first half or the second half?", "Jon A. Olson", "Well, the peak, yes. The peak will be, of 28-nanometer tape-outs, is more likely in the first half, but you have to actually know the profile to know whether that -- whether there's a flat roof or a peaked if you go back to my Analyst Day presentation. [indiscernible]", "Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then a follow-up on the...", "Jon A. Olson", "I'm not sure that's helpful. I'm afraid you're going to take -- you're going to draw conclusions from that, that may not be accurate, so just be careful with that.", "Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research", "My conclusion is I need to wait for next month. So if I could ask a follow-up question on the inventory side. Can you give us some color on how channel inventory -- just the inventory declines stay flat or go up? And what's your view on the OEM side of the inventory equation?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. Our channel inventory has been pretty flat from a days perspective, so it's kind of tracked -- it's tracked our revenue numbers; been pretty flat around 15 total days for the company, plus or minus a couple, quarter-by-quarter for the last 4 quarters. And essentially we've again had short lead times. The distributors are quite confident they can get parts very rapidly, so they haven't been stockpiling parts nor have they been necessarily overly leaned out with respect to Xilinx. I can't speak for other lines that they're carrying. So for me, the inventory number isn't particularly a concern. Inventory at customers, we -- throughout the December quarter, we definitely had an increase of pull-ins by customers, meaning numbers of customers who were asking us to pull things in, which is a good sign that they have leaned up their inventory and they need things. These are all sizes of customers. I did point out that the last 2 weeks we had unexpected labels from large communication customers. One more in addition to our distribution customers. So to me, that's a good sign that we are bouncing along the bottom because while we still have some push-outs and reschedules, we also have some pull-ins. So it feels to me like that inventory at customers has worked its way through, for the most part with some exceptions, and we're now kind of more, I'll call it, hand-to-mouth, depending on what their end demand is.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ruben Roy with Mizuho Securities.", "Ruben Roy - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Moshe, I have a question on the 28-nanometer products and the comments around $10 million in revenue through the April to June quarter. If you think about the ramp and how you guys were thinking about 28-nanometer maybe 6 months ago or even last year at your Analyst Day, would you say that the revenue ramp is moving in line with your expectations? Or do you think the macro -- the challenging macro has had some impact and perhaps some delays in some of the programs that you had won? And if so, do you think that there will be potentially an inflection point or a step function increase in 28-nanometer revenue later this year?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "So that's another great question. So intuitively, it feels that it's happening more or less a quarter later than we had expected. Part of those are issues in the market, part of those are making sure that the products are fully qualified. As we have this scalable architecture and now that we have the first product basically having gone through -- both the processes qualified, that's happened a long time ago at TSMC and now the product is qualified to extend, that enables us to apply the pedal to the metal in terms of getting all of the other products out in an accelerated mode. And I do believe that, that will enable faster growth from this point on. And so the numbers we've projected are just the beginning of what we consider to be a significant ramp. And given that we have 5 product families, 4 of which already are sampling and the fifth is actually the simplest one, which already actually has been demonstrated, it's a subset of the previous ones, we feel very, very, very confident in our ability to bring this to market. And we do expect it to accelerate. Now the different products do tend to have different profiles and because we've started with the midrange product, which is Kintex, and we're now moving, and the Virtex product is catching up with that, that should provide some acceleration, too, because that tends to have a much higher ASP as does the SSIT, which was one of the questions we were asked about previously. So I know this is a supposed answer, but the answer -- if you summarize all of that, it should grow very rapidly through the second half of the year due to the breadth of the product offering.", "Ruben Roy - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "And just quickly around Zynq and given that you've got some early returns from customers, would you say that the initial activity is in areas that would be incremental to the FPGA TAM? Or how are design wins working out? Is it kind of FPGA late replacement sockets or new sockets that you wouldn't traditionally hit?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "So the markets we're addressing definitely -- we have tens of thousands of customers in nearly every market. So this is less opening a new market, but it enables us to significantly increase our penetration into markets which are not necessarily FPGA-centric. And an example on Zynq, which was targeted at 3 general markets: automotive, ISM and to a lesser degree, communications, we're seeing a totally new set of applications in automotive, for example, where truthfully, our percentage of the BOM before would be minuscule, and the percentage of the BOM now or the bill of materials is very, very significant. So no, it basically enables us to replace the solutions which used external processors, external DSPs, external analog mixed signal capabilities and external FPGAs to -- so it is a market expansion because it is -- it does have an FPGA element, there is an element of FPGA design, the tools we are providing to enable a larger, less skilled set of customers will be the key to enabling us to address that larger market in terms of designers, and that will enable us to reach a larger TAM.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.", "Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "It seems that both Altera and Xilinx are doing FPGA and microprocessor integrations, and it's not clear to me what the difference is, and I'm hoping that you can help me understand what's the difference between what you guys are doing, what your competition is doing.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Okay. Well, we've been focused on this area for a very, very, very long time, and you can check comments made by the competitor on this area as to when they got into it. As a result, we believe we have customer engagements for years now that are now reaching fruition, and we have a very, very significant time-to-market advantage. At this point in time, what we see from the competition is very early and if we compare it, it's probably equivalent to things which we showed customers over 2 years ago. And so we feel very comfortable with our product offering. We were there first. We have a very broad product offering. We have sampled, it works. It's in customer systems. The customer systems are working. We feel very good at our -- with our competitive position. We obviously need to continue running, right, because if you stop running, then the competition will catch up, but we definitely have a very significant early lead there.", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, Mark, one more thing. I don't think we can actually say much about their products since it only exists on the paper and a block diagram, which happens to look close to silicon block diagram, looks very close to our block diagram. But there isn't any unit out there, there isn't any evaluation boards out there that I'm aware of, and so it's hard to know exactly what they will do with it. And I think, as you know, it isn't just about a piece of silicon, it's around all the software ecosystem, et cetera, that you build around a processor subsystem. And as Moshe said, we've been working on this for quite a few years and with real customers engaging on this. So it's actually difficult to make a real competitive comparison at this juncture.", "Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. Can you just say what are the biggest end-market applications?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "They are automotive, industrial and communications.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.", "Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "When your sales started to pick up towards the end of the year and into this year, what did your customers say or distributors say as to the reason that they were ordering more? Was it that their demand was better or was it just that they'd kind of gone through the inventory burn phase, and they were taking some up or a little of both?", "Jon A. Olson", "I would say it's about 50/50, based on what I can tell. So I tried to go through the end markets and the customers because I was trying to understand that and get people to explain that to me as well. And the best information I have today from the distribution side were it's just a lot of different customers involved in it. It's really kind of been a little of both. The networking side, et cetera, I don't have as clear of an answer on that question.", "Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then just as a follow up on, it sounds like things are bottoming here. You guys have plenty of cash. I'm just curious as to why not get a little more aggressive on the buyback?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. Well, this is an annual process that we go through in our discussions with the board, and we certainly will be discussing all of the alternatives. As we have been committed historically to both and we continue to be committed to both dividends and cash repurchases, so I think you can expect us to continue to look at both of those as opportunities.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities.", "Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Jon, you talked about, last time, a program in defense. I'm just wondering if you can quantify it and also said that it's not going to go away, at least this quarter. I'm just wondering when it goes away.", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, there are 2 things going on in defense for next quarter. There is some last time buy which is, I'll say, a relatively small portion in terms of billions of dollars, really small, if you will, but it's just needing some additional -- some parts, I guess, the last time buy program that we have. The bigger growth is really this new buy for a relatively new program or I should say an increase in the program of one of the defense contractors. So that's really where the biggest growth amount is coming from. Overall, if you look overall at the last time buy from this fab line obsolescence thing that we have  going, it's a very small increase overall for the company next quarter, and it remains kind of in this low-single digit bouncing around tolerance band of revenue. It was last quarter and it will for the next 3 or 4 quarters. So we're not really getting a lot incremental is what I'm trying to tell you from the last time buy.", "Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And then just one clarification. On the enterprise side, you said that, that business grew in December quarter. Just wondering if you think that is just demand being a little better? And also if you could give us what's your expectation for that market is in Q1, that would be great. I mean, I'm talking the March quarter.", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, well, I would read that as a positive sign for us in the network area from the standpoint of just the overall ordering patterns have been low and choppy, and I think the increase was a positive sign relative to what's going on in the potential IT spend area going into the new year, so our least expectation is that people are going to continue to buy equipment, so I think that's a pretty good sign.", "Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And your expectation is that it will grow in Q1?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. Again, that's back to my answer to one of the earlier questions. I think wireline is still pretty choppy, and it's not clear to me that it's sustainable yet.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo.", "David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "A couple of clarifications on what you said about 40, 45-nanometers. If I understand, you said you want to close in on 50% share at this node. But that includes your low-end product on 40, 45, so you would have lower than 50% market share at the high-end product, is that correct? And can you also give us some sense of what percentage your 40, 45-nanometer reps now at high end versus low end?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "So traditionally, the high end has been 2/3 of the market, and the high volume or lower end has been 1/3. And what we expect is for the sum of those to enable us to get to 50%, and part of that is driven by the fact that there is no competitive -- significant competitive product at the 45-nanometer node that we're competing with. So we think we'll have pretty plain sailing and we have a lot of high volume but more lower ASP design wins there, which benefit from what is a very strong profile in terms of low cost and actually very low power, too. And that would be our projection. It requires acceleration of our growth because we're definitely starting from behind these families. We're several months behind the competition, which did a good job and came out first, which is by the way why we made sure that at 28-nanometer that did not repeat and if anything, we feel we're well ahead on 28-nanometer.", "Jon A. Olson", "We didn't really comment on the components. We're not going to, but the 45-nanometer, our high-volume product, didn't grow as well quarter-to-quarter and as well as the high volume and we said there was 20% growth for that category quarter-to-quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sujee De Silva.", "Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division", "Maybe can you try to, from your anecdotal conversations, handicap the likelihood of wireless infrastructure spending snaps back some time in 2012 or can it stay at this low level?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Well, my position is that it can't basically because in Palo Alto, I can't get cell coverage, right? And then in China, which I was there last week, it used to have pretty good cell coverage and now seeing a lot of dropped calls in China, and this is based on one person's anecdotal information. I fundamentally believe that what is happening is there's a gross mismatch between the infrastructure and the consumer purchases, and that this will sooner or later generate a huge problem that will need to be addressed. And if you look at North America, the big carriers are trying to address this by limiting bandwidth, throttling back. There's a whole host of techniques that are being used. But at the end of the day, the number of smart cellphones is growing at such a fast rate that, in my mind, it's going to totally overwhelm the system. Having -- and this is not a North America-only phenomenon. It's clearly happening in China, too, in a big way as the number of smartphones is growing at a very rapid rate, and we expect it to have worldwide ramification. So I just don't see how you can go through another year of not investing in bandwidth unless there's a year of not selling cellphones, right? It's just at an imbalance already at this point and it's getting worse. And the number of applications and the usage models are just more and more bandwidth-intensive. So I don't think it's sustainable and it will happen. It will happen in different rates where it's driven by government mandate as opposed to where it's driven maybe only by commercial interests, but I think in both cases, there's absolutely a huge demand.", "Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division", "And then on 28-nanometer, thanks for giving us the $10 million forecast. I imagine that's concentrated around the Kintex and Virtex products initially. A year out, will that be spread between the 5 product families or still concentrated among one or two 28-nanometer families?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "It will be spread for sure on all 5, but it won't be evenly spread on all 5. I would expect Kintex and Virtex to be the 2 largest ones, then SSIT to be the third and then Zynq and Altix to be the fourth. And there's just an intuitive response as to how it's expected to be. And some of the significant growth in Kintex is driven by the fact that we believe it has sustainable competitive advantage in the midrange, particularly for wireless applications.", "Rick Muscha", "Well, thanks for joining us today.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.", "Rick Muscha", "Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We'll provide a financial and business review of the March quarter, and then we'll open the call for questions.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available, and that actual results may differ materially.", "We refer you to the documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.  This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website. Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.", "Jon A. Olson", "Thank you, Rick. Fiscal year 2012 was marked by challenging industry conditions. In spite of these, Xilinx introduced a record number of 28-nanometer products, gained market share on the 40-nanometer node and reported record operating cash flow of $827 million. Additionally, cost reduction efforts of the company contributed to gross margin improvement in each consecutive quarter of the year, enabling Xilinx to report a record gross margin of 66.4% in the March quarter.", "Turning to the March quarter, Xilinx sales were $559 million, up 9% sequentially and down 5% from the same quarter a year ago. This was better than our guidance heading into the quarter, primarily due to better-than-expected business from wireless communications customers deploying LTE and 3D technology, as well as a strong rebound across-the-board in the Industrial and Other category. Consumer & Automotive also posted better-than-expected strength due to exceptionally strong Automotive business across a broad base of customers and a better-than-expected growth from audio and video broadcast.", "Gross margin was a record of 66.4%, up from 65.8% in the prior quarter, driven in part by a more favorable customer and product mix, but also cost reduction efforts driven by the company, including better-than-expected yield improvement on newer products and better inventory supply chain management.", "Operating expenses were $208 million, only $1 million dollars higher than guided, as we were able to offset higher variable with expense management efforts. Operating margin was 29.1%, up from 26.8% in the prior quarter.", "New product sales were up 11% sequentially. Sales increases from our 28-, 40-, 45-nanometer and 65-nanometer products, all contributed to this increase. Mainstream products declined 4% and base products increased 21% sequentially or $24 million. The increase associated with last time buy products was about $18 million or approximately 3% of total revenue in Q4.", "Let me now turn to a discussion of end markets. Communication sales increased 5% sequentially, driven by wireless sales, which increased double-digits during the quarter while wired sales were essentially flat. The Industrial and Other category posted the strongest sequential sales growth during the quarter, increasing 18% sequentially, with all secondary markets increasing double-digits. Consumer & Automotive sales increased 9% sequentially driven by strength from audio/video broadcast and automotive, while pure-play consumer applications were flat. Lastly, data processing sales decreased as anticipated, driven by weaker storage sales.", "Net income for the quarter was $134 million or $0.49 per diluted share. Other income and expense was a net expense of $7.1 million, better than guided due primarily to higher-than-anticipated gains associated with our investment portfolio and a non-U.S. investment credit. Operating cash flow for the March quarter was $208 million before $20 million in CapEx. We paid $50 million in cash dividend during the quarter, and recently raised our quarterly dividend $0.03 per share to 22% -- $0.22 per share per quarter.", "The tax rate in the March quarter was 14%. Diluted shares for the quarter were 276 million. There was a 7.7 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes due to an increase in the average stock price during the quarter. For questions related to the dilution associated with our convertibles, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com.", "Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased $175 million to approximately $3.1 billion. We have approximately $1.3 billion in convertible debt and our net cash position is approximately $1.8 billion. Days sales outstanding decreased 3 days in the March quarter to 35 days. Inventory dollars at Xilinx declined by $41 million sequentially during the quarter. Combined inventory days at Xilinx, distribution were 110, down significantly as expected from 142 days in the prior quarter. In the June quarter, we expect both dollars and days of inventory to slightly decline as we continue to align the appropriate supply with demand trend.", "Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the June quarter of fiscal year '13. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up sequentially. We are expecting strong growth from our 28-nanometer and 40-, 45-nanometer product families. From an end market perspective, we are expecting sales from Communications to be up sequentially, with increases in both wired and wireless. We expect sales from Industrial and Other to be approximately flat sequentially, as increases in industrial, scientific and medical are offset by a decrease from defense. Consumer & Automotive is expected to be approximately flat, as increases in automotive are offset by a decrease in audio/video broadcast. Lastly, we expect data processing sales to increase sequentially. We expect last time buy sales to decline by about $5 million sequentially.", "As a result, we are expecting total sales to be up 1% to up 5% sequentially, with sales from Asia Pacific expected to increase, sales from Europe expected to be approximately flat and sales from the U.S. and Japan expected to be down. And the midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 55%.", "Gross margin is expected to be between 65% and 66%, slightly lower than the March quarter due to strong growth expectations from our 40-, 45-nanometer and 28-nanometer products. Operating expenses in the June quarter are expected to be approximately $220 million, including approximately $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. The majority of the growth in spending compared with the March quarter is in R&D and related to the 28-nanometer ramp, as our tape-out activity remains high.", "There's also some growth in our SG&A related primarily to variable spending increases as a result of higher revenue and also higher legal expenses. Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $8 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 277 million shares. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 16%. This number excludes the impact of the R&D tax credit which has expired. Our estimate of the impact if reinstated in its current form, would lower the tax rate by approximately 1.5%.", "Let me now let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. Sales increased over 9% sequentially in the March quarter, driven by double-digit increases from 6 of our secondary end market segments. This broad-based strength gives me confidence to us seeing a recovery in our business. Sales from new products, including our 28-nanometer and 40-, 45-nanometer families, drove growth during the quarter. With regard specifically to the 40-, 45-nanometer product family, revenue grew approximately 70% in fiscal year '12 over the previous year. This significant growth has allowed us to greatly improve our market share position in this node. Although this product generation will likely be much smaller over its lifetime than the 28-nanometer node, our share gains clearly indicate strong customer acceptance for these products. With regards to 28-nanometer, our sales during the quarter was driven by Kintex-7, the industry's first 28-nanometer FPGA family; and Virtex-7, including our stacked silicon interconnect technology, the industry's first 3D IC product with 2 million logic sales. 28-nanometer product family rollout continues at a rapid pace and will, without question, be the most successful node in the company's history. ", "In the March quarter, we achieved 2 significant milestones. First, we announced the transition to the production phase of the Kintex K325T FPGA. This has accelerated our ability to serve the demand created by the outstanding acceptance of 7 Series FPGA product family. We also began shipping Virtex-7 690T FPGA from our high-performance Virtex family. This device establishes a new benchmark for single-chip, serial bandwidth and is very well suited to address the market requirements of high-performance wired communications applications that require lower power, single-chip solutions.", "The 28-nanometer design win momentum continues to be outstanding. Now totaling more than 650, the total value of over $2 billion. Approximately 1/2 of the designs we have in the Communications end market are actually replacing ASIC or ASSP business, providing further testament to the acceleration of the programmable imperative. We've grown PLD market share for the past 5 quarters. The improvement in shares is a testimonial to the work over the past few years to deliver the most innovative, differentiated and highest value product portfolio. In addition, yesterday, we announced the delivery of the final, broad and very significant element of our indisputable technology leadership strategy.", "The Vivado Design Suite allows us to break away from the competition in productivity and enables the highest leverage of our next-generation product portfolio. Vivado is an IP and system-centric design environment built from the ground up to the next decade of what Xilinx calls, All-Programmable Devices. These devices go beyond programmable logic and I/O to enable programmable systems integration, leveraging various components of 3D stacked silicon interconnect technology, ARM-based embedded systems, Analog Mixed Signal, advanced high-speed serial transceivers, and a growing percentage of IP cores.  The Vivado Design Suite is estimated to provide customers with up to a 4x productivity advantage over last generation development environments. Truly a revolutionary achievement. I cannot overstate how essential this is to enabling broad access for our customers to our leading-edge technology and for enabling accelerated revenue growth of 28-nanometer node. ", "In summary, I believe our all-in investment strategy is paying off. We have shipped parts from 4 of the 5 28-nanometer product families to more than 120 customers, demonstrating its broad acceptance. We're expecting 28-nanometer sales to exceed $10 million in the June quarter. We'll continue to execute the aggressive rollout plan.", "With continuously increasing market share, execution on the indisputable market-leading 28-nanometer portfolio, now and another breakout move in design productivity with Vivado, fiscal year '13 promises to be an incredibly exciting year for us. Let me now turn the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura System.", "Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "It's Romit Shah from Nomura. The results look pretty solid. I had a question on industrial. Is it fair to characterize the strength in this segment as largely driven by market share?", "Jon A. Olson", "Well, I wouldn't necessarily attribute it entirely to market share or even primarily to market share. I think what's happening out in the market, there is both a replenishment of inventory cycle that's going on but also sell-throughs. So we wouldn't have seen the -- I would say the overall strength in broad-based industrial or its scientific and medical applications, as well test and measurement, if there really wasn't a good pull-through going all the way. And while I do believe we are getting a lot of traction in the 40-, 45-nanometer area, and it's still very early on the 28-nanometer, we do think that was part of what contributed to share. But I don't want to say it's -- that's the only reason.", "Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Then what changes in Q2 -- because I noticed that you're guiding that segment flat.", "Jon A. Olson", "Well, the biggest issue there is because of defense. So we had a defense program or 2 that was kicking in, in this past quarter in the March quarter. And so that caused our defense business to be higher. And so what's happening in the June quarter is that's coming back down. So in other words, the lumpy kind of a project acquisition from a defense perspective project, and the remainder of the industrial segment will continue -- continues to grow. So that's the balance that's going on, one piece going down, the other 2 pieces going up, but it ends up approximately flat.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from the Bank of Montreal.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Moshe, I'm sure, this is topmost in everybody's mind. There is variance between yourself and Altera, but this time, it's very big. I'm just trying to understand your -- just give us your perspective please, if I look at revenues, look at inventory and we do understand that you guys have a better kind of more diverse foundry relationship that allows you to step aside or at least mitigate some of the impact that we're hearing other companies talk about. And then my follow-through for you, Jon. On the margin front, are we ready to break out of the band that you guys have laid out for us? Because it sounds like STSM becomes a bigger mix and then as yields improve in 40, 45, shouldn't we be headed North of the stated trajectory?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Okay. So we can't really comment on what other people are seeing. We're seeing strong demand from the customers. We feel we have an incredibly strong portfolio, which after 4.5 years of building up is starting to demonstrate its strength. And this is now very, very broad. And the significant impacts of that are yet to come because this is mostly in 28-nanometer, and that's why we're projecting the $10 million for this upcoming quarter and we've, I think done a good job in meeting the customers' requirements. We believe that the technology choices we have made have high yields, enable the customers to get lower power and generally, higher performance across the board, and that should manifest itself. So from my perspective, the best is yet to come.", "Jon A. Olson", "I just want to add a little bit to that before I get to your margin question. If you look at what we've said going into this quarter and certainly, the way it ended up and when we're talking about next quarter, I mean, the recovery is well underway. I mean, it wasn't underway this past quarter. And we had 6 of our 10 sub-markets grew double digits, 7 of our 10 grow in absolute percentage. So that's not just a one-trick-pony kind of an adjustment situation for us. So we definitely feel, and Moshe pointed out in his remarks, that the recoveries underway and work through the first quarter and go again in the second quarter of it. So we do feel business overall, spending overall by companies is continuing to grow. I'm always a conservative guy. There's not snapback going on but there certainly -- it's -- we feel a lot more steady demand from our customers. So we're feeling pretty good. And from an inventory perspective, we do have some variety in our foundry partners. But on the other hand, we seem to be getting what we need to have even though in some places, it is tight, we were getting what we need to have from our foundry partners in order to meet customer demand. So I'm -- another example of what that means is our lead times are essentially up to normal standard. There's no extension going on, on any lead times anywhere. So we have ample inventory in order to serve our customers and we're getting support from foundries at that level. ", "From a margin perspective, yes, I anticipate this question being asked about 3 times today. Well, geez, why not improve your model? Well, the -- it's a difficult thing to forecast because mix is always a component of that. We had slightly lower top 50 customer contribution than the previous couple of quarters, 5 percentage point or 2. So there's a customer mix that tends to drive our -- to drive it a little bit better. We are very pleased with where we are with the yields right now, and I did say in the Analyst Day that once we got through the, I'll say, massive tape-out and introduction phase, if this route is -- this trajectory really holds is that we should flow that up to the top of the range or above. We just kind of got there really fast. And even though next quarter is -- we're still modifying that to say it's going to be near the top end of the range, 65% to 66%, we are very positive that we can operate at the high-end of that range given the dynamics, the way they are. So basically, I'm not ready to raise it. We'll see how things go.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Our next question comes from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering if you'd comment on the kind of progress and the recovery in the communications vertical, specifically. You talked about wireless and wireline, both seeing strong improvement. Can you discuss any kind of differential in the wireless coming back faster than wireline or the reverse? And then maybe any kind of color by geography will be helpful.", "Jon A. Olson", "Sure. Let me take that one. So in the March quarter, it's driven primarily by wireless. So -- and if you also saw there, our European geographic segment was up. So -- and we talked -- and I talked in my remarks about LTE and 3G. So we feel like the activity going on in a worldwide basis x the Chinese manufacturers are actually going pretty well. And while I'm not necessarily saying that all the LTE providers in the U.S. are in a massive capital spend, they are -- we do believe that capital spend is going up and I think we've heard T-Mobile come out and say they're going to be doing some things in LTE. And so we are seeing a -- I'll say a nice support there relative to advanced technologies. And we happen to be tied strongly to one of the manufacturers of base stations that seems to be doing really well even on a worldwide basis. So that works out pretty well for us. So we definitely, in March, saw more of the strength in wireless than wired. Now if you take -- go back and look at December to March, our wired went up and we were concerned that we wouldn't be able to hold that. And we actually did hold that in this quarter. So it was flat. And now we're seeing both are going up, and what we're really seeing there is continued strength in the -- again, in the general LTE and 3G worldwide situation in addition to the fact, that we do see a network spend in terms of the network side of our wired business improving in the quarter. And it's actually fairly broad-based across several customers of the major guys. It isn't just one person popping up. So we are starting to see some spending going on, and we feel pretty good about where our position is in serving that capital spend that's going on.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "That's very helpful. And then maybe could you comment a little bit on the strength you're seeing in Europe outside of your largest wireless customer? Is that all the increased you saw of 27% in the quarter or was there strength beyond that as well?", "Jon A. Olson", "No, there was really quite a bit of strength that of -- in the industrial category. In fact, between industrial and Communications, it was a very big pop for us there. So it was much broader than that. I know there's a lot being said about the economy in Europe not being all that well, but we're actually seeing customers really engaged with rolling out with new products, their products. So all that has been really, really positive to us and we're obviously hopeful that, that continues. And no, it was not just a wireless play in Europe.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS.", "Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Let me just ask you a bit on the wired part of the business. So, Jon, you said you expect that to grow next quarter. Any comments you can make as to what you're seeing between service providers and enterprise? And I asked that because some of the comments coming out of the enterprise companies during this earnings season has been kind of mixed in terms how things are playing out now. So any comments you can make there would be helpful.", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, I think on the wired side going forward, it is -- there are several customers that I think have been pretty lean on inventory and is starting to build that inventory, and that's helping us even though I'm aware that their specific announcements haven't been all that great. But our design wins have been increasing there over the last few years in, I'll say, nontraditional FPGA areas and some of those designs are starting to kick in, particularly and we noted our 40-, 45-nanometer product family growing. We talked about that in the Analyst Day about how we thought that was going to be an increasing market share as we add designs taking off. And that in fact, is part of what's driving that for us in the wired, not solely, but part of what's going on there. And it is a more positive enterprise view than we had in the past quarter. So we are counting on the enterprise side of that being a leader in that growth in June.", "Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Right. That's great. And just to finish up on -- do you have any 10% customers you want to mention to us? And I have a question for Moshe, for the quarter.", "Jon A. Olson", "We have no 10% customers for the quarter or the year.", "Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. Moshe, let me just ask you about the issues on 28-nanometer that TSMC has talked about. Obviously, you're not a high-volume customer yet of 28. But what is your take as to what that does in Europe for your ability to ramp in volume? Is that something that concerns you at this stage or not?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "So Dr. Morris Chang gave a presentation at the TSMC technical conference and talked about challenges they have and, to a large extent, said that the worst was behind them. We were there first, picked out first, got product first, moved into production first, and we have the benefit of HPL, which has less process steps and probably is a tad less challenging. So it may be that, that is what is helping us through this. We don't have any HP or LP, and so far, so good. And you are right in pointing out that the numbers are very low at this point. But they're going to ramp up significantly in this quarter and the quarter we're in and the quarters going forward. So we watched this with -- very closely and we believe that our relationship is helping but more than anything else, it's the choice of the HPL process and being there first may have given us some benefits, which others may not have seen. Other than that, it's all conjecture on my part.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.", "Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I guess maybe an extension to that question, which is to the extent there is any lack of availability of 28-nanometer wafers, not making a statement here about yield, is it possible that the 40-nanometer node may, in fact, play out a little bit longer? And might that not, at this stage, of 40-nanometer be a benefit for value because you guys are coming off your worst point of 40-nanometer share and are showing some signs of share gain there?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "No -- well, as you know, in 40-nanometer, we have relationship with UMC has worked generally well for us at that note in terms of technology availability. In terms of 28, it just provides such huge benefits in terms of much low power, increased performance, increased functionality and we have a much broader portfolio at 28 than we had at 40 and 45 node. So even though -- if you're asking for us to stack things, we don't see these issues at 40 at all. We do have the unique position there. So maybe that is helping us. And the 28 so far, we have not seen any challenges. It is, as Jon pointed out, very, very tight. And again, possible selection of HPL in addition to the product benefits maybe helped in terms of maturity yield, et cetera. But we really don't know. So we're a little puzzled as to those issues ourselves.", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. I mean, I think that there's a lot been talked about relative to that from a couple of other companies and we have -- quite frankly, I've been scratching our head a little bit about the scenario that has been talked about. But nonetheless, and one of your premises there was that 40, might last longer because of this. I don't view any of the conversation with 28-nanometer suggesting it's including long-term capacity constraints or whatever. I'm certainly not thinking that, and we are very strongly supportive of growing our 28-nanometer as fast as possible. It's just -- again what we've been talking about has been our strength. So I think Moshe characterized it right. I mean, we've got some differences of what process we're using. It has different characteristics to it and maybe that has something to do with it. And we were very early with lots of tape-outs, and so I think we have a very broad portfolio that's been sampled and that may have helped us put some level of a number of wafers through the system, et cetera. I don't know because we've been at this with a lot of different parts for quite a few quarters now.", "Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Can I just ask as a follow-up, if I look at the quarter-on-quarter progression, I think someone else said that there have been gaps between yourself and your primary competitor. Obviously, this quarter's gap noticeable and I think if you normalized their results for some changes at the end of the quarter, you're gaining share this quarter and next. Is there any -- can you help us figure out where that share gain is coming from, from an end market perspective and also maybe from a geographic perspective if you can do that?", "Jon A. Olson", "Well, I think wireless is clearly one of those distinctions because the China market has not really been strong from a TD perspective. And that might be where we're weaker on a market share basis in the wideband CDMA portion of 3G and then LTE, where we have tremendous strength. So I think you're seeing a technology -- a manufacturer and technology gains going on that favor us quite a bit. And I think that's -- in the wireless space, I think that is what's -- the biggest differential is who we're partnering with the closest and what geographies that those customers are serving and where the strengths are right now on the wireless capital spend space. So we feel that, that's part of our driver. I don't -- I cannot explain the industrial side. We've seen extremely strong growth there. As I said very broadly, our customers are doing well. We've got parts for them. So I don't -- I don't know why we would have a different characteristics than our competitor. But we do, apparently. And geographically on the industrial side, all geographies grew for us there. So we had -- again, worldwide strength, not just one geography or one subsegment in one geography, et cetera. So the recoveries here and next quarter is the second -- the second quarter of it and we're moving along.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla with William Blair.", "Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Digging a little bit deeper into the wireless 4G solutions that you talked about, are you gaining access in new content on these 4G LTE base stations or is it basically more of the same functions?", "Jon A. Olson", "Oh, no, we've been progressively increasing content so 3G to LTE is kind of a 2x factor for us in terms of penetration. So when we're off selling parts that end up in the LTE space, we end up selling a lot of parts. So to the extent that the CapEx, worldwide CapEx, spending in wireless is favoring the most advanced technology that favors PLDs, frankly. So that's helped us a lot.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "We've got the trend now for 3 generations. So with each generation of product, the amount of FPGAs used or the percentage of the system, which is implemented in the FPGA has grown significantly consistently and we see that continuing for a whole host of reasons.", "Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Right. So Moshe, if I look at the architecture, are you going closer to the edge of the network? Or the content increase is more in the core perhaps?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "It's primarily in the core and there's a huge deficit in terms of wireless infrastructure which is getting aggravated by this huge growth on the smartphone market, where the demands are just unbelievable. And this is well documented. There's a huge issue there. And it requires these upgrade to this new standard because the usage model is now totally different. So we see that continuing, and when we talk to our key customers in each of these areas, they don't see it slowing down. If anything, they see it accelerating  generation-on-generation right now. Obviously, there are pricing pressures, et cetera, but it -- in terms of a need, that umbrella need is growing for what we call insatiable, intelligent bandwidths. And the intelligent in the wireless side comes from the smartphones.", "Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Great. And one of the biggest concerns that's been voiced about you guys was about the single architecture in 28-nanometers. You already got traction. Seems like you're getting good traction. How would you debunk or -- how are customers embracing your 28-nanometers and whether that issue which was brought up with single architecture versus designing for the low mid-high, I mean is that -- do you think it's...", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Yes, so we obviously did a terrible job in explaining what we're doing. So we -- it's true we have a single manufacturing process. That's absolutely true, which is HPL. We think that, that was at the core of the success because it's actually a high-performance, yet low-power process. So it actually enables us to span the product families. Now what we have is a scalable, optimized architecture with -- at the high-end, it's optimized for performance. In the midrange, it's -- which is Kintex, it absolutely has an unbelievably well-matched performance power footprint, which we believe is a huge differentiator vis-\u00e0-vis what the competition has, which use LP process there and typically, does not have enough performance. At the low end, the -- it was optimized for a lowest power and the lowest cost, and the fact -- they are fixing that. I can tell you that if there's one decision that not only would I never change but I -- if I could have done it on the 40- and 45-nanometer node, this is the decision. Right? And so if it -- if we have failed to explain the benefits of it, shame on us. But the customers are thrilled with it, and if you look at the product definition and what the customers can achieve, at the high-end, it's higher performance and higher capacity than the competition and higher bandwidth. In the midrange, it absolutely hits that performance power cost trade-off, which is not easy to achieve. But we think we've hit it and we think that the competition missed in a big way there. And at the low end, we've already rolled out the Zynq offering, which shows the Artix fabric, and the results are great, it's functional and part of our fast rollout and being first to market with the breadth of product is due to having the same manufacturing process but having highly differentiated [Audio Gap] ", "so if we failed to explain that they are optimized for the 3 points, we did a great injustice. But they are optimized, and if you go to the customers, just ask them what they see. We have the highest performance, we have the best trade-off in the middle, and we also have a low-cost, low-power version, which we think is second to none. So we're delighted with where we are. And again, I would never -- not change this and you can guess that to the extent that these options are available in the future, we're very likely to go the same way.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "John Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Yes, I apologize for the technical difficulty earlier. Just a couple of questions. Jon, if I've got -- remember my  numbers correctly from the Analyst Day earlier in the year, you guys kind of talked about growth rates by segments and I think you mentioned industrial is kind of being a 6% longer-term grower. And I guess my question is given that industrial is now is effectively flat with the kind of the peak you saw back in June '11, that is holding up a lot better than the rest of the business, do we have to rethink kind of the longer-term growth opportunity in that market? And if it is a better grower, what are the margin implications? And then I have a follow-up for Moshe.", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, so John, yes. What we have to be a little careful about in having one new data point from the Analyst Day and then try to extrapolate it. So I agree with you that industrial is -- has been stronger. But remember, some of this growth has been inventory replenishment.", "So that's got some part to do that -- to do with that. And I think our statement around the industrial growth rates during that time frame was one of the areas we were confident that we're going to grow quite a bit on, is with our Zynq product it's just going to take a while for that to kick in and have more significant growth. And the industrial category just take a longer time period. So I'm very bullish on the industrial over the long haul, it's just that we modified the industrial category a little bit, and I think it was mostly because of where we thought the defense spending was going more than anything else, and not the broad-based industrial and scientific and medical area.", "John Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And, Jon, to the extent that, that does grow faster, do you think that margin accretive or is too difficult to tell given the mix?", "Jon A. Olson", "It's generally margin accretive but to the extent we might be putting -- pitting Zynq against ASSPs, it's not clear yet to us.", "John Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Got it. And then -- Moshe, just quickly, on 28-nanometer, just given the absolute dollar amount, it's kind of meaningless to talk about end market breakdown today. But if you think about design activity and which end markets are doing the most activity there, if you think about a 4-quarter aggregate number, how do we think about 28 by end market?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "So the fastest out of the shoot is wireless, and that's why we chose to focus on Kintex because truthfully, we did not have the best solution in the previous generation, and we let the competition win more than we did at wireless in the previous generation of products. Now we expect to reverse that with a vengeance. And there's a lot of designs in there out the chute, really fast and that Kintex is the perfect solution for the wireless market. Then what we're seeing and we -- is now wired comms, in the -- all of the high-end, the prototyping market just benefiting from the higher capacity and higher throughput that there is on our Virtex 7 product as opposed to the competing product. And it is true that we started a little later there, but now that, that's moving ahead for us, we expect to not only catch-up but actually have a very significant lead in terms of market share over time on that. We just have higher capacity, have higher serial throughput. We actually have significantly lower power on the high-end, and that's where HPL is a major benefit. And so that should be the second out the chute and Zynq is obviously, starting that tends to be more markets like automotive and industrial that move little more slowly but the design wins are accumulating at a huge rate there, and we're very pleased with that. And then Artix will follow. Artix is -- there's elements which are targeted at some higher volume consumer-type applications, but it also has a whole host of other markets which will be addressed there. So that's sort of how we see the sequence and, to some extent, where the $10 million which were well underway to delivering this quarter is a function of all of those.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra with Baird.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Looking at your base product revenue of 21% in the quarter, that's the type of increase that's typically unsustainable. How much of this is just the result of inventory replenishment because of the shipping in previous quarters and then how should we look at this going forward?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, Tristan, so it was up 21% or $24 million in terms of the quantification because I just want to make sure that the percentage increase doesn't overweigh the fact that the increase was $24 million on our base of $559 million. And of that 24% increase, there was an increase in our last time buy category or products, which are reflected in the base, so about $18 million. So the remaining increase was related to defense programs, spending primarily as some of the legacy programs continue to take parts over time. So that, that is an up-and-down thing depending on when those programs decide to take part. So we don't believe the base is sustainable at an increasing -- in fact, they'll be fewer last time buy parts being sold next quarter and then in the September quarter, the last time buy program will be essentially over in that point. So I think base returns back to its normal decline by the September quarter.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And was there any unusual pricing in the quarter relative to some of your turns business?", "Jon A. Olson", "I'm not sure what's behind that question, but no, I mean, we don't have any spot pricing kinds of things that happen in those situations. If you look at our ASP trends, they were pretty normal and as expected. So I don't think there was anything there. I'm not really sure what you're asking, but I hope I answered it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Barclays.", "Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I was hoping to ask a market share question. If I look at your share versus Altera back at the trough in Q4 '10, and the guide for Q2, it was roughly about 500 bps uplift or around $50 million per quarter in terms of gains. And so curious on that, what percentage do you think is sustainable versus what do you think is more lumpy like defense or and/or end-of-life benefit?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "So there's quite a few elements, and that's a difficult question to answer. But end-of-life is something which is not a onetime event. It's part of the normal modus operandi in the semiconductor business. It tends to be challenging on the FPGA side because our product have very long product life cycles and the customers are in slow-moving markets. So we have a strategy which has a minimum of 12 years, and these end-of-lifes are actually at that point or are well beyond that. But it's something which is a sustainable part of the business. It's not a onetime event. It's not like taking a big ASIC deal at lower margin. It's sort of something which is really repeatable for us and we just sort of do that. And we have it mapped out and on our website, we actually have projections as to when to expect it going forward. So don't want you to sort of assume that there's some sleight-of-hand here. This is repeatable business going forward, and it's the way -- no, it's just due to the mismatch between fabs not having infinite lifetime at a given process node and our customers' requirement. And -- so that's the one element. The second element really, it's sort of difficult to look back and understand and to some extent, we're looking forward. And the reason for our bullishness is the strength of the 28-nanometer product portfolio. So there's 2 things we said. We believe that we're going to, over time, grow our market share at the 40-, 45-nanometer node, going forward to 50%. And obviously this quarter is a big leap from the mid-30s into the mid-40s, something like that. And the reason that we're positive on that is we have a broader product offering, which is now catching on. We definitely were later, and we paid the price for that. And -- but you're now catching up and a lot of that is the spot-and-fixed product, which basically -- we're there and to the best of our knowledge, there's no one with a significant FPGA low-end portfolio at the 45-nanometer. And that helps a whole host of markets, and that will help us over time grow between Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 that we continue to be -- to expect that to grow to 50%, as those products are now moving into production. Having said all of that, the real exciting thing is the 28-nanometer, the quality of the product offering, its position. And that -- if you look at the markets that have the biggest benefit there, as I mentioned before, short-term, it's wireless. But then, wired at the high-end and actually eating into the ASIC and ASSP market is starting to happen in spades. That's why we made the comment that on the communication space, as we look at our design wins, about 50% of them are actually in competition with ASIC, and in some cases, ASSP products. And the reason that we're seeing that is those are becoming hideously expensive either for companies to design as ASICs or for ASSP companies to continue their roadmaps. So there is this inevitable exit in terms of wired communications. And if you look back as recently as 10 years ago, there are probably more than 90 companies in that space that has dropped to around 20 companies in that space. And even they're struggling except for the very big one, to provide forward-looking roadmaps. And that's, that's what the 28-nanometer enables us to address. So you asked a very large question, and I don't want to spend everyone's time here. But I would say that those are the major effects.", "Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Very helpful. I really appreciate it, Moshe. And, Jon, as a quick follow-up, cash -- net cash has grown out to A+ dollars. Curious how you think about dividends, stock buyback and what kind of cash level you really need to run the business.", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, so clearly, I think you see pretty broadly across many of the technology companies that cash has been growing and with the market being relatively hot there's probably some more reticence to do share repurchases than not. We've got our model that we do share purchases on in terms of strike prices and other ways of looking at it. We didn't repurchase any shares this last quarter but we're obviously, committed to purchase -- repurchase shares and we will adjust our model over time to do that. So I think you can count on us being in the market and repurchasing shares from time to time. And we are still very committed to growing the dividend on an annual basis on which we increased 16% growth in our dividend that we just announced for this current quarter. So it is -- it is definitely an issue, I know all in your minds and we're -- we continue to look at it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with BofA Merrill Lynch.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I have a question on the long-term R&D intensity for Xilinx. I think you had the 2 successive years of very high spending outpacing sales growth. And it's not just for Xilinx. I think it's for all the lenders. The cost and complexity is growing and I think the 20-nanometer transition, even though it's a few years again it's probably going to be more expensive. How do you look at the R&D trajectory from there? How do you manage it? How do you get more leverage in the model?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "So the way we look at it is we have a target and obviously, we're slightly above the target. In reality, that being slightly above is not due to overspending. There was expectation of revenue growth and since the market was a little soft, we tend to hit the high -- the top end numbers. But as we looked at it, we said okay, what do we do now? And we feel that the right thing to do is to exploit the very significant substantial edge we have on 28-nanometer because it's going to be a huge node for us. We have leadership in numerous aspects, now we have leadership on the software side too, which has the broadest applicability and that has the highest lever on growth, right? So we are big believers in that. Having said that, we're not taking that out of control. So we've given absolute numbers that we fully intend to respect and to live within those limitations. From generation to generation, we're actually becoming a lot more efficient and effective. What is happening is that the tape-out costs and the mass costs are going up significantly. And so when those happen en masse, as were they are happening now, as we're driving the products out so we can benefit from our portfolio, it generates a bit of an artificial bulge on our R&D costs. But the expectation is that, that will go down somewhat. If you look at our projected investment over the 2 years, it is where we said it would be. It's -- it was a little lower last fiscal year and it'll be a little higher this fiscal year than we had expected. But overall, the total number is actually less than we had urgently projected. And as we're working full steam on the 20-nanometer, we're just being a whole lot more effective and the design -- the products are being defined and hopefully designed in a way which should enable us to resume at that at that level. And it requires a lot more ingenuity and fiscal control and we're committed to doing that. So the question is valid one, and the answer is a lot of hard work in order to keep doing that. We don't intend to blow through with the numbers even though each product is more difficult and the mass cost for sure is significantly higher.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And perhaps more just something related and revisiting this issue of 28-nanometer availability. Obviously, this year is not as big for you guys from a revenue perspective on 28-nanometer. But as demand grows for 28-nanometer, are you looking at alternative supply sources just from a risk management perspective?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "If you were at the -- TSMC forum, they made it very clear that the worst is behind us at this point in time and they're continuing to invest and to bring up their capacity at 28 nanometers. So there -- our expectation is that, that will get resolved and actually, to a large extent, has been resolved from our perspective at this point. So now we have -- we're thrilled with our relationship with TSMC, and we continue to believe that, that was a great decision at 28.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie.", "Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research", "Yes, I was wondering if you could help us with our -- I had a couple of questions. One was mix and then another was on the last time buy. On the mix, could you share just what the dollar value of your 28-nanometer product was? And I was also curious what your mix in the March quarter was of defense and wireless comm?", "Jon A. Olson", "So no, we're not -- we haven't -- did not or not providing our 28-nanometer number. Revenue in the quarter more than doubled from the previous quarter and it's on track towards our -- hitting $10 million milestone that we have been talking about for a couple of quarters, which will happen in the June quarter. So the defense business did grow quarter-to-quarter. And traditionally, it's been in the neighborhood of 15% of our total revenue and it's still in that about that same level, maybe a tad more. And I'm sorry I missed the other mix question.", "Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research", "The wireless infrastructure as a percent of sales?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, wireless has been bouncing around a lot in -- the last time we gave a number, it was 25% but then there was a big cycle that went on, so it went down below 20% and it's moving its way back towards 25%, but still far away -- it's still, pretty -- got to ways to go there.", "Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then on the last time program buys, it sounds like this was a -- or you stated it was a normal part of your business but is there something unusual about what's happening with the $18 million that you're calling it out and is it the case that the remainder of it will completely fall off by September? Or is it something that will kind of inch down over the course of the year?", "Jon A. Olson", "No, we called it out because it is a significant -- it was a contribution where to the revenue growth, where -- there was a concentration, and I'll say, an abnormal increase in that category of products and base. And we thought it was important to call it out. And it will go down some in the June quarter and then totally fall off from that class of products. It's a very old, old products that we have in September. And so we've been running mid-single-digit percentage of that class of product, and it will -- like I said, it will decrease a little bit in September, and then -- excuse me, in June, it will drop off totally in September.", "Rick Muscha", "Thanks for joining us today. We have a playback of this call beginning at 5 p.m. Pacific Time and 8 p.m. Eastern Time today. For a copy of our earnings release, please visit our IR website. Our next earnings release date for the first quarter of fiscal year '13 will be Wednesday, July 18, after the market close.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.", "Rick Muscha", "Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We'll provide a financial and business review of the September quarter and then we'll open the call for questions.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially.", "We refer you to documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.", "This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.", "Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.", "Jon A. Olson", "Thank you, Rick. Xilinx sales were $544 million in the September quarter, down 7% sequentially but within our guidance towards the lower end of our guidance. Weaker-than-anticipated sales from industrial and A&D, as well as computer and data processing, more than offset better-than-expected sales from wireless communications.", "With the exception of Japan, which was flat, sales to all geographies were down sequentially. Turns were 57% for the quarter and relatively linear on a monthly basis. We continue to get the capacity we need from our foundry partners, and our lead times, with a few exceptions, are within normal ranges.", "Gross margin was 65.5%. This level is a testament to our focus on margin improvement projects across our product portfolio, with particular emphasis on new product margins, which offset significant impact from customer and product mix during the quarter.", "Operating expenses of $208 million were lower than expected as a result of the shift in tape-out activity, lower litigation expense and reduced discretionary spending. New product sales were up 7% sequentially, with strong growth from our 28-nanometer families while 40-nanometer sales were essentially flat.", "During the quarter, revenue from our 28-nanometer products achieved our goal, surpassing $20 million. Mainstream products increased 3% during the quarter, with strength from the Virtex-5 products, driven primarily by LTE deployment activity. Base products declined over 20% sequentially, with most of the decreases coming from industrial, defense and communications.", "Let me now turn to a discussion of end markets. Sales from communications in data center increased 3% sequentially, with strong wireless sales offsetting expected declines in wireline. Industrial and aerospace and defense sales declined 13% sequentially, with declines coming from all 3 subcategories: defense, industrial, scientific, medical and test measurement. Broadcast, consumer and automotive sales declined 15% sequentially, with sales from all categories flat to down sequentially.  The other category declined 24% sequentially, impacted by declines in computer and data processing, as well as storage.", "Net income for the quarter was $123 million or $0.46 per diluted share. Other income and expense was a net expense of $10 million, higher than anticipated due primarily to an unfavorable hedging impact. Operating cash flow for the June quarter was $197 million before $8 million in capital expenditures. We paid $57 million in cash dividends during the quarter and repurchased 2.5 million shares for $79 million.", "The tax rate during the quarter declined due to a shift in our geographic mix of profits. Our new effective tax rate is 15%. In addition to the lower tax rate estimate for the year, in Q2, we had a favorable impact to tax expense of $4 million associated with the release of reserves related to a recent tax court case. The impact of these 2 factors represent a positive contribution to EPS of approximately $0.03 per share.", "Diluted shares for the quarter were 270 million. There was a 5.5 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions related to the dilution associated with our convertibles, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com.", "Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased $61 million to approximately $3.2 billion. We have approximately $1.3 billion in convertible debt, and our net cash position is approximately $1.9 billion. Days sales outstanding decreased 3 days in the September quarter to 37 days.", "Inventory dollars at Xilinx increased as expected by $11 million sequentially during the quarter. Combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution were 109, up from 99 days in the prior quarter. We expect inventory days to slightly increase in the December quarter.", "Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the December quarter of fiscal year '13. Our backlog heading into the quarter is down sequentially. Additionally, we believe continued macroeconomic uncertainty may result in unpredictable customer ordering patterns. We expect continued growth in our new products but will most likely experience declines from our base and mainstream products.", "From an end market perspective, we expect communications to be down sequentially. Within communications, wireless is expected to decline more than wired. Within industrial and aerospace and defense, we expect increases in both industrial occupations and defense. Automotive, consumer and broadcast is expected to be approximately flat. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be down 1% to down 5% sequentially, with sales from North America up, Japan flat, Asia Pacific and Europe down sequentially.", "The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 59%. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 66%, up slightly from the September quarter, due primarily to improving customer mix. Operating expenses in the December quarter are expected to be approximately $224 million, including $3 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Almost all the growth from Q2 is related to an increase in map and wafer expense.", "Q4 operating expense will decline substantially, resulting in combined R&D and SG&A expense of approximately $860 million for the fiscal year 2013, and it's at the low end of the range we provided at our analyst meeting last year. Given the uncertain business environment, we are slowing headcount growth and lowering discretionary spending.", "Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $7 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 269 million shares, and the tax rate is expected to be approximately 15%.", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. Macroeconomic environment continues to be a challenge for near-term semiconductor industry revenue growth, including Xilinx. This clearly affected sales for the September quarter and has also resulted in lower-than-seasonal guidance for the December quarter. With the uncertain near-term business environment that Jon mentioned, we're practically taking steps to slow headcount growth, reduce discretionary spending.", "That said, we continue to be very confident about our mid- and long-term outlook, driven by continued design win momentum in our 28-nanometer offerings and new product revenue growth. In the September quarter, new product sales increased 7%, more than 80% year-over-year. Growth in new products was driven by the tremendous adoption of our 28-nanometer product families, allowing us to exceed $20 million to achieve our 28-nanometer revenue goal.", "September sales growth was driven by significant growth in revenue from all members of our 28-nanometer product family in all of our key end markets. We have now clearly demonstrated to our customers that we're a generation ahead of our competition and offering those customers an extra generation of system value.", "In our 28-nanometer FPGAs, we're delivering effectively the equivalent of an external performance, power and integration with an average of 100 -- of 1.5x advantage in every technical category. I think all programmable SoC delivers additional value by integrating multiple chips into one, including CPUs, DSPs and analog mixed signal components. Our 3D ICs are now integrating complex and have the smartest systems function such as packet processing, traffic management while adding 30s bandwidth in a single device that's unmatched by any competition.", "With our Vivado Design Suite, we are both enabling our new generation of devices and delivering unmatched time to integration and implementation. Vivado is the first and the only ASIC and SoC strength design suite in the programmable industry. We've built Vivado from the ground up over a 4-year period, with an investment of over 1,000 engineering man years to enable the next decade of All-Programmable Devices that's creating a huge and sustainable advantage for both 28-nanometer and beyond.", "I believe that with the breadth, value advantages and competitive differentiation of our 28-nanometer portfolio, we're undoubtedly a generation ahead of any competition. To clearly define our roadmap to stay a generation ahead, we plan to provide a high level 20-nanometer portfolio announcement in mid-November.", "Being a generation ahead is accomplished through technology leadership with ever more advanced FPGAs, our second-generation SoCs and 3D ICs and even more significant leverage of our Vivado next-generation design suite. We continue to be pleased with the 28-nanometer rollout. We achieved our September revenue goal, reaching more than $20 million in overall sales. We're expecting to exceed this number in the December quarter as well and then expect very significant growth in the March quarter as more customers will be accelerating their production ramps.", "Despite some uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, game-changing product strategy of the 28-nanometer node has put us in a tremendously positive competitive position and will drive continued share gains, both against ASICs and ASSPs and traditional PLD competition.", "Now I'll turn the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session.", "Rick Muscha", "Operator, I think we're ready for some questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura.", "Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "You mentioned that wireless this quarter would be down more than wired. I was hoping you could drill down into 4G specifically and talk about some of the activity you're seeing today in North America and China.", "Jon A. Olson", "Sure, Romit. This is Jon. So from a wireless perspective, the strength that we continue to have is around LTE deployments in North America or in the U.S., in Korea and as well as Japan. And while that -- those rollouts are continuing into the next quarter, we do think that there's, as there always typically is, there's some bumpiness along the way. But we still are shipping, I would say, the biggest portion of our Virtex family FPGAs that go in the wireless base station segment into the LTE piece. There are some additional GSM and TD-SCDMA activity going on for China, but it is -- the capital spend is actually relatively low. And as they prepare for -- in 2013 a bigger rollout, there are some systems going into that early part of that deployment. But relative to the lion's share of what we see, not only for this past quarter we just announced, as well as this next quarter, it is primarily LTE and it's primarily North America, Korea and South Korea and Japan.", "Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Jon, you were saying that it's a little bumpy. Were you referring to China specifically?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, China is really much -- is really the bumpy part. The North America part seems to be still pretty steady as best as we can tell. And as you know, we ship to people who then ship to a variety of locations. We don't all know exactly where every unit is going in every base station, but based on our communications with our customers, that's really where the strength was. We noted that we had stronger-than-anticipated performance this quarter in wireless, and it's backing off just a little bit but it isn't -- it's still quite good and again, it's LTE-based.", "Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. And then as a follow-up, Moshe, you mentioned that your 28-nanometer revenue doubled in the quarter to about, I think, $20-plus million. Altera has been saying that the majority is tied to SSI and therefore, won't go into production. Could you give us a split how much is SSI?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Well, the revenue came from all 5 families, and the truth is 2 of the 5 families, there is no competition. One of them is SSI. And SSI goes into numerous applications. One is ASIC prototyping. And there, as long as it's the largest FPGA out there, then you keep getting additional wins in that category. So there is a scaling factor, it's not that it's a one-hit wonder in the first 3 months of the product line. It actually continues until there's a larger product line available from any other source. So it actually will continue, and we'll continue to see growth on that. In addition, there's a lot of design wins that go into the high end of the wired communications and the A&D applications, and those do go into production. So you can think of it as having this dual personality, both of which scale. And again, it's only part of the revenue, but even that part goes into some applications, which do go into production and others which just repeat themselves due to a whole host of other reasons.", "Jon A. Olson", "I mean, we stood at -- to add to that, we did ship to all those -- to the customers that are using them for all those reasons that Moshe talked about within this last quarter. So we did ship SSIT very broadly across the application set that it goes to. We tend not to want to parse out our $20 million about which product -- individual products and product families because it does get -- it's actually hard for us to keep all that tracking up because it's not that important to us necessarily to track one versus the other. But we did ship in a prototype and we also shipped into the comms and to A&D, wired comms and A&D, this quarter. And we're very attuned to the fact -- there's a lot of noise around the fact that SSIT only means prototyping, and that's really far from the truth, Romit.", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Question on just on the end markets. There seems to be a little more noise and actually, you had a press release this morning on TD-LTE. What are you guys seeing? Are you seeing any early indications in that market or it's still too early to call? And then my follow-up is really trying to understand the non-communications part of the business, Moshe or Jon. And I'm looking at industrial and the other segments, and if you are taking share from the non-PLDs, shouldn't they be acting a little bit better than what we are seeing from the more generic analog kind of companies? And I'm talking about in terms of Q-over-Q decline.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Okay. Well, there's actually quite a few questions there. So TD-LTE is -- it's still early days. It has -- as Jon indicated, the majority of the rollout has been in North America. There's still a tremendous amount of rollout that is required in North America, and there's some imbalance between the carriers in North America in terms of the level of penetration, one is well ahead of the others. The others need to catch up. Otherwise, they will have a tremendous competitive disadvantage, in particular as the smartphones become more and more prevalent and suck more and more bandwidth. So there's no doubt that there's a need for tremendous upgrades throughout North America, which will happen undoubtedly. The question is not if it will happen, it's only a question of when it will happen. It has to -- the consumer requirements are such that it's about the only solution that can handle that. So that's North America. Elsewhere, as Jon highlighted, it's been -- the rollouts have started in Japan and Korea, but there's room for significant upgrades there. And then the rest of the world, in particular, China and Europe, have not started anything equivalent to that, and so there's significant room for deployment there. So the consumer demands in the smartphones are making this a nondiscretionary decision. It's just book rate [ph]  and how quickly and when it will start in other areas of the world. So we're hearing that consistently from the companies we work with who are the equipment suppliers.", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. And just one more comment on the first question, and I'll try to answer the second question for you, Ambrish. I tried to find out exactly if we could figure out how many base stations were being sold into China that were advanced technology because they keep saying, \"Well, they're doing some demos and prototypes, whatever.\" And as best as we can find out, there's a few thousand that are going to get built or deployed in this quarter, which is certainly not anywhere near what it would take for a rollout. And again, the best information we have is mid-2013 on the TD-LTE business. So it's yet to come, but we're not really experiencing it much there.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "But Jon, there is a few thousand so that's good to know that this is not paper-based stations.", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, yes, that's right. And again, as best -- as good as information as we can get about it, that's what I was able to get to try to figure out really when we might see a better ramp because of China CapEx spending. On your second question, there's kind of 2 ways to look at this. One is our industrial has been relatively weak the last couple of quarters. And in fact, even looking through this coming quarter in right now, the industrial business in Europe is starting off very weak, and the backlog is very weak and distribution information seems to be very weak in Europe in this particular category. So even though we are forecasting a little bit of growth, it's really kind of off of a, I would say, relatively low base. And I'd be surprised to see if anybody else has very bullish numbers on it, industrial. As other companies roll out, we'll obviously be watching that. And with your question around, shouldn't you see maybe a better uptake because of displacing ASSPs, the real winner for us in that area is going to be our Zynq product. And the design-in times, we've had a good uptake. It is still a new category, and we are developing it, and we're getting lots of successes and we're getting design wins. But quite frankly, we aren't on the acceleration knee of the revenue curve yet. And that's going to take a few more quarters before we get there. And that's really the part that's going to, I think, show up in a big way against ASSPs in the industrial category.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Actually, I had a clarification and then a question. On the clarification, Jon, if I heard you correctly, I think you said you're expecting 59% turns to hit the midpoint of the December quarter. How do I square that high turns requirement with the lower visibility? Is that a bit aggressive or I'm missing anything here?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. So Vivek, that's -- obviously, we look at these numbers pretty hard, and when I saw the percentage number, I scratched my head a little bit and said, \"Yes, that seems like a high percentage number.\" But when you peel back the information, we're starting out with a lower backlog. We're aware of certain customers and certain of our end markets that normally would be booked now that aren't booked that we still have high confidence that they will come through. That's one point. The second point is if you look at the absolute dollar amount that it takes, again, remembering we have -- we're starting up with a lower backlog and we're trying to get to a lower revenue than this past quarter, the absolute dollar turns per week is at or slightly below what we've achieved the last couple of quarters. So it's a little bit of this percentage is the tyranny of creating a percentage out of both the numerator and denominator changing at the same time. From a dollar level, I think if we can sustain this current level of business that we have, we'll hit our numbers.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it, very helpful. And then a question for Moshe. As I look at your 28-nanometer ramp, and I think your competitor has also disclosed some revenue numbers. It seems like if I ignore which particular application, it seems that you're both on a similar run rate, right, that they also expect a $20 million-plus this quarter and they did $17 million cumulative at the end of last quarter. And I think your numbers are probably in that $35-ish million to $40-ish million range. So is it fair to assume that your share is sort of 50-50 at this note? Or do you think that you can actually gain share, that there are certain design wins you have that you can actually start gaining share from this point onward, and if that's right, which are those areas that you think you are doing better than them in terms of design wins?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Okay. So we have -- last quarter, we delivered over $10 million, which was higher than what the competition delivered. And it is definitely still early days, so these are the early returns from them. But as we look at the breadth of our product offering and we look at the technical advantages that we have, we have no doubt that we have huge advantage. It manifests itself. There are 2 areas where we don't have any competition yet, and it's likely to be long period of time until there is competition, which is anywhere close to catch up. So that's one major differentiator, and that's on the 3D ICs and on the same product line, which has the embedded ARM core. In addition, if you look at the core product offering, then typically, what we find is at the high end, we have much lower power footprint than the competition, and we're hearing this from our customers and from our competitor's customers too, right, who are surprised at how significant the advantage is there at the high end. The 30s are operating much better in a competitive situation, that has significant impact. In the mid-range, Kintex basically, because of the choices we made, we achieve a certain level of performance, which enables us to sweep the wireless business. And so we're very convinced that there'll be huge shift in terms of shipments into wireless customers. And that, we actually believe that their -- our original -- our preliminary data shows that we have even 80% market share in terms of wireless. And then -- and so between the -- at the core business, between the better service performance, lower power at the high end, higher performance in the mid-range, that gives us confidence that we'll have the lion's share even in the core market then when you add to that these additional markets with the 3D ICs and Zynq that gives us confidence and our target is 70% and we're hell-bent on achieving it.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And one last question, if I may. Just structurally as you look out to say the 20-nanometer node, and I believe you mentioned that you will have some product announcements soon. Just structurally, do you think that it will be a more profitable node than what you saw at 28, because I understand that a lot of the end markets are maturing a bit, but your cost and complexity of going to these more advanced nodes keeps on going up. So 40-nanometer node was profitable, 28 less so. How should we think about the transition to the 20-nanometer node? Do you think that there is a chance that the profitability will be any better than what you have seen in the prior transition?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "So I strongly contest the profitability of 28-nanometer not being there. It has the potential of being the largest node for sure in the FPGA space by a significant margin. And we're seeing it come out of the shoot faster than everything we've seen before. It's just that the nature of the business is that it takes some point in time. But our -- the early data we have and the fact that we can displace ASICs and ASSPs quite affectively, not across-the-board but in lots of markets with our 28-nanometer product, gives us confidence that it's going to be a very large node. The extent of design wins is much, much higher than we've seen in every previous node. And we're hearing from customers that less and less of them can afford to design ASICs to compete with what 28-nanometer can provide. So I'm not sure I agree or I strongly disagree with 28-nanometer being less profitable than 40-nanometer. It will be a much larger node, it has the potential of being the largest node ever. On 20 nanometers, it is clear that due to the number of layers and the complexity of the layers, that the manufacturing costs are going to be higher. There's been a lot of discussion on that, and our way to address that is to make sure that we design the parts and we tape-out a number of parts which cover a broader market. So in terms of our investment at 20, it will likely be similar to what we invested at 28. And the markets we're going to address will probably be similar. It is getting more difficult at these advanced nodes as the designs are more complex and the mask costs are complex, and it requires us to invest a lot of time either in optimizing the design or making sure that we don't tape-out more parts than we need to. And we're up to that challenge, and that's the way we're approaching this node.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Jon, I believe you talked last quarter about 2 of your major comms customers reducing inventory this quarter. Can you talk about whether they've, in fact, finished that inventory reduction? And how do you square that with the comms being a little bit better than you expected in the quarter? Is it that those decreases are just more than offset by increases of other customers and how should we think about that dynamic?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, the second part of your question -- because it was there hanging. It is -- that is true. What happened is that there was certainly an offset with other customers and some significant strength in another place, in the wireless segment in particular that helped to offset that. I think the answer to your first part of your question is, yes, I believe that both those customers are through that buildup, and we're back to a more normal level with them. And I think one of those 2 in particular ended up being pretty decent this quarter and really wasn't that much of a drop as it turned out. So I think we're on the other side. The reason I'm being -- I'm saying -- I'm cautioning that is, we don't always know what the order pattern is of some of our customers, and all of a sudden, they say, \"Oh, no, I need more, I need less\" at the last minute. But the current forecast would suggest that we are behind that, and that's behind us.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Appreciate that. And then as a follow-up, can you maybe talk about what your customers in the defense and aerospace segment are talking about in terms of their behavior around fiscal cliff? Are they ordering more in advance of that? Or are they being more cautious and waiting and reducing their orders? How should we think about that effect on your business in the next 2 quarters?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. So I've been studying this quite a bit because our A&D has not been growing at the rate that we, I would say, had typically would have expected it. We've had a pretty steady 10-plus percent growth year-on-year for quite a few years. And that growth rate has definitely slowed this year. And I'm trying to figure out, I'm trying to sort out how much of that is potential caution or individual programs. And our best information right now is that it's been more impacted by individual programs than people worrying about the cliff. Now I have a hard time correlating what our people are telling me relative to what I read from the defense contractors in the newspaper, but I can't tell how much of that is political posturing and what is real. But the best information we have is that people are not slowing down because of that. They're just kind of waiting it out, and we'll see what happens. And that most of why we aren't growing quite as strongly as maybe we have historically is just because of a couple of individual programs that are just in a space where they're not ordering right now and they'll order a little later.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And maybe just a quick housekeeping question. You talked about the OpEx level reducing substantially into the March quarter. Is that kind of the right run rate as we -- expecting into the beginning of the next fiscal year or would you expect change either way?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, I'm not going to forecast next year, but I think since I pointed the way to the tape-outs and wafers and masks being the biggest driver up and then the biggest driver down, we don't have a large number of tape-outs early in the year because it's kind of the very end of 28 and the very beginning of 20. So I don't think you're going to see a big spike up or down from the Q4 exit, but I don't really want to pin a number on it.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.", "Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Steven Eliscu with UBS.", "Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "We've heard a lot about SSIT and Virtex at 28-nanometer, yet Kintex was talked about as key element of your share gains at that node. Can you give us a sense of how much Kintex is currently driving your LTE revenue? And then within that revenues, within 28-nanometer currently, is Virtex or Kintex overall bigger? And then I have a follow-up.", "Jon A. Olson", "So Kintex has clearly been a early leader in design win level. Virtex has now caught up with it, relative to the dollar amount of design wins overall. But we led with Kintex part, it is specifically designed for wireless base stations, and as Moshe said, we've been winning a tremendous number of design wins. We did ship into production -- into the wireless space with Kintex in this quarter, so it is -- there are designs that are ramping, but it's been like early prototyping from our customers and early units. Prototype their early units not our prototype parts, but their initial base stations. I would say that the wireless segment in our 28-nanometer is probably about the same percentage as it normally is for the overall company during the quarter, which is in the neighborhood of 25-ish percent, and this is kind of just an estimate.", "Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. I have a question on Zynq. Discussed about it earlier being potentially an important driver for your industrial business. To help us calibrate it, can you give us a sense as to when it will make up, let's just say, 5% of revenue? And besides industrial, what end markets are you seeing the biggest opportunities? And what have you learned given your leadership position? What have you learned that you'll be improving on your next generation?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. So this is a Zynq question, right? You're talking about Zynq?", "Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Zynq.", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, so the lead end markets are automotive, industrial and communications. And within communications, it's heavily around wireless. In fact, the small cell category is a category that's a great opportunity for Kintex, and we have been doing pretty well there of late in terms of reducing the number of devices required by our customer -- in our customer's units because we have that processing capability, as well as the ability to do digital front end and other kinds of capabilities that are -- you find in a wireless base station, radio card in particular. So I would say early on, it was automotive followed by industrial and now communications is coming on very, very strong in this particular application. Industrial is very, very broad: automation, motor control, those kinds of activities. And then automobiles is usually our sweet spot, which is driver assist for this particular part. Those are kind of the highest level categories. And with respect to any forecast about when it might be 5%, I would guess that is several quarters away before that ramps to that size because the lead design wins are all, I would say, relatively a compilation of relatively medium-sized to small-sized design win dollar values initially, and then ramping very strongly, particularly when you think about automobile capabilities starting out at the high end and waterfalling down, which is exactly what our customer is going to use this capability for. It takes a while to get into those units in terms of get the unit build up enough because it has to go to different models of automobiles, et cetera. The wireless business is more -- will take off much more rapidly, but most of these deployments are most likely to come in the second half of '13.", "Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Second half of calendar '13, correct?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. But I really haven't -- anyway -- again, 5%, I haven't studied it in great detail, but it's going to be a while before it's 5% of our revenue.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Jon, one question for you backward-looking and then one forward-looking. In the September quarter, you mentioned how North America was the strongest area, especially in your comms business. But that geo was down the most, I think 11%. Can you just help reconcile what was going on between those 2 comments?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. So as you recall last quarter, we had this end-of-life shipments, and a lot of that went into aerospace and defense and industrial category.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Automotive.", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, automotive. And so if you look at geographically where the biggest impact, where that was is North America and Europe. So those were the 2, and North America in particular, the aerospace and defense portion is the lion's share of what we have in defense is in North America. So that was kind of a hard number to match and to make up from a comms number -- a comms perspective.", "Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then the forward-looking question, a little bit following up on an earlier question on OpEx. I know you're not going to talk specifically for next year. But you mentioned that the tape-outs for 20-nanometer aren't really going to start in the first half of next fiscal year. Can you remind us, is the normal cadence of that more back half of the year or is there going to be almost a full year gap between the tape-outs you're doing now looking into next year?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. So yes, I don't have a good sense for the rate of tape-outs into next year. We will do some tape-out activity in the first half of next year, but it just won't be the rapid fire progression because usually, the first 1 or 2 comes out a little more slowly as we get everything settled, and then as we're sure we got things right, then we accelerate those tape-outs. So I would expect the tape-outs will start accelerating in the back half of calendar '13 and then obviously throughout '14.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie.", "Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research", "Starting on OpEx, the lower OpEx for September and then the higher for December, you talked about tape-out push as being part of that. Was there any kind of program that changed on your roadmap or was it just a timing thing, end of the quarter kind of push or can you describe that a little bit?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, it really was timing, Shawn. It was some things that were supposed to happen in the last couple of weeks of the quarter that pushed out to the first couple of weeks. So we're talking about a 2- to 3-week kind of push in the way -- just the way the accounting works for the mask payments. I guess you could say I believe the forecast, I don't know on that. But it did just push out a few weeks, and there were no significant program slips, changes or issues really as a result of that. But we had an additional payment to an outside supplier for something, and it was fairly significant, and that pushed out because of delivery of the contract didn't happen on time. And so both those together kind of made it -- made it a bigger than life number. I mean, we certainly missed more than we typically would ever miss an R&D number.", "Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then on the inventory side, I think you mentioned that it would -- you expected days to come up in December. Can you talk about how channel inventories are looking? They still seem at 10 days-ish to look kind of on the lean side. Do you think inventories built or came down in the quarter? And what do you expect them to do in your channels in December?", "Jon A. Olson", "So I was talking earlier about -- particularly European distribution being weak, and the backlog being particularly weak from a Europe perspective in the medium-sized and small customers. And we've been doing a pretty good job with Avnet collectively to keep the inventory lean and keep it available for them and in Xilinx's inventory pot. And that's worked out pretty good because it gives them a lot more flexibility versus having to guess which of their customers might decide to order something in these kind of uncertain times. So that's worked out pretty good for us, and I don't think there's any particular supply chain issue that gets communicated with that. Overall, our inventory is moving up just because we were starting to build more 7 series or products. And since those tend to carry higher costs than the initial part of the ramp, as we build up to satisfy needs over the next couple of quarters, that dollar impact typically increases our dollars and also our days because days are just average, not specific to any individual product family. So there's not really a much of a story in inventory. I think we've got a pretty good handle on it at this point.", "Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then on the mix, I think you might have said or I might have heard you say that wireless was 25% of overall sales. Can you confirm that? And then within your industrial, defense, aero, how big is the aerospace defense portion of it?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. Well, wireless typically runs from the low 20s to mid-20s for us, and that's -- a little lower than 25%, but approximately the number. And our industrial typically runs in the mid-30s, and that dropped as a percent as you can see our industrial percentage has dropped on a quarter-on-quarter basis and comms went up on a percent basis so...", "Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research", "So how big was defense of the -- of your business or is that within that bucket?", "Jon A. Olson", "Sorry. Defense has typically been in the neighborhood of 15%, and it was a little lower than 15% in this last quarter.", "Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And one, just final one, if I may. The OpEx for the full year of $860 million, does that include your amortization charges?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, it does. It doesn't? Wait a minute, hold on a second. No, it doesn't?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "It does.", "Jon A. Olson", "All right, good. Two different nodding heads here from people. $860 million does include.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Anil Doradla with William Blair.", "Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Moshe, when you interact with your customers, the cautiousness on the macro front, is there something qualitatively different this time than previous times? Are they preparing for kind of a prolonged multi-quarter or more short term? And I have a follow-up.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "So I do spend a lot of time meeting with our customers. And I think generally, there's no sense of gloom and doom. There's just challenges on the macro side, which are pretty visible to all of us. But I don't see any huge expectation of a very severe slowdown. When you look at -- a lot of these elements are driven by a need for some political fortitude which takes time. Hopefully, it will get addressed in North America soon, and in Europe, they're starting to come together on that. And likewise, when the transition in China is going to happen, that will enable things to move forward. So the short answer is no, I don't get the sense of a huge downturn impending at this point.", "Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Great. And when you look at the LTE activity in Europe, that's been kind of weak from our checks. Do you expect anything coming back in the next 6, 9 months on LTE front from Europe or do you think that's going to be pretty muted?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "I think it will come later than it has in the past, and the competitive position is such -- you can see it in North America, when one carrier decides to go ahead and start generating significant advantage, it generates pressure on the others to catch up. In Europe generally, that isn't happening yet. So I do think it's several months out at this point in terms of a big deployment in Europe.", "Jon A. Olson", "I think there was some press release by Vodafone somewhere in the last 3 months on this thing, but I don't think we've seen anything significant with respect to our revenue.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Yes. So the 6 to 9 months is probably a good guess.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities.", "Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Jon, I just want to make sure the OpEx question, I got it right. So you're saying $860 million, that includes the amortization of roughly $10 million, right?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, Srini, it does include that. $860 million is all-in the full year of all of our OpEx.", "Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Okay, got it. And then Moshe, it looks like there are some concerns about the China TD-LTE as far as the base station content goes. We've been hearing that a majority of these base stations are software upgradeable. I guess the question is, is that true? If so, what does that mean for your FPGA content in each of these base stations?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Well, we believe we have a phenomenally strong position there, and best we can tell, there's a lot of FPGA content in the product. So I don't believe that, that's going to pose an issue once the deployment starts in earnest in China. In the interim, what they're doing is, they're about to launch this next rollout of the previous generation, the 3G generation. But when 4G comes out, our product position is very strong there, and we're looking forward to that happening. And the faster it happens, the better from my perspective.", "Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then one last question. On the wired business, Jon, you said it was down last quarter and looks like it's going to be down again this quarter. I'm just wondering what's going on. Is it still inventory correction or is it just demand being weak?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. There was -- it was down this past quarter more from an inventory correction basis than anything else. And it's basically weak demand. If you look at our -- all of our large customers, our top, say, 15 or so customers, which are really communications and aerospace and defense customers. The communications customers are just almost plain flat. It's over the last couple of quarters with the only exception being in the wireless base station area. Everything else just seems to be kind of chunking along and not getting a lot worse, but also not getting a lot better. And since a lot of our businesses, our revenue levels are defined by these large customers, there really isn't a tremendous amount of growth going on. So it's just -- it's weak demand, not growing demand.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.", "Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Jon, just a follow-up on your last comment. So I'm looking at my model here, we're in the second half of fiscal '13. If I plug in some really good growth for Q4 and then double-digit growth for next year, we'll essentially have 4 straight years of kind of flattish revenue growth. So I mean, do you guys look at that? Are you reconsidering your long term growth rates for the PLD market for Xilinx? Has this come into discussion at all?", "Jon A. Olson", "So the answer to your very direct question is absolutely, we've had discussions around what is going on, where the drivers of our business really are going to come from and does our investment level and growth level still -- those 2 things match appropriately to what we've been saying. So there's no doubt this is a question. And this elusive metric that we, I call it elusive because I'm the CFO around design wins. The strength of which we are winning business gives us such confidence that the revenue growth is coming. But of course, macroeconomic issues can always play around with timing and when and how that happens. But we still have very strong belief here. That being said is, we are very mindful that we're outside of our business model from a percent basis, and we'll look very hard at that. We go through our planning cycle in early calendar year 2013, and I don't know what to say. I'm not going to say that we're going to cut our growth rates as we sit right now because our design win levels are really, really high on a relative basis to anything we've ever seen. Moshe wants to make a comment here.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Chris, I mean, we are -- it's obvious to us that there are challenges there, and that's why we are curtailing discretionary spending, and we are careful on the hiring front. Having said that, the impact of the design wins in 28-nanometer is not yet visible, right? It's still a tiny portion of our business. And given our very strong and broad portfolio, as we exploit that and as that goes to market and moves into production, that's when you'll start seeing accelerated growth, right? And that can't happen soon enough from my perspective, but it takes time in our business.", "Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Throw me in that bucket of can't happen soon enough as well. A follow-up question as it pertains to OpEx. It's jumping up this quarter as a percent, but you guys are shaving it down pretty good in fiscal Q4. I mean, are we to assume -- can we assume that if we're in this kind of sluggish environment going into next fiscal year that there are a few more levers you guys can pull on the OpEx side to keep it down?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, I think we certainly are going through -- we'll go through that process with plan depending on what we see the outlook for the top line is, and I think there are more levers that could be pulled if we get ourselves in a negative kind of growth situation again. But we're also not going to slow down technology too slow just to get back in the business model in the short term and then screw our opportunities for growth in the future. So it is a balance, and I do hear you. We're going to work through that.", "Operator", "And your final question for the day will be Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.", "Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just a follow-up on the earlier SSI question. Your competitor had talked about a fairly limited size for the prototype market. Can you -- understanding that you see more than just a prototyping opportunity here, can you help us size the overall opportunity for the Stacked Silicon Interconnect and how much of that is actually prototyping?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Okay. So let me repeat and so try to quantify it. The equivalent of SSIT from the customer's perspective is like having a much larger FPGA available 2 or 3 years earlier than they could achieve any other way. And in addition, because we have a version which is heterogenous, in other words, has [indiscernible] integrated with the FPGAs, it also enables a significant growth in terms of bandwidth. And so if you look at that and you say, \"Forget about how it's implemented, right, that it's 3D and all of that, what does that -- what is the size of those markets?\" And those markets overall are several hundred million dollars per year markets, right? Now there's a subset of that which is used for prototyping, that's correct, and that prototyping is where it's used primarily by semiconductor companies or ASIC or for the few remaining ASIC designs to do early product assessment of their products. And there, as long as you have the biggest one available, which we do now, it enables -- it facilitates itself and it's repeatable. So even though those customers don't go into production, whenever they're doing a new design then they're designing new versions of these ASIC prototypes, so it's not a one-hit wonder, and it actually is quite broad and as such that's why we believe that it's several hundred million dollar market. It's the high end of the FPGA market, and it also enables us to break into what would be the midrange of the ASIC market or the sweet spot of the ASIC market, and that's a pretty big market in of itself. So trying to minimize that is probably erroneous. It's significant. And as long as there isn't an alternative, it continues until that alternative exists and typically it takes 2 or 3 years before the next generation of FPGA is there and can achieve that level of complexity. So you can assume that there's at least a 2- or 3-year edge there, which we intend to exploit very aggressively.", "Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And just a quick follow up. Do you foresee people wanting to stack FPGAs with non-FPGA devices such as CPUs or ASICs in the same interconnect structure? Is that something customers want and something that you might provide?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Well, generally speaking, we haven't -- we are the leaders, we're the only people who have it. We have our first generation of product you can get. We have wrung out all of the issues there. The first generation had 2 elements of integration and you can assume that in the next generation, there will be more things that can be integrated on using the 3D capabilities, and then it needs to be economically viable to do that. So some applications require things like memory, some applications require other elements. We're way ahead of anyone else in terms of identifying those and pursuing them.", "Rick Muscha", "Thanks for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.", "Rick Muscha", "Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the December quarter, and then we'll open the call for questions.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially.", "We refer you to the documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.", "This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.", "Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.", "Jon A. Olson", "Thank you, Rick. Xilinx sales were $510 million in the December quarter, down 6% sequentially. Weaker-than-anticipated sales were primarily due to the communications and broadcast end markets. In addition, consumer automotive sales were also slightly weaker than we had anticipated. Sales from North America were up sequentially driven by defense, while sales from all other geographies decreased. Turns were 57% for the quarter.", "Gross margin was a record at 66.6%. The improvement in gross margin was driven by favorable customer mix, as well as continued focus on margin expansion projects across our product portfolio. Operating expenses of $218 million including amortization, were lower than expected due primarily to the gain on the sale of a building, as well as lower-than-planned litigation expenses.", "New product sales were up 17% sequentially, with particularly strong growth from Kintex-7 and Virtex-6 FPGAs. Both 28-nanometer and 40-nanometer sales increased sequentially.", "Let me now turn to a discussion of end markets. Sales from communications and data center decreased 11% sequentially, including declines from both wired and wireless communications. Industrial and aerospace and defense sales increased 7% sequentially, with a double-digit increase in defense, offsetting flat industrial and declining test and measurement sales. All 3 subcategories in broadcast, consumer and automotive declined sequentially.", "Net income for the quarter was $104 million and included a tax benefit of $6 million, or $0.02 per diluted share related to the lapse of the statute of limitations with respect to certain previously unrecognized tax positions. Earnings per share was $0.38 per diluted share. Other income and expense was a net expense of $5 million, lower than planned due primarily to a one-time royalty payment.", "Operating cash flow for our December quarter was $123 million before $8 million in CapEx. We paid $57 million in cash dividends during the quarter and repurchased $20 million of stock.

Our backlog heading into the quarter is up sequentially. We expect strong growth from our 28-nanometer products. From an end market perspective, we expect communications to increase slightly. We expect industrial, aerospace and defense to be up sequentially, with growth from all 3 secondary end markets. Lastly, we expect broadcast, consumer and automotive to be approximately flat. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be up 2% to up 6% sequentially, with sales from all geographies up slightly. The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 58%.", "Gross margin is expected to be approximately 66%. Operating expenses in the March quarter are expected to be approximately $208 million, including $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. R&D is expected to be between $108 million and $112 million, declining significantly due to a lower level of tape-out expense. SG&A is anticipated to be between $94 million and $96 million, increasing due to higher litigation spending, as well as the absence of the asset sale mentioned earlier. This will result in fiscal year operating expenses of approximately $855 million, slightly less than the $860 million in fiscal year 2013 guidance we provided last quarter.", "Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $7 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 274 million shares. The tax rate for fiscal Q4 is expected to be between 13% and 14%.

Gavrielov", "Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. While there has been some weakness in the economic environment, I am pleased with the 70% sequential growth from our new products. This growth was driven by robust sales of our Virtex 6 40-nanometer product family, as well as a nearly 20% sequential increase 28-nanometer sales, which significantly exceeded our $20 million forecast.", "28-nanometer sales were driven by our midrange Kintex-7 product family, offering unparalleled price performance per watt and a high-performance Virtex-7 family. As we begin 2013, I have grown ever more confident in our 7 series portfolio. We now have all 4 key elements of this optimized scalable portfolio in the market, all programmable FPGAs, SoCs, 3D ICs and the Vivado next-generation design environment that enable these next-generation devices.", "A broader portfolio is enabling us to increase penetration in many of the highest-growth electronics, applications and also combinations of these devices into ever smarter, bandwidth-hungry, 100-gig wired networks, wireless HetNets, data centers and vision-based systems. This broader portfolio has also enabled us to displace a large number of ASICs and ASSPs.", "Vivado is the industry's first SoC-strength design environment delivering unmatched time to integration. It reduces months of design activity to weeks, makes our next-generation devices possible. The current adoption of Vivado is now estimated to be already at roughly 35% of all of the 7 series designs.", "We continue to be very pleased with the 7 series rollout, which was without any question the most aggressive and complete new product introduction in our history. We expect healthy sales momentum to continue in the March quarter, with sales comfortably exceeding $30 million.", "While Xilinx has not been immune to the weakness in the economic environment, the innovation, differentiation and value advantages of our 28-nanometer product strategy has enabled us to clearly move a generation ahead and is driving accelerated share gains against both ASIC, ASSPs and traditional PLD composition.", "We look forward to providing you an update at our Analyst Meeting on March 5 in New York City. Let me now turn the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.", "Sameer Kalucha - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "This is Meer Kalucha calling in for Chris Danely. So I have a question on the communication side of things. Given your experience on pushouts in the December quarter, how are you thinking about the March quarter? Do you think there's a possibility of something similar happening? Or are you confident that whatever happened is behind us?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, let me take that one. So the world is still pretty choppy out there for us, but we are certainly seeing signs of improvement. So for example, we're starting to see the beginning of what people have called the sixth phase in China of the TD-SCDMA, so 3G additional base station deployment, and we believe we were starting to ship some units, certainly not the full level at this point in time, but some units into that particular ramp. So that gives us a positive view of the world. Also I think most of what -- much of what we saw in this quarter was a combination of some sluggishness by large communications customers in terms of their end demand and also some inventory correction. And I would anticipate the inventory correction aspect of that to be -- have worked through -- throughout this past quarter, the December quarter, and therefore will be moving back more towards I'd say traditional end market sales in that area. So those 2 things together make me feel relatively confident that comps should be moving up. And we're kind of behind -- the worst of it is behind us. But anytime someone tries to call the bottom, they're usually wrong. So I'll give myself a little bit of an out there.", "Sameer Kalucha - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it. And then just a little color on how you're thinking on the 28-nanometer ramp this calendar year going forward?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Well, we set targets of $10 million and $20 million in past quarters and exceeded them. We set a target of $20 million this quarter and significantly exceeded that. The target is $30 million, and we expect to significantly exceed that in this -- in the quarter we're in. So we're seeing that come out of the chute and accelerate and come plan and it's working well. So I continue personally to be extremely optimistic and enthused about the rollout of the 28-nanometer.", "Jon A. Olson", "And we came out with our midrange product, which was targeted at the wireless communications area, and we just pointed out in the call how strong that Kintex business was inside of the 28-nanometer revenue. So we think we are on the path to achieving the kinds of growth in segment and share gains in the wireless segment with Kintex in particular. So that's been a strength for us and we have elements of all of our portfolio in production at this point in time. So things are moving quite well relative to the characterization and production worthiness of our portfolio. So pretty happy with it at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Outside of comm, can you please talk about the visibility in the other end markets? And then my quick follow-up, Moshe, on the 28-nanometer, can you help us understand whatever guidepost you can provide us to give us confidence that in 28, the non-comm segments will be bigger, i.e. in consumer and automotive that you have been talking about?", "Jon A. Olson", "So from an outside comms perspective, I think we've gone through an inventory cycle or mini correction, if you will, in the industrial side of things. And across the board, all of our geographies are stronger in distribution backlog going into this next quarter and a lot of the industrial segment. They don't just serve industrial, but a lot of it is served there, and I believe there's -- the backlog is demonstrating some strength in the, I'll say, the non-aerospace and defense portion of our industrial. So I think -- we believe that both aerospace and defense and industrial, that category is our broad industrial name is one of our -- I think it will be one of our fastest growing, percentage-wise, segments that we have throughout this year. So I think there is -- the inventory issues have been worked through. We talked also about aerospace and defense growing in March, which is actually very -- it is not very typical for us, so again kind of not the seasonal patterns of aerospace and defense, but we have continued strong business there. So I think outside of comms, we have laid the seeds for accelerated growth across the board, and that's really attributable to our 45-nanometer Spartan class product, as well as 28-nanometer.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "And with regards to 28 non-comms rollout, it really is an unparalleled generation of product in terms of its breadth and depth. And as such, it serves lots of markets, not only communications, as Jon pointed out, wireless communications is ideally serviced by the Kintex product line. But if you look at the broad product portfolio, it addresses all of the markets. And if you look -- I think, where we have a minimum of 1 year lead over our competition in terms of delivering samples to the products that really is a product that is targeted at automotive, industrial control, and of course, it also has communications applications, but it has tremendous breadth there. If you look at the high end of the product offering, where we don't have any competition, there's a broad acceptance that everyone who needs a high-end product, right, and that includes ASIC prototyping, but it isn't limited to ASIC prototyping, and for example, we're seeing a lot of military applications that are utilizing the unparalleled capacity we provide to customers there. So now this is not only a comm story, 28-nanometer is the broadest, the deepest portfolio and addresses all of the markets that we're in, including all of the ones that you mentioned. And some of them take a little longer to turn to revenue, some of them happen faster. But so far, the non-comms world is working well on 28 in terms of design wins and transition to revenue, continue to be very confident in that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Ryan Carver - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "This is Ryan Carver in for Jon Pitzer. So given comms is down sort of 11% and you guided it up slightly, if you look at sort of seasonality, I guess, first half is typically the stronger side of the comms business, with actually the March quarter being the strongest. So I mean, give us some of the pushouts and maybe the resolution of some of the fiscal cliff. I mean, how much do you think we may see an atypical growth pattern in comms this year, with potentially comms being stronger in the second half relative to historical?", "Jon A. Olson", "I think we did say comms is up slightly in this next quarter, which is the first quarter of the calendar year and our last quarter of the fiscal year. And what I wanted to be as transparent as possible here because I am a little -- I'm always concerned about how strong snapbacks are going to be and things like that. So we do think it's going to be up, we do think it's going to be stronger, it's because some of the things I've said earlier, particularly on wireless customers and overall inventory. But we are seeing the big CapEx spending that has been talked about relative to some of the newer technologies rolling out, particularly in the wireless segment. And we are -- we do believe that those, assuming all the rhetoric about that is true in terms of are they actually going to have that CapEx spend, that we'll have a growing contribution from those spends as we move throughout the year, and that, I would say, it's likely that the second half would be better than the first half.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.", "Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division", "I just had a quick question on the industrial defense in the December quarter, which appears to be -- I know defense was up kind of seasonal for you, but the flat industrial, traffic industrial, if you want to put it that way, appears even better to be than your peers. And then I just have a very quick follow-up on the tax rate for fiscal '14, if you could give us some sort of guidelines on where you think that's going?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. So Brendan, in the industrial category, industrial and defense category for December, yes, we clearly had a really strong, I guess, you could call it seasonal contribution from that particular area, and the other end markets were a little -- were weaker and mixed. And I think one of the bigger -- the bottom of the industrial -- pure industrial part for us happened, I'd say, in the September quarter, and we just kind of was -- kind of bumped along again in the December quarter and largely all that inventory adjustment and -- had been worked out. And so we do think that, that's going to be stronger going into the next quarter. The defense spending was up not just in, I would say, in the defense side, but also the aerospace side, meaning the nonmilitary aspect of things for us in the December quarter. And we are shipping into some new programs in March that are kind of the first time shipments for a new family of products that we have for the aerospace and defense area. We're starting to ship those now in a reasonable big way over the next couple of quarters into one specific program. In addition to some of the other broad-based programs that are continuing into March. So while there's a lot talked about the whole sequestration and cut back and et cetera, and I think we've been impacted to some degree last year in that, we are seeing the selected programs that we've been successful in winning over the years to continue to move forward. So that feels pretty good for us. The tax rate for FY '14, so I specifically -- we have not done our full year forecast yet for the next year, so I really can't give you a specific number. But if you look at the -- what -- including the impact of the R&D -- reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, we guided between 13% and 14%. I think for now, that's as good number to use for our FY '14  as I can give you guidance, but I reserve the right to reset that when we get to the Analyst Day in March.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ian Ing with Lazard Capital Markets.", "Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Jon, so I think you've done a good job describing the advantages of your 28-nanometer families. But I think investors are still trying to reconcile the share commentary, both of you having about 65% to 70% share. It seems there's 3 explanations: number one, one of you is overestimating the share or both of you are missing an additional 1/3 of the market, you're both underestimating 1/3 of the market. Or perhaps the third explanation is that there's wins that you're counting that aren't going to yield the same historical number of production ramps and volumes. So which one do you think it is and why wouldn't it be number three?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Okay. So that's a great question, Ian. Look, we are very confident in our portfolio. I think at this point, the revenue is starting to grow to demonstrate that. It's still early days. The reason that we believe we have a stronger position is we have a broader portfolio, and there are elements of it where there is no competition, there's elements of it where the competition -- we were way ahead in terms of availability of the product. That provides us with a significant advantage. In addition, in other areas where you could say there wasn't a significant time lead to other side, where the benefit we have there is typically significantly lower power and -- but it's a [indiscernible] performance and actually now a much better software design suite. Several of these advantages are new and they're a result of an intense investment we've made in R&D. And so they're yielding now these superior results, and the customers are seeing that and sharing that with us. So those are the reasons we believe we have a very, very strong position. And now in prime time, it's starting to manifest itself and we'll see how it rolls out over the next 2, 2.5 years. We're expecting great things in terms of design wins there. They need to translate into revenue. You're right in pointing out that there's not even a -- not a perfect correlation between design wins to revenue, but we're seeing some really good results. And time will tell, but we're very confident based on the breadth and depth of our product portfolio and its superiority. I don't know into which of the 3 categories that falls, but that's how we see it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Srini Pajjuri with CLSA.", "Ryan Goodman - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "This is Ryan Goodman in for Srini. Question on the comms business. Sounds like you're pretty positive on that for the year, both on the wireline and the wireless side, but I was curious more in the near term. You have LTE starting to pick up, but you've also talked recently about new IT budgets coming in, which will help on the wired side. Which one are you feeling a little more positive about in the coming quarter?", "Jon A. Olson", "Well, I think the wireless gains are easier for us to tie back to specific activities going on geographically in the wired aspects of things, usually are much more diverse around a set of carriers and corporate providers in corporate spending, which is much harder for us to correlate precise -- more precise trends, et cetera. So I would seem to have a little bit better visibility, a little bit better confidence on what's going on, on the wired side. But that being said, we have one data center, high-speed connectivity kinds of design wins in the data center area that by the middle of the year and the second -- the mid- to second half of the year will start to kick in. So I feel pretty -- and these are areas that we have not participated in, in a big way in the past and we are now. And so I feel pretty confident that those design wins, which are more tied to data processing -- or excuse me, data center type companies that are -- have significant market share in those areas, I feel confident that midyear to second half of the year, those are going to start showing up as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura Securities International.", "Sidney Ho - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "This is Sidney Ho for Romit. So in terms of your operating expenses, you guys have done a great job taking it down to like $208 million next quarter. I know you're probably going to talk about this in your Analyst Day, but generally, how should we think -- should we think of this as a new base for your OpEx and understanding that some of that is because of asset sale last quarter? And then a little longer term, your competitor has talked about 10% growth in OpEx this year. I know you don't talk about specific numbers now, but how do you guys think about revenue growth versus OpEx growth in the upcoming year?", "Jon A. Olson", "Well, if you look at our guidance for our fiscal Q4 and then the previous 3 quarters, you'll see up and down, up and down, and it really is because of the crescendo, if you will, or the peak of the 28-nanometer tape-outs. We haven't added, I would say, a significant number of heads in the company, and we've actually had more geographic dispersion of the adds that we have had to lower-cost geographies. So we really haven't increased payroll base significantly, some, but not significantly throughout the year. It's really been a mask and wafer spending perspective. So when you look into next year, we do have some things we have to finish on 28-nanometer technology, and then we'll be beginning to launch the next generation of products, but those obviously won't have a high number of tape-outs going on until more towards the back end of the year. So we'll probably, likely, have a slightly different profile to our spending next year. I wouldn't fixate on $208 million as being the new normal flatline because, again, it's up and down depending on the activities we have in the tape-outs. And you're right, I'm not going to give you a number right now, Sidney, you'll have to wait until a few weeks until we get to March, and I'll be a lot more specific about it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steven Eliscu with UBS.", "Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I just want to focus on the industrial segment some more. If I look at your guidance, it looks like you'll be, for the full fiscal year, you'll be down mid- to upper single-digits. Can you give us an idea of which of the subsegments within industrial have underperformed this past year and then if there's some type of snapback as we go into fiscal '14?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. So the biggest underperforming subsegment has been defense. So we have -- we've pretty much felt that defense has been growing for us in the neighborhood of, on average, of about 10% per year, and this past year, it really hasn't grown much at all. It's been choppy and the growth rate has been fairly near 0. So that's probably been the biggest individual contributor to that particular segment. We aren't at our traditional peaks in, I'd say, the pure industrial area by a long shot or even in test and measurement. We're not -- our current run rate isn't near those peaks at all. So if those markets, as we believe they will, will start to come back next year, that should give us a significant benefit. And then hopefully the defense budget stuff gets worked out here in the next 60 days and people will know what to do and what not to do.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your expectations for the wireless segment as we move throughout the year, specifically on the geographic rollout. Is most of the wireless strength being driven by North America at this point? And what's your expectation for when China TD-LTE could start to kick in? And lastly, are you expecting anything material out of Europe, or other emerging markets, or India at this point?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. So I think as we move throughout next year, we are expecting good North America spend environment, and we're also expecting China LTE to begin and start to ramp in the second half. Our best -- everyday, I guess I could probably give you a different version of the story and whatever, but our best views right now is it's the second half of the calendar year when that starts to ramp. I'd mention earlier that we're getting to start also -- getting the sixth phase of the TD capability going out to help round out some of the capacity issues, and that's going to be -- that's going to happen over the next 2 or 3 quarters. And then you're asking about -- specifically about Europe. I do believe that there'll be some activity in Europe. We've seen some signs of some things going on there. I don't think it's going to be a significant, a large contributor, it means -- but I think it's going to have some contribution. And I have no understanding of what's really going on in India, and I'm not willing to project when that might take off.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "I'd like to dig into the gross margin a bit, if I can. You delivered above target gross margin for the quarter, it's also above your long-term target and yet you're not blowing away revenue. So can you talk about the potential for that target to move? And what's the biggest driver, kind of over the next couple of quarters, that we should think about when we're contemplating on to model that?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. So we have, really, over the last 3 years, really focused on margin improvement programs across the company and essentially leaving no generation of products unturned in terms of the things we can do to squeeze out some dollar -- positive dollars here and there, because we do have a pricing environment, and particularly as we go against nontraditional PLD competitors, it's a different environment for us and we have to make sure that we have the capability and the ability to stay in our business model while still competing vigorously against potential ASSP companies in other situations. So we have created a situation and a culture at the company over the last several years to really go after things, and that's both on the pricing side of being -- becoming much more mature and strategic about how we think about pricing, as well as some of the cost things we've talked about in the past. But that being said, if you just want to focus on this last particular quarter, we did have a drop in our communications by 11% or $30 million, and it was -- that drop was concentrated on a relative basis to a previous quarter in our large comms customers, which tend to have the volume pricing agreements that have -- put some level of pressure or they're below, in some cases, some of the designs are below our corporate average and corporate margin. So when you have less business sometimes, you can get an uplift in margin because of that customer mix. And we had both good cost profile and good contribution from improved cost across the last couple of technology generations so good improvement there. But we also had the losses in business that we probably -- which we would've had because we've had higher operating margin dollars if we were to have it. But that's really the reason why our gross margin popped up. We have been running at the top end of our model for some time now. There's not an artificial cap on gross margin, meaning because the model stays at 64 to 66 range, that doesn't mean we limit ourselves at 66, we'll take whatever -- we maximize whatever gross margin we possibly can get. We tend not to evaluate our model dynamically. We look at it once a year and decide whether we want to change it or not, and at this point in time, we're not changing it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Anil Doradla with William Blair.", "Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Moshe, I think my question was around your strength on 3G versus 4G. So as we see North American deployments in 4G and some of the 3G, 4G in emerging countries, can you share with us how you look at your market share in each of these technologies or does it depend more on end customer? And I have a follow-up.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Okay. Well, with -- if you look at our position in 28 vis-a-vis our position in 40, then in 28, Kintex was designed with a very close look at the needs of wireless. And we believe we have an overwhelming market share by definition, that has been used more for 4G than it has for 3G. And as a result, because it's a new rollout and Kintex-7 is a new product so my expectation is that as newer generations roll out, we have a better general position. And then of course, in some accounts, we have higher penetration, in other accounts, we have lower penetration. Generally speaking, we have a stronger hand, so if you look at the average position then it is better, but it is account specific. But the breadth at 4G in terms of the penetration is really very, very broad, and the faster that rolls out, the better off, I believe, our position will be. Having said that, we gladly welcome any fast 3G rollout too. We have a lot of design wins there. The other element to keep in mind is regardless of market share, which everyone spends too much time focusing on, the reality is that from generation to generation, the percentage of the bill of materials, which is implemented on the FPGA has typically gone up. Now it doesn't go up every single time, but as a generalization, it has gone up. And as a result, there should be a higher percentage of the bill of materials in 4G solution, which is implemented in there than there is in the 3G. So just generally speaking that FPGA SAM is growing from generation to generation. And our percentage there, we believe, with the 28-nanometer should grow too, in particular with Kintex, which is a home run with regards to wireless penetration.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Glen Yeung with Citigroup.", "Delos Elder", "This is Delos Elder on behalf of Glen. I wanted to ask you about order linearity during the quarter, sorry, linearity during the quarter. And then with respect to some of the most recent order trends, how does that fare between distributors and direct sales, direct customers?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. Our linearity, I would say, was pretty -- I'd say, typical until we got to the very end. So October was pretty strong for us, and November was the middle month of the quarter as typically things slow down a little bit and it did, and we got into December and things were okay. And the last 2 weeks, it wasn't quite as good as we'd anticipated, which is why we missed our guidance slightly on the bottom end because of the last 2 weeks of the quarter. And that was really a combination of less-than-anticipated volume through distribution than we had anticipated and a little bit of rescheduling into the next quarter that we saw. So those are the primary drivers of what went on and essentially why we missed our orders slightly outside of our range. Relative to the profile of orders and backlog increase and how things have been going so far between distribution and direct, as I mentioned earlier, distribution backlog was stronger pretty much across-the-board for us and that was really good. And our direct backlog also was up from a quarter, beginning backlog from the previous quarter and then going into this quarter. So I wouldn't think -- I don't see any, really, difference between the 2, meaning they're both seem to be improving and not one versus the other.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Shawn Webster with Macquarie.", "Deepon Nag - Macquarie Research", "This is Deepon for Shawn. If you could talk a little bit about the inventory pop. I know last quarter, you kind of talked about how it was mostly built over 28-nanometer products. Was it something similar? Just maybe the value in the mix of that inventory and what you plan on doing to get it down?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, so the inventory did go up $22 million. Now some of that was a lower revenue profile, but we're also building safety stock increases in advanced technologies, inclusive of 7 series. Now Moshe talked about us having a target of $30 million for revenue for this quarter in the 28-nanometer technology or 7 series product families. And so we are building product in anticipation of that number are a greater amount of revenue so we have the right mix of products to be able to serve everything to our customers. But we're also increasing safety stock in a couple selected products, across a couple of older technologies, meaning 40-nanometer and 65-nanometer, also in anticipation of some very specific orders. And that caused their inventory to go up. Now we are a little bit out of mix and balance in terms of line item by line item. We were adjusting wafer starts, starting at the beginning of this past quarter, means the beginning of the December quarter. So those outs will start to fall, if you will, in the March and June quarters and will be bringing our inventory dollar level down, we believe, in both quarters, March and June, the dollar should fall.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ruben Roy with Mizuho Securities.", "Ruben Roy - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Moshe, I just had a follow-up on some of the Kintex comments that you were making earlier. The first midrange product you mentioned that it was designed really with wireless infrastructure in mind. I'm wondering if some of the initial strength that you're seeing is coming from solely that market or if you're seeing strengths outside of communications for Kintex. And how is it lining up so far against your midrange competitive product out there, i.e. in comms specifically for instance, are you taking portions of the PCB that might have gone to your competitor? Or are you seeing some traction against other types of technologies?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Okay. Well, Kintex indeed was targeted at wireless, and one of the unique features of the strategic decisions we made was that we recognized that wireless required a combination of pretty high performance, but focused on low power, and we think we aced that one and got the right combination there, and that has provided us with a very strong position there. And that's basically the strength together with very strong and actually industry-leading service, which again is -- has become a strength for us as we have invested very heavily in developing that capability. If you look at what is happening, then -- note, this is -- it's true that the product had, as its initial target wireless, but it has a broader reach than that. And we're seeing design wins on Kintex that address all markets that need higher level of performance and are cost sensitive and just don't require the ultimate performance for which Virtex is the right solution. So there's a lot that falls into that category, and actually we see that market expanding relatively rapidly. And if you look at the challenges, and to be honest, mistakes we made in the past, we did not have product that addressed that market and it went elsewhere. Now generally speaking, what we're seeing is, and I'm amazed that the data, because we predicted that this would happen and would start accelerating, and this is the ASIC and ASSP displacement, and that continues to grow and with each generation of product, there's like a quantum leap in the percentage of the bill of materials we can address because we can -- we have typically higher capacity, higher-performance and lower power. And except for high volume applications, the ability to justify ASSPs or for semiconductor companies -- sorry for customers to justify ASICs, for semiconductor companies to justify ASSPs, that gap continues to grow. And as we move -- have moved very rapidly into 28, we're benefiting from that, it requires having the right products. And one of the new elements we have is with our SoC device, Zynq product line, which is we've been delivering to customers for well over a year, that enables us to address new market, where we're displacing lots of medium and lower end ASSPs that -- and micro-controllers that our customers have been using. And as we come out with the higher end versions of the Zynq family, which are already available to customers, we can continue to move up in terms of product displacement. So there's largest share of the bill of materials, it's something we're seeing. And as we look at the detailed data, we're looking at ways to share that in March. We're just seeing that trend accelerate, and it's quite gratifying and that's one of the reasons that we are very bullish about the size of the market that is served at 28-nanometer by FPGAs and by Xilinx in particular.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.", "Brian Peterson", "This is Brian Peterson stepping in for Hans. Can you just talk about wafer availability and if that improved in the quarter, and if that impacted gross margins or maybe your decision to add a little bit of inventory, especially on the 40- or 65-nanometer processors?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. We generally don't have any, I'd say, significant issues on wafer availability. Now it doesn't mean there aren't -- there isn't some tightness at the foundries, but we've been able to navigate around that some. So it didn't really impact our gross margin as a result of any actions that we've taken or we are taking on the safety stock increase that's material or substantial. But quite frankly, we have built ahead in a few products that we are fairly confident we're going to get orders from just in case we -- I mean, just to make sure that we have the right mix in order to meet upside in the face of what I would say normal kind of tightness at the foundries, nothing extraordinary at this point in time. So to answer your question, it's kind of yes, we're building safety stock because there are some concerns that things could be getting tighter over time.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Nick Clare with Robert Baird.", "Nicholas A. Clare - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "This is Nick calling in for Tristan Gerra. So I guess 2 quick ones. First, from a higher level, do you guys have any type of industry-wide kind of growth estimate for base station deployments for this year, or for your fiscal year, or calendar year, either way?", "Jon A. Olson", "No. I think you could get -- maybe Moshe has got something to say here, but I think we could talk to everyone of the predictors that studies this kind of stuff, and they all give us a slightly different view. So I'm not sure there's one that's right or one that we're subscribing to.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "We'll share our insights in March, right, to the best of our ability. But this is a prediction and we do obviously talk directly to our customers, and we have a central role in terms of fulfilling their requirements, so we'll try to translate that into something which you can hang your hat on. But generally speaking, when you break it down geography by geography, they ebb and flow not all at the same time and there is an expectation that some of the geographies that have been weak will actually have a significant deployment. And Jon did talk about China as being one of those. We'll try to give you better predictions, but we don't want to throw out a number at this point.", "Rick Muscha", "Thanks for joining us today. We have a playback of this call beginning at 5 p.m. Pacific Time, 8 p.m. Eastern Time today. For a copy of our earnings release, please visit our IR website.", "Our next earnings release date for the fourth quarter of fiscal year '13 will be Wednesday, April 24, after the market close.

My name is Marvin, and I will be your conference operator. I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.", "Rick Muscha", "Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the March quarter and then open the call for questions.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially.", "We refer you to documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.", "This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.", "Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.", "Jon A. Olson", "Thank you, Rick. Fiscal year 2013 was highlighted by sales growth from our new products, which increased more than 80% from the prior year, driving PLD share gains for the year. Although muted macroeconomic conditions contributed to an overall sales decline of 3%, Xilinx achieved a record gross margin in fiscal 2013. Gross margin of 66% was an increase from 65% in the prior fiscal year, a direct result of our continued focus on margin expansion projects across our product portfolio.", "In the March quarter, Xilinx sales were $532 million, up 4% sequentially and at the midpoint of the guidance we've provided. Sales from all geographies, with the exception of Japan, increased sequentially. Gross margin was 66.1%.", "Operating expenses of $204 million including amortization were $4 million lower than expected, due primarily to lower discretionary, sales-related and litigation expense.", "New product sales increased 13% sequentially, with particularly strong growth from Kintex-7 and Virtex-7 FPGAs. 28-nanometer product sales exceeded $40 million in the quarter, surpassing our previously stated goal of greater than $30 million.", "Let me now turn to a discussion of end markets. Sales from communications and data center decreased 1% sequentially. This was slightly weaker than we had forecasted. We had expected this sector to be up slightly, driven primarily by wired communications. The actual results were driven by a decline in wired customers, primarily on older products. New products, however, were up sequentially. The decline in wired was partially offset by wireless customers shipping both 3G and LTE technologies on a global basis. We continue to expect TD-LTE business to be a significant sales contributor in the second half of the calendar year.", "Industrial, aerospace and defense sales increased 7% sequentially, with strengths from all 3 subcategories. Broadcast, consumer and automotive was stronger than anticipated, with double-digit percentage growth from all 3 subcategories.", "Other income and expense was a net expense of $9 million, $2 million higher than planned, primarily due to impairment losses on private equity investments.", "Net income for the quarter was $131 million or $0.47 per diluted share and included a tax benefit of $12 million or $0.04 per diluted share as a result of a catch-up benefit related to the restatement of the R&D -- reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.", "Operating cash flow for the December quarter was $174 million before $6 million in CapEx. We paid $58 million in cash dividends during the quarter.", "Diluted shares for the quarter were 277 million. There was a 9.4 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions relating to the dilution associated with our convertibles, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com.", "Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments were flat at approximately $3.4 billion. We have approximately $1.3 billion in convertible debt, and our net cash position is approximately $2.1 billion. Days sales outstanding decreased 2 days in the March quarter to 39 days.", "Inventory dollars at Xilinx declined by $25 million sequentially. Combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution were 110 days, down from 131 days in the prior quarter. We expect inventory dollars to be down again in the June quarter as we work toward a target of 90 to 100 days of combined inventory.", "Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the June quarter of fiscal '14. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up sequentially. We are expecting continued growth from our new products. From an end market perspective, we expect communications to be approximately flat as wired increases offset wireless decreases.", "We expect industrial and aerospace and defense to be up slightly as growth from industrial, scientific & medical and test & measurement are offset by declines in defense. Lastly, we expect broadcast, consumer and automotive to be up, driven by increases in both consumer and automotive.", "As a result, we are expecting total sales to be up 1% to 5% sequentially, with sales from all geographies expected to be flat to up, with the exception of Europe, which is expected to be down. The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 54%, which is lower than the prior quarter but in line with our 4 year average.", "Gross margin is expected to be approximately 66% to 67%. Operating expenses in the June quarter are expected to be approximately $206 million, including $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. We remain comfortable with the full year operating expense guidance we provided at our recent investor meeting.", "Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $8 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 277 million shares. And the tax rate for the June quarter is expected to be approximately 13% to 14%.", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. The 4% sequential sales growth in the March quarter was driven by double-digit increases on 6 of our secondary end markets. This broad-based strength highlights recovery in our business. Revenue was primarily driven by exceptional growth from our 28-nanometer product family, which exceeded $40 million, significantly surpassing our expectations. 28-nanometer sales were driven by both our midrange Kintex-7 and our high-performance Virtex-7 product families.", "We are now converting technology leadership to revenue growth. 28-nanometer Xilinx is a generation ahead of our competition in 4 areas. We have the broadest portfolio with our all programmable FPGAs, SoCs and 3D ICs. Second, we have the best products with an extra node of performance, lower power, high levels of integration and connectivity with the industry's absolutely best service.", "Third, and per our customers, critically more importantly, as our average design complexity has skyrocketed, we enable the highest productivity with Vivado, the industry's first SoC-strength tool suite. This enables delivering unmatched time to integration and implementation and, by far, the best quality of results, i.e. higher density, higher performance and lower power.  Lastly, we enabled smarter systems with the unique combination of SmartCORE IP, C-based design tools and libraries, embedded software running on our market-defining ARM-based solutions.", "Leveraging all 4 advantages, revenue growth is already being driven by continued PLD share gains, considerable displacement of ASICs and ASSPs, aggressive market penetration and core target growth driver applications. Smarter 100-gig wired networks, wireless HetNets, data centers, retail and vision-based systems.", "In the March quarter, we announced multiple industry first, the 20-nanometer, clearly demonstrating between our -- this node to staying a generation ahead. Vivado Tool Suite now supports 20-nanometer designs. We are currently working with numerous Early Access customers. We'll be taping out our first 20-nanometer device this quarter as predicted.", "The rollout of our 7 Series and Zynq All Programmable SoC product generation is nearly complete with all 5 families in production. Fiscal year 2013, 28-nanometer sales comfortably surpassed $100 million. Over 500 customers receiving shipments in the March quarter alone in a broad base of applications including communications, industrial, defense and broadcast.", "In the June quarter, we expect our 20-nanometer shipment -- 28-nanometer shipments to, again, exceed $14 million in sales. As we discussed at our Analyst Day last month, we are very confident 28-nanometer sales will grow to more than $250 million in fiscal year 2014.", "With an improving demand environment, industry's broadest and, by far, best 28-nanometer portfolio, focusing penetration into the highest growth applications and significant progress in displacing ASICs and ASSPs, the new fiscal year promises to be an exciting year for Xilinx, here, where we will clearly connect technology leadership to revenue and demonstrate we're a generation ahead for accelerated growth.", "Let me now turn the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.", "John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Jon, in your prepared comments, you talked about a meaningful uptick expected in the back half of the calendar year for TD-LTE. The LTE cycle has been one that investors have been waiting for, for a while. I guess what gives you the confidence in the TD-LTE market? And if you could also just discuss the kind of the LTE build-out here in the developed countries. We saw AT&T kind of lower their CapEx for the out years. When do we start to see kind of the content pickup story for you guys within that spend?", "Jon A. Olson", "Sure, John. So let's just talk about the TD-LTE portion first and I'll go to the second half after that. So we get -- the information we get is primarily from our customers. And the customers in China who are providing, or are the likely candidates to provide that equipment have given us forecasts that indicate in the second half we're going to have a -- the beginning of the ramp for that design. We have already sold into equipment where they're kind of doing their booked prototyping and their first-generation of testing of that capital equipment. And so I'm just putting these 2 things together. They're forecast for the second half of the year now, of course, these aren't binding forecasts, these aren't orders that are booked and all is subject to change. But usually what we've seen is the beginning of the prototype build followed within a quarter or 2 of the ramp. So the combination of their forecast, which means there must be some confidence that they want us to build enough parts for that as well as the beginning of prototypes is where I'm getting that information. The second question or maybe Moshe, do you have any additional color on the LTE before I...", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Well, China is expected to happen in the second half, and all of the signals highlight that, that is the plan and is ongoing.", "Jon A. Olson", "Okay. The AT&T announcement is kind of interesting. We obviously are pretty aware of that, of what was said. But when you peel back the onion of what's inside there and we have talked to the carrier about this, their program is associated with wireless rollout of LTE. Actually, it's preserved in terms of the kind of ramp they've been talking about in terms of capital spend and deployment across the country for the rest of this year and into next calendar year. So it's a very specific name to that program and we've gone and talked to them and checked with that. And our best information is, is that the wireless LTE portion of this is not substantially impacted by the statements that they made.", "John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And maybe as my follow-up, guys, just quickly, another good quarter on the gross margin line, without yet seeing, I think, the benefit of some of the share gains you're expecting in 28-nanometer. I guess, given your leadership position is at 28, as that becomes a bigger mix of the overall revenue stream, is there opportunities to kind of get the margins above the higher end of your target, given that there's still a gap between yourselves and your closest competitor?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. So there's no question we are continuing to do everything we possibly can to move the margin number up. The fact that we haven't changed our business model, I kind of anticipate the question on that as well. The fact that we haven't changed our business model is not really important relative to our view in the short term that we do think margins are going to continue to be healthy. I think one of the things we've talked about at the Investor Day was around the increasing importance of Zynq against ASSPs. And we're still working through those kinds of competitive situations. And in terms of changing our business model, I think we're just being cautious. But there's no doubt in the short run, as evidenced by our forecast for the June quarter, we are confident that margins have drifted up and continue to drift up a little bit if you go back over the last 6 quarters and plot it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "One more on gross margin. One thing that Altera has done, had these products customized for different applications, i.e. with cost optimal structures, some of it in high-k metal gate, some without. And they have often explained that, that's the reason that their gross margins have tended to be higher. Is that a valid reason? Is that the kind of gap that you can close through your own design activity? Or do you think there is that structural gap that will remain?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "So we have, over the past 5 years since the new management team has been in place, we've focused on improving the gross margins. And we believe that with the unquestionably superior portfolio we have and the broader portfolio we have and the deeper portfolio we have, we will get -- we audit for that and there is now the operational focus on driving defect densities and making sure that the overall portfolio has the right mix. So there's various ways of addressing it, and we like the way we've addressed it. It gives us technology leadership, market leadership and, unquestionably, a strong position. So I wouldn't say there's only one way to address it and the results speak for themselves. Ours have floated up. And despite the fact that we're now shipping a lot of 28-nanometer, the margins have gone higher rather than lower, which typically in the past it would go the other way when we are introducing a new generation of product. So -- but fundamentally, I believe that our overall portfolio strategy at 28 is absolutely winning and superior at this point.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And as a follow-up, there's some frequent concerns that the large Chinese equipment vendor has been trying to actively use more of their internal ASICs. I know it's not a new concern but it does come up frequently, and the related concern to that is that maybe for this initial prototyping part of PBLT, they might be using more PLDs. But as they go forward, that they might try to use more of an internal ASIC solution. Can you put that concern to bed once and for all, because I think that has -- it just comes up so frequently?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Well, we are confident that we have tailored our Kintex product to be absolutely a perfect solution for those wireless requirements. And what does happen is for the first few years, things change quite a bit, and the flexibility inherent in the FPGA is fundamentally a big feature that enables them to address that. And so between the flexibility they need and the very strong match that we have with our product offering to their requirements, and Kintex was targeted specifically at that, then I think we have a very strong position. Now any of our customers at any point in time can decide to do this. It typically is a risky, lengthy and complex thing to do, and it does happen from time to time. It just is becoming rarer and rarer. And so the number of companies that can do it has dropped. And even at the biggest names, and you've alluded to one of them, where they do undoubtedly have capacity, they tend to want to use it strategically where it has the biggest impact, and that biggest impact actually tends to be more on the consumer side where they have huge volumes and very short product life where they can exploit that most effectively. So I would never say never. I'm just saying it's more difficult and we're intent on making it more and more challenging as we move forward to advance nodes at the fastest pace possible.", "Jon A. Olson", "And we're seeing no signs of this activity. So I mean, again, it could always happen in the future but I wouldn't think if -- you had specifically talked about, maybe right after prototyping. No way, I don't believe that's happening at all just for all the reasons Moshe said, in terms of the change that's still going on in the overall environment and et cetera. So I don't think that's going to happen.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "First question is just getting back to the end markets and the guide. Jon, I think you mentioned that in the coming quarter, wireless will be down. But then I'm trying to reconcile that with TD-LTE builds happening. And since you did some prototyping, if they're happening in the back half and assuming they're strong, then what is weaker in wireless? So that's my first question. The second question is back to your business model through the cycle -- through the cycle, through all the top line volatility, the franchise has become more profitable. So could you please remind us again, and I won't ever fault you for not returning enough to shareholders, but the business is more profitable and you churn out a boatload of cash. So just remind us on the priorities on buyback versus dividend.", "Jon A. Olson", "Ambrish, wow, you've covered a whole lot of stuff in that question. From an end market perspective, yes, I can sense why there's may be some dissidence or differences in those 2 statements that I made that you mentioned. But a lot of what's going on is just what our customer patterns of individual projects. So nowhere near the entirety of our wireless business is dedicated to TD-LTE. In fact, it's obviously very small at this point in time. And again, prototypes tend to be built in batches, and then there's a deployment and then there's contracts-led and then there's approval for it. So it's natural to have kind of a buildup in one quarter, a pause and then a kind of an initialization of ramp when you're talking about a new technology rolled out. So that's some of what you're seeing in the June forecast. And then very broadly, the rest of our business, which is related to both 3G and LTE rollouts elsewhere in the world, it's just the normal bumpiness. I mean, we're not going way down or way up. It's just down a little bit in wireless and then up on the wired section. So it's not really particularly very pronounced for either one of those 2 subsegments in the direction that we've forecasted. So hopefully that was helpful. From a business model approach, yes, we are very profitable. I will remind you that we did return $430 million of our $660 million of operating cash this year to shareholders, so a very high percentage of what we generated this year. And we are confident about growing profitability in the company, and we will make adjustments to our return -- our cash return to shareholders as those opportunities present themselves relative to growing cash balances and decisions that we make about how to do that. So just to refresh your memory on what our strategy is, the first preference is dividend, and we've raised our dividend every year since inception, and we raised it again here in the last quarter by a double-digit percentage. And the buyback is at least dilution or in the range of $150 million -- $100 million to $150 million every year plus opportunistic on top of that, which is really dependent on the stock price and the cycles that are going on. And so we have an algorithm that we use as a guideline, but not as an absolute, and we implement that as it hits our stock prices.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just returning to the carrier CapEx commentary again. If you set China aside for a second and look at the broader market outside of China, if you total up what all the carriers have said about their spending plans for the year and look at what they spent so far, you mathematically conclude that there is going to be a big recovery in the back half of the year. So my question is, based on your customer forecast, do they basically support that snap back in the back half of the year or are you more cautious on whether that can really happen?", "Jon A. Olson", "Jim, when we put together our forecast for the year this year, and we try to add this thinking into what we talked about in the Investor Day in March is I agree with you. It looks a heck a lot more bullish if you add up all the capital spending that's been published, and we've indicated a very strong snap back in the second half, and we haven't actually -- we haven't modeled anything near that strong. I view it -- I think it's going to be more of a steady growth situation, not some sort of a step function up for a couple of quarters. So I think we've been a lot more cautious.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. That's very helpful. And then as a follow-up, you have noted a really large increase sequentially in Europe. I think Europe was up 14% sequentially, and obviously, that's way outside the bounds of what the broader market in something like analog is doing. So can you help us understand what's going on with the European sales? Is that all being driven up by step-up in your large European telecom customer? And what do you expect from that region going forward?", "Jon A. Olson", "Actually, the growth in Europe was very broad-based, and the industrial improvement that we had forecasted in Europe came through. We had double-digit growth, I would say, in the mid to small customer range, just as we had forecasted. And it's nothing -- if anything, by the way, it was a little weaker than we thought in North America in that category, but in Europe, everything came out just right. So we had, in addition to this broader base industrial growth, which came through distribution support primarily, we also had strength in automotive this quarter that was focused a lot on that European market. So very strong business there. We had a few isolated aerospace and defense increases in Europe, greater than on a growth basis as well. Moshe talked about having multiple sub end markets growing. I mean, it really, this \"recovery\" that we had forecasted really was broad-based and it kind of got us back, I'd say, to the normal supply-demand kind of thing. I haven't been able to reconcile what other semiconductor companies have said in this, because I know there's been a lot of negativity going even into the March quarter around strength in industrial. We absolutely saw strength & industrial and in test & measurement and in broadcast and in automotive. And it wasn't just a large communications customer in Europe.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.", "Delos Elder", "This is Delos on behalf of Glen. I wanted to ask really quickly, if you can disclose it. How much of your cash balance is offshore and how much of your cash flow would you say is offshore as well?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, I'm always hesitant to give you -- to give precise numbers on the offshore/onshore cash split because we do have ways of bringing cash back to the U.S. cash efficiently -- cash tax efficiently. Obviously, not all of it, some of it would get a 35% haircut. So I always bristle when someone or an investor says, \"I'm just taking your estimate of your offshore cash and giving you a 35% haircut.\" That really isn't right -- the right way to look at it. In the neighborhood of 1/3 or so is onshore and 2/3 is offshore. But again, I'm cautioning you some of the offshore can be brought back cash efficiently. From a cash generation perspective, I think we've told you, definitely have talked about this before. We're comfortable with our U.S. cash generation, able to absorb dividend -- our dividend payment plus increases in the future and dividend along with supporting all our U.S. needs for cash. So we're in a pretty good position in cash generation in the U.S. and also pretty good position in terms of our overall cash balances.", "Delos Elder", "And then regarding OpEx, it seems to be coming in a bit lower than expected. Are you being conservative there? Or -- and when does spending for 20-nanometer kick in?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, so I think we're pretty much on our thought process in terms of our June forecast for OpEx. And it does grow throughout the year, so the second half of the year is greater because of tape-outs primarily. And there will be additional tape-outs for the next generation. I mean,", "there's still some tape-outs going out but it's on a relatively low level of finishing off the 7 Series and Zynq parts. And in the second half, we will get some uptick in the second half, nowhere near the kind of uptick we experienced in the last fiscal year, where we had our huge crescendo. It's a little flatter starting, if you will. So second half up from first half.", "Delos Elder", "Great. And if I can just ask one more. 28-nanometer color, where is it doing well in the short run and where do you see it most successful in the long run?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Well, it's, by far, our broadest product offering. And if you look at the portfolio, it goes all the way from the low end, the Altix family, through Kintex, which is a wireless-oriented family, to Virtex and then there's the high-end of Virtex, which is primarily implemented with the 3D technology, where we're the only ones who are shipping that in production today. If you look at the breadth, it addresses all of the markets we're in. So there actually isn't a market that we play in which will not be served very well by 28-nanometer. If you look at timeframe, these markets tend to happen at a different rate. So wireless, the high end of test & measurement actually happened to occur quickly. Emulation, of course, happens quickly, too. So those are the 3 faster ones. And then the other markets tend to happen at their own distinct rates, where typically some elements of the aerospace and defense take the longest, but not all of them because even though they are markets that move faster than the average. But I would say it's a continuum, where the 3 that I mentioned are the fastest coming out. But based on the fact we've shipped to 500 customers in all of the markets we serve, it's coming out very broadly and strongly across the entire portfolio. And we expect it to manifest itself in being by far the strongest node we ever have had. And the early signs and the $100 million worth of revenue that was shipped this past fiscal year and the $250 million, which we feel confident in, are all manifestations of that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla with William Blair.", "Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Yes, Moshe, I had a question on your Zynq product line. Clearly, there's a trend of ASSP replacement and Zynq is benefiting from that. Can you walk us through how you expect that to play out over the next couple of years? And do you think Zynq could be a 10% revenue generator for you guys?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Well, we -- it's a groundbreaking product and it addresses a lot of markets, which, again, happens at different rates. But for sure, it will be 10% or higher of the 28-nanometer generation. And because at any point in time, we're shipping numerous generations of product in parallel, it isn't likely to become 10% of our overall revenue anytime soon. But then there's the follow-on product of Zynq which will build upon that. So for 28-nanometer, for sure, it should be in excess of 10% above that. The way these markets work and the target markets to Zynq, some of them, for example, automotive and industrial, take a little longer to manifest themselves. So that will -- won't happen in the short term, but 3 to 4 years out, I would expect it to be well in excess of 10% of the overall revenue of the 28-nanometer shipments.", "Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "So is it fair to say that initial deployments are on high end, and as you get out new iterations, you're going to work your way towards the mid and low end?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "I wouldn't use high end and mid and low end here. I would say that it's market dependent. But Zynq is a mid and low end product by definition. It's not an ultra-high end product. It's basically focused on Kintex and Altix type sort of markets. But I would say within those, it's at the high end of those markets. That's what we've targeted Zynq at. And it's -- the design wins are phenomenal, and this year, it will start to be visible. The year we're in, the fiscal year we're in, it will be visible on the shipments. It just won't be at the 10% level yet by the end of this year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.", "Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Can you give us a similar discussion of the 3D business today? Can you help us now that you're over $40 million a quarter, can you help us decide how big that exposure might be and how big it might get?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Well okay, let Jon -- I'll let Jon answer the first part and then I'll talk about where I think it could go.", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. So I mean, the 3D, which implementation generally describes our largest devices, and the largest devices go into a combination of end markets relative to test & measurement and emulation and prototyping, and then also high end communications for high-speed -- for lots of [indiscernible] and then also aerospace & defense and other in communications, where you can take out much larger ASICs. So those are all descriptions of businesses that many of them don't take off like right away. But yet the emulation and prototyping do take off relatively fast. And vis-\u00e0-vis the strength of our $40 million are definitely was a significant contribution there. But by and large, as Moshe talked about how strong wireless and other end markets have been, our midrange product has taken off much, much faster from the revenue perspective. So it is extremely important to us, that technology, and it has been a very strong contributor to the $100 million level, but it's actually not the biggest component of what we've been shipping up to now.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Kintex by far has been the biggest component, and there's been huge take-up of Kintex shipments in the wireless market, so that's the biggest. And then the high end of Virtex is the second, and then it's the normal Virtex product followed by Altix and Zynq are still a very small percentage point. Over time, we'd expect Virtex and Kintex to probably be neck and neck, the mainstream Virtex and the main stream Kintex to be neck and neck in terms of being the largest and then the high end Virtex to follow that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with JPMorgan.", "Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "With the 20-nanometer business being a little bit better than expected, can you just talk about your expected ramp for that in the June quarter and then the second half of the calendar year? And then, did you guys mention what that 40-nanometer/45-nanometer revenue did during the quarter? If you could talk about that as well.", "Jon A. Olson", "Sure, Chris. The 28-nanometer ramp number next quarter, we said it would exceed $40 million again. So we exceeded $40 million in the March quarter. And in June, we said we would exceed $40 million again. And then just to remind you, Moshe said we would exceed $250 million for the year, which is consistent with what we said in New York at Investor Day. So that would lead a person to believe that there will be a quite a healthy ramp through September, December and March in order to achieve this greater than $250 million. So we do expect September to be approaching 10% of our revenue and continue to grow from that. We have -- again, these are predicated on lots of forecasts from customers but we have a very, I'd say, very detailed tracking around and monitoring of -- say, monetizing 28-nanometer at this company may be different than we've approached things in the past. And so we have a pretty good handle on what we think designs are ramping from our customers with respect to that technology. So we feel, I think, every bit as confident as we did in New York on this particular area. We didn't specifically say anything about the 6 Series. If you do the arithmetic on new products, quarter-on-quarter, new products is really made up of 28-nanometer and the 40-nanometer node. You would see that the 6 Series was in the neighborhood of flat quarter-on-quarter. So we do expect the 6 Series to grow next quarter, in the June quarter, and it starts to get flattened out per quarter and then it will start growing.", "Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Great. And as my follow-up, I guess just one more question on capital allocation. So if I look at your share count from what's basically fiscal '07, '08 until fiscal '11, it went down at a pretty healthy rate. However, now that fiscal '13 is in the books, your share count's actually gone up a little bit each of the last couple of years, so along with your cash balance, too. So I was just wondering like how you guys look at that? What are the plans to deal with sort of the share count creep going forward here?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, the biggest dropper of our share count increase is the dilution effects of the convertible that the accounting world says we have to take but the call option we have to protect us on the strike price can't get recognized in the P&L, so on terms of the diluted share count. So it's actually a little bit of tyranny of accounting. If you net all that out, you would've seen a slightly declining share count for us. But because our actual stock price has been increasing, which is a good thing, over that same time period. You got to give some credit for stock price going up during that time. Now that doesn't necessarily wipe away your base question. I'm just trying to make sure that you understood what the mechanics were relative to the share count. So absolutely, we see our cash balances creeping up slightly, not to a great degree, and we have had kind of over 2 years of flat return of cash to shareholders in the neighborhood of 425 to 450 or 420 to 450 kind of a range and so we're quite aware of that. I'll also point out that we distributed in the neighborhood of 2/3 of our operating cash for the year, which is actually a very high payout ratio. So we do look at a combination of payout ratios and our cash forecast in order to make that determination. And we're very aware of it and we have continuous conversations with the board about it and, again, we are continuing to review those particular alternatives. I'm not going to give a statement today that we're going to change what we're doing right now.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "From your comments earlier in the call, it sounds like the booking pattern during the quarter improved, do I have that right? And then I have a follow-up.", "Jon A. Olson", "I think it kind of came out normal, kind of, I'll say, a normal quarter. We had a strong beginning and an okay third month of the quarter. And the second month is always a little lighter, vis-a-vis the first month of the quarter. So I wouldn't say it was exceptionally strong at the end. I think it was kind of average.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then to a degree there's normal with regard to seasonality anymore, can you remind us what you'd view as kind of a typical September quarter change sequentially?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, September is -- has been -- has a lot of -- has had a lot of different patterns for us in the past. We always have this effect of the industrial and smaller customers, particularly in Europe, getting a lot softer for us in September, in the September quarter. So June has been up. And I don't know if you look at history and seasonal, we're in the range of where we've been. And September sometimes has been down. But I'm not making any statement about September. Again, with all the CapEx spending growth that we believe is going to happen, it's way too early to know the timing of some of those programs to know about September.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Wu with Indaba Global Research.", "Unknown Analyst", "I've got one on Zynq because that's a new business for you and you're replacing existing processes. How should we think about the profitability of that business versus the FPGA business?", "Jon A. Olson", "At this point in time, what we've seen is it's pretty -- right now, it's pretty close to what -- from an end market by end market basis, to what the average is for each of our end markets. Now acknowledging that the first wave of business came from existing FPGA customers who are now substituting an FPGA and a processor for a Zynq product. So it's, I'll say there's some cannibalization going on relative to our FPGA business, but it is value-additive, because now we're getting the dollars for the processor as well. And so by and large, we aren't sensing any sort of downward pressure or difference. We have some designs where the value proposition is so high, we've been able to get a premium for it and in some situations where it's a more price sensitive.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Yes. And just to complete the thought there, the processor business is huge, and it goes all the way from the dirt-cheap microcontrollers to the ultra high-end, which obviously has very handsome margin. But we've targeted the middle of the market and so we have very intentionally stayed away from the profitless prosperity of the ultra low end, and we're making sure that the product, in of itself, targets markets where we believe that it's generally in line with our FPGA business. We're not targeting, at this point, neither do I expect to see in the future to target those ultra low end, dirt-cheap markets where we can sell billions of these but it's unlikely to enable us to sustain our model. So if you look at the way the product is designed, if you look at the power of processor there, which is actually a very formidable dual processor core, you can see why we're pretty confident in our ability to do that. And that's why we're not saying this is a couture product, it isn't. It's targeted for markets which are more in line with our typical markets.", "Unknown Analyst", "I see. Can I ask a quick follow-on. Do you treat that, the process CPU market, as a separate line item in your own internal business? Or do you see that as an ASP enrichment? So really it's, P&L-wise, it's still folded into your FPGA business.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Well, we look at it both ways that when you introduce a new product, which really is revolutionary and we were the first to do this way ahead of anyone with regards to product of this sort, and we now have been followed happily into this. But quite fundamentally, at this point, when you have a new product, you want to isolate it so you can accelerate your learning and it is looked at separately at this point. I do believe that over time, these markets do tend to converge. And  if you look at other technologies we've introduced in the past, where they were totally separate or they address a small niche of our applications, over time, those technologies have become widely used. And so DSP cores are now widely used, SerDes are widely used. So over time, I do expect it to converge and become closer to our core markets.", "Unknown Analyst", "Just one quick follow-up. Is there a need for you to expand into the 64-bit addressing that the ARM camp have just recently announced and does it help you in your customer base?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "More technology is always better, right? So I won't say it doesn't help us. But if you look at the product we have, it really has very broad applicability. And there is an emerging 64-bit market. And as this progresses, I wouldn't be surprised if, over time, we look at ways to address that. But this isn't a short-term need for our core market. Our core markets are more than adequately serviced by the existing architecture and its capabilities.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Ian Ing with Lazard Capital Markets.", "Tyler Radke - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "This is actually Tyler Radke on behalf of Ian Ing. My first question, as it relates to TSMC's 16-nanometer pull in. I'm just trying to understand how that changes your strategy with respect to 20-nanometers, and can you just kind of walk us through the puts and takes of that.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Okay. Why don't I answer that and if you could kindly raise your voice when you ask the second question, because you're very barely audible to us so we can hardly make it out. But we are very pleased with our success with 28-nanometer. We were first in the market. We have the broadest portfolio by far, we have the deepest portfolio by far, and we've demonstrated that even with a totally new foundry, we can come out and demonstrate leadership. Similarly on 20-nanometer, we've already announced some elements with regards to tape-out, where we believe we're going to be the first FPGA company to tape-out a 20-nanometer software. The software is there already. It's being used broadly by customers and a whole host of other things, which gives me tremendous confidence that in 20-nanometer we're going to be able to continue and extend that leadership and keep our generation ahead. And we have not announced anything yet on our plans beyond that, but rest assured that we are not resting on our laurels here, and we expect to continue to deliver leadership to our customers, and we will communicate that and our strategy when it behooves us. At this point in time, most of the design wins or a large plurality is in 28-nanometers. We'll continue to be there in that for some years going forward and then immediately after that, there's the 20 and we will make sure that we have a response for anything beyond that at the appropriate time.", "Tyler Radke - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So my second question, my follow-up, I don't want to beat the dead horse here but just as it relates to wired and carrier CapEx, obviously, I think you guys said wired was down more than expected but you expected it to be up next quarter. And as you look at obviously, AT&T and Verizon CapEx coming in a bit lighter than they'd hoped, do you think this is a function of late releases of their budgets and this stuff getting pushed out into June or is there something else, your customers are saying that we should be thinking about?", "Jon A. Olson", "Our specific method is and then our confidence about the next quarter was directly related to only a couple of customers' programs, that the timing was off from what we had thought. So I want to make another statement in a second, but I was going to make sure that it was clear not to read too much into my next statement, because there really is a macroeconomic overhang where people -- where the confidence in spending kind of ebbs and flows almost on a weekly or monthly basis. And that does end up with caution in our customers' ordering patterns and they always say they want to expedite and do something. And we are finding it harder and harder to nail down forecasts and trends on key programs just because of that secondary factor. But again, the fact that we were down, lower than expectations, and we're going -- when are we going to come back up some in wired is really related to a couple of specific programs at a couple of specific customers.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "And with regards to LTE deployment, one way of looking at it, and probably the best way is, as a customer, regardless of who's winning and who's not winning on the smartphone world, that world just continues to go through the roof. It generates huge demands on the infrastructure. Those infrastructural demands can only be addressed by, over time, moving to the newest generation technology. And to a large extent, we're seeing a commitment, a strategic commitment to do that and it's in each country, region. It happens at a different rate, but it definitely is happening. And to some extent, when you have a major -- in all of these companies, they have numerous carriers. At any point in time when one pulls ahead, it generates tremendous demand for the others to catch up. Otherwise, their service levels become unacceptable. And we're seeing that happen. So even if from time to time, they do need to watch their deployments, we see more of those dollars being directed at new technologies as opposed to upgrading old ones. So given our very strong 28-nanometer position and the larger percentage that we get, that tends to help us. So I am very bullish on that and I don't see that trend reversing itself anytime soon.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA.", "Ryan Goodman - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "This is Ryan Goodman for Srini. Just as a follow-on to that last question on wired, so it sounds like the macro is weighing a bit on maybe the enterprise demand -- enterprise demand within wired. Could you give an update on how the data center demand looks? And also last quarter, I think you had mentioned a large data center high-speed connectivity win that was supposed to ramp in the second half. Any update on that as well?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, so I think you characterized the wired accurately there. And relative to data center, our data center market is a new area for us, and it will take a little bit of time before it grows at a more accelerated rate. But when it does, some of the design wins we won already and are about to win is going to start to take off at a more accelerated rate, but that's going to be in the back half of the year and into next year. We have won the design -- any of the designs that we've talked about in Investor Day in New York, we're still either on track to win or have won because things are going very well, yes, and it is around high-speed connectivity as our biggest value add there. Now we have been in solid-state drives fairly broadly as controller units. That business continues to be very good for us across a variety of customers. But it ebbs and flows on individual customers' shipments, et cetera. But by and large, we're where we wanted to be on data center, but it's not the big part of our communications business at this point in time.", "Ryan Goodman - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just for another area, in industrial, looked pretty strong across the board. Just curious, how much of that do you think is coming from inventory replenishment versus sell-through demand? And how do feel about customer inventory levels now? Are you comfortable where they are going forward?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, I think given the fact that we're maybe a little bit of an outlier of calling the industrial recovery and we had it, I think quite a bit of maybe in the neighborhood of 2/3 was inventory replenishment. So we are seeing strong -- signs of stronger continued ordering patterns from some key customers there, which do lead me to believe there is sell-through going on in that particular end market category. I do not believe there is much inventory in the channel in that end market at all at this point. No build up.", "Rick Muscha", "Thanks for joining us today.

My name is Jay, and I will be your conference operator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Q1 Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]", "I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin.", "Rick Muscha", "Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We'll provide a financial and business review of the June quarter and then open the call for questions.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially.", "We refer you to documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.", "This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.", "Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.", "Jon A. Olson", "Thank you, Rick. In the June quarter, Xilinx sales were $579 million, up 9% sequentially and better than forecasted. Most of the sales upside was related to better-than-expected growth in wired communication, with aerospace and defense sales also stronger than expected.", "Sales from all geographies were up sequentially. Gross margin was higher than guided and a record 69% for the quarter. Roughly half of the gross margin upside is related to the result of margin expansion programs, which are yielding benefits faster than previously anticipated. The other half of the upside is product mix related.", "Operating expenses of 261 -- excuse me, $206 million includes amortization were in line with guidance. We were able to offset higher variable sales and profit-related expense with overall spending reduction.", "Operating margin was 33%, the highest since Q2 of fiscal year '11. New product sales drove most of the incremental sales growth during the quarter, increasing 24% sequentially. 28-nanometer sales exceeded $50 million, again, surpassing our forecast. Sales from this family were driven by all 5 family members, with Kintex family remaining the largest contributor.", "Our 40-, 45-nanometer node also posted double-digit sales increase, with strong growth from both Virtex-6 and Spartan-6. Mainstream products decreased during the quarter, and base products increased as a result of strength in specific aerospace and defense programs, as well as accelerated sales associated with the previously discussed foundry line closure.", "Let me now turn to a discussion of end markets. Sales from communication and data center increased 8% sequentially, better than forecasted as a result of strong wired communication sales. Wireless sales were flat sequentially, slightly stronger than we had anticipated due to a pickup in North America-based LTE activity.", "Industrial and aerospace and defense sales increased 10% sequentially, with strengths from all 3 subcategories. Defense sales were stronger than anticipated due to shipments associated with a specific government program. Broadcast, consumer and automotive was up 4% sequentially. Finally, the other category, which represents only 3% of our total sales, benefited from strong high-performance computing business during the quarter. Other income and expense was a net expense of $10 million, slightly higher than forecasted.", "Net income for the quarter was $157 million or $0.56 per share -- per diluted share. Operating cash flow for the December quarter was $144 million before $11 million in CapEx. We paid $66 million in cash dividends during the quarter.", "Diluted shares for the quarter were 280 million, 3 million higher than guided, primarily due to the impact of the higher stock price. There was an 11.1 million share dilutive effect from our convertible note due to the higher stock price. For questions related to the dilution associated with our convertibles, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com.", "Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased $110 million to approximately $3.5 billion. We have approximately $1.3 billion in convertible debt, and our net cash position is approximately $2.2 billion. Days sales outstanding increased 3 days in the June quarter to 42 days.", "Inventory dollars at Xilinx declined by $14 million sequentially. Combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution together were 105 days, down from 110 days in the prior quarter. We expect inventory dollars to be approximately flat in the September quarter.", "Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the September quarter of fiscal year '14. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up sequentially. We are expecting continued solid growth from new products, driven by 28-nanometer strength. Base and mainstream products are expected to be flat to slightly down sequentially.", "From an end-market perspective, we expect communications to be approximately flat, with wired --- wireless increases offsetting wired decreases. While we have begun to see increased activity associated with the China Mobile and China Telecom LTE deployments, we continue to expect those LTE deployments to be a more material contributor to sales in the December quarter.", "We expect industrial and aerospace and defense to be up, as growth from defense and tests are offset by decreases from ISM. Lastly, we expect broadcast, consumer and automotive to be approximately flat, with broadcast decreases offsetting increases from consumer and automotive.", "As a result, we are expecting total sales to be flat to up 3% sequentially, with sales from North America and Asia Pacific increasing, sales from Japan flat and sales from Europe down. The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 53%, consistent with our 4-year average.", "Gross margin is expected to be approximately 69%. Though we are not revising our long-term growth margin target of 64% to 66% at this time, we believe gross margin will be approximately at the June levels for the next few quarters, as a result of product mix and continued focus on margin improvement across our product families.", "Operating expenses in the September quarter is expected to be approximately $225 million, including $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. We are revising our OpEx guidance for the fiscal year due to higher variable spending associated with higher-than-anticipated sales and profitability. The new fiscal year '14 operating guidance is approximately $495 million in R&D, approximately $385 million in SG&A and $10 million of amortization for a total of approximately $890 million for the year.", "Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $9 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 284 million shares, and the tax rate for the June quarter is expected to be approximately 14%.", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. The 9% sequential growth in the June quarter was driven by increases in 6 of our secondary end markets. New product sales were exceptional during the quarter, increasing nearly 25% in the March quarter, 75% on a year-over-year basis. This growth was driven from both our 28-nanometer and our 40-, 45-nanometer product families, demonstrating widespread customer adoption in all application segments.", "28-nanometer sales comfortably exceeded $50 million, higher -- significantly higher than our expectation. Sales were driven by growth from all 5 product families, led by our midrange Kintex-7 and all components of our high-performance Virtex-7 product families.", "In the September quarter, we expect 28-nanometer to continue its accelerated growth, exceeding $60 million in sales. We remain confident that 28-nanometer sales will surpass our fiscal year goal for 2014 of $250 million, a goal we had established at our Analyst Day in March.", "The accelerated sales ramp and tremendous customer adoption clearly demonstrate that we have established a proven technology leadership formula with our 28-nanometer portfolio. With Vivado, we've created the industry's first SoC-strength tool suite, which enables unmatched time to integration and implementation, and a very significant improvement in the positive results over previous development environments.", "Second, leveraging our world-class partnerships with both TSMC and ARM have created the broadest portfolio of All-Programmable FPGAs, SoCs, and 3D ICs, offering an extra node of performance, lower power, superior connectivity and an absolute breakout in programmable systems integration.", "Lastly, we're enabling smarter next-generation system and an even better alternatives to both ASICS and ASSPs, with a combination of SmartCORE IP, our C-based design tools and embedded software running on our industry-leading ARM-based solutions.", "We recently announced the tape-out of the semiconductor industry's first 20-nanometer device and the PLD industry's first 20-nanometer All-Programmable device. We also implemented the industry's first ASIC-class programmable architecture called UltraScale. UltraScale devices enable next-generation smarter networking equipment, smarter vision systems, high-performance computing and intelligent surveillance and reconnaissance systems. These devices, when coupled with our Vivado design suite, will enable Xilinx to deliver another 1.5 to 2x system-level performance and integration value advantage, well ahead of any competition.", "In the June quarter, we also extended what has been world-class partnership with TSMC by announcing that we're working on a program called FinFast to create the fastest time-to-market and highest performance FPGAs to be built on TSMC's 16-nanometer FinFET process. We expect to deliver test chips later this year with first product coming in 2014.", "Having established proven leadership formula 28-nanometer and now expanding that formula with our next-generation architecture and product milestones, we are very well positioned to drive even more share gains against both ASICs, ASSPs and traditional PLD competition.", "Let me now turn the call back to the operator to open us up for the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Jon, my question, the first on gross margin. You said half is structural and half is product mix. So beyond the next few quarters that you have guided to should be -- what's the right way to think about it? 150 bp is variable, but the 150 from structural stays. And then I have a follow-up as well, please.", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, so we have -- we clearly have been focusing a lot on margin improvement programs across the company, as I said in my remarks, that starting -- some of them are coming a little earlier than we anticipated. And so what I was saying in the call about the gross margin forecast for the next few quarters, we do expect it to be in the neighborhood of 69% at the June quarter. And it is driven by a combination of continued structural improvements that I expect will continue to improve in -- as we go throughout the year, and then the impact from the product mix will be a little variable as you go quarter-to-quarter. But I would expect over this coming quarter, that impact starts to decline a little bit. And because you have one positive trend and one trend that's moderating a little bit, we think we can keep the margins in the neighborhood of 69%, flat for a while.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, okay, that's helpful, because -- so the key takeaway is that the half from structural is not done yet. You're still working on that part.", "Jon A. Olson", "Oh, absolutely, and I see additional benefits out in time for us there.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, good. And then a follow-up for you, Moshe. As we think through, and especially in the context of what Vivado is helping you do, as we think through the next node, 28 and beyond that, where does the mix for the business going to look like? Because right now, most of the time, we spend on the comp side, but is industrial and auto and all the other segments finally getting to a point that you see them becoming a bigger proportion for the -- and then what would the mix be in 28 and beyond?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "So 28-nanometer is the broadest and the deepest node we've ever had, and it benefits all of our businesses. But they tend to benefit from it at a different pace. They all benefit from it, but the ones which clearly have a lead in our communications at this point. And of course, some ASIC prototyping, which was the very early product offering, and that continues now we're sort of seeing other markets like test and measurement start to pick up, and we expect wired communications to pick up too. You are right in that if you sort of look at it from 30,000 feet, [indiscernible], then communications is the biggest benefactor at this point from 28-nanometer, and the other markets will benefit over time. And the Zynq products offering, in particular, will have a very significant impact on industrial, scientific and medical. And then some of the others like military, aero just tend to take quite a bit longer, as does medical to translate into revenue. As you move forward, the product offering tends to have a higher end component to it where communications will benefit more from that than some of the other markets. So I would say that the 28-nanometer, you've yet to see the other markets emerge in force. It's just starting. It's less than 10% of our revenue at this point in time, and it's growing rapidly. 20 will lead with communications, and it will take a little longer for the other markets to manifest themselves.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura.", "Sanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "This is Sanjay Chaurasia for Romit Shah. Moshe, one question I have for you, if you could provide any color on the wireline side of the business. It seems like it was the driver. Any color around if it was tied to any specific deployment and to service provider in enterprise [ph] or in technology, 10G versus 40G would be great.", "Jon A. Olson", "Sanjay, let me grab that one. So first, I would say that our wireline and data center business was very -- the increases were broadly distributed around customers. So if you look at the top 20 communications customers, of which there are quite a few wireline contributors in that more than the wireless, is pretty concentrated on a few names for us. But just the wireline, more than 75% of those -- of the customers that are in the top 20 showed an increase this quarter. So it wasn't just one technology or one application. We have made tremendous progress in 40-gig and 100-gig, since you brought those up, and particularly with our OTN-related IP is driving us to a tremendous number of design wins in that category. And some of those are starting to get into a preproduction kind of phase. But I have to say that if you look at the names of the tier 1s and even tier 2s, with communications customers in the wireline side, we saw quite a bit of growth, very broadly distributed.", "Operator", "The next question on the line comes from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Ryan Carver - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "This is Ryan Carver in for John. Just a question on the linearity in the quarter. The data points seem to imply that April was a pretty good quarter and May was a pretty good quarter, but maybe there was some falloff in June. Can you talk about -- a bit about your linearity in the quarter and just kind of, if you saw any of that or something different to that?", "Jon A. Olson", "Ryan, June was actually pretty -- the quarter was pretty linear from a historic perspective. And in fact, at times, we've seen June fall off towards the end as it goes into the summer from -- particularly from an industrial perspective and, in some respect, some of the communication equipment. And we didn't really see any kind of fallout whatsoever. So June for us was, I would say, a very, very solid quarter because -- I mean, we ended up being over the top of our guidance a few points, right? So it certainly showed strength throughout the month of June, maybe more than we had modeled as we walked into the beginning of the quarter.", "Ryan Carver - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And just as my follow-up question, on the OpEx side, when you took up -- I mean, I think the guide for the September quarter was a bit above expectations. When you took up the full year numbers, it looks like around a lot of R&D. But even as a percentage of revenue, it looks like it came up a little bit. How should we think about sort of R&D, specifically, the percentage of revenue? And -- I mean, is this the new run rate that we should expect? Or is this sort of a peaker, a peaking time around 20-nanometer and should expect that to fall off? And I guess, how should we think about this sort of OpEx levels kind of trending over the next couple of quarters?", "Jon A. Olson", "For the near term, our OpEx will -- the second half of the year by quarter will look pretty similar to our forecast for the September quarter. So we're forecasting $225 million. It's going to be pretty flat, maybe up just a tad in the second half on a quarterly basis but relatively flat to that. And what's happening underlying that is we start to get incrementally more mass expense in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. And the first half of the year ends up with more variable impact from profitable variable kinds of things, bonuses, et cetera, because of the -- that's directly tied to our op margins from an employee bonus perspective. And so what's actually happening in the second half is the underlying I&D -- R&D, not the variable piece, but the contribution from developing and launching products goes up somewhat and the variable expenses moderate a little bit.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "I'm hoping you can dig into the TD-LTE opportunity for us. It seems like we didn't see the strength from that this quarter as anticipated in the next quarter, also not a big impact but something bigger, you said, starting in December. Can you help us think about the potential upside there? And as we've seen the bid for one of the big carriers, investors have contemplated competitive moves by the others to drive a more robust growth opportunity in that end market. Can you comment as to whether you've seen any of that?", "Jon A. Olson", "Sure, let me -- we'll be happy to do that. The China TD-LTE business, we've been saying for some time that it was a second half of our fiscal year growth for us. So the December quarter and the March quarter for us was where the ramp would take place, so beginning in the September-October time frame. And at this point in time, we still have that same view that's been pretty consistent for us for the last 6 months, but that's been our view. Even though I know various other companies and other parts of Wall Street have tried to forecast acceleration, that will be pulled into the summer, et cetera, we've never really seen that. We've shipped in the March quarter and -- particularly and a little bit in the June quarter, we have shipped in with some prototype and early production for some of the early city trials that they're doing. And we certainly acknowledge the fact that the bids have now gone out at least for one of the suppliers, and so this process is moving along, I would say, pretty much as we had thought it would. And we're not -- I'm not trying to say we've got a great crystal ball and we know precisely what's going on, but it is relatively consistent with our view of the world. Now relative to the speed of the ramp, now we still believe there's the 200,000 base stations that are going to get deployed, and there's a lot of conversation around, are some of them upgradable from the old generation and the new generations? Those are very difficult things to know because it depends on which manufacturer, OEM, gets the business and which -- whether the provider decides to pursue some sort of a hybrid upgrade strategy. There's all these different articles written about how it could be done and whatever. At this point, it's not really clear how that's going to work out. We're very confident with our design win levels at all the manufacturers that we believe will be providing units. And again, we see the ramp beginning in the September, October timeframe for us.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.", "Sameer Kalucha - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "This is Sameer Kalucha calling in for Chris Danely. One question on the share count. It has been creeping up, so I'm wondering how much is that from the convert? And how does it -- or how do we expect it to trend forward? Are there going to be any buybacks to bring it back to the earlier levels?", "Jon A. Olson", "Well, clearly, in the last several quarters, the impact has been a great deal from -- disproportionately from the convert versus other sources that have been driving it up. Now we do have some anti-dilutive protection in one of the 2 debt offerings that, from an accounting perspective, doesn't end up showing in the diluted shares. But that being said, it's really being driven more by the converts than anything else. And as the stock price goes up more, then more of it gets into the money in terms of the bigger way. We are still committed, as we've said consistently, to a share repurchase and a dividend program to return cash to shareholders. And we are still committed to buying back at least $150 million of stock for fiscal year, and I'll just leave it at that.", "Operator", "Next, we have Anil Doradla with William Blair.", "Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "A couple of questions. Moshe, how would you address the concerns from some quarters, saying that the industry can skip 20 nanometers and go from 28 to the 14, 16 FinFET? And the follow-up question was, was there any end-of-life for last-time buys? During the quarter, did you benefit from that?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Okay. So no, if you look at the -- our current plans, we expect the next offering to be split over 2 nodes. It will be our UltraScale 20 and our UltraScale 16. And we are basically making sure that for the product offering, which benefits from the ultimate in terms of performance, then it's the 16 node, that, that will be a more expensive node and hence, the more cost-sensitive applications, are better serviced by 20-nanometer. And we're just splitting the family -- our next family across those 2. There'll be a very broad product offering at 20-nanometer and being first, and we believe actually having a larger lead now than we had at 28-nanometer node. We expect to have a very strong position at 20-nanometer. And we'll continue with our plans and committed to moving forward. And we, being in the lead, other companies have different strategies. But generally, I believe, for FPGAs, there's a huge benefit from -- going from 28 to 20, and that will be available -- as we tape out now, that will be available to our customers to start design, and they're already starting designs. And if they wait for nodes after that, that delays them by quite a significant period of time. So I think it's a very viable node for FPGAs. In other industries, in particular, ASSPs, I can see why for the very high performance, maybe graphics, they would want to skip straight to the 16-nanometer node. And that would make sense for them. For us, both nodes have their benefits, and we're splitting the business across them.", "Jon A. Olson", "I'll handle the second part of the question. So Anil, the situation we talked about some time ago is that one of our boundaries is end-of-life-ing [ph] a line. We were kind of the last man standing, and we've gotten to the point now where we cannot start any more wafers in that line. And so we've accumulated a significant amount of inventory for our customers, but this isn't what I would call our typical end-of-life for products. This is something that was accelerated by the fact the foundry was -- stopped producing products for us, so we've built a lot of inventory and are getting forecast and commitments from our customers, and we'll be delivering those products over an extended amount of time. So I'm talking about many, many quarters out in time. So you're not going to see, at least certainly anywhere in the near term, some giant pop and then a reversal of fortunes downstream. If you -- a good way to look at this is to look at our base product family. And if you look at the base products, which is where -- which is part of the base product family, is this particular set of products, and you'll see that the base products went up about $20 million quarter-on-quarter. Of that, about $10 million of that was related to an acceleration, if you will, over a normal run rate that certain customers decided to take part ahead of price increases. But the other $10 million was driven by strength in aerospace and defense business and the specific A&D program that continue to buy our legacy parts in order to ship into some of the larger programs that we've won historically, which will continue again for many years, because these are very large programs that the government is going to continue. So the real short of the answer -- to answer the question, there was some impact to that to both revenue and gross margin, but we don't expect this to be some sort of a leading, large pop that's here and then goes away in the following quarter.", "Operator", "Next, we have the line of Sumit Dhanda with ISI Group.", "Ian Eigenbrod - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "This is Ian in for Sumit. Did you guys say how much Q2 was helped by the specific government programs?", "Jon A. Olson", "We did not say that. I did just comment on the answer to the previous question that there was about $10 million in our base product family that was incremental. I'd say, actually, compared to what we thought at the beginning of the quarter, about $10 million of business came in on a project that we weren't expecting. But there was actually another project that was in the neighborhood of the same size. So we continue to see improvement in our defense business, which I think maybe is a sign that the sequestration concerns and fears that may have been making the suppliers a little more reticent have loosened up a little bit. And we're forecasting defense to be up again in this September quarter as well. So we're seeing good contribution from the defense systems.", "Operator", "Next, we have the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.", "Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "This is Gabriela Borges on behalf of Jim. I was hoping to follow up on your commentary on wireless CapEx. You mentioned your expectation for China, but I was hoping you could also provide some color on trends in North America and perhaps more broadly in other geographies as well?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, from an overall LTE perspective, we've been doing really well with the whole North America rollout, as well as South Korea and Japan. And it -- everybody's kind of wanted to say, \"Oh, where is the big increase coming out of North America?\" We've had, in our wireless business for quite a few quarters, very strong contribution for the rollout of Verizon and LTE -- excuse me, Verizon and AT&T. And then as Sprint starts to kick in, I think that will be some incremental. So we've got a really nice North America business that has a little bit of lumpiness, and we continue to see that strength go on for the next several quarters at least. So that's very good. We've seen, of late, some strength out of the South Korea area. And as I mentioned earlier, we're yet to see anything significant out of the China deployment. A couple of quarters ago, we did ship into some trials for Europe, but we've not seen any significant signs of any build from a European perspective at this point in time.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Glen Yeung with Citigroup.", "Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "A question for you on your visibility, looking at your market share potential in the China business, given the design wins that you've seen today and the progress you've made with Kintex, what's your confidence that in this next deployment, whatever the size, whatever the timing, that your share position will be better than the last time?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "The -- Glen, the question is related to China or generally speaking?", "Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes. I'm sorry, the China LTE buildout.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Okay, okay. So we're very confident that it's going to be a lot better than it was in the previous node. The Kintex product is the winning product in terms of its cost and performance and power and was designed specifically to address the wireless market. It actually is also beneficial for others, but it's definitely a clear winner there. And with regards to wireless, in particular, we're expecting a very high percentage of the wireless LTE business in China to use Kintex. If you compare it to the 40-nanometer, I would say, it's several times in terms of percentage of what we got. And I think we, at most, had 20%-ish before.", "Jon A. Olson", "It was -- in the early part of the 3G rollout in China, it was higher. And then it declined as designs moved to 40-nanometer. It started out in 65, and then they moved to 40 in China. And that's where we were disadvantaged with that product family. And the way that the LTE is going to roll out is that at the beginning, there will be some -- in certain supplier -- OEMs, there will be some 40-nanometer product, again, where we're disadvantaged. But they'll all be transitioning to 28-nanometer relatively rapidly over the initial few quarters, and we're very confident of our share position with the 28-nanometer win.", "Operator", "Next, we have the line of Ruben Roy with Mizuho Securities.", "Ruben Roy - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Jon, I just wanted to clarify one thing around the $10 million of base business that you talked about being incremental. Are you expecting any of that? Or is there any of that continuing into your fiscal Q2, that's implicit in your guidance or no?", "Jon A. Olson", "So what I would characterize being for the aerospace and defense business, that part of that increase in base of $20 million -- the $10 million of the $20 million was due to some specific aerospace and defense projects, and then we do expect a strong up defense business. And some of them will be in base, some of them will be in mainstream products. So we do expect a strong, healthy defense business. The $10 million that I was characterizing as -- was more along the broad-based foundry EOL. We do expect that to continue into the next quarter. But again, we're forecasting base to be overall kind of flat to down-ish. So we aren't expecting any sort of big pops from this particular EOL that will go on for quite a long time.", "Operator", "Next, we have the line of Ian Ing with Lazard Capital Markets.", "Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "So revenue estimate's likely going up nicely this year. It seems most of the upside is 40- and 45-nanometer design wins. It seems 40 and 45 is up 20% this quarter, and it looks like, this year, you're still on track for $250 million in that 28. Is that sort of the right framework we should think of?", "Jon A. Olson", "Your latter statement is correct. But no, the growth that we've experienced overall is very strong 28-nanometer. We happen to have a slightly stronger contribution from 40, 45. But I don't -- I would expect, over the fiscal year, revenue growth horizon that 28 becomes the much more rapid growth vector for us.", "Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Okay, so north of $50 million this quarter and still on track for $250 million for the full year.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "We were explicit that we were well north of $50 million, and we set a target of $60 million. And we've beaten all of our targets to date. Our target for the year is $250 million, and we're very confident about beating that target.", "Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then, Moshe, with the efforts at 16 and 20 nanometers at the same time, maybe you could articulate the benefits that the FinFETs give you? You said these are more for the expensive high-end parts, so is that -- is it sort of a logic shrink or lower power solutions, more integration?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Really, as you move from technology to technology, the benefits you get are typically lower power and higher performance, and achieving lower cost is more difficult and actually requires re-architecting your system and designing it from scratch to fully exploit the benefits of that. And some customers can do it, and some customers find that more difficult and it's a higher effort. If you compare 16 to 20, then 16 has the FinFET. And 16 will undoubtedly have even higher performance and lower power than 20. But 16 inherently is a more complex manufacturing process, and FinFETs are more difficult to design and require more manufacturing steps. Hence, they cost more. So you can achieve higher performance. You can achieve lower power. You can modulate between those 2. It's difficult for a given design to achieve cost reduction. So by definition, 16-nanometer addresses the high end of the product offering: communications -- Mil/Aero wired communications, Mil/Aero test and measurement, prototyping and less the other markets we address.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time. I turn the call back to the presenters.", "Rick Muscha", "Great. Thanks for joining us today. We have a playback of this call beginning at 5 p.m. Pacific Time, 8 p.m. Eastern Time today.

New product sales were particularly stronger in the quarter, increasing 22% sequentially or by almost $40 million. 28-nanometer sales surpassed $80 million, with material sales from all 5 product families.", "Sales from our midrange family, Kintex, were particularly strong, driven by wireless applications, but with significant traction from wired communications, industrial, scientific and medical, audiovideo broadcast and consumer applications.", "Sales of our 40-nanometer and 45-nanometer products, Virtex-6 and Spartan-6, also increased during the quarter, with exceptionally strong sales from Spartan-6. Sales from the mainstream and base categories both declined sequentially.", "From a geographic perspective, sales from all geographies, with the exception of Europe, were up. From an end market perspective, sales from communications and data center increased 2% sequentially, slightly better than our flat guidance.", "Wireless sales increased sequentially during the quarter, driven by initial China LTE activity. Wired sales were slightly better than anticipated as a result of new product momentum, particularly in the areas of metro and access. Industrial and aerospace and defense sales increased 6% sequentially to a record 38% of total sales, driven by a broad base of applications, including defense, surveillance and test and measurement.", "Lastly, broadcast, consumer and automotive was up 5% sequentially, driven by increases in consumer and automotive applications, which were partially offset by an expected decline in broadcast sales.", "Gross margin was a record 69.5% for the quarter, better than guided due to broad-based margin improvements that are collectively contributing to material gross margin expansion. We are particularly pleased with margin improvement in our new products category. The combination of our 28-nanometer process choice, engagement with TSMC and our optimized scalable architecture has enabled rapid yield improvement on 28-nanometer products.", "Operating expenses were $252 million, including amortization of $2.4 million. Also included in the operating expenses was a $29 million charge for enhanced damages associated with the Q4 fiscal year '12 judgment on a patent case. Our intention is to appeal the court's decision.", "Other income and expense was a net expense of $11 million, slightly higher than forecast due primarily to lower interest income than planned. Net income for the quarter was $141 million or $0.49 per diluted share, including a $0.09 per diluted share impact associated with the previously mentioned litigation charge. Offsetting the litigation charge was a tax benefit of $8 million or $0.03 per diluted share primarily associated with a release of reserves related to the federal R&D tax credit.", "Operating cash flow for September was $255 million before $8 million in CapEx during the quarter. Diluted shares for the quarter were 291 million, higher than guided due primarily to the impact of the higher stock price. We repurchased $70 million of stock during the quarter. There was a 17 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes due to the higher stock price. For questions relating to the dilution associated with our convertibles, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com.", "Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased $225 million to approximately $3.7 billion. We have approximately $1.3 billion in convertible debt, and our net cash position is approximately $2.4 billion. Days sales outstanding remained flat in the September quarter at 42 days.", "Inventory dollars at Xilinx declined by $3 million sequentially. Combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution were 102 days, down from 105 days in the prior quarter. We expect inventory dollars to be approximately flat in the December quarter.", "Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for December quarter of FY '14. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up slightly sequentially. We are expecting continued growth from our 28-nanometer product families. Base and mainstream products are expected to be down. From an end market perspective, we expect communications to be up sequentially, with equal contributions from wired and wireless applications.", "As a result of 28-nanometer portfolio strength, China LTE activity is expected to increase materially during the quarter. However, the overall growth rate of the wireless subsegment will be offset in part by a reduction in prior generation sales from a large customer.", "After 4 consecutive growth quarters in industrial and aerospace and defense, we expect this category to decline sequentially, driven by decreases from all 3 secondary markets: test, defense and ISM.", "Lastly, we expect broadcast, consumer and automotive to be slightly down as consumer decreases offset AVB and automotive increases. Lastly, we're expecting the other category to be up. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be approximately flat sequentially, plus or minus 2 percentage points, with sales from APAC and Japan up and sales from North America and Europe down.", "The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 53%, consistent with our 4-year average. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 69%. Though we are not revising our long-term gross margin target of 64% to 66% at this time, we believe gross margin will continue to be around 69% for the next few quarters as a result of product mix and continued focus on margin improvement across our product families.", "Operating expenses in the December quarter are expected to be approximately $225 million, including $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. We expect our R&D and SG&A guidance for FY '14 to be approximately $490 million in R&D, approximately $385 million in SG&A with $10 million of amortization.", "Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $9 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 291 million shares. The tax rate for the December quarter is expected to be approximately 13%.", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you, all. I'm pleased that we delivered revenue at the high end of our guidance, coupled with record gross margin. Overall, new product sales were truly outstanding, increasing 22% over the June quarter, doubling on a year-over-year basis. They now represent 36% of our total sales.", "This growth was driven by exceptionally strong sales of our 28-nanometer product generation, which comfortably exceeded $80 million, totally eclipsing both the previous quarter's results and our original $60 million target.", "Sales were driven by old 28-nanometer families. These include our midrange Kintex-7, old members of our high-performance Virtex-7, our high-volume Artix-7 product family and Zynq, the industry's first All Programmable SoC. This tremendous growth of 28-nanometer revenue continues the momentum from the June quarter, where we already had delivered more than 70% of 28-nanometer PLD share.", "In the December quarter, we expect 28-nanometer sales to continue to ramp at an accelerated rate, reinforcing our confidence that this node will be by far the most successful in our history. We're confident that our 28-nanometer revenue will exceed $90 million in the December quarter.", "The widespread customer adoption and aggressive revenue ramp are clear examples of the transformation we've made from a supplier delivering programmable logic to one that is enabling All Programmable and smart systems. These results unequivocally demonstrate that in 28-nanometer, we're a generation ahead in terms of silicon, design tools, IT and the commensurately higher value we deliver to our customers.", "In parallel, we have already delivered several industry firsts at the upcoming 20-nanometer node. These include the tape-out of the industry's first 20-nanometer All Programmable device back in the June quarter; the development of the industry's first ASIC-class programmable architecture called UltraScale; and the capability to enable devices co-optimize with our Vivado Design Suite that enables another 1.5x to 2x system-level performance and integration value.", "This past quarter, we were very encouraged by numerous successful competitive customer valuations with our 20-nanometer UltraScale devices. Coupled with a significant time-to-market advantage, we clearly have another generation of technology leadership, both in the midrange and, in particular, the high end of our 20-nanometer product offering.", "In addition, our FinFast program extends our world-class partnership with TSMC to create the fastest time-to-market, highest-performance FPGAs built on TSMC's 16-nanometer FinFET process. The 16-nanometer FinFET combined TMSC's multi-year lead intensity with double patterning with the advantages what FinFET transistors for performance provides. We're combining the 16-nanometer process with our new UltraScale architecture, Vivado tool advantages, our multiyear leadership in SoC and 3D IC technology and our SmartCORE IP to provide the best solution for programmable systems integration, our customers' mandate for the FinFET node.", "Let me now turn the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Romit Shah.", "Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Jon, I just wanted to get some more color on the decline. I guess it's an older product revenue stream that's coming down this quarter. Could you just -- any color you can provide on which vertical or customer -- why the decline is happening now. And does this headwind go away after the December period?", "Jon A. Olson", "So, Romit, let me make sure I understand your question. This is about the decline from a large customer of older products on the wireless segment?", "Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Correct.", "Jon A. Olson", "Okay. Yes. So I just want to make sure that I had it straight. So, yes, what's happening here is we are seeing the pickup of LTE business in China. As we talked about this in the past, we thought it would begin in September, October. And in the September quarter, we did see, I would say, the beginning of it, and then we do believe we'll have acceleration of that as we go into December and then follow on in March. The offset to that is the business transition that's going on at the large European wireless customer where we had been shipping 65-nanometer products in large quantities into the LTE designs there. And as we've said in the past, we've lost the socket at 40-nanometer and there's a transition that's going on at that customer away from us for certain designs and towards our competitor. And so, what we're signaling here is over this past quarter and into next quarter is that, that revenue is starting -- is coming down some. And we believe by the time we get to the end of the December quarter, we'll have essentially bottomed out, for the most part, in that transition because we didn't have -- we relate with the product family of 40-nanometer and we didn't win those sockets as we did from the previous generation.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer.", "Ryan Carver - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "This is Ryan Carver for John. Just to kind of follow up on that question a little bit. I mean, is this decline at this other large European customer potentially impacting your attach rate to the LTE build-out in China? I guess, maybe broadly, I mean, how should we look at sort of the rollout in China? Is it going to be more 40 than 28 in terms of the process? Or maybe you could just sort of help us out with -- or sort of, from a node perspective, what kind of stories we should expect? And when the 40 to 28 transition should happen in terms of the China LTE rollout?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. Well, this decline that we're referring to from the European customer will not have any significant effect on the China position for Xilinx at all. I mean, that -- the number of the allocation, as best as we can tell, to the European-based manufacturers is pretty small in China. And so, we continue to be really bullish, very bullish on our position in China. The initial rollout of technology in China LTE at some customers, some manufacturers, primarily one, is a combination of 40 and 28. But that transition -- that large customer transitions to 28 pretty rapidly. And pretty much from the rest of the Chinese manufacturers, the other 4 manufacturers are coming out of the sheet with 28-nanometer products, which is largely ours. So we still believe we're going to have, by far, the most significant PLD share of the China LTE rollout, and this phenomenon that I'm referring to with the European manufacturer doesn't really impact that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung.", "Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Jon, I'm just going to keep popping away on the same issue. I'm wondering if you could give us a sense as to the dollar value of the loss in Ericsson. And then, as you say it bottoms out in the December quarter, does that tell us something about the March quarter? And as much, is that no longer a drag on the business? And you said that China will continue its momentum. Do you expect China to actually -- China LTE to actually be up quarter-on-quarter in the March quarter based on what you can see at this point?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. So again, if you look at our -- the fact that our communications business increased this quarter, and we actually -- most of -- the biggest part of the increase was in the wireless segment. So even with the decline of the European customer, we still grew wireless quarter-on-quarter. And again, we're forecasting the wireless to be up again a little bit in the December quarter. And having worked through most of the decline from the European customer, then that would indicate that -- assuming there's China business growth going on in March, that would be reflected more fully in terms of a bigger growth percentage in the wireless business for us in the March quarter. So I'm kind of putting all these things together. Really, it's kind of -- turns out to be around a 2-quarter transition of what we're experiencing here.", "Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "But, Jon, can you quantify how much it was?", "Jon A. Olson", "I'm not going to get into the quantification of that now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Jon, you guys have been signaling about -- talking about this share loss at 40. But beyond that, focusing on LTE, and we always see the fits and starts, you said that you expect the China LTE to -- can accelerate through December and March. What gives you the confidence that, that will happen? And then, my quick follow-up is, we've been picking up that lead times had been stretching out for some of your -- actually for the Kintex-7 and Virtex-5. Could you please comment if that's true or not? And where are the lead times?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. So the rate -- Ambrish, the pace of the rollout is obviously dependent on, one, the OEMs, how fast the OEMs are going to be shipping into China Mobile and how fast the other providers come online as well. So we kind of have a 1 quarter at a time visibility, and the current forecast for this current -- this quarter that we're in right now and the following quarter do indicate a nice healthy ramp for us. So I mean, we're just -- we're going to base on what they're telling us. And the story seems to be consistent from all 5 of the major suppliers that account for 90% of what's going on. The Chinese manufacturers account for essentially 90% of that. And I'm -- and we're talking [indiscernible] in Shanghai Bell [ph] is 1 of the Chinese manufacturers where we have very strong position as well. So the forecasts are all very consistent, and they're all -- I mean, these are all up into the right for the next couple of quarters. So that's the basis with which I'm making that statement. And then, with respect to lead times, there's no doubt that, as Moshe just talked about, we are definitely doing well in the 28-nanometer revenue at a higher rate and it's ramping faster than we had even anticipated. And that has put some tension in the supply chain in terms of lead times. But at this point in time, we don't see anything ahead of us that's going to be able -- that's going to restrict us from hitting the numbers that we need to hit for 28-nanometer, although it is a little on the tight side.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "So you're getting enough capacity from TSMC on that?", "Jon A. Olson", "We are definitely getting enough capacity from TSMC. But the question is, is how fast -- how good are we at forecasting what part in ordering ahead of time enough that we are getting really good support from our foundry.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Jon, first, now that there is more news around China LTE and some scope and timing of base station rollouts, is it sort of coming in line with your expectations or you still think it's a quarter-by-quarter kind of visibility?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. So we've all -- there's been lots of things written about the pace of how fast this is going to happen and the rates to 200,000 base stations installed in a very short time period. We have never held that position. We have always held the position that this is going to be a multiple quarter rollout, and it was going to take the neighborhood of anywhere from 4 to 6 quarters to roll out this first phase. And we still maintain that it is -- it appears to be on a pace like it's more like a 4-quarter or so than it is. It's all going to be a rocket ship tomorrow. And a lot of that has got to be related to the fact that all of the front-end logistics requires that ordering patterns of all the manufacturers for silicon and other things that go into it. And so, we think it's on the pace that we would have -- we've been thinking about it and we've been forecasting, which is a multiple quarter rollout.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And as my follow-up, perhaps...", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Schneider.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Jon, I will need to get you to maybe provide some quantification of what revenue you saw from the China Mobile rollout into the September quarter and then roughly what you're expecting in terms of magnitude for the December quarter.", "Jon A. Olson", "So, Jim, I'm not going to get into any specific dollars per se. But I mean, again, we've been -- we have been -- we've had, I would say, a relatively low level of shipments over the previous several quarters, a little choppy, as they were doing some of their prototypes. And you've -- you look at the fact that our comms business overall is about the same level that it has been, so 43%, 44% kind of a range. And so, you can imagine that we're not talking about $30 million, $40 million kinds of growth sequentially quarter-on-quarter; it's a much smaller level than that, again, with this slow ramp. And that's about as much as I think I want to say about it. I don't want get into start talking about individual shipments to individual customers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ruben Roy.", "Ruben Roy - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Jon, on the 28-nanometer product related to the China LTE build-out, would you say that most of the equipment that you're selling into today related to China LTE specifically is 28-nanometer? And then, as a follow-up to that, in terms of the customer that you talked about that was shipping some 40, some 28. And you guys are expecting a rapid transition to 28, do you expect that transition to happen in this 4- to 6-quarter first phase of rollout?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. So pretty much everything we're shipping into the China LTE business is our 28-nanometer product, and it's actually a combination of Kintex and Zynq in some situations. So those are the 2 leading product families. So pretty much 100% of that -- of what we're shipping in there is 28-nanometer. On the transition for the -- to the large manufacturer that's going from 40 to 28, we would expect that to happen probably within the first -- within the next quarter or so, 2 quarters -- or probably 2 quarters more of those sockets starting to move to the 28-nanometer designs.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri.", "Srini Pajjuri - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Jon, just to follow up on that. You said that you're shipping Kintex and Zynq. My understanding is that some of these base stations actually use higher end parts. I'm just wondering if you're shipping Kintex and Zynq because the initial rollout is going to be only radios as opposed to base stations.", "Jon A. Olson", "Well, I mean, the value proposition that we are delivering in the base station arena for both radio and baseband cards and backhaul is in focus a lot on the performance of the fabric. And so, we are -- since we have a high-performance fabric on our midrange product, which is a differentiator, and it has a lot of DSP intensity, which is what's required to do all these waveform processing, if you will, really, Kintex is ideal. We've designed it -- that part to be -- to hit the sweet spot of what was required. The reason Zynq is in there is because Zynq also carries an additional processing capability in addition to DSP, and that's obviously being used, in some cases, to even enhance the offering from certain customers. So when you think about high end, you need to think about what attributes of the high end are important. And the most important attributes of the high end to the base stations are the DSP capability and the overall fabric speed. And the SerDes capability is, I would say, lower speed SerDes required. So this is why we decided to make Kintex focused on that -- those particular attributes and therefore that application. And that's where we differentiate ourselves from our competitor primarily, where they end up having to use higher-end parts.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla.", "Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "When I look at your 28-nanometers, can you share with us how much revenues you got from prototyping? And as we exit 2014, if you look at China build-outs, what would you say your market share would be on the LTE rollout when it comes to 28-nanometers?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Okay. So let me take that, give Jon a little well-deserved rest. As you look at our offering this past quarter, prototyping was just about 10%. It's great business, we love it and it's recurring business in that we have the biggest designs, the biggest parts. And as long as we have the biggest parts, that continues because there is even a market for it. Having said that, it's now a small part of our business and has been a small part of our business for several quarters now. By far, the largest portion is Kintex and the entire Virtex product offering is catching up at this point in time. As you look at LTE, we designed Zynq particularly for that product offering. And as you look at the midrange past quarter, we actually had, I believe, 90% shipments. And we would be very disappointed if it drops below 80%. And so -- and that's what is the best product for LTE out there. So that's how we look at it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of William Stein.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "I'm wondering if we can talk about gross margins for a sec. You have pretty consistently been beating the target range, not taking that down but highlighting you'll stay in the same high range for a few more quarters. What would potentially bring that back down to the range? In other words, why not up the range to approximately where you've been recently and where you expect to be in the next couple of quarters?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes, so -- well, this is really around -- one around visibility and the trends in our business of where we're competing at. So in the past, we've talked about the successes we've had against not only ASIC written displacement, but ASSPs. And as we get more familiar with working in -- through some of those sockets. It does have some slightly different business characteristics relative to margin profile, depending on the sockets. In other words, the value proposition for an FPGA is worth something -- worth a premium, though maybe not as much of a premium in certain kinds of situations. So we really are -- we're not foreshadowing anything of that going down because we're in this. It's really more one around visibility of what we can see ahead of us. We are not intentionally planning on reducing the gross margin. We don't have anything, \"Oh, it's going to drop off the table in 2 or 3 quarters.\" That's not what we're trying to signal. It's really one around visibility as the composition of the new business we've been winning.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely.", "Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I know you're not getting into the specifics around any of the customers but -- so just to clarify, in terms of the China build, did the product transition at the large European wireless OEMs -- I'm just trying to dance around the name here. Did the product transition there, did that completely negate any growth in China in Q4? And then, when would you expect the revenue to peak from the China LTE build-out?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. So either quarter, actuals of September and our forecast for December, the decline in the European customer does not negate the increases from China. We are growing China faster than the decline. And so, I think that answered your question. And the next one is, when do we think the peak is going to be? I really don't know how to model the subsequent wave beyond the first 200,000 base stations. If I think about the 200,000 base station number, I mean, it kind of feels like the peak is going to be somewhere in the middle of next year, but I don't have a really solid view of that because, again, we're just starting it out now and I don't really have as much customer feedback of how things are going with a customer's customer at this point in time. Maybe in another quarter, I'll have a better view of that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Going back to a prior question, do you expect Virtex-7 to contribute meaningfully in any 4G whether it's in China or elsewhere? And as such, do you see the market moving to the high end of the 28-nanometer range for communication application, or do you expect the current mix to be prevailing into next year?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "We expect the Virtex to start growing at a faster rate. It already is significant. If you look at all of the Virtex product families. But Kintex is still larger. Virtex primarily is targeted at non-wireless applications, so -- and the wireless applications tend to happen a little earlier and a little faster. The Virtex ones, we expect in 2014 and relatively early in 2014 to start to accelerate, and those are just -- it's a broad set of applications, and Virtex addresses them both. So military is another one which tends to take a little longer. The high-end applications generally have a long qualification time, whereas the midrange, which is the wireless, tend to happen faster. Virtex, we are on plan and doing actually very well there, and it will continue to accelerate. That's why, if you look at the overall numbers, we beat every prediction that we put in place and every target significantly. And you can see that we grew from significantly over $50 million to comfortably over $80 million. And now, we're predicting $90 million for the next quarter. And in 2014, we would expect growth beyond that, and that will have a significant Virtex component to it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Wong.", "David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "You mentioned 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer technology. Can you refresh our memory on which families you're sampling -- you've sampled in 20-nanometers? Or if not, if you haven't sampled yet, when do you expect to be sampling silicon in 20, when you expect to have first silicon on 16 for various families?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "So the -- we were the first semiconductor company to tape out a 28 with TSMC. We are the first semiconductor company to tape out a 20. We taped out in June. We believe we have a multi-year lead -- sorry, a multi-month lead over the competition at 20-nanometer. Actually, it's a bigger lead than we had at 28. The first product offering there will be Kintex-oriented, shortly followed thereafter by Virtex product line. And the generation beyond that, we are working closely with TSMC. We expect to have first chips [ph] and then tape-out in 2014 with TSMC. That's the current plan. We haven't announced which product, what -- the product tables are still something which we have not disclosed, so I'd rather not comment on that -- on 16. But on 20, the first Kintex shortly thereafter, there will be the Virtex product line on 20-nanometer.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann.", "Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Can you guys give a little more detail on the legal action there on that impact to quarter in terms of what the issues are at hand and why you lost the judgment?", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. So we -- there was a case in the most popular place for -- to take large companies to, which is an East Texas jurisdiction, and we lost -- we got a judgment by a jury in Q4 of fiscal year '12. And after the jury gets done, then the judge gets an opportunity to review the decision and decide whether he wants to add any multiples to any of the aspects that were decided where the jury said we infringed on a few patents. And it's taken that judge from Q4 of FY '12 until this quarter in order to decide what to do, and that's when he added an additional, I think, $28 million of judgment on top of the $15 million for a total of $44 million. I guess, there's $1 million [ph] around in there somewhere because the total is $44 million. And so, now, we're in a phase now where the judge has asked us to spend a little more time with the other party and try to work out some sort of a royalty scheme to that. And then, there's a point in time where we get to appeal to a different jurisdiction, to whatever the next highest level court action would be. I think it's back in the Washington, D.C. circuit, which deals with all patents, and our intention is to do so. So at this point in time, this is really a part and parcel of the same decision that was made back in Q4 FY '12 on the same set of patents, and we have not gotten an opportunity yet through the legal process to appeal, which we plan to do. So there's no -- there's a P&L charge right now for $44 million, and there may be some sort of a bond posted in the future and those kinds of things, but we have not really stopped our fighting or negotiation in this particular situation because we think that the court did not find the right answer in this case.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely.", "Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So -- well, hopefully, I can ask 2 follow-ups since I think I'm going [ph] again. One thing, so Intel talked about some delays at their 14-nanometer process yesterday. Do you think that impacts your competitor in the 14-nanometer market? Does that make you feel better about how you are looking in terms of your process technology versus theirs? And then, my second question is just on OpEx. We've seen it creep up here over the last few quarters. We're getting closer and closer to the next fiscal year. Any predictions on how OpEx looks going forward either next fiscal year for the rest of this?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov", "Let me answer the first question, Chris. With regards to process technology, we feel incredibly gratified due to the quality of the relationship we have with TSMC. As the new kid on the block, we were last to start on 28 and first to deliver on 28, and that clearly has manifested itself extremely well in terms of market share. The revenue numbers are here. They're large, they're growing, they're accelerating. The proof is in the numbers. Similarly, in 20, we actually think we have the bigger lead in terms of time-to-market and we have a much broader product portfolio, broader and deeper one. And so, we feel very confident there. And the FinFast program we have with TSMC at 16 and the fact that they already will, at that point in time, have learned the ins and outs of double patterning and will move onto FinFET makes us very comfortable with our decision. So the -- there are always other alternatives out there in terms of foundry partners, but we're delighted with the one we have. And we intend to prove that, as we have in 28 and as we feel very comfortable with the 20-nanometer position, too. And with that, I'll hand it over to Jon.", "Jon A. Olson", "Yes. On OpEx, what's happened in terms of our OpEx from our original prediction from last Analyst Day is that we've had an increase because the share-based expense has cost us more because the stock price has gone up quite precipitously in that time period and our profitability has increased faster than we had anticipated. So our bonus plans are tied to profitability of the company. And so, that's part of the reason of why we've seen an increase over that original projection. From inside the projection, we are starting to spend more money on mass and wafers in the second half of this current fiscal year than the previous first half of the fiscal year because we are starting to tape out some additional products, as we've been talking about and Moshe referred to earlier on 20-nanometer and a few things on 28-nanometers as well. So there is some added costs relative to that. Going into next year, while it's next fiscal year doesn't start until April, so we're still in the middle of our planning process. We do believe mass costs will go up next year because it will be -- we'll be starting to tape out more 20-nanometer products and then onto 16-nanometer activity that we talked about. We're also very mindful that the business model needs leverage in there. We need to be growing cash flow and earnings on a year-on-year basis. And so, that's how we're thinking about it. We are thinking about growing the company and putting leverage in the company. I'm not going to give you any sort of a spending growth rate percentage at this time, but we are definitely mindful of both the things we have to do from a technology perspective and the financial aspects where we need to manage the P&L for growth in terms of return to shareholders.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And there are no further questions at this time.", "Rick Muscha", "Okay. Well, we'll wrap up. Thanks for joining us today. We have a playback of this call beginning at 5 p.m. Pacific time, 8 p.m. Eastern Time today. For a copy of our earnings release, please visit our IR website. Our next earnings release date for the third quarter of fiscal year '14 will be Tuesday, January 21, after the market close.

My name is Rachel and I will be your conference operator. I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions).", "I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.", "Rick Muscha", "Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the March quarter and then we\u2019ll open the call for questions.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information as currently available and actual results may differ materially.", "We refer you to documents the company files with the SEC including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It could be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.", "Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.", "Jon Olson", "Thank you, Rick. Fiscal 2014 was a year marked by the phenomenal success of our 28-nanometer products which exceeded $380 million in sales, easily surpassing our revised target of $350 million. For the company as a whole, fiscal year sales were a record $2.4 billion increasing 10% from the prior fiscal year and enabling Xilinx to gain PLD segment share for the third consecutive fiscal year. We also achieved a record gross margin of 68.8% in fiscal 2014, up from 66% in the prior year. Operating margin also improved markedly to 31.4%, up from 26.8% in the prior fiscal year.", "Finally Xilinx continued to demonstrate a strong commitment to returning shareholder value through dividend increase and repurchase activity. We recently increased the quarterly dividend by $0.04 a share to $0.29 a share per quarter. In the fiscal year 2014, we paid a record $267 million in dividend and repurchased 5.2 million shares for $242 million. Additionally more favorable financial market conditions and a continued strong credit rating enabled Xilinx to issue $1 billion of senior notes using the proceeds to redeem our 2007 convertible notes.", "Turning now, I would like to now turn to discussion of the March quarter. Xilinx sales were $618 million, up 5% and at the high end of our forecasted range. 28-nanometer sales increased over 40% sequentially driven by particularly strong wireless activity in China. Kintex remains the largest product at the 28-nanometer node but sales growth from Virtex and Artix were also particularly strong. Zynq sales also increased after more than doubling last quarter. Sales from communications and data center were stronger than anticipated in the March quarter, both wired and wireless sales increased during the quarter with wireless sales posting a new record and wired sales at its highest level in six quarters. China LTE deployments were the most significant factor contributing to the record wireless revenue, but we also saw growth in other geographies during the quarter.", "Within wired communications, metro, access and data center applications were particularly strong. Virtex-7 design began to ramp during the quarter in area such as OTN access and SSDs. Infrastructure upgrades 100 gig and 400 gig and increased bandwidth requirements are driving many of these applications.", "Test and measurement business increased as forecasted. However, industrial and A&D sales were weaker than anticipated due primarily to weakness from a couple of large customers in the industrial and security area, as well as a broad-based weakness across our smaller account.", "Lastly, broadcast, consumer and automotive were down as forecasted related primarily to an expected decline in consumer business.", "Gross margin was 67.6% for the quarter, 40 basis points lower than forecasted entirely driven by customer mix. Operating expenses were $228 million including amortization of $2.5 million, slightly higher than anticipated due to stock-based compensation associated with the higher stock price during the quarter.", "In the March quarter we recorded a loss of approximately $10 million or $0.03 per diluted share associated with the redemption of our convertible debt. This one-time loss was related to the accounting treatment of the early call of the 2007 convertible notes. As a result of this loss, other income and expense was approximately $7 million higher than planned.", "Net income for the quarter was $156 million or $0.53 per diluted share including a $0.03 per diluted share impact associated with the previously mentioned debt redemption loss. Operating cash flow for the March quarter was $189 million before $14 million in CapEx during the quarter.", "Diluted shares for the quarter were 295 million shares. This was 6 million shares more than forecasted due entirely to the impact of the higher stock price. There was a 21.7 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes. The impact of the 2007 debt redemption will not be fully reflected in the diluted share count until Q1 of FY15.", "For questions related to the dilution associated with our convertibles, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com. We repurchased 1.4 million shares for $75 million during the quarter and 5.2 million shares for $242 million during the fiscal year.", "Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments decreased $96 million to approximately $3.6 billion. We have $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed rate debt resulting in a net cash position of approximately $2 billion.", "Inventory dollars at Xilinx increased by $27 million sequentially. Combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution were 115 days, up from a 114 days in the prior quarter. The growth in inventory is related to increasing safety stock on new products in anticipation of higher future demand. We expect inventory to increase again in Q1, FY15 as we anticipate strong demand for our new products in future quarters.", "Let me now turn to the discussion of guidance for the June quarter of fiscal year \u201815. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up double-digit sequentially, driven primarily by a few large wireless customers in the channel business.", "Coming off an exceptionally strong March quarter, we expect wireless to remain at these approximate record levels in the quarter, driven by continued China LTE activity. We also expect wired communications to be approximately flat as declines from a couple of large customers are offset by strength from enterprise, OTM and data center application.", "We expect the industrial and aerospace and defense segment to be approximately flat with increases from ISM offset by a decrease in aerospace and defense.", "Lastly, we expect broadcast, consumer and automotive to be up, driven by increases from AVB and automotive. We expect the new products category to continue to grow. Mainstream products are expected to be approximately flat and base products are expected to decline.", "As a result, we\u2019re expecting total sales to be up 0% to 4% sequentially. The midpoint of this guidance is predicated on turns rate of approximately 50%. The lower than typical turns rate is driven by a strong beginning backlog from wireless and channel customers.", "Gross margin is expected to be approximately 68%. Operating expenses in the June quarter are expected to be approximately $220 million, including $2.5 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.", "Other income and expense for the June quarter is expected to be a net expense of approximately $8 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 286 million shares. The lower share count reflects a reduction of 8.8 million shares associated with the redemption of the convertible. The tax rate for the June quarter is expected to be between 13% and 14%.", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Good afternoon to you, all. I am gratified that Xilinx delivered both record revenue and record gross margin in fiscal year 2014. 10% growth in annual sales was driven by almost [for true claim] of our 28-nanometer sales. These exceeded $380 million for the year [completely] surpassing, both our initial forecast of $250 million and our recently revised target of $350 million.", "Similarly, our sequential growth in the March quarter was driven by exceptionally strong sales for our 28-nanometer product generation. This increased by more than 40% sequentially exceeding $140 million, both 40 and 28-nanometer product families achieved new record level. The growth was led by both our high performance Virtex-7 and our Kintex families with additional significant contribution from a high volume Artix-7 family from Zynq, the industry\u2019s first (inaudible).", "Phenomenal success of our 28-nanometer product generation has enabled us to capture approximately 70% market share (inaudible) and grow our total PLD market share for the third consecutive fiscal year. In June quarter, we expect 28-nanometer sales to continue to grow driven by broad-based strength from all of end markets. We discussed at our Analyst Day in February, we have targeted 28-nanometer sales of over $700 million in fiscal year 2015. Our proven formula of success which has been undeniably delivered very broadly at 28-nanometer to ready yielding similar results to 20-nanometers with the UltraScale family. Again shipping functional sample of Kintex UltraScale the industry\u2019s first 20-nanometer [design] in November these functional devices based on key customer feedback are extending our time to market lead to at least six months.", "Recently we have already both received and demonstrated functioning devices in-house for the first Virtex UltraScale product, this is the industry\u2019s only high end family offering of 20-nanometer. With $700 million of revenue projected for 28-nanometer combined with technology leadership with total execution already demonstrated at 20-nanometer fiscal year 2015 promises to be an exciting year with even more share gain in both 86 ASPs and (inaudible).", "We now turn the call back to the operator for (inaudible) Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions). The first question is from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "John Pitzer - Credit Suisse", "", "Yes, good afternoon, guys and congratulations. Jon thanks for the color by end market for the June quarter expectations. I am just kind of curious relative to the China LTE build out do you think that this is a (inaudible) before reacceleration, is this sort of a peak level but a sustainable peak? And if you can help us understand what your level of business, what do you think that translates into quarterly base station deployments in China at current levels? Thank you.", "Jon Olson", "Yes, sure John. The -- it\u2019s a several points I\u2019d like to make about that. So clearly we had a really, really strong performance this quarter and this is driven by a very broad deployment by China Mobile, as well as the beginning of China Telecom deployments of the TDE LTE standard. And as best as we can tell I have a hard time giving you a quarterly deployment level, but we do believe that by the end of calendar \u201814 the China Mobile will have deployed upto 500,000 base stations in total at that point in time, so that\u2019s a 500,000 since the beginning of their deployment in calendar \u201813 middle of \u201813 going forward to get to 500 million, excuse me 500,000 base stations. And China Telecom will be somewhere between a 100,000 and 200,000 base stations by the end of \u201814. So, there is still a lot of work and deployment left to be done the rest of the year just on the TDE standard.", "What hasn\u2019t kicked in yet, really is the FDD standard and right now our best estimate of that is for the second half of this year sometime and I do believe that that\u2019s an additive to the ramp that\u2019s going on, on the TDE area, so while I am always hesitant to forecast where peaks and plateaus are in the business that has this kind of variability. I think there still is a lot of positive trends left for us throughout this year and into next year with respect to rolling out those standards.", "John Pitzer - Credit Suisse", "And then John when you look at the OpEx guidance for the fiscal first quarter and compare that to what the guidance you guys gave for the fiscal year at the Analyst Day, it implies a relatively steep ramp. I am just kind of curious, is that a statement about your expectation for future revenue growth as the fiscal year unfolds or are there sort of fixed cost that come into the model that we should be thinking about.", "Jon Olson", "", "There really are not any changes from what we\u2019ve said, at the Investor Day relative to our expectations on spending for the year or revenue or anything else quite frankly. We think we're on track to deliver what we\u2019ve said, the spending decline quarter-on-quarter really is more of a reflection of lower level of tape-outs in the June quarter than there were in March and that still be increasing as we go through the year, as we continue to more rapidly tape-out 20 nanometer now that we have the first two parts Kintex and Virtex taped out and well on their way to customers.", "And we also have our annual focal activities, so salary increases going on beginning in the June quarter. So we expect to hit the numbers we\u2019ve said which were R&D between 530 and 550 and SG&A between 380 and 400 for the year those are our estimates. And so you will see an increase in the June quarter of spending over those two factors, the focal salary increases as well as the tape-outs increasing.", "John Pitzer - Credit Suisse", "", "Perfect thanks guys.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Next question?", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Securities. Your line is open.", "Jon Olson", "", "Hey Romit, are you there? I guess we should move on then.", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question is from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you for taking my question. Jon, how should we think about the gross margin trajectory this year? If communications continues to drive the growth should we be modeling gross margins closer to the 68% level or do you think it can get back to sort of closer to the 69% level as we go through the next couple of quarters.", "Jon Olson", "Yes, Vivek, we still are in the 68% to 70% range. We do believe gross margin will increase, gross margin percent will increase as we go through the year. What we're seeing right now is this disproportionate mix issue towards large customers and quite frankly towards the wireless business.", "And as two things happen both cost reductions that are continuing to kick in as we go throughout the year and a mix as ISM and A&D customers are comeback throughout the year and some seasonal and some individual customers issues going on right now. Those comeback, we expect gross margins to increase from the current forecast of 68%, as we go throughout the year.", "So, again nothing different than what we said on the Investor Day.", "Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. And maybe as a follow up for Moshe or Jon. You guys had a very strong year and fiscal \u201814 right growing double digit well ahead of your competitor. I'm wondering how much of that is share gain versus just the underlying PLD market sort of secular growth. And that I'm going with that as how should we just conceptually think about fiscal \u201815, is there anything that prevents you from going at a similar pace for fiscal \u201815 when you look at just the PLD initiative that you have spoken about and probably continued market share gains?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, if you think that we've projected 8% to 12%. We believe that when we have a virtuous product cycle as we clearly have now that enables us to shoot for the higher element at any point the compound growth is 8% to 12%. As we\u2019ve said before, we have now delivered it one time in a row and we are delighted with actually meeting that projection. And we\u2019re driving hard to continue, it\u2019s difficult for us to project what the rest of the companies in the area will do, but we feel very confident with our product offering.", "Jon Olson", "I\u2019ll just add one thing, we talked at the Investor Day and we have to talk about this for sometime our progress against ASSP and ASICs designs particularly in communication and we are now starting to see those contribute to revenue. So while share gains certainly contribute to our growth in 2014, I do think we\u2019re earning against our (inaudible) competitor. I do think that we\u2019ll continue to be able to grow the top-line as we penetrate some of those designs more fully from these alternative devices.", "Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays Capital. Your line is open.", "Chris Hemmelgarn - Barclays Capital", "Thanks very much for taking my question. This is Chris Hemmelgarn on for Blayne. Just first one to follow-up on the pace of China LTE rollout you\u2019re seeing. We\u2019ve kind heard some rumors that there may be some extra ordering from some of the related, some of the bills, I am just curious if you guys are seeing that dynamic at all?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "We don\u2019t really think we\u2019re seeing anything that would be in design of double ordering or whatever, and most of it\u2019s because we are the high valued part at the center of the universal radio [cards] in particular and then also on the baseband and backhaul. So we have really, really close logistics conversations with the primary OEMs there and we don\u2019t think there is a pattern going on.", "We have talked about forecast variability, but they don\u2019t always know exactly how many base stations they need to deliver every quarter and then they order more or less in any given quarter. So, we are not really seeing anything I would say radically different in the short-term ordering patterns, meaning within the 60 to 90 day horizon that would lead us to believe that there is that kind of activity going on that you asked about.", "Chris Hemmelgarn - Barclays Capital", "That\u2019s great. Thanks very much. And then just as a quick follow-up your main competitor had an announcement out about their 14-nanometer efforts at Intel today, just wondering if you could tell us a little more about timing of 16-nanometer plus for you guys just kind of when you expect that to hit and remind us of your comments on I guess relative scale versus Intel 14-nanometer?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "", "So, we are making tremendous progress with TSMC, we are delighted with their [16 FS] plus this has enhanced transistor performance and -- best transistor performance in that entire generation of products. So, we are working very closely with them. We believe that the combination of elements which we have is going back and in fact foundry is one element to that that the superior architecture socket software and the flawless execution that we have delivered -- we would like to continue to have leadership as we have demonstrated at 28 and 20. And so, we are continuing to make progress on 16 and there is no need for us to say more because at this point in time, we will deliver that technology as we\u2019ve predicted we expect to take out this year and to simplify it in 2015.", "Chris Hemmelgarn - Barclays Capital", "Thank you very much guys.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Tristan Gerra with Robert W. Baird & Company. Your line is open.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Company", "Hi, good afternoon. Given your commentary about the China mobile base station count by year-end, does that imply that orders will continue steadily for the second half of the calendar year that will decline as a percent of mix? And also how do we reconcile the backlog entering the quarter with the revenue guidance; do you expect a softening at the end of the quarter?", "Jon Olson", "So, the order pattern again will undoubtedly have some variability of course throughout the year. But we are expecting and I\u2019ll say the longer-term forecasting beyond a quarter from our large customers does show very solid numbers throughout the year. So, whether there is going to be growth every quarter or whatever, but the second half of the year does look reasonable to us vis-\u00e0-vis the first half. So, I think this is about deploying all these base stations been going silent this year doesn\u2019t appear that\u2019s the pattern if that\u2019s the underlying question you\u2019re asking.", "And then reconciling the backlog I think is your question, because there was a little bit of a surprise to us relative to the channel more or so than the large wireless customers, because they certainly are trying to make sure that they give their fair share of our FPGA supply by placing orders earlier than they normally would have. So that is I would say the leading reason backlog is up so much. And so that is contributing to driving this lower turns number, but also the channel customers.", "So, we had a softer industrial ISM business in the March quarter than anticipated. And so there was an inventory adjustment going on by some of our customers and they jumped in very quickly to order in and purchase more put more on the books early in the quarter. So I\u2019m not expecting a softer end of the quarter necessarily as a result of that backlog, it\u2019s really recognition because we have some specific classes of customers that put orders in the books earlier.", "If you go back and then look at how do we look after the first few weeks, we\u2019re still more or less in a good backlog position. We are, but it is -- I do want to point out that some of the orders didn\u2019t come in earlier than they normally would have been in a given quarter.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Company", "Okay. That\u2019s very useful. And then a quick follow-up, how should we compare the performance of Kintex-7 with Virtex-6? And in other words, is there really a performance incentive for OEMs to keep using Virtex as you make progress with (inaudible) node and the mid one product of (inaudible) node could be equal or exceed that of high-end of previous nodes?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "", "Well, that\u2019s a good question and it\u2019s difficult to give one answer, but let me try to crack at it. As we move from generation to generation then typically the high-end of the previous generation is somewhat covered not totally covered by the mid range of the existing generation. And what you can get is similar performance at the attractive power level and in some cases the lower cost. So, generally speaking that trend does happen, but it\u2019s not a perfect replacement and it's not that you can take anything which would have done in a Virtex-6 and replace it with a Kintex-7. But it does tend to intrude and that trend from generation to generation does tend to repeat itself.", "So, what use to be the most aggressive or the largest device in one generation tends to be competing against the mid range of the next generation generally, but not fully. And then if you look at two generation gap then for sure, you can see that the mid-range tends more than replace everything you had in the high-end of the previous one.", "Jon Olson", "I\u2019ll just add one more quick thing to that. So, we're winning in some of these ASSP opportunities in the wireless communication area, they need faster serial connectivity and more serial connectivity range and that\u2019s what we\u2019re being able to integrate, lots of capability into single devices or a couple of devices and that's all Virtex class capability that has been with Kintex. Kintex is designed to do so. We'd stretch the high-end to grow that available market. And so Virtex definitely has more life and is not being replaced for Kintex.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So in order words, the [fan] of the high-end that expanded through replacing (inaudible) I think that\u2019s reporting point. So it's not -- it gets cannibalized and -- actually can grow significantly, it replaces different devices.", "Rick Muscha", "Next question please?", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Company", "Thank you.", "Operator", "You next question is from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets", "Hi, thank you very much. Jon and Moshe, we get so all of us are guilty I said we just get caught up in the 4G, can you help us understand what\u2019s the 3G business doing for you on a year-over-year basis or any guide post you could provide? And where I am coming from is that yes 4G is growing sounds like wireless especially China is doing well. But is it being offset to some extent by the decline in 3G and then I have a quick follow-up also?", "Jon Olson", "Well clearly, going from generation to generation as the 4G technology gets introduced to more and more geographies, there is a replacement effect that goes on naturally from 3G. But quite frankly, we still have a very, very healthy 3G business. Even in China, in addition to what\u2019s going on in 4G and clearly in Europe as GSM deployment and continuing to build out existing base stations for capacity reasons. And then broadly on a worldwide basis in those countries, they haven\u2019t started the deployment of 4G, we still have a very, very healthy business that is not related to 4G generation.", "So, the answer to your question kind of depends, yes overtime it is replacing 3G, 4G to some extent, but these technologies tend to live on for a very long time and have a very long tail. So, it isn\u2019t just [foreign] replacement on a quarterly basis.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets", "So you don\u2019t have any metric for us in terms of what is (inaudible)?", "Jon Olson", "I don\u2019t really have that. I don\u2019t have that on my finger tips because we actually haven\u2019t looked at that, we look at it more on a customer basis and geographies, so I\u2019d have to dig into that a little bit, Ambrish.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. That\u2019s fair, Jon. And then my follow up is on the 20 and 16, can you just walk us though what are the expectations that you guys have because ASML came out and gave some conflicting comments about the potential delays from the foundry camp? Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "", "Well, you need to look at the public statements made by TSMC this week, they are all out there, they have the technology symposium, they do it once a year. They expect to have more than double-digit tape-out actually in 16-nanometer by the end of this year. And clearly 20-nanometer for them is growing at a faster rate than even 28 was and 28 was probably the most successful node they have ever seen. So TSMC is doing extremely well on 28, 20 and will undoubtedly be doing very well on 16 FF and 16 FF plus. So I don\u2019t know what the comments from ASML as they related to these current nodes but that clearly has, look at TSMC, they had a record year and they are projecting another significant growth year in calendar \u201814. So that highlights that at least the fabless companies TSMC has a majority of the fab business at advanced node doing really well.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets", "Really Moshe, there was. And as I said there is some conflicting remarks, so thanks for your perspective. Thank you sir.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "", "Sure, thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question is from the line of William Stein with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Thanks for taking my question. Moshe, I am wondering if you can give us an idea for when we might expect to see revenue for 20-nanometer products and when for 16?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So, if you look at our Analyst Day which is two months ago and it\u2019s on the rear view, you can see that we showed that our current revenue at 28-nanometer is basically after to being 3 years in production and of course it was a very small number the first year, grew significantly second year and it has almost quadrupled the third year. And we would expect that same shaping happen of 20. And so it took about a year after the tape out to start to have any meaningful number on the revenue side and then it\u2019s 2 years before it gets to -- overall it has an impact on our overall revenue and then third year is when it sees the biggest growth and that\u2019s what you\u2019ve seen.", "Now for us and if you look at the $140 million in the third year of production, that is just under 25% of our revenue. So that would be a good model and we think that model is likely to follow. 28 happened faster for us than previous nodes that is a good proxy. We\u2019d expect 20 and 16 to have similar trends in terms of their converting to revenue, rate conversion to revenue.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "", "That\u2019s helpful. And then one follow-up if I can, Moshe at the Analyst Day, you were asked about the sizing of 20 and 16, your anticipated size of that node from a revenue perspective overall. And I think your comment was that your view was that 20 plus 16 was likely to equal what 28 looks like overall. And first, if you could confirm that that\u2019s the view? And second, I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about the last time that a new node wound up being smaller than the older node and if that\u2019s changing in new and different, why that might be?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "", "Okay. So what you said, that reflects what we expect to happen. And the reason that it\u2019s happened this way is 20 and 16 are coming out very close. And there are some companies, business, (inaudible) if they\u2019re not early users then they just jump to the next node. And for us, because of the long design cycles and the long manufacturing cycle, those will co-exist, but because they\u2019re really about 1.5 years apart, [lead tape out] and the expectation was nodes would come at a lot more leisurely pace than they have in the past which that hasn\u2019t happened, we think that this will turnout the way that which we predicted, the two of them together will be as large as 28. And that\u2019s just because we're so close together. I don\u2019t expect future node to continue to come as fast furious as they have. If they do continue coming at this [cover], it\u2019s great and obviously the ROI changes need to be make sure if you don't double the amount to achieve the same amount of revenues.", "And if you look at where we are, it\u2019s not quite that [street] does that, but it is a big investment and it\u2019s just due to the proximity of those to know nodes scheduled.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Thank you very much.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jim Cavallo with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks for taking the question. This is Gabriella Borges on behalf of Jim. I wanted to follow up on some of commentary on [comps and construction] beyond China. Could you talk about how demand is turning into some of other geographies, maybe in the U.S. Europe and Latin America. And any color on why you\u2019re expecting relative strength and/or weakness over the next couple of quarters, would be helpful as well? Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Sure Gabriela. The strength, we have broader strength, as I commented in my remarks about that. We did have broader geographic shipments and we saw strength, both in Europe and the U.S. And U.S. is still LTE deployments going on, just to remind you that Sprint and T-Mobile are still in their scale of deployment in rapid deployment.", "We still believe that AT&T and Verizon are populating their existing base stations, they are not adding a new state base stations, I think Verizon is almost like at 95% or 98% covered where they had 3G already, but all the base stations are now fully [populated] for capacity reasons.", "So, again we see a very healthy business coming out of North America still it\u2019s in our numbers and we do expect that will continue throughout this year. And we\u2019re also seeing in Europe continued expansion of GSM technology while they are beginning to do some trials and start to kick off additional spending with respect to LTE. So Deutsche Telekom in addition to Vodafone Deutsche Telekom also really has increased their capital spend forecast for the year, as they start to begin to look at their deployment of 4G technology in Europe and their locations. So all in all very healthy wireless business on a worldwide basis.", "Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs", "That\u2019s helpful, and thank you. And just as follow up on the weakness that you are seeing near term aerospace and defense, could you talk about how much of that maybe last time buy (inaudible) versus program timing over we can have some broader spending and also confidence with customers coming back later in the year? Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Yeah, quite frankly most of our weakness is the guide of going down, I will talk more seasonal for us to someone is related to mainstream product that were in particular programs that were driven by our mainstream (inaudible) class of products more than it was anything to do with the historic older products that have gone off, again those will continue in a variability quarter-by-quarter throughout the year, but we actually had, see on a forward looking guide some normal seasonal patterns going on in the summer time and then in September and December quarters we expect increases in our space and defense again quite typically from a seasonal perspective. So as the government fiscal year ends, and the new year begins, we have typically seen dollars being flushed and new dollar new money coming in. We expect that same pattern to exist and we obviously have a number of programs identified where we believe those orders will be coming for us and we will ship against that.", "Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs", "That\u2019s helpful, thanks very much.", "Jon Olson", "", "Thank you. Next question.", "Operator", "", "Your next question is from the line of Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Your line is open.", "Ian Ing - MKM Partners", "Yes, first of all a clarification on this China FTD rollout in the second half, is that specific to China Unicom and what\u2019s the size of that deployment or it this more related to the China [5 mode] requirements for LTE going back and perhaps upgrading base stations.", "Jon Olson", "", "This is a China Telecom and I suspect some Unicom will start, but it\u2019s really more China Telecom is the first leader on that in terms of the (inaudible). And so again we don\u2019t we have, I would say estimated forecast from our customers about when that might ramp, but we really don\u2019t have hard orders yet, so it\u2019s hard to know exactly in what time period they are going to ramp, our best estimate is during the second half of the calendar year.", "Ian Ing - MKM Partners", "Great. And my follow up and you gave a top supplier award to TSMC one thing you talked about is continuous yield improvement spending, just want to get a sense of how much yield improvement, gross margin tailwind is left here in helping to offset mix? Thanks.", "Jon Olson", "", "Yes, sure. We are extremely happy with our overall yield improvement across all of our value partners, quite frankly it\u2019s really been an additive thing over the last several years to us. And in TSMC which has clearly the largest scale we have been able to ramp down costs very, very rapidly. We still are not at the lowest levels we expect to attain there, we still have a reasonable way to go. There are variety of other, things factors associated with yield improvement that really isn\u2019t just about just only about the fab, it\u2019s also about our test capability and being able to target the highest volume of the right speed of products [on] wafer for which is more of a sort of and final test capability that maximizes or optimizes this against the demand we have for those faster or slower kinds of products. And we\u2019ve made tremendous progress with our sort and test capabilities around isolating those kinds of capabilities in order to improve costs even more. So, it all was the wafer (inaudible) density is the biggest driver, there are many other things that we have on schedule that helps us reduce cost throughout the year. So we\u2019re still, we still have a lot of cost reduction left, what I am trying to say.", "Ian Ing - MKM Partners", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Americas LLC. Your line is open.", "Ryan Goodman - CLSA Americas LLC", "Hey thanks for taking my question. This is Ryan Goodman in for Srini. Question on 20 nanometer, I know it\u2019s still a bit early but you announced the products shipping in another one around the corner. So maybe could you talk a little bit about which markets you expect this to gain traction in first? And maybe just a bit of a balance between how much is new market expansion with further ASIC, ASSP displacement versus more migrating your leading edge emulating type business in 28 nanometers to 20 and then eventually 16?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So we have two families in 20 nanometers, there is Kintex and Virtex we actually have the only high-end family and the expectation is that that is an expansion play, it\u2019s largely for wired communications. The ASIC prototyping business, the high-end of middle arrow and generally the high-end of what our customers design, but it is an expansion play because the previous question was asked there, this enables us to affect ASIC and ASSP space. If you look at the Kintex product offering and we\u2019re sampling that broadly that process has been out for since November, we have been sampling it since November, so it\u2019s approaching six months I think at this point. That is [migrating] product which enables a cost reduction task and additional capabilities for the previous generation of Virtex products and it also enables an upgrade in regards to higher performance, the lower power to the previous generation of Kintex.", "So this enables both, and if you look at the previous generation of Kintex is very broad amongst other markets, for wireless market, but it actually addresses a lot of applications and that mid range market is the biggest, the fastest growing, the largest here, but it\u2019s a fastest growing market and we expect it to continue growing at an accelerated break into address numerous markets, wireless being one, but that\u2019s just one of several that use those Kintex devices.", "Ryan Goodman - CLSA Americas LLC", "Okay. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-on for Jon, just the inventory days I think you had mentioned reps to 115, it\u2019s a bit higher than you\u2019ve had in recent quarters and it sounds like you are looking to grow it again next quarter. Just can you help us understand what is the target range there, where are you comfortable on and how should that trend over the course of the year?", "Jon Olson", "", "No, we're fairly above our target in terms of where we like to run the business from a long-term perspective and the target is there as a measure of efficiency. But quite frankly, you have to react to the environment around you. And when we have such a strong growth pattern going on in our new product category like we do now and growing revenue so rapidly, we want to make sure that we have the supply chain ability to supply our customers. And with the variability of the ordering patterns particularly from the China LTE business, we wanted to put a substantial safety stock.", "And the good part or when you see inventory growing you might say there is warning sign there, but the good part of it is that\u2019s all in our new product, which mean to us there is no risk of obsolescence here, this is a matter of trading our cash for in the return on cash for inventory to make sure we have, we\u2019re well positioned.", "We\u2019re far enough down on the defect density curve they are not buying expensive wafers and writing them off throughout the time period. So, this is kind of a no [brainer] from me and that making sure that we have that kind of capability.", "We do expect this to continue meaning inventory will get larger in June and probably get in September and then start to decline as we go through the next several quarters. So again, we are establishing a higher revenue point for the company, inventory dollars go up, the days are kind of fluctuating around based on where our revenue is. So, I actually look at the total dollars of our inventory more than just a day. And I'm pretty comfortable into that we're in, which is in the neighborhood of 240ish plus or minus $240 million plus or minus.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "And the other reason is that capacity is tightening up and so it [beholds] us to make sure that we can seize the moment as these opportunities come. And this is actually public information with regards to capacity at 28 and 20. Most of them are doing extremely well and having the backlog in place and having the wafers definitely helps us address the opportunities.", "Rick Muscha", "Next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James. Your line is open.", "Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James", "Thanks guys, congratulations. On the new product category, it seems that 40-nanometer was flat or down, is that the second quarter in a row that\u2019s occurred? What\u2019s happening there in terms of the guide for the rest of the year? Thanks.", "Jon Olson", "Yes Hans, I don\u2019t think it was the second quarter in a row, I think we increased it in the previous quarter. So, it was down due to a couple of large customers who had taken products in the previous quarter and then was absorbing that inventory. We do expect new product category to grow next quarter and we expect it to grow both from 28 and 40-nanometer technology.", "So, the peak of that generation is likely sometime this year maybe later in the year in total. That\u2019s what we can tell, although we still have a lot of very strong designs in the high-end of the business, the high volume part of our business; we expect it to continue to grow for at least in a year or two before a peak maybe even longer. Just to remind you that we\u2019re the only one in the industry that has that generation has high volume product and has serial technology with it et cetera. So, we are pretty happy with how things are going with that generation as well.", "Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James", "Okay. And then as a follow up, can you guys provide the mix Kintex as a percentage of 28-nanometer?", "Jon Olson", "", "So now we are not providing that mix by technology, we did say it\u2019s the largest contributor to our total revenue last quarter. So, it\u2019s large but it isn\u2019t 50%. Okay, they are buried on Virtex-7 and Artix, Zynq as well.", "Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James", "Thanks again.", "Operator", "", "Your next question is from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley & Company. Your line is open.", "Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley & Company", "", "Great, thank you. I wanted to explore just a little bit more the strong backlog kind of weaker turns, is that something, I mean are you seeing those weaker turns already or are you being, you sort of projecting that based on kind of the overall bookings trend that you have seen the lumpiness of the wireless business? And are you, is it possible with that conservatism in that number and the turns coming stronger or just how should we think about that?", "Jon Olson", "", "Yes, it\u2019s again largely driven by these large wireless customers. We have seen this back in the 3G generation, the same kind of pattern. And so, I don\u2019t really feel like we have got some sort of a sandbag number but again with the variability that goes on with the Chine LTE, there are all possibilities that things are turned out different than we say. The second part of this story, the early backlog was around these channel customers specifically focused around ISM business. We\u2019ve done our best view at those customers where they are going to end up this quarter and that they just ordered earlier, the pattern was just a little earlier in the quarter than normally we would have seen things. So, it really isn\u2019t I think we are fairly positioned with our zero to 4 growth number.", "Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley & Company", "Okay, great. Thank you. And then in terms of the industrial aerospace and defense, you described some inventory kind of build and depletion around that, what would have triggered a build? I think you had some patents on couple of products, was it about that or was it just more customer behavior over the last couple of quarters?", "Jon Olson", "Yes. The question on that or the answer on that is really around the ISM A&D was because the programs didn\u2019t materialize as we thought and/or there were some slips going on the A&D side that won\u2019t come back to still later in the year. But on the ISM side, it was a matter of leading out inventories. We\u2019ve had, very healthy industrial sales over the last previous six quarters and there was a bit of an adjustment going on at a few customers that we had anticipated some larger orders from. And we\u2019ve reconfirmed that they\u2019re ordering again this quarter. So, I am not too concerned about that at this point.", "Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley & Company", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Jon Olson", "Sure, Joe. Next question?", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Ruben Roy with Piper Jaffray and Company. Your line is open.", "Ruben Roy - Piper Jaffray & Company", "Thank you. Jon, just quickly, have you seen any appreciable changes in lead times over the last couple of quarters, 28-nanometer? And a follow-up question just around the 28- nanometer product Virtex-7. I think Jon you talked about some of the -- there is the ramp going on and some of the design wins around wired and markets outside of communications. Are you seeing design activity for Virtex-7 into wireless as well? Thank you.", "Jon Olson", "Yes. So on the lead times on 28-nanometer, our lead times again with our inventory build, we don\u2019t have any particular issue there, but as Moshe said, there is some general tightness going on in the 28 nanometer capacity. But if you look at our supply chain and backward to see if we have any lead issues, we really don\u2019t have anything significant there from our perspective. So I think not just from a wafer perspective but also assembly test and packages and things like that substrates, we\u2019re not seeing anything, I would say that\u2019s really significant in terms of any individual lead time issues.", "With respect to the Virtex-7 ramp, I mean the applications are in the communication space are mostly on the wired side -- on the wireless side, we don\u2019t sale that much Virtex-7 into that. We have some Virtex-6 parts and Virtex-5 parts that we sent there, that we still ship into the wireless business. But the big growth for us from wireless has been Kintex. The Virtex-7 growth for us has been round wired communication and the applications associated with the network interface cards and 40, 100, 400 gig kind of connectivity capability. That\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing the biggest single growth area. And then also on the solid state disc arrays for data center is both Virtex class products and in some cases Kintex.", "Ruben Roy - Piper Jaffray & Company", "", "Great. Thanks, Jon.", "Jon Olson", "Sure Ruben. Next question?", "Operator", "", "Your next question is from the line of John Vinh with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.", "John Vinh - Pacific Crest Securities", "My question, as we roll into FDD deployments in the second half, can you talk about, are there any sort of differences in your competitive position on FDD-LTE versus TD-LTE? And also, are there also any sort of differences in content, (inaudible) content between of FDD and TD for you?", "Jon Olson", "", "John, the FDD side, there is slightly more content for us on that but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s like a 50% more or anything near that, there was slightly more contain on FDD. And from a competitive perspective, I would say most of the FDD is related to 28-nanometer. And as we have said before, we have an extremely strong design win percentage at 28-nanometer.", "So, I would say there is no appreciable difference on the competitive environment for us. So maybe a little more dollar content and no appreciable competitive difference.", "John Vinh - Pacific Crest Securities", "Great. Thank you.", "Jon Olson", "There is last question now or...", "Rick Muscha", "Yes, we\u2019ll take our last question. Yes.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over Mr. Rick Muscha for any closing remarks.", "Rick Muscha", "Great. Thanks for joining us today.

(Operator Instructions) Please limit your questions to one to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.", "Rick Muscha", "Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the June quarter and then we'll open the call for questions.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information as currently available and actual results may differ materially.", "We refer you to documents the company files with the SEC including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It could be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.", "Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.", "Jon Olson", "Thank you, Rick. The quarter was characterized by strong profitability, although revenue was slightly below our guidance. Xilinx sales were $613 million, down 1% sequentially. The two primary end markets contributing to the shortfall versus our expectation were China LTE and aerospace and defense. ", "Total wireless revenue was significantly down -- excuse me -- was slightly down primarily due to a lower than anticipated 28-nanometer sales to China LTE base station manufacturers. ", "Sales from these customers were below our expectations due to some balancing of component inventory. LTE deployment outside of China remained healthy, and as a result we had better than expected shipment of our 40-nanometer and 65-nanometer technology. ", "Aerospace and defense was weaker primarily due to the timing of certain key programs moving into the September quarter. We are confident that this segment will see a very significant rebound in the September quarter. ", "Wired communications sales were up and better than anticipated driven by enterprise networking OTN and access business. The Industrial, Scientific and Medical segment rebounded nicely as expected. New products increased 6% sequentially driven by both Virtex 6, Spartan 6 growth. Turns were 47% for the quarter.", "Gross margin was 69.1% for the quarter, higher than forecasted due primarily to product mix. We also continue to make good progress in cost improvement across our new product families, particularly in yield and backend expenses. ", "Operating expenses were $217 million including amortization of $2.4 million, slightly below lower than forecasted due to variable expenses related to lower revenue and lower stock-based compensation expense. ", "Other income and expense was a net expense of $6 million better than forecasted mainly due to the higher -- to higher interest income on our investment portfolio. Net income for the quarter was $173.6 million or $0.62 per diluted share. ", "Operating cash flow for the March quarter was $130 million before $9 million in CapEx during the quarter. Operating cash flow was impacted by higher working capital requirement due to the timing of receivables and payables along with higher inventory level. ", "Diluted shares for the quarter were 282 million shares. This was 4 million less than the forecasted due to the impact of a lower stock price and increased buyback activity during the quarter. There was a 9 million share dilutive effect from the convertible note.", "We continue to be committed to returning cash to shareholders and during the quarter we stepped up our buyback activity repurchasing 2.1 million shares for $100 million. We also paid a record $77 million in quarterly dividend. ", "Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments decreased $53 million to approximately $3.6 billion. We have $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed rate debt resulting in a net cash position of approximately $2.0 billion.", "Combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution increased as we forecasted. The total inventory days are 135, up from 115 days in the prior quarter. As you recall earlier this year, we have got safety stock particularly in 28-nanometer to ensure sufficient supply to meet our demand outlook. We expect inventories to remains at these elevated levels through December and then begin to decline. ", "Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the September quarter fiscal year 2015. Our backlog heading into the quarter is slightly down sequentially. We expect wired and wireless communications to be down in the September quarter. ", "The leading factors driving the decrease in wireless sales are a delay in our expectations for the next phase of China LTE deployment and absorption of inventory at key customers. We currently anticipate wireless sales to increase meaningfully into December and March quarters. After posting its highest sales level in nearly two years, wired communication is expected to decline sequentially in the September quarter.", "We expect industrial and aerospace and defense segment to be up significantly driven by aerospace and defense. Broadcast, Consumer and Others expected to be flat sequentially. As a result, we are expecting total sales for the September quarter to be flat to down 4%. The midpoint of this guidance is predicated on a turns ratio of approximately 48%. ", "Gross margin is expected to be approximately 70% as we benefit from customer mix during the quarter. Operating expenses in the September quarter are expected to be approximately $236 million including $2.5 million of amortization of acquisition related intangibles. The majority of this increase is related to R&D mask and tape-out expense for 20-nanomenter technology. ", "Other income and expense for the September quarter is expected to be a net expense of approximately $7 million and share count is expected to be approximately flat. The tax rate for the September quarter is expected to be approximately 13%.", "Now let me comment on changes for fiscal year 2015 expectation. We remain confident in our broad base of 28-nanometer growth opportunities and believe this family will demonstrate strong growth in fiscal year 2015. However, the ramp will be slower than previously anticipated. The key drivers for this change are the pace of China LTE deployment and a slower than expected ramp in wired communications. ", "As a result, we expect our total revenue to be up approximately 5% for the fiscal year. This forecast is predicated on increased China wireless sales in the December and March quarters as key customer inventories are absorbed in the next phase of LTE deployment begin. ", "Gross margin will be mix dependent in the December and March quarters, but we remain comfortable with our fiscal year 2015 gross margin guidance of 68% to 70%. Operating expenses will be lower than anticipated as we manage the business appropriately to focus on superior next-generation product development and execution within a disciplined financial framework. ", "R&D expense for the year is expected to be approximately $530 million and SG&A expense approximately $380 million. Other income and expense will be a net expense of approximately $28 million, down from the prior guidance of $34 million due to better returns from our investment portfolio. And the tax rate is expected to be approximately 13%.", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you, Jon and good afternoon to you all. While we are disappointed with top line during this June quarter, our continued focus on profitability drove significant increases in both gross and operating margin to 69.1% and 33.7% respectively, resulting in earnings per share of $0.62.", "Following the March quarter we had 28-nanometer sales increased 40% to more than $140 million. 28-nanometer sales exceeded $130 million in the June quarter. This slight pullback was forced by a temporary pause in China LTE activity.", "Despite this pause, we remain very confident that the 28-nanometer nodes will continue to be the most successful node in our history, served as the growth driver for the company for several years.", "We are still in the early phases of 28-nanometer revenue growth, the very large number of design wins being converted to revenue over the next several years across a very broad range of markets.", "Consequently, we expect 28-nanometer growth to resume in the second half of our fiscal year with meaningful contributions from new LTE orders and more rapid growth from a host of ramps and design wins in markets including wired communication and data center and industrial. ", "Given our current disability of these ramps, we are revising our fiscal year 2015 28-nanometer sales target to be approximately $600 million. A proven formula for successful execution established the 28-nanometer continues to yield excellent results to 20-nanometer, the UltraScale family.", "Kintex UltraScale, the industry\u2019s first 20-nanometer device been in the market since November -- per our largest customer is providing us with more than six months advantage over competitive product.", "During the quarter, we began shipping our Virtex UltraScale All Programmable FPGA, industry's only high-end product offering in 20-nanometer. This family provides our customers with unprecedented level -- system-level performance and integration, that enables the displacement of another class of ASICs and ASSPs.", "Let me now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Your line is open. Romit Shah, your line is open.", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "James Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. I appreciate it. On the China LTE, how do you think about how much it is the supply issue versus the demand issue? In other words, is this just a another pause in a broader built out or is the -- the demand continues to be okay, maybe they preordered some of the components ahead of what is really continue to build. Could you give us any color on that, that would be great? Thanks.", "Jon Olson", "Yeah. Jim, I think this past quarter, our fiscal Q1 quarter was little more on the inventory side as, I think you recall, we had a huge shipment to them in the March quarter and some of the -- the situation with supply chain overall with other suppliers certainly has challenged some of the OEMs in China. ", "So, I think I would characterize our fiscal Q1 as being a little more on the supply side and the fiscal Q2 more -- a little more being on the delay side of when phase III is going to hit, although there is still little bit of inventory rebalancing going on in that. ", "So, it's probably the -- I don\u2019t know if I can really handicap a percentage, but each of those quarters but that\u2019s how I would describe it. ", "James Covello - Goldman Sachs", "And I guess for my follow-up, I'd stand on that same topic, are we seeing any of the kind of incomplete kitting dynamic that we've seen in prior cycles?", "In other words, I don\u2019t think PLDs are the longest lead-time or the things where the lead-times have stretched the most. But we know things like RF have stretched quite a better.", "Are we seeing customers order the entire kit waiting for the longest lead-time item or is that really not part of the supply dynamic in this cycle?", "Jon Olson", "Well, I do think that they were trying to make -- generally trying to get their supply chain solidified and they have placed orders on us to make sure that we have supply and in some cases they took that.", "They took those parts though, if they wouldn\u2019t get -- if they were short of some of other parts that they kept, then I would say, yes, they are -- in some cases have been ordering partial kits, if you will, to make sure that they could try to build when they got the full building materials.", "James Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Very helpful. Thank you so much. Good luck.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Next question?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your line is open.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO", "Hi, thank you. Jon in the past you have talked about your sense of how many base stations have been built. So where are we in the build from China Mobile? And I think you've also talked about your expectation for what the other carriers you will be building out?", "Jon Olson", "Yeah, so our best information is they are in -- have been through this June period in the neighborhood of 300,000 base stations built from the China Mobile perspective.", "And I think some of the differences in our thought process is when they were going to beyond the 400-500 into the next phase and that seems to have pushed out into calendar 2015 now. And so think they are in the process of getting to their 400-500 between now and the end of the calendar year.", "And then with respect to FD, the FD phase is still not well understood in terms of when that will begin. We're still counting on that to have some impact for us in our December quarter as builds will happen ahead of deployment, obviously.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO", "So then what gives you the confidence than that you would see a rebound in the second half of the fiscal year in the wireless business?", "Jon Olson", "Yeah, I think it's really talking to -- individually to each of the customers and the carriers. We've had multiple visits over the last three weeks and that -- of both the manufacturers and the carriers and this is our best sense of what's going on. ", "I mean, as inventory is depleted the kits are fully deployed as the shortages dry up than we would expect a rebound from that and then also an impact for Phase III which is the next way from China Mobile. So those two effects together should provide us a second half increase.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Chris Hemmelgarn - Barclays", "Thanks very much for taking the question. This is Chris Hemmelgarn on for Blayne. Just first of all, could you talk a little bit about where you think your share is for 28 and I guess kind of what your -- obviously, it's down a little bit in the June quarter. But do you expect that to continue to decline in the September or do you expect a rebound in the 28-nanometer revenue?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "If you look at the past fiscal year which ended in March, our share grew significantly over the year and actually for the whole year it was over 70%. And our prediction for this quarter is over $130 million and that should put us in the high-60s in terms of percentage. But, you know that depends, of course, on what the competition does there.", "But, no, we are confident in the exceeding $130 million and remaining well ahead. And we expect it to continue to restart its accelerated growth in the December quarter. So this quarter and the next quarter 28-nanometer revenue will be relatively flattish and then we expect it to grow in the December quarter and the March quarter and to yield overall $600 million, which is the new target for the year. And, no, you couldn\u2019t do the arithmetic on what the market share will be then based on whatever you predict as the companies will ship 28-nanometers.", "Jon Olson", "Yeah, Chris. If I can add another little color to that, if you think about what's happened here in this flat spot on 28-nanometer, it's really been driven very largely by Kintex the mid-range because of China Wireless where we have very, very strong market share, which we still -- I believe we'll be maintaining throughout this particular cycle. And if you look inside some of the other product families, as well, test and measurement was down some, and so that impacted the very high end of Virtex. But the other, broad based Virtex parts grew quite nicely throughout the quarter, which is one of the reasons our wired business is up, as well.", "So, we\u2019re getting really good traction across the Board in our product families in 28-nanometer. And what you're really seeing is the effect of China on the Kintex family, which takes so many parts into the radios and base bands.", "Chris Hemmelgarn - Barclays", "That's really helpful. Thanks so much. Then just as a quick follow-up. Obviously a strong gross margin quarter and continuing in September. Can you just talk about your expectations for the trend throughout the fiscal year? Can you continue at these high levels, or does that pull back a bit?", "Jon Olson", "Yes, as I said, 68% to 70% is still our full year forecast. And I think when we talked about this a quarter ago, we did talk about the potential of having it hit 70% at some point, depending on what mix is going on there.", "We\u2019re forecasting to be at the top end of the range in our fiscal Q2 and it will be mix-dependent. So, for example, if wireless ticks up, it will have some downward pressure. So, it really depends on the mix of other customers or other end markets, whether it's sustained, but, again, our forecast is to be in the 68% to 70% range.", "Chris Hemmelgarn - Barclays", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra from Baird. Your line is open.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Hi. Good afternoon. How much room do you have to further cut operating expense if the rebound that you expect from TD-LTE starting in the December quarter does not materialize?", "Jon Olson", "Yes, so we've taken a position, as I said in the remarks, to be at the low end of our previous range. We're certainly looking broadly across the company for, I would say, typical kind of belt-tightening opportunities to help balance out some of the top line change and therefore, overall profitability changes in our full year outlook.", "However, we remain committed to developing -- to continue the 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer development programs. We will not be slowing those down and cutting those back.", "So, we have some other things that are under consideration and we're looking at as alternatives if we need to do something. But we aren't going to change our fundamental approach of developing and getting new technology out as fast as possible.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay. And then if I look at the mix by node from China between you and your competitor, do you expect that mix to change as orders rebound starting in the December quarter, more toward 28-nanometer? Or do you think that the mix of ordering patterns from Huawei between 65, 40, and 28 will remain the same as in the next investment wave for TD-LTE?", "Jon Olson", "Yes, we believe that there will be a bias towards conversion of certain sockets that are in older technologies at 28-nanometer in certain manufacturers in China, which is to our benefit. So, I think that premise is still what we believe and the same premise that we've had all along. We do believe that as the year moves forward, we'll continue to gain a little more share there.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla from William Blair. Your line is open.", "Anil Doradla - William Blair", "Hey guys, couple questions. Why was the inventory build-up by now -- I mean we get these things in waves and cycles. Was there anything unique about the inventory build-up this time with the Chinese customer? Or was it pretty much in line with what you've seen in the past? And then I have a follow-up.", "Jon Olson", "Well, I think the unique part, Anil, was a little more the shortage issue and I think, the supply chain dynamic with the Chinese manufacturers to make sure they could secure enough supply from people. And we got caught in the -- we built a lot; they took a lot. And some of the other suppliers didn't build up to the request and so we're getting the effect of that.", "Is this different than the past? I don't know how to compare it to any point in time in the future -- or excuse me, in the past, relative to that. It is what it is right now. I don't know that I can compare it to the 3G wave in any way.", "Anil Doradla - William Blair", "And stepping back, looking at the big picture, to a skeptic, one might say that the last time we had this 3G wave was -- Beijing Olympics was supposed to be big on 3G. Well, it took almost four years before we saw it.", "To a skeptic who questions the premise that the trajectory on China 4G is perhaps right here and now, or over the next six to 12 months -- it's not that, but it's more like over the next two years. How would you react to that?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So, the expectation is that it will be a three-year deployment. That is in line with previous generations. This is a massive deployment; it's a huge country and it's being deployed in several waves.", "The previous wave had about six cycles to it, and we wouldn't be surprised if this one has a similar multiple cycles. And the next one counts as number three, in the way we're think. And then the previous generation was one carrier, albeit the biggest one, this one has all three carriers. And the other two smaller ones are expected to start a little later and with a different -- the FD approach, largely.", "And as a result, the expectation is that it will continue to be a multi-year rollout. And in terms of the peak, depending on exactly when these other two carriers go into their broader deployment, but we can't expect the peak to be in calendar 2015, but for the deployment to continue well beyond calendar 2015. And that would be very much in line with the previous facts, right, as opposed to the conjecture, which may have assumed that it happened faster.", "Anil Doradla - William Blair", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust Robinson. Your line is open.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Regarding the China LTE inventory, I'm hoping you can give us some view as to where you see the inventory build. Has it been in component distribution, or at the contract manufacturers, at the OEMs themselves, or maybe even at the carrier, at China Mobile? Any visibility into that would be helpful.", "Jon Olson", "Yes, well, our best understanding of this is at the OEM manufacturer, whether they're doing it themselves or they're using a contract manufacturer. And the portion where they're waiting for other components, that's where that sits.", "Relative to how many base stations are sitting in OEMs' warehouses; I really don't have a good view of that. I think that is not as big of an issue after we work through the early part of the summer than it was before that beforehand.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Great. And then if I can ask one follow-up about the gross margin improvement in the quarter. If you were a completely vertically integrated manufacturer, I'd be highlighting the inventory build as probably a driver here, but I'm not sure it's the case with your company. Maybe you can help me understand whether the inventory build sequentially helped gross margin in the quarter.", "Jon Olson", "Yes, the inventory build did not help gross margin, in our case, since we do purchase wafers and have them assembled and tested. The inventory was really representing the cost of the work in process of the wafers we purchased.", "So, we don't have any spending that gets built up in inventory as a result of factory expenses, if you will, because we're on our purchase price variance issue -- or variance process with the wafer purchases. So, that was not the driver.", "The driver on a quarter-to-quarter basis was cost reductions with lower yield. So, we were essentially purchasing units, if you will, or the cost of the unit was lower on a quarter-on-quarter basis.", "So that's why there was a quarter-to-quarter improvement. And then versus our expectations for the quarter, it was really more around mix. We sold less into the wireless business than we had anticipated and more into a few other end markets that pushed gross margin up a little.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "That's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "John Pitzer - Credit Suisse", "Yeah, good afternoon, Moshe and Jon. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Guys, first, just a clarification, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on in China for you guys, relative to other players. And I know these data points don't always line up exactly. But TI, Sanima (ph), Ericsson, ZTE all relatively positive commentary around the TD-LTE base station deployment in China. You guys talking more about a pause. Do you think that this is specific to you guys? Or do you think as the earnings season goes on, we'll hear more and more about the pause in China?", "Jon Olson", "Yes, I don't know what others are going to say, quite frankly. And I think what we're calling a pause is from -- there's two things going on here again, John. One is there was a lot of inventory -- Xilinx inventory, purchased by the OEMs that was built up. And there's not a total match in their supply chain for what they're doing. So, that's part of the story.", "The second part of the story around a pause, it was a pause for us versus our expectations. I think, as Moshe characterized a little earlier, there was a view that there was going to be a very, very rapid deployment in China.", "And this Phase III that we're talking about, we thought was going to happen a quarter or so sooner than it actually is happening. Whether we were misinformed or what other companies think about that, I really can't comment on that. I really don't know that. But I do know, versus our expectations, its coming -- this Phase III is coming later than we had anticipated.", "John Pitzer - Credit Suisse", "Jon, that's helpful. And then, Moshe, maybe as my follow-up question, a little bit longer-term question. You guys talked about some operating expenses ramping because of 20-nanometer. I wonder if you can give us an update on FinFET.", "There's clearly a lot of controversy out there on when TSMC might get there versus guys like Samsung, GLOBALFOUNDRIES. How comfortable are you still with your timeline around FinFET? And if you had to change course and go with a different foundry vendor, could you? How easily could that be done? Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "We are delighted with the progress of TSMC. As best we can tell, we are on -- they're on schedule and they have numerous other users of the technology who actually, in this case, will even be ahead of us.", "So, there really is no issue, in our mind, on the availability of the FinFET from TSMC. And, if anything, we've heard significant delays with other players, is that we're not seeing, that, and they are hitting all of their milestones; and so far, so good. So, there is no issue there with regards to their execution.", "In 16, 28 and the 20; and, as best we can tell, at 16, and they're doing 16 in two cycles. They're doing a FinFET and they're doing the FinFET Plus version, and we're going to be using the FinFET Plus version. And -- so, we're benefiting from all of their development at this point in time.", "John Pitzer - Credit Suisse", "Thanks, Moshe. I appreciate it.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Sure. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ian Ing from MKM Partners. Your line is open.", "Ian Ing - MKM Partners", "Yes, thanks for letting me ask question. So, for industrial, aerospace, and defense, it looks like its 18% below prior peak, so we're probably in the middle stages of a semiconductor recovery cycle. So, do you think you get back to peak run rates in the coming quarters if it's really just an aerospace and defense program timing issue? Or have some sockets maybe moved on to some other activities?", "Jon Olson", "Yes, I don't know that I can -- I haven't really studied exactly where the peak is at what level. But I think we're going to see a very significant increase because of these key programs that we know that are on the books to spend the money this quarter in aerospace and defense.", "Last quarter there was a lot of trying to understand why we were an outlier on the pure industrial, scientific, and medical side. That rebounded very nicely. We do expect that to be strong again in the September quarter, with aerospace and defense on top of it growing very significantly. Not sure that we'll get to a peak. But it will certainly be back on -- in that neighborhood, if you will, in that general range, in the September quarter.", "Ian Ing - MKM Partners", "Great. And as a follow-on to an earlier question, how much of the 4G base station opportunities still haven't switched over to 28-nanometers? And does that largely switch over with Phase III and China Mobile?", "Jon Olson", "It's really -- it's very different by manufacturer. I think we've said in the past, we've won about 80% of the sockets. How long certain manufacturers -- the ones that are still using older technologies, hang onto older technologies, it's hard to -- from a China perspective -- is hard to handicap, quite frankly. I would say the lion's share of what's shipped in China is certainly 28-nanometer.", "Ian Ing - MKM Partners", "Okay, so it's a gradual process, still. Okay, thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you for taking my question. Jon, Moshe, is it fair to assume that for growth in your December and March quarters, that you are depending on the FD-LTE deployment to take off? And if yes, how should we think about the number of base stations that could be deployed in those two quarters for FD-LTE?", "Jon Olson", "Yes, I think on the -- what we're counting on and the second half is clearly the Phase III build to start happening for China Mobile, which is still TD. And we're counting on, I would say, a modest beginning of the FD cycle.", "Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "I see.", "Jon Olson", "In terms of numbers of base stations on FD, I think we're talking about, over the cycle and the time period, to be approaching 0.5 million, but this is just going to be the beginning of that. And as Moshe talked about, later this continues on a more steady basis through 2015 and 2016.", "Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So, should we then think, Jon, that by the time you get to your December and March quarters that you should be running at the same sort of normalized levels in your communications business that you were in the March or June quarter of this year? Is it a recovery back to those levels? Or do you think it could be -- by the time we get to the back half of your year, we could still be looking at year-on-year growth.", "Jon Olson", "Well, March was such a crescendo, and June was down from that in China, so I don't know what normalized is, Vivek. I hesitate to make a statement and mislead you, because I'm not even sure what's normalized. The variability around the China business is continued.", "We do expect both the December and March quarter to be larger -- excuse me, the December to March quarter to be larger than September. Will it be larger -- and probably larger than the June quarter as well, but I don't know how to answer the normalized part of it.", "Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. And one last question, if I may. Could you remind us again of the launch timing of your 16-nanometer and the 20-nanometer products? Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So, the 20-nanometer, both families are now available. The initial tape out was of Kintex, that is moving into production and we're sampling the Virtex product line. We're -- and the feedback we have is that we have a minimum of a six month's lead based on any competitive product.", "On the 16-nanometer -- this is FinFET, we're on schedule to tape out in Q1 of calendar year 2015. And what has happened is that we have revised our roadmap to better align with customer requirements and specifications.", "So, originally, we had expected to tape out by the end of the year. We're now expecting to tape out our first 16-nanometer device in the first quarter of 2015.", "Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from CLSA. Your line is open.", "Ryan Goodman - CLSA Americas LLC", "Hey, thanks for taking the question. This is Ryan Goodman in for Srini. So, another question on China LTE. I understand that it sounds like the primary driver was a push-out in the second leg of the Phase III build and inventory digestion. I'm curious, though, if you saw any changes in the competitive dynamics over in China, just as your competitor is ramping up on their 28-nanometer solutions.", "Jon Olson", "Not really. I think there was probably some pressure around pricing from a perspective of holding onto older technologies and delaying the conversion to 28-nanometer, which would've been to our benefit.", "And there's been a little bit more of that activity going on. But I wouldn\u2019t call it so severe that it really changes our expectations that much. But, nothing really on 28-nanometer competitive front that\u2019s different than our previous expectations.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "We continue to be supremely confident in our market share position on 28-nanometer, in particular on China LTE, nothing has changed in that regard, best we call tell.", "Ryan Goodman - CLSA Americas LLC", "Okay. Okay, great. And then for a follow-up, you talked about the inventory levels going on in China. Can you talk just about some of the other markets like Industrial or Wireline? Are you seeing normal inventory levels at the customers out there or is there any risk of a similar dynamic playing out in couple of quarters? Just any color you could add there?", "Jon Olson", "Yeah, individual customers has always a period of where they particularly -- they take inventory to do proto builds before they go get certified. Again, this is heavy -- I'm talking about wired communications equipment that requires all those certifications.", "So there is always some lumpiness, if you will, in an individual customer. But we've seen a couple of really strong quarters out of wired, strong quarters out of our 28-nanometer product family, which again is a very positive sign for us in converting sockets that were previously ASICs and ASSPs to FPGAs. All those things are on track.", "We really aren\u2019t seeing in other end markets any appreciable inventory build I would say on an industry wide basis. And again, individual customers can have their particular issues from time-to-time.", "Ryan Goodman - CLSA Americas LLC", "Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thank you. I wonder if you look back over the last couple of quarters and you look at what preceded that inventory accumulation. Did you guys have any kind of lead-time extensions or is there anything -- I'm trying to -- is there anything you can identify that would have led to an accumulation other than just the customer being a little bit too optimistic?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So, no, we've -- we anticipated the potential of having this not look like a 3G rollout, meaning it was going to go a lot faster and so we had built up safety stock which is why our inventory balances are higher than we would normally have them. So we have built up in advance and we communicated to the customers that we had adequate supply to meet their forecast.", "And that -- in the end, they took whatever they thought they wanted to have and in some cases we believe they took more of our inventory than they actually ultimately needed.", "Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley", "Okay.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "I don\u2019t see -- there were no signs and no -- nothing that, I think, we could have done any differently on the inventory front.", "Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley", "Yeah. Okay, great. And then with regards to the industrial aerospace and defense that business has gyrated a lot. It was growing over 30% a few quarters ago and the slowed down. Now it looks like ex-defense really sort of start picking back up. Was there any kind of inventory dynamic around that movement -- that sort of excess that you saw in the mid part of last year, the slowdown and then snap back from that?", "Jon Olson", "Well, clearly, part of our explanation for the March quarter was -- and industrial, scientific and medical was related to some key customers that had inventory build-up that they were bleeding off. And then those customers bought inventory this past quarter, the June quarter. ", "And so we did experience that and that was the reason that we were different, I think, than some of our peers. It was customer -- specific customer related more than anything else. At this point in time we aren\u2019t seeing any real build up in the ISM category. And a", "Aerospace, defense is all program related really, so it's not the same kind of a business model.", "Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley", "Got it. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura. Your line is open", "Romit Shah - Nomura", "Yeah. Thanks a lot. Jon, it's my understanding that revenues have missed the midpoint of guidance two out of the last three quarters and it's been a little surprising given that we perceive you guys to be gaining share and beneficiary both LTE spending a better economy. ", "So can you just talk a little bit about what's been the challenge in terms of forecasting on a quarter-over-quarter basis, because it doesn\u2019t seem like this was an issue last year?", "Jon Olson", "Yeah, Romit, it's very interesting observation. You've kind of put a mirror right up to us here on that one. And you are right, we have missed, and it's really -- quite frankly, it's been in two areas, and the two areas we talk about this time, China LTE and aerospace and defense. And we have certainly ridden a bit of this roller coaster on the China LTE business, pretty much everything else we have relative to our end markets and other plans that we have made for the year seem to be working out just fine, but those two end markets have been difficult for us. ", "Aerospace and defense, while it does have a seasonal attribute to it where it\u2019s typically lower in this summer like it is now and then accelerates in September and December. It has been a little more pronounced. And as we came off the Defense Department budget changes and before that the sequestration issue, there has been a lot of churn going on with respect to military contractors and the quality of some of the forecasts that, you know, we have been less than to our expectations. ", "And so, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really any other broad base end market issue or customer issue, but we have struggled in getting to those forecast for China LTE and aerospace and defense in the last two or three quarters. And that pretty much explains why we've either missed or been at the low end of our range. ", "Romit Shah - Nomura", "And I guess, sitting here today, what's the confidence level that beyond fiscal 2015, you guys can get back to that 8% to 12% growth target? Or look at that target and say, yeah, that's the right way to think about our revenue growth.", "Jon Olson", "Yeah, from my perspective, it\u2019s to me -- this is -- these are the kind of things CFOs do think about a lot and try to figure out what's really going on and what's our trajectory level. And while, we can talk about design wins and how big the dollars are and all of those kinds of things, it\u2019s really around what are the big customer drivers, the big sockets that we have that should be delivering that kind of expansion to our SAM. And these are the sockets that are not traditionally FPGAs that we have won.", "And so I have gone back and I have checked on all of those businesses particularly in the wired area. Other end markets like test and measurement are going gangbusters on 28-nanometer. That's not really the issue. The growth is that communications side really, in a lot of places wireless and wired. And in every case the conversion and the SAM expansion activities that we have claimed are still on track. It's just happening slower than anticipated.", "So, that's what gives me confidence. I can't -- I don\u2019t know how to communicate that to the audience here in any different way, other than a tremendous amount of activity tracking what we think are the key differentiators that are going to result in SAM expansion for us. And we really aren\u2019t losing shares of 28-nanometer. If anything we are accelerating and winning more in the design win particularly in the SoC-based product and in wired communications side.", "Romit Shah - Nomura", "All right. Thank you. I appreciate your comments.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra from Baird. Your line is open. ", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Hi. Just a quick follow-up from the previous question. So, you mentioned that the ramp of TD-LTE in China had been more difficult to forecast that you had expected. You also mentioned during the Q&A that you over-shipped real end demand. So is it -- should we really assume that this is the end demand that's the problem? Or is there perhaps a discrepancy between the underlying infrastructure build and your revenue?", "And, if so, is it fair to assume that there is potentially a mix issue? I mean, we know that your market share is up year-over-year, so could there be something else, notably in terms of average ASPs that could be disappointing relative to the real end demand? ", "Jon Olson", "Yes, I think I would trying -- at least, if I understand the question correctly, Tristan, I was trying to answer that earlier in the call around the inventory imbalance that drove probably more of our issues in the June quarter overall, meaning the inventory balance of other component suppliers into the OEM, and the September quarter was more about the pace and the digestion of base stations in terms of the rollout for us. ", "So it is a combination of both. And again, I think, in the earlier part of the summer, it\u2019s really more around the component balancing at our customers' inventory.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Yes. I think what I meant is that you over-shipped and yet the past few quarters were disappointing. So is the end demand that much slower that what you initially predicted? Or is there a mix shift that\u2019s happening? ", "Obviously, we are seeing much larger contribution from the mid-range than the high-end, and we know the ASPs are not the same? Are you seeing a big discrepancy in terms of your next shipments versus the revenues that you are posting over the last few quarters specific to TD-LTE?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay, let me try to that. I think Jon has tried twice. Let me -- there were two separate elements here. One is in the previous cycle there was a shortage of other components and as a result because the customers got everything they needed from us they are now absorbing that. ", "And -- but in terms of the number, that was not a disappointment for us. So the overall number was in line with what we had expected. But the -- with regards to the third phase which is about to start that is delayed and that is delayed in our estimate by about quarter vis-\u00e0-vis what we had expected.", "It's not in the overall number, it's just in the timing and we do expect that help drive the business and it should drive our business starting from the December quarter and that will generate renewed growth, driven by China LTE.", "Now, all of the other businesses are starting to catch up and actually Jon commented about the growth we've seen in wired communication in 28-nanometer and that\u2019s growing at a slower rate, but it is happening. And that's more or less on track to continue over the next few quarters, right?", "So if you look the overall margin if you look at the overall margins, wherever there's a surge in wireless then you see a small dip in the overall margins and when there is a pause in wireless you see the margin go up at a faster rate. So that's what -- that explains that and it\u2019s the tightest element or the thing that is the percentage of wireless business.", "But as Jon pointed out this is this is well beyond Kintex this point in time. We are shipping a lot all of the families this point including Virtex and that's actually growing relatively faster as opposed to Kintex which was primarily driven by wireless requirement. Does that help?", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "It adds a lot of color. Thank you very much.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "And I have no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to you, Mr. Muscha. ", "Rick Muscha", "Great. Thanks for joining us today.

Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.", "Rick Muscha", "Thank you and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO, and Jon Olson, CFO.

It can be accessed from our Xilinx investor relations website. Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.", "Jon Olson", "Thank you, Rick. Xilinx sales were $604 million during the quarter and profitability at $0.62 per share was significantly higher than expected. Sales for Q2 fiscal 2015 were down 1% sequentially and in line with our guidance.", "All primary end-markets performed as we expected. With respect to the sub-end-markets, aerospace and defense, industrial, scientific and medical, test and measurement, automotive, and data center, all increased while all other secondary end-markets decreased.", "28-nanometer sales were flat and 40-nanometer sales declined as anticipated, reflecting an overall decline in our new products category. Our base category, which is comprised of our oldest products, increased significantly during the quarter, driven primarily by the timing of programs in the aerospace and defense end-market that we discussed with you last quarter. On a year-on-year basis, new products were up 21%, mainstream down 8%, and base products down 14%.", "Sales to communications customers were down significantly as expected, with two customers accounting for the majority of the decline. Both wired and wireless communications were down double digits sequentially, while data center sales increased. Turns were 48% for the quarter. Gross margin at 71.9% was a record for the company and better than expected, due to product and customer mix. Operating expenses were slightly better than expected at $235 million, including amortization of $2.4 million. This resulted in operating income of $200 million, up 22% from the same quarter a year ago.", "Other income and expense was a net expense of $6 million, slightly better than forecasted, mainly due to higher interest income on our investment portfolio. Net income for the quarter was $172 million or $0.62 per diluted share. A number of factors contributed to the high level of profitability including a higher gross margin percentage than forecasted, a tax credit for approximately $2 million utilized during the quarter, and a lower number of shares outstanding.", "Operating cash flow for the September quarter was $204 million before $8 million in CapEx. Diluted shares for the quarter were $267 million. This was $6 million less than forecasted due to the increased buyback activity during the quarter and the impact of the lower stock price. There was a 6.7 million share dilutive effect from our convertible note.", "We continue to be committed to returning cash to shareholders. During the quarter we stepped up our buyback activity, repurchasing 4.8 million shares for $200 million. We also paid $77 million in quarterly dividends. For the first half of the fiscal year, we returned over $450 million to shareholders in the form of repurchases and dividends, significantly more than we generated in operating cash flow.", "Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments decreased $49 million to approximately $3.6 billion. We have $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed-rate debt, resulting in a net cash position of approximately $2 billion.", "Inventory increased slightly during the quarter. The vast majority of our inventory is in new products for which we continue to have strong forecasted end-demand. As we discussed last quarter, our plans are to reduce inventory dollars by the end of the fiscal year.", "Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the December quarter of fiscal 2015. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up sequentially. We are expecting significant sequential growth from our 28-nanometer product family. We expect both wired and wireless communications to increase modestly.", "China wireless deployments continue to be gated by the availability of components essential to the ramp of FPGAs. We remain optimistic about the global LTE deployment and our strong position in wireless deployments. We expect the industrial and aerospace defense segment to be up, driven by continued program-related strength in aerospace and defense. Broadcast, automotive and consumer is expected to be flat. As a result, we are expecting total sales for the December quarter to be flat to up 4%. The midpoint of this guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 46%.", "Gross margin is expected to be approximately 69%. The sequential decrease in gross margin percent is driven by product mix as 28-nanometer revenue grows and older product revenue declines. In addition, as inventory begins to decline, we expect a negative impact to gross margin. For the full fiscal year we expect gross margin percent to be between 69% and 70%.", "Operating expenses in the December quarter are expected to be approximately $230 million, including $2.5 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Other income and expense for the December quarter is expected to be a net expense of approximately $6 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 272 million shares. The tax rate for the December quarter is expected to be approximately 13%.", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. While September revenue was in line with our guidance, I'm very pleased that we continue to deliver strong profitability. Gross margin increased to a record 71.9% and operating margin to 33.1%, both significantly higher than our expectations. These contributed to earnings per share of $0.62. As we had predicted, 28-nanometer revenue was flat sequentially, driven by a forecasted pause in China LTE activity.", "As we head into the second half of our fiscal year 2015, we're anticipating 28-nanometer revenue to renew its significant growth. This will be driven by a broad set of applications in wired communications, industrial, data center, defense and automotive markets, complemented by the strength of increasing LTE deployment. We anticipate 28-nanometer sales to exceed $150 million in the December quarter, driving overall sales growth for the company.", "28-nanometer product generation is without doubt the most successful node in our history, will serve as the growth driver for the company for several years going forward. Our 28-nanometer sales target in fiscal year 2015 is $600 million, an increase of approximately 60% from the previous fiscal year.", "At the 20-nanometer node, independent customer feedback indicates that we have approximately a one-year lead over the competition, both in terms of our ultra-scale silicon maturity and quality of results. This significant technology leadership is delivered in the broadest and most compelling midrange product family, complemented by the industry's only high-end family. This is manifested in the largest FPGA in the industry which delivers over 4x the capacity of competitive devices. All these are enabled by the unmatched abilities of our Vivado tool suite, which is uniquely delivering only to Xilinx customers fastest time to market, most efficient device utilization, fast [ph] performance and lowest power.", "The record success of the 28-nanometer portfolio, which is still in the early phases of revenue growth, combined with the competitiveness, breadth and execution to date for already delivered 20-nanometer solutions and about to be delivered in early 2015 16-nanometer ultra-scale portfolio will drive increased share gains against both ASICs ASSPs traditional programmable competition.", "Now I will turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]", "Your first question is from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Ryan Carver \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is Ryan Carver in for John.", "I know one of the things that has been difficult is to quantify sort of number of base stations being deployed in China. I'm wondering if you could maybe help us understand relative to sort of the 3G cycle, you know, this quarter or sort of the cycle to date for 4G versus sort of the ramp in 3G. And I guess what I'm trying to think about is, you know, kind of dollar content for base station. I think you guys have talked about a 2x increase from 2G to 3G and a 3x increase from 2G to 4G. But it seems like wireless revenue, at least from sort of the peaking period in 2010, is probably down currently. So I'm just trying to understand from a like-for-like perspective in terms of base station units, how you guys sort of think about that and if the content growth is actually playing out as expected.", "Jon Olson", "Yes. Well, first off, Ryan, it's very difficult to compare these two ramps because we are still very much in the middle stages of 4G and we've already seen that the predictability has been quite difficult, primarily because of shortages in the supply chain vis-a-vis what China Mobile might prefer they want to do. So, comparing the number of base stations generation to generation, I just can't -- I don't have any good rule of thumb for you to figure that out.", "I mean I do think that 4G number of base stations deployed will be a greater number of base stations than 3G in the end when you think of all the technologies. And we are still very much in the ramp-up of that capability across China. So I would say the way I had thought about 3G ramp was that it was very fast, very sharp, up, level off for a while and then came down relatively sharply. This is -- this has had a lot more volatility relative to 4G versus 3G. So it's a pace issue that to me has turned out to be very different so far. And again, it's because of the supply chain issues they have.", "Now relative to content, I think we've said in the past that all base stations are not necessarily created equal in terms of their -- both the OEMs who manufacture them relative to FPGA content by OEM, and also then again the various models of centralized versus distributed, remote radio heads versus centralized, things like that.", "But when you look at the manufacturers that are using, in the radio, cars, in particular, all FPGA implementation, it's really clear to us that there's a 50% revenue increase over 3G. Those manufacturers who are using ASIC deployments with FPGA companionships, then that percentage doesn't hold quite as easily. And so it does depend on the mix of which OEM we're talking about. And each of those OEMs have different levels of logistics issues in the 4G technology rollout as we sit here today.", "Ryan Carver \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Good, thanks. And as a quick follow-up, I think the magnitude of the industrial performance for the September quarter was certainly a bit above expectations. Can you just kind of walk through how this -- how you think this is going to play out? You obviously are guiding it a bit higher in December quarter. How should we think of that kind of going into the first part of next year? And I guess as a correlation to that, what's, you know, do you guys expect gross margins to come down as base units, kind mix lower as a percentage of revenue?", "Jon Olson", "Yes. We have a huge end-market mix going on right now that's driving that gross margin up this quarter as a result of all of our industrial -- all sub-segments within the industrial category going up in the September quarter. And then the guide is for aerospace and defense subcategory to go up, the other two being ISM and test and measurement will be flat to down. So there's a little bit of a difference there.", "The aerospace and defense is clearly program-related. And we pushed a lot of programs -- several programs got pushed into the September quarter, out of June into September for us, that's contributing to this. And we are expecting strong aerospace and defense again one more quarter. And this is a very seasonal bracket around the government fiscal year. Typically, in March you would see aerospace and defense then declining. And then our belief is the offset to that will be the communications business growing significantly during that time period.", "Ryan Carver \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Great, thanks. Good results, guys.", "Jon Olson", "Next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question is from Romit Shah with Nomura. Your line is open.", "Romit Shah \u2013 Nomura", "Thanks. Hi, Jon. Hi, Moshe. And yeah, congrats on the good results. I imagine it's a pretty tough environment out there. Jon, just seeing the strong growth in base products and industrial aerospace combined with the 72% gross margin, I think may start to feed speculation that sales this past quarter were artificially boosted by last-time buys. And so I was wondering if you could address that. And then I have a follow-up.", "Jon Olson", "Yes. So it is true that the aerospace and defense and industrial, scientific and medical category does have very long design-in and long tails relative to when they ramp to production. So that would lead you to believe or understand that many of our older products, when those end-markets grow, it's more of our older products that are contributing to the biggest part of that, not just our new products, which is a little different than maybe some of the end-markets we have. And so when you see this new product category going down and communications going down where there's a lot of new products sold into the wireless technology, you have this big swing in the mix, meaning comms down, new products down, base products way up because of those particular two end-markets that grew quite dramatically.", "So inside of those -- the base products is the last-time buy, but it isn't the only element of base products and it isn't the only element that gets sold into those technologies. Essentially Virtex-5, Virtex-4, those are not considered last-time buy products, were very strong contributors in the aerospace and the ISM end-markets as well. But also some of the even older products and some of those were considered last-time buys.", "So I don't know about the word artificial. We'll take whatever business we get. But you're right; there is this big push-up of these end-markets that will -- there'll be a flop as the seasonality hits us later on aerospace and defense, and it will come down some. And that's driving the 72% gross margin.", "We remain confident on the 68% to 70% range for running the business at this point in time. And we did have this higher profitability because of the end-market mix, and will return to a more balanced mix over time.", "Romit Shah \u2013 Nomura", "Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess in light of the current macro environment, which seems to have weakened recently, and your comments about supply chain constraints in communications, how do you feel about the fiscal 2015 target of 5%. Is that still a realistic target for this fiscal year?", "Jon Olson", "Yes. So we aren't forecasting the fourth quarter in this call, and that may get you to think that we're backing away from the 5%. But quite frankly, it's really highly dependent on this wireless supply chain shortage issue. We've had large wireless OEM customers say we would be taking more FPGAs if we had more power amplifiers. They've made that statement to us. And so the whole notion that China Mobile claims they want to do a couple hundred thousand more base stations this year, I don't see where those units -- excuse me, the supply chain is going to be able to support that in the short order based on what we see.", "And so the fourth quarter for us is a growth quarter for 28-nanometer. It is a growth quarter vis-a-vis what we think will end up in December. Whether we -- it's definitely possible we could get to the 5%, but we are not making that commitment at this point in time due to this reduced visibility.", "Romit Shah \u2013 Nomura", "And is this issue with the power amplifiers, is this just a timing issue, meaning that you're not sure if you're going to, you know, ship X number of FPGAs in March or whether it will spill over to June? Or --", "Jon Olson", "We don't believe we're going to lose share - we're losing any share in this time period. It is a matter of when they are going to ship, the timing of that, when the allocation of power amplifiers increases, if it ever does. We don't produce those, so therefore I can't give you a good reading on when that is going to be alleviated. But we don't think this impacts the total dollars for the overall China LTE deployment for us. It's timing.", "Romit Shah \u2013 Nomura", "Okay. Thanks, Jon.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Ambrish Srivastava \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Thank you. My first question, Jon and Moshe, with respect to communications for the reported quarter, it sounds like it was weaker than what you had guided to because you had said down but it came in way lower, down 19. My question really is, given how big you now are at Huawei and also given your success on the radio side, are you aware of any ASIC conversions going on with HiSilicon? Because it's our understanding that HiSilicon's business has been on a tear the last couple of quarters. So that was my first question.", "And second is on the capital allocation, Jon. Could you just remind us what is the company thinking on capital allocation and also how much buyback do you have in the arsenal? Thank you.", "Jon Olson", "Sure. On the comms, comms was down quite a bit. And the biggest part of it was the wireless piece that was down versus the wired. But wired was also down quite, you know, from a double-digit perspective, you know, pretty healthy. But think of it more like two-thirds of that was wireless and maybe a third was wired at the highest level.", "It really -- I mean none of that was caused by any substitution from an ASIC perspective at all. This is -- HiSilicon and Huawei continue to work very closely together. There are ASICs on the board. We don't, you know, we're not being substituted out in any of the companionships that is anything material that would drive a lower overall Huawei number from us versus our expectations. So I guess the answer to your question is really no, we're not seeing that necessarily on the wireless side. ", "From a capital allocation perspective, we did increase our repurchase level quite significantly in the first half of our fiscal year. And our strategy has really been to first define what we think the right answer for the dividend is and try to be a consistent increaser of dividend over time, and then the remainder of the cash allocated to return back to shareholders. It's really opportunistic from using repurchases as the balance to that.", "And as we see, you know, as we see what happened in the stock market to us last quarter, we thought it was appropriate for us to increase our buyback significantly. We aren't gated by a 70% number or an 80% number or 100% number. We're gated but what we think is the right time to buy back and our confidence relative to the business model that we have. And so we've made the call to increase it significantly in the first half. We still have, on the current authorization, a little less than $200 million available as approved by the Board of Directors.", "Ambrish Srivastava \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. So it's consistent, no change. Thank you, Jon.", "Jon Olson", "Right.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Vivek Arya \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to talk about the 28-nanometer revenue target at $600 million. I'm wondering what is the contribution from wireless in that. Is it fair to think it's about 35%, 40% of that, or is it less or more? I just want to get some rough ballpark of how much wireless contributes to that.", "Jon Olson", "Yes. Actually I'm a little bit at a loss. I'd have to look into that for you, Vivek.", "You know, Kintex is by far the biggest driver, and that's in the neighborhood of 40% or 50% of our overall number in wireless. And Kintex is the primary parts that go into the wireless technology for China, at the 28-nanometer level. But I think I need to go dig into that. I haven't really looked at the end-markets split of 28-nanometer that closely. I don't want to throw out a bad number. I don't think I mind giving you a range; I just don't have the number at my fingertips.", "Vivek Arya \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So I guess, Jon, maybe where I'm going with that question is that, what is giving you the confidence that you will be able to achieve $600 million at 28 nanometers given that wireless is the growth driver and there is some uncertainty on the pace of the build-out and then just the supply of other components? Why do you think you will be able to achieve $600 million in 28-nanometer revenue?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Vivek, this is Moshe. Our target is 600. If you examine our comments closely, that's driven by a whole host of markets. The amount of design wins, the breadth, the depth transcends all markets. And what happens is at different points in time, different markets tend to grow at different rates.", "Generally speaking, if you take out the ones which are lumpier, and wireless falls into that. There are, you know, in particular, wireless in China tends to come in big lumps, driven by external elements. But if you take that out, then 28-nanometer has been growing constantly every single quarter since we started. It took a huge leap in the December and March quarters, and those were driven by wireless. But then as -- and that's LTE in China. But as that took a pause, then the other elements continued to grow.", "So it would be appropriate it to think that wireless is a driver, but it's not the only driver, and to assume that over time what happens is design wins in other markets start to turn to revenue. We expect some of those, and they are turning to revenue, have been over the past quarters. One which will start in the next calendar year to accelerate is, for example, automotive. In addition, we do expect wired comms to somewhat -- a little later than we had expected, but we do expect that to catch on. So long answer to a question, but it is multi-markets, it's not only wireless.", "Vivek Arya \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. Very helpful, Moshe. And maybe just as a follow-up to that, I think the investor worry is that if, let's say, the China base station build-out does peak, right, over the next couple of quarters, are there enough of other applications out there to help you grow into your target revenues? Because when I look at the last eight or ten years of the communications and data center revenues from you guys or even with your competitor, it's only grown half the time. Right? So it coincides with the CapEx cycles and it seems like that CapEx cycle could peak next year. So do you think there is enough of range of applications outside of wireless and China base stations that you can still grow the overall company at above the rate of semiconductors?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "You know, I'm loathe to provide anything vis-a-vis the rate of semiconductors. So I'd rather just focus on our numbers. And those are the ones that we are responsible for. And what is driving our growth now is a very virtuous product cycle with a huge and very broad number of design wins across all applications. And that is -- and hence, we are very confident that 28-nanometer, just due to the breadth and depth of our offering and the number of design wins, will be by far our largest node. And that is driving our growth.", "As part of that, this long-awaited ability to grow the fam through ASIC replacement and ASSPs is starting to happen. Again, it's happening a little more slowly, unfortunately. But there is no doubt, and as the Zynq product offering starts to gather momentum, that it's all ASSP replacement because it clearly changes -- enables us to displace ASSPs.", "ASICs are happening at the high-end. They are happening quite broadly now as the ASIC market is devolving and it's becoming less and less viable except for high-volume, very high-volume consumer type applications. So all of those are growth vectors. And that is helping grow our market. It's helping grow the entire programmable market. And that should enable us not to be necessarily linked to any previous cycle. It is a growth arena potential, and I absolutely would agree that we have yet to demonstrate that. But that is happening in terms of design wins. The transition to revenue will enable us to do that.", "So we are very confident in that trend. And the growth -- I'll take one example. Automotive is a market we had very, very, very peripherals play in, in the past. And we expect -- and it's a market that develops relatively slowly. But in terms of our design wins and our confidence in those design wins we expect to see significant growth in calendar 2015 and calendar 2016 and calendar 2017, in that area. We really did not have a huge play in previous generations.", "Wired comms, again, is another area where 28-nanometer has yet to fall into a stride and rhythm there. And that's more delayed and we had expected. But again, those design wins are now moving into production and they will, over the next year or so, translate to revenue. So I think there's a lot -- if you look at the data and the details, and there's a lot of reasons that -- to not to believe that previous cycles are necessarily a perfect predictor of what will happen now. This time it is different.", "Vivek Arya \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "I hope so. Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to go back, Jon. You said that the quarter played out fairly as you expected, and obviously you didn't tell us exactly what numbers to model. But obviously comm was down significantly and industrial up. Jjust wanted to make sure that that was your comment, that it all played out. And you've seen fairly soft comments on the wired side. I was surprised that wireless was the weaker one. What is wired looking like as you go forward? You're looking for growth. Have you seen these pockets of weakness that others are seeing?", "Jon Olson", "Yes. The characterization that the quarter played out as we anticipated, all end-markets went in the direction we said. Comms was down a little bit more and industrial and aerospace and defense was up a little bit more than we'd anticipated. And so there was a little bit more of a pronounced down and up in those two specific, you know, those specific cases.", "And I'm sorry, and the rest of your question, Blayne --", "Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital", "The second part was the wired, there's been several data points that wired is kind of getting worse. You seem to see it going up.", "Jon Olson", "Yeah. Wired was -- the wired issue is that we had a couple of very large customers who had taken a lot of product the previous quarter for -- a lot of this was around access and transport capabilities. And there's some inventory adjustment going on in some cases and also they're beginning a transition from 40-nanometer technology to our 28-nanometer technology, so they were buying quite a bit of the older products earlier. And they're going to start to transition all their new products to 28-nanometer over time.", "So it was again customer specific. The overall trend for wired is still up. And as Moshe just articulated, we are expecting 28-nanometer in wired to grow in the coming quarters pretty significantly.", "Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then just secondly, on the industrial A&D market, huge sequential. Was that primarily defense as you had talked about? Was that the vast majority of the contribution? And then when you look into December, it's growing again. Is that still the defense snapping back after the transition? And can you just go over the seasonality there again? I was kind of confused on the comments. Does it come back down to a more normalized level?", "Jon Olson", "Yeah. The high-level category, which includes aerospace and defense and industrial, scientific, medical, and test and measurement, all three of those categories grew in the September quarter. Aerospace and defense subcategory grew a lot. And that was consistent with what we had talked about before, that it was way low the last couple of quarters on a run rate basis and it was going to bounce back and catch up.", "Going forward in December, aerospace and defense subcategory is going up and the other two are flat to down. And so the increase won't be as pronounced in that overall category but it will be driven by aerospace and defense. Then what is typical for us is, in March and June, is that the aerospace and defense subcategory goes down because of the seasonality around bracketing the end of the government fiscal year in September. And we have had this effect fairly consistently over many years of the company.", "So there is definitely going to be some up in those categories and then some down in aerospace and defense as we get to March and June quarters. I hope that was clear.", "Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Yeah, very clear, thank you. And just the node that defense is on, I mean into that context of the last-time buys.", "Jon Olson", "The last-time buy node is 130-nanometer, a part of our 130-nanometer capability. And again, aerospace and defense, industrial and scientific and medical buy 130, 90, 40, 28-nanometer. It's across the board, but it's always weighted towards the lower, you know, the older products just because of the nature of that business, very long design-in and very long qualification.", "Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. Thanks, Jon.", "Jon Olson", "Next question?", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Tristan Gerra with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Hi, good afternoon. Just as a follow-up to some questions that have already taken place regarding the December quarter outlook. A quarter ago you stated your expectation for revenue to be down starting in the December quarter. Since then, China Mobile raised their TD-LTE base station target by 200K so that's at least $60 million in incremental revenue, which will be about 10% of your September quarter revenue. Are there other end-markets representing an offset to your expectations for the quarter going to the December quarter? Could be the wired market? Or is it because you don't think you're going to ship more than incremental 200K TD-LTE base units by yearend or by calendar year end?", "Jon Olson", "Yeah. I'm not sure I got the very front end of your declarative statement on what we said. I don't believe -- if you said we said wireless would be down in December, we did not say that last quarter.", "Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Total revenue.", "Jon Olson", "We did not say total revenue would be down either in the December quarter. We've said that we were going to grow in the second half of the fiscal year, which is December and March. So that's not us that said that.", "And so inside of that growth is a strong growth in wireless and a strong growth in wired that we had modeled into the second half. To your point around the incremental 200,000 base stations, earlier I made the comment around the shortage issue, and I have a lack of confidence that China Mobile will be successful in getting all the base stations to deploy that. And this will push out into calendar 2015.", "Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay. And as a follow-up, is it fair to assume that, as a result, your China exposure within wireless is going to continue to increase in the March quarter, and as such, I guess we could make implications for gross margin given the mix?", "Jon Olson", "So, yes, we do believe our China mix will continue to increase as we go throughout the year. And it is true that the gross margin will move back down, as we said, in December and again in March as mix -- as our overall product mix and customer mix gets a little more normal to our business and then we fall into the 68% to 70% range that we've been forecasting. When you take the effect of what happened to us this quarter and our belief of the margin number for March, we do believe that the gross margin will be between 69% and 70% for the full fiscal year.", "Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Great. Thank you.", "Jon Olson", "Next question?", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Srinivas Pajjuri with CLSA Research. Your line is open.", "Srinivas Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA Research", "Jon, a couple of questions. On the supply constraints that you mentioned, do you think that's only impacting the radio card build, or do you think that's impacting the baseband card build as well?", "Jon Olson", "Srini, I think it's impacting both because I think it's -- certainly, our business is more impacted by the radio card, meaning we have a higher revenue content in our overall wireless business than radio. It's about half radio and the rest, the other half, is between baseband and microwave backhaul business. But for us, you know, having shortages on the radio card is a bigger deal to us, but I do believe that the power amplifier issues are both baseband and radio card.", "Srinivas Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA Research", "Okay, fair enough. And then maybe for Moshe, you mentioned that, I think, you have about a year lead in 20-nanometer. Given that 2016 is just around the corner, how big do you think 20 is going to be for the industry?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "We expect the sum of 20 and 16 to approach what 28 will be. And it's difficult for us to make the division between the two. Fundamentally, 20-nanometer for us will be two years ahead of 16-nanometer and two years ahead of any competing product in an advanced node. So typically that provides us with a pretty reasonable portion of revenue. And our product offering in 20 is very broad. It has the midrange and it has a high-end and super-high-end component to it. So we're very bullish on what it will provide. But clearly it won't be as good as 28, which for a variety of reasons actually is broader and will have a longer life due to some cost-related elements. So that's why our analysis is 20 and 14, 16 will be, combined, at best like 28.", "Srinivas Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA Research", "Okay, great. And then, Jon, just one clarification. As we head into the next quarter, you are guiding down the share count pretty meaningfully. Is it just the buybacks and the convert? Or is there anything else I should be aware of? Thank you.", "Jon Olson", "No. It was our best estimate of choosing share price to compute the dilution with, from the converts, and then implementing our buyback strategy.", "Srinivas Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA Research", "Great. Thank you.", "Jon Olson", "Next question?", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of John Vinh with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.", "John Vinh \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First question that I had was just wanted to clarify the expectations for a rebound in wireless in the March quarter. Is that solely predicated on the constraints on RFPAs starting to ease? Are you also making some assumptions about some FDD-LTE contributions in the March quarter as well?", "Jon Olson", "Yes, I think it's more, John, I think it's more around the phase three introduction for the TD and the fact that we would end up with, I would say, a full quarter of that effect. While there will be some builds of FD during that time period, we believe it's not the biggest driver; it's really around TD. And again, we don't -- since we don't make the power amplifiers, we don't know for sure when it's easing. We're going by what our customers are telling us, that they believe the March quarter, that they'll be ordering more FPGAs for us, so they must be confident that they are going to have an adequate supply to be able to do that. But it's really around the phase three timing is what we're counting on the most in order to drive that growth in the March quarter. ", "John Vinh \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Got it. And then my follow-up question is, if you look at kind of the ramp of China Mobile and TD-LTE, it seems like their macro base station deployments could be down next year. Should we think about China wireless peaking this year, or is there a possibility that some of the FDD contributions could drive continued growth in China wireless next year?", "Jon Olson", "Yeah, there are a lot of moving parts, as you can imagine, here with what might get pushed into calendar 2015, being the March quarter, versus what might happen to us in December. Our belief is that calendar 2015 will be higher than, you know, maybe it's only slightly higher, but higher than calendar 2014 relative to our overall China-related business. And yes, some of that will be FD, particularly in the second half of calendar 2015.", "John Vinh \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Ross Seymore \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hey, guys. Congrats on the strong result and guide. Jon, a lot of questions about the industrial and aerospace and defense. Now that it's 40% of your revenues, at least in this last quarter, could you give us a rough estimate about how big that aero and defense side is? And how long does that tend to adjust to the downside similar to what it has now done for, it looks like, a couple quarters to the upside when it does in fact turn? Thanks.", "Jon Olson", "Yes. So it's, I mean it's typically aerospace and defense has been around 15% of our total revenue of the company. And obviously this last quarter it's a little higher than that, by a percent or two. So it is larger. And some of it was created by the fact that we had such a low point, lower than we would have expected, in the summertime, and that's driven that up little bit. So it's one of those things you have to look at over the whole year and compare it to the previous year to kind of get a normality.", "I would definitely expect, based on some of the programs that have gone through, are going through for us in September and December, that March will be down, I would say, quite a bit. I don't know if I want to use the word significantly because we are not always sure of what programs are going to be happening out there, and it seems like the military activity on a worldwide basis is pretty brisk right now. So there's all kinds of things that surprise us sometimes on what programs come back and requiring more product.", "Ross Seymore \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "And is the typical seasonality for the other two portions of that first cut segments to be an offset seasonally in those March and June quarters?", "Jon Olson", "Yeah, generally, the industrial, scientific and medical is a little bit softer in the summertime leading into September. Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. But yes, there's going to be offsets there.", "There's going to be offset in automotive. Our automotive business, while it grew this quarter, September quarter we do expect next year for it to grow quite significantly. And Moshe talked about some of the drivers earlier on that one. So yes, we do see offsets in that category test and measurement. Again that can be sometimes choppy. We do expect some growth there as well.", "Ross Seymore \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "If I could sneak one more in really quickly. Can you just walk us through why the inventory coming down is going to weigh on the gross margin? And just how did the inventory get so high to begin with? I think it's at an all-time record as far as I can tell. Then I'll go away. Thanks.", "Jon Olson", "Yeah. It's definitely higher on a dollar -- forget the days part for a minute because that's a mathematic or arithmetic calculation, it involves our cost of sales number. But if you look at the absolute balance of net inventory, it is higher than we would have liked to have it.", "And if you recall back a few quarters ago, we made probably, now a year ago, we said that we were going to start to grow inventory for two reasons. One is we wanted to make sure we had adequate supply for the peaks of 28-nanometer, specifically in the wireless segment. And think of China in that particular area. And number two, our primary foundry building -- our foundry building 28-nanometer product was going to be constrained, and we wanted to build ahead of that constraint to make sure we had adequate inventory. So we built up a significant amount of safety stock. ", "When this volatility started to happen in the China wireless, because of logistics constraints of other products, we had built up an overshot, if you will, the amount of safety stock that we needed to build. And so we started to cut our wafers a quarter or two ago, and the effect of that is, as the outs happen from the foundry, that effect is going to start December and March for us.", "So what that really means is, from a, why-is-there-margin impact, is we built up inventory a lot. We built up some products effectively several quarters ago at slightly higher cost. Costs are reflected at actual costs. And as that moves through inventory and out as reduced inventory, you end up having to flesh out some of the more expensive inventory. And you are seeing some downward margin pressure.", "Again, as you look at the whole year time period you are going to see right at our expectations, maybe even a little higher. We said 68% to 70% and now we are forecasting 69% to 70%. So the overall business model thesis is intact. There are some fluctuations driven by the inventory build and decline.", "Ross Seymore \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is open.", "Joe Meares \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "This is Joe Meares calling in for Will Stein. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, understanding that you are not going to be forecasting out beyond the quarter, there has been some expectation for increased weakening the macro environment. I just wondered if you could give Xilinx's view there.", "Jon Olson", "Yes. That's not without notice on our part, as the European GDP forecast continue to go down and I would say quite a bit of volatility and toughness in the U.S. China actually has been the source of strength for us, not just the wireless piece but also industrial side. And Japan has been kind of okay for us on a year-on year basis. There's a lot of activity going on there that can put some pressure, particularly on CapEx, in the comms space.", "We alternately feel good and not so good about what's going on there with respect to some of our customers and the effect that they are having, it is having on them. But to balance that out, Joe, there is certainly strength in our new product growth, which, as companies produce new products and start to ramp new products, even in this macro situation we end up selling a lot of products because we have increased content going in some of these pieces of equipment.", "So we do think we have some counterbalance to the macro effect. And that's why we are still forecasting growth in the second half of our fiscal year. Obviously, any sort of very large scale macro collapse would impact us just like everybody else. We're not immune to that.", "Joe Meares \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "That's very helpful, thank you. And just as a follow-up, I guess if you could give any comment on demand trends in the channel? And that's it for me.", "Jon Olson", "Yeah. Demand trends in the channel, our smaller customers continue to be a little on the weak side, as they have been throughout the year. Our overall distribution revenue though is still, because of the new product effect has been on an upward trend. But some of the I'll say smaller customers, large customer balance is still, you know, we are still seeing the effect of slightly more business coming from the larger customers than smaller customers.", "Joe Meares \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "That's very helpful. Thanks again.", "Jon Olson", "Next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Your line is open.", "Ian Ing \u2013 MKM Partners", "Thanks. First question, ultra-scale 20 nanometers, any data on yield improvements, how that's comparing to 28 nanometers? And also for 28, any manufacturing cost reductions that remain at this point? Thanks.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So, ultra-scale is doing extremely well both in terms of product introduction on the midrange, which we led with, and the high-end. And we are about to deliver the ultra-high-end solutions to our customers. With regards to defect density and maturity of the products, it's ahead of where we were at the same point in time at 28-nanometer. And 28-nanometer was very smooth introduction for us. But 20-nanometer, and this is the second-generation we have done with TSMC, has been extremely smooth. ", "So it's going really well. And it's moving into production on all fronts. And the defect densities are ahead of where the 28-nanometer was at that same point in time. The product quality is even higher than what the 28-nanometer was at an equivalent point in time. So for us this is as smooth an introduction as we have ever seen or actually smoother than we've seen, both in terms of the product design in the manufacturing flow.", "Jon Olson", "I'll make a comment on 28-nanometer. 28-nanometer, we are certainly very pleased with where we are on a defect density basis, which is the biggest driver of cost reductions typically. We aren't down to our lowest level or our lowest expectation yet, but we're doing extremely well there.", "But that being said, there are always things we are working on relative to reducing packages and test times and things like that. So we still believe we have some more cost wring out on 28-nanometer, however we -- a lot of the cost reduction has already been reflected.", "Ian Ing \u2013 MKM Partners", "Yes. And then for the wired business I know you said there's some program timing issues that have been impacting you. But are you confident it's going to be a better environment? It seems the telecom spending environment is not exactly robust in the developed markets. So, just your thoughts on that going forward.", "Jon Olson", "Yes. I mean I think we have counted on wired CapEx being a little more favorable than it -- I mean historically we've said very positive things about the CapEx environment. But it really hasn't come true quite the way we thought. But again we have an increased content level at some of the very large communications manufacturers and in certain of their new products with our 28-nanometer generation, both broadly with the very high-end Virtex parts and Zynq, additive to what we already have with, I'll say, regular Virtex and our Kintex lines. So we are expecting the new product growth to help -- be additive to us despite the mixed CapEx spending environment.", "Ian Ing \u2013 MKM Partners", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Unverified Participant", "This is Joe on for Chris. Thanks for letting me ask a question. So the first question, do you guys have any visibility into hardware versus software for base station upgrades? And if you would talk about maybe the content opportunities relative to each other and any shift between the two going forward, I'd appreciate it.", "Jon Olson", "I think we are generally seeing hardware deployments, not conversion of existing base stations via software to make those deployments, really not seeing a great deal of that happening. It's really a lot of new base stations and a lot of new radio heads associated with that. Again, the frequencies are radically different. You do need different radio heads. You do need different software implemented in the FPGA. And then we also have Zynq going forward.", "So, we really aren't subscribing to the point that there's software upgrades going on in that market, to a large degree.", "Unverified Participant", "Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then just as my follow-up, just to follow on to the question about the channel, can you talk about inventories in the channel? And then do you guys have a good grasp on inventories, especially in China? Any color there would be appreciated.", "Jon Olson", "Yes, our inventories have been pretty lean in the channel. And in fact, the inventory management logistics relationship we have with Avnet is quite good and quite -- and we work together to keep it very lean. So it's not always indicative of what their businesses are not, in other words, what our inventory balance is with them doesn't necessarily imply good or bad business on expectations on their part as we do have this really tight coupling of logistics.", "But I would say overall, from an inventory in the channel or inventory at customers across our broad set of end-markets, other than the wireless lumpiness that we've had with excess inventories and a little bit at a few customers in wired, we generally do not see inventory building in the channel across our broad base of end-markets outside of some of the comms areas.", "Rick Muscha", "Operator, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Okay, certainly. Your last question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Harlan Sur \u2013 JPMorgan", "I think you brought up a good point of China being more than just wireless. So how did the China industrial segment trend in the September quarter? And how are you seeing that here in the December quarter?", "Jon Olson", "So generally China industrial has been on a positive trend throughout the year, and we do expect that to continue to show strength. And the penetration across a variety of applications that are vision-related or scientific and medical, which is a huge new opportunity for China's manufacturers to serve that market, we are getting really good uptake in those particular categories. They are building; their industrial base is obviously expanding in China. And there's more manufacturers that are local manufacturers that are contributing equipment to that versus them importing equipment from other areas. So we are participating in that ramp as well. So all in all, we have been pretty positive in that area. It's definitely a source of growth for us in the industrial, scientific and medical category.", "Harlan Sur \u2013 JPMorgan", "Good to hear. And then data center was a bright spot within your comms business in the second quarter. What were some of the applications that drove this growth? And then how are some of the new applications like workload acceleration and enterprise SSD controllers shaping up to be potential meaningful contributors on a go-forward basis?", "Jon Olson", "The biggest area of growth this last quarter was storage. And that has been our largest individual contributing revenue area to this point in time, even though the acceleration business and the switch integration capabilities in the data center are other big areas for us that are emerging and we have an increasing number of design wins there; we just don't have the growth in revenue yet. That will come next year. So it's really been -- more of the growth right now has been around storage. And we do anticipate next year to have these other two categories grow more significantly.", "Harlan Sur \u2013 JPMorgan", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Rick Muscha", "Okay. Thanks for joining us today. We have a playback of this call beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time, 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time today. For a copy of our earnings release, please visit our IR website.", "Our next earnings release date for the third quarter of fiscal year 2015 will be Wednesday, January 21, after market close.", "This quarter we will be presenting at the Barclays Global Technology Conference in San Francisco on December 10. In addition, please do save the date for our 2015 analyst meeting on March 10 in New York. More details to follow.", "This completes our call.

Fiscal 2015 was another strong year of profitability for the company, with operating income up 31.8%, the highest in four years. Industrial and aerospace and defense category increased 7% for the year, representing a record 39% of total sales. The communications segment declined 5% impacted by lower than expected CapEx spend in many of our sub-applications. The broadcast consumer and automotive category decreased 2%. However, the automotive sub-segment grew significantly, increasing 30% during the year. For the company as a whole, fiscal year sales were $2.4 billion, flat with the prior year.", "Gross margin was a record 70% for the fiscal year benefiting from end market mix as well as continued cost reduction and margin expansion initiatives across our product platform portfolio. In fiscal year 2015, we returned over 120% of our operating cash flow to shareholders, which represent about 40% of our revenues. This consisted of a record $306 million in dividend payout and a stock repurchase of 15.3 million shares for $650 million. The March quarter of fiscal 2015 marked the 10th consecutive year of dividend increases for the company putting Xilinx in a very elite group of technology companies. Cash flow per share has increased at a compound annual rate of 14% in the past 10 years, driven by a combination of gross margin expansion, disciplined expense controls, working capital management and share repurchase.", "Turning now to a discussion of the March quarter, Xilinx sales were $567 million, down 4% sequentially and within our guidance. 28-nanometer sales exceeded $160 million as forecasted. Sales from communications and datacenter declined 7% sequentially and were weaker than anticipated. Wired communication was approximately flat as expected, while wireless sales decreased double-digits. The weakness in the wireless segment was primarily due to continued softness in North America and a weakening in China LTE business. Industrial and aerospace and defense business also decreased although not as much as anticipated during the quarter. Expected declines from defense were partially offset by better than expected business from both industrial scientific medical as well as test and measurement.", "Lastly, broadcast consumer and automotive was better than expected with automotive achieving a record quarter, while broadcast was flat and consumer was down. Gross margin was 59.9% for the quarter better than anticipated, primarily as a result of product and customer mix although we continue to be focused on driving improvements and profitability. Combined R&D and SG&A expense were $211 million, significantly lower than forecasted, primarily as a result of lower stock-based compensation expense in addition to continued cost efforts.", "Operating income was $159 million, including amortization of $2.4 million and a $24 million restructuring charge or $0.08 per diluted share. The restructuring charge reflects the impact of streamlining certain internal organizations as well as the impact of a transition from sales reps to a direct sales model for certain customers. Other income was $1 million, higher than guided primarily due to an $8 million gain or $0.03 per diluted share from the sale of land.", "Net income for the quarter was $135 million or $0.50 per diluted share. Operating cash flow for the March quarter was $166 million before $6 million in CapEx during the quarter. Diluted shares for the quarter were 270 million, slightly less than forecasted and down 25 million shares from the same quarter a year ago. There was a 5.7 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions related to the dilution associated with our convertible debt, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com. We repurchased 4.4 million shares for $175 million during the quarter and paid $70 million in dividends.", "Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments were flat sequentially at $3.6 billion. We have $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed rate debt, resulting in a net cash position of approximately $2 billion. Inventory dollars at Xilinx decreased by $16 million sequentially, but days increased to 136.", "Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the June quarter of fiscal year \u201816. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up sequentially. Both wired and wireless communications are expected to decline. Wired communications remains sluggish although data center will likely increase. Wireless will be impacted by slowing China LTE builds in the near-term. We expect the industrial and aerospace and defense segment to be down driven primarily by continued expected decreases from A&D. Lastly, we expect broadcast consumer and automotive to be approximately flat. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be flat to down 4% sequentially. And the midpoint of this guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 47%. The lower turns rate is primarily due to a couple of large customers being more fully booked to expectations and a regional distributor transition.", "Gross margin is expected to be approximately 69% to 70%. Operating expenses for the June quarter are expected to be approximately $210 million, including $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. The Q1 fiscal \u201816 operating expense level will be at its lowest level for the year due to lower tape-out activity and timing of expenses to ramp up headcount post-restructuring. The headcount additions will largely be driven by hiring in the sales force and to a lesser degree in R&D.", "For the full year, we are lowering our spending forecast as follows. R&D is expected to be between $530 million and $540 million. SG&A will be between $340 million and $360 million. Amortization of intangibles will be approximately $8 million. Other income and expense for the June quarter will be a net expense of $12 million, due to lower interest income and anticipated hedging losses. For the full year, other interest and expense will be a net expense of approximately $33 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 266 million shares. The tax rate for the June quarter is expected to be approximately 13%.", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you, Jon and good afternoon to you all. We are very pleased with the strength of our 28-nanometer products, which exceeded $160 million. As expected, we continue to expand the breadth of 28-nanometer sales contributions. The strength of our Virtex-7 high end family and Zynq all programmable SoC was a particular highlight, driving 28-nanometer sales growth in wired comms, industrial and automotive applications. For fiscal year 2015, 28-nanometer revenue reached $580 million driven by broad-based growth from all end-markets and each of the four 28-nanometer product families. 28-nanometer product generation continues to be the most successful node in history and we believe will have longest life of any node. As we discussed our Investor Day last month, we are targeting [Technical Difficulty] of sales to grow approximately 30% in fiscal year 2016.", "Gross margin performance was another significant highlight for both the fourth quarter and the year. Gross margin increased 69.9% in the quarter significantly better than forecasted and a record 70.2% for fiscal year 2015. Proven formula for successful execution, establish the 28-nanometer continues to yield excellent results at 20-nanometer with the UltraScale family. Leveraging our world class partnership with TSMC, the undisputed leader in the foundry industry are now delivering the industry\u2019s first and only 20-nanometer FPGAs volume production. Based on key customer feedback, we are more than one year ahead of the competition in terms of product advancement and quality. Additionally, we are shipping the industry only high performance ASIC class 20-nanometer high-end product offering with Virtex UltraScale.", "Finally, with our second generation of 3D IC technology, we are shipping the industry\u2019s largest device delivering more than 4x density of competitive devices. We are currently shipping 20-nanometer products to approximately 100 discrete customers, demonstrating the broad-based acceptance of this family. This past quarter, sales from our 20-nanometer node were $5 million and we expect these sales to double in the June quarter. 60-nanometer node, we launched the UltraScale Plus family of FPGAs, 3D ICs and Zynq MP SoCs, combining embedded memory, 3D on 3D, and multiprocessing SoC technologies. On the system level, the UltraScale Plus family provides 2x to 5x greater system level performance per watt significantly more systems integration and intelligence and the highest level of security and safety. We continue to anticipate the first tape-out of our 60-nanometer FinFET Plus process to be this quarter.", "During the March quarter, we also strengthened our family of SDX software defined development environment with the launch of the SD SoC product. This environment enables a much larger software and systems development community to program our Zynq SoCs and MP SoCs. Target high growth opportunities, areas such as datacenter acceleration, software defined networking, embedded vision and the industrial Internet of Things. Despite the near-term revenue growth challenges, I continue to be confident in our strategy to resume top line growth. Additionally, we are driving increased efficiencies in our operating model to improve productivity and appropriately align spending levels for the fiscal year \u201816 sales outlook we have previously provided.", "Let me now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "John Pitzer", "Yes, good afternoon guys. Moshe, you might have just answered my first question in your prepared comments. But I just want to confirm that as you look at your full year fiscal \u201816 revenue guidance that you gave at the Analyst Day, I think a flat to up 2 that you still think that\u2019s the right range to look at. And I guess given the less than expected start in the June quarter, how do we think about linearity of that growth to get to that full year number?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So, John, that continues to be our target and it obviously will start from a low point if we hit our range, but we expect to see it grow during the year and we are confident that as the communications business starts to recover that will be one of the numerous fibers of the growth together with all of the technology elements that I referred to before.", "John Pitzer", "That\u2019s helpful, Moshe. And then specifically your comments around China, to what extent do you think this is a pause in vacation build-out in China versus perhaps too much inventory with some of the equipment guys that we need to bring there. I am just trying to get a sense of how much of this do you think is a real pause in demand versus perhaps a realignment of kind of inventory within the supply chain?", "Jon Olson", "Yes, John, this is Jon. Let me kind of take that one. So, it\u2019s always a little of both, right, but meaning in general, the Chinese manufacturers try to get ahead of the awards as much as they can. But when there is a following demand situation like we have now or delay I would say, particularly from the FD ramp perspective, it is really more about that pause. And one, the ramp starts to build a little more precipitously. We did think all along that our communications business, wireless specifically would build throughout the year. So, that part while it maybe starting off a little weaker than we anticipated, it isn\u2019t really radically scaring as much at this point in time. They are just \u2013 China is just going through some overall CapEx modifications and the FD stuff is going to happen. It\u2019s just going to happen, start a little bit slower, but we do think we have accommodated that in our full year forecast.", "John Pitzer", "Thanks guys. I appreciate it.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Next question. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Vivek Arya", "Thank you for taking my question. Maybe to just continue that discussion, I understand the China impact on wireless. I am just curious why the wired business is not growing? When Broadcom reported yesterday, they thought the datacenter demand or the wired business demand, they see picking up. So, I am curious is this just lumpiness, is it just the timing of different projects? What will drive wired demand for you?", "Jon Olson", "Yes. So, we were very pleased with our 28-nanometer growth in the quarter. So, new products are growing, including datacenter this quarter. So, we had good contribution from the new product category. It\u2019s really some of the older stuff that wasn\u2019t quite as strong as we had anticipated in some of the sub-applications. So, I would say we saw some \u2013 and I don\u2019t really know the details of all the sub-segments that Broadcom ran, but we did see strength in these new products. So, as those build throughout the year, meaning the new programs and some of the customer differences, I think we will see good growth in the wired market from new products continue throughout the year.", "Vivek Arya", "Got it. Very helpful, Jon. And then as my follow-up, I am curious what your views are on this potential combination of Intel and Altera. Is that \u2013 if not were to happen, is that a net positive neutral or does it present any kind of risk for you and if that combination does happen would you also need to take any steps towards consolidation? Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. Well, in the 15 minutes of saying for the programmable world, I am sort of surprised that this was the third question and not the first, but thanks for asking it. And from our perspective, regardless of whether that happens or it doesn\u2019t happen whether it\u2019s rumor, whether it\u2019s true or not, we are very confident. And the reason that we are very confident is that we continue to distance ourselves from the competition and we believe we are poised to now deliver a three-peat. We have won a 28-nanometer, we believe we have huge leadership at 20-nanometer and we are very confident in our position at 16-nanometer. We have leadership with our ASIC class tools and also the new tools the software defined environments are huge enablers for business expansion. If this rumor does come to pass and this acquisition will happen we believe that will be a net positive for us, because it will give us the additional significant advantage of being the only vendor with this very service-oriented business, with the total focus, the best foundry, strategic relationship with leadership on the roadmap and generally continuity of operations. So, whether it happens or not, we don\u2019t know, but our position is very strong and we are very confident in where we are and we believe that this gap between us and the competition will just grow going forward.", "Vivek Arya", "Thank you, Moshe.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Gabriela Borges", "Great. Thanks for taking my question. This is Gabriela Borges on behalf of Jim. I know you discussed a little bit on the China dynamic in the communications market, maybe you could also comment on what you are seeing in North America I know you mentioned the softness in the March quarter but maybe there is a little bit of stabilization in June, is there any color on North America and maybe Europe and some of the other geographies as well? Thank you.", "Jon Olson", "Sure, Gabriela. The North America continues to be weak for us. I think we have had a couple of quarters of relatively weak transitions or weak revenue there. One of the bigger expansions that have gone on over the last year or so has been the Sprint deployment and they have slowed down substantially. There seems to be some CapEx spend financing things going on here and there, and that\u2019s been slower for us on a relative basis to how strong we are to the ultimate OEMs who won those contracts. We don\u2019t \u2013 best as what we can tell we don\u2019t think this is some sort of a permanent thing. Some of those things we are getting worked out as we talk to our customers in that particular area. I mean largely, the AT&T and Verizon businesses is add-ons and capacity extensions. Nothing significant going on there quite frankly in terms of the CapEx spend, it\u2019s really around Sprint and T-Mobile and we are well-positioned there. But it is definitely, decelerated over the last couple of quarters but we do not expect that to continue for the full year. Europe, while there has been some sales into Europe, it\u2019s still early and we don\u2019t have, I would say a clear view. We are counting on a big percentage of that business to come in until maybe very late in the fiscal year.", "Gabriela Borges", "That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And as a follow-up if I may, could you help us think through the implications of the Alcatel-Lucent and Nokia merger and maybe any context you can provide based on what happened in 2006 which I think is the last time we saw customer consolidation? Thanks very much.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So wireless generally is the market where, as you pointed out has been consolidated for some period of time. And we fundamentally believe that the \u2013 or at least I believe that the catalyst for all of this is the emergence of the very strong players in China and that is forcing the other non-Chinese players to bulk up and strengthen up. And from our perspective, both of these companies are significant customers of ours and as they merge if they come out strengthened that should improve our business. And we think that this will provide them with a better market position to compete against the other players who have been pulling ahead recently.", "So, given our market position with these two players and the potential for growth with both of them, I think as they merge it will provide a growth path for us going forward assuming the combined player will emerge stronger as indeed they should. There does tend to be a little bit of confusion when it starts because these are two very large, very diverse companies with geographic footprints in different spaces. And I do believe that at least as they are doing the merger, there will be a little bit of hiatus, but then it will \u2013 as the merger is completed they will probably have renewed growth going forward.", "Gabriela Borges", "Appreciate all the color. Thanks very much.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Ross Seymore", "Hi guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I guess first, Moshe one on your side and still on that kind of comm infrastructure side of things. From as close as I can check, whether it was the end of market or Xilinx specifically we have had there quarters in a row of tough results, can you talk a little bit about what gives you the confidence that we are going to see a snapback in the back half of the year, especially on the wireline side where I believe on the last conference call you talked about being relatively puzzled as to why design wins weren\u2019t turning into revenue for Xilinx?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So the reason we are confident that this needs to reverse is at some point there is a mismatch between the infrastructure requirements to the drivers which is basically a lot of this is driven by consumer and business demand. And we think that on the wired side that time is approaching and that our very strong product portfolio will enable us to capture that as it happens. There is an incessant need for an investment in the infrastructure. And I think it has been shortchanged for too long. So you are right in pointing out that we have been disappointed and that this has taken longer. And actually, we have predicted this before, but at this point what we are seeing is a lot of the designs that we reaped at the high end of the 28-nanometer are now moving to production and those got delayed roughly by a year vis-\u00e0-vis our initial expectations. So between the market demands and the design wins we have at 28-nanometer, where we do have visibility in them now moving and hence we made the comment on the growth of our Virtex-7 product offering. Those products are now starting to move into production. And we expect that to be a portion of this snapback. And then of course on the wireless side, there are elements which we expect as Jon elaborated on we expect China to have that need and it\u2019s only a question of when and that needs to start happening soon on the wireless infrastructure too.", "Ross Seymore", "Great. Thanks for all that detail. I guess as my quick follow-up, one for you Jon, on the OpEx side, great job controlling those expenses in the quarter and the guide. From your description of what\u2019s going on in lowering the full year by about 3%, it sounds like there is an aspect of tightening the belt overall and then also some timing issues on OpEx. Are you expecting us to exit this year at the same sort of OpEx level that we would have before and therefore fiscal \u201817 would kind of be the same as we would have thought before or is this truly a cut in OpEx levels longer term? Thank you.", "Jon Olson", "Yes. So I think the whole origin of the restructuring in the first place was around driving efficiency and getting more focused in areas particularly in the sales area to accelerate our wins of customers. And that was really the genesis for doing it. And we sat there in the March timeframe and Investor Day obviously we knew we were doing restructuring, but we never commented in advance on that for a variety of reasons. And in the guide that we gave in March there were certainly some things that weren\u2019t decided yet through our restructuring efforts even at early in March. And as we got through to really dissecting the sales organization and changing the focus away from reps to direct selling, this is where we have garnered the biggest part of the dollar drop and the change in our guide since March. So it\u2019s really reflective of us figuring out how to put the right resources in the right places. And sometimes that means you actually spend less when you have the right resources and that\u2019s the primary driver of what the reduction \u2013 the net reduction that we have going on.", "Now on your question around the exit rate, as I said in my remarks, the first quarter is particularly low and that\u2019s because we haven\u2019t ramp headcount back up. I do think that the second quarter, we have a lot of more tape-outs going on and that goes \u2013 bounces around throughout the rest of the year. And our exit rate in \u2013 out of Q4 will suggest some tick up and would suggest that some tick up in FY \u201917. But \u2013 by the way, we are not there yet. So I am not signaling that we are going to have a tick up in FY \u201817. So it will look like the \u2013 that Q1 is low and then Q2, Q3, Q4 will be more flattish throughout the year. But we certainly aren\u2019t making a statement yet about FY \u201817 spending.", "Ross Seymore", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your line is open.", "Ambrish Srivastava", "Hi. Thank you, Moshe. And I am sorry because actually we disappointed you with that question not being number one. I did have a follow-up on that and which is when you heard and if it\u2019s true that whatever price was offered and what was asked, did you fall off your chair or you said okay, Intel gets it. The Street doesn\u2019t get it that there is this huge opportunity for PLDs in the datacenter and I think Altera has quantified it as $1 billion in 2020. So, any thoughts around that would be very helpful? Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, it\u2019s a rumor and the prices are a rumor and whether it\u2019s happening or not happening is a rumor too. We are delighted with the attention this gets and we think that obviously there is potential for growth. With regards to prices and all of that, it shows the perceived value of programmable logic, which I am a big believer in. So, I am delighted with that general trend. Hopefully, the entire world will see the light, but\u2026", "Ambrish Srivastava", "Okay, Moshe. Thank you. Good luck.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra from Baird. Your line is open.", "Tristan Gerra", "Hi, good afternoon. Could you quantify the headwind from end-of-life products embedded in the June quarter guidance and is that headwind done by the end of the quarter?", "Jon Olson", "Yes. So, as we said in Investor Day, there would be some residual shipments into some of these major programs at the very beginning of the fiscal year \u201816, but at a much diminished rate. So, by the time we get to through the first half of our fiscal year which is end of the September, I would say a great deal that will be away and the biggest piece of it will be in June. So, I would say by the end of June it\u2019s largely gone, with some residual going on in the following quarters.", "Tristan Gerra", "Okay, thank you.", "Jon Olson", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Will Stein from SunTrust. Your line is open.", "Will Stein", "Thanks for taking my question. First, just a housekeeping one, you have reset guidance on OpEx, I just want to confirm you are keeping the gross margin guidance that you have offered previously for the full year?", "Jon Olson", "Yes, we are.", "Will Stein", "Great. And then the more substantial question I had is in the press release you talked about and I think at the Analyst Day, you talked about this as well these new software development tools that are targeted at datacenter and SDN and industrial IoT. I am wondering if you can help us understand whether that\u2019s expected to accelerate your growth through perhaps share gains versus Altera or is it versus some of the other maybe the other SoC vendors or is it to grow the market? Any color on the expected effect from these tools will be helpful?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So, the expected \u2013 let me pose the challenge that we have. And if you look at our products, they, in numerous applications, enable our customers to achieve very attractive parameters in terms of performance per watt or price performance per watt. In other words, they can achieve a \u2013 they can implement differentiated highly competitive system. In order to do that, they need to go through a design cycle, which requires a certain set of skills. And in order to increase the population or universe of the users of our products, what we have done is we have developed these tools. These tools tend to be somewhat application-specific or it\u2019s not one size fits all. They tend to have different targets, but once you use these tools, you can enable usage by a broader set of customers and in particular, engineers with more of the software background and there are lot more software engineers then there are hardware engineers. And the reason we are doing it is in order to expand the SAM and the intention here is to provide a alternative \u2013 an attractive alternative to ASSP standard product. So, that\u2019s what this is. This is SAM expansion and this enables us to target markets, which today are serviced by ASSPs, because the engineers at some of these companies and datacenter is a very good example typically do not have hardware design skills and we are developing these tools to facilitate that expansion.", "Will Stein", "Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Sure, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from CLSA. Your line is open.", "Ryan Goodman", "Hey, thank you. It\u2019s Ryan Goodman in for Srini. So, I had another question on China LTEs. We have the FDD licensing now behind us, but it seems like the near-term trends are still softening a bit. So, I am just trying to understand how much of visibility you have here. We all know it\u2019s going to happen at some point, but are you starting to see some of these FDD orders coming in for the back half of the year or if not just what are your expectations there? And then also are you seeing any impact from potential tower sharing going on in China at this point?", "Jon Olson", "Sure. Ryan, the China \u2013 FD on the China LTE as we have already seen builds going on by the OEMs and we get more of our information through the OEMs than anywhere else. And so there already have been some builds and some shipments on the FD. So, this is more of a timing issue as best as we can tell and what our customers are telling us versus they are changing their longer term forecast for us, they don\u2019t. There is certainly no orders booked for the second half of the year at this point in time, because our lead times are generally pretty short. So, there is not a whole lot of impetus on the part of the OEMs to commit through a PO early even though they do provide us some guidance on forecast. And we don\u2019t see an overall lower number than we had anticipated maybe even in early March. So, really it\u2019s more of a temporary slowness the best as we can tell as anything else. On the tower sharing, no, we really haven\u2019t seen any impact whatsoever of the tower sharing. It doesn\u2019t even come up in our conversations. The issue there is really more about new towers, not old towers, so that\u2019s really not a factor.", "Ryan Goodman", "Okay, great. And then just different question on the cash side, so cash return was great this year, you forgot the history of it, it\u2019s been pretty consistent. Just any thoughts on where \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you have a formal target on it for the coming year or just maybe an idea of how you are thinking about it for the year versus operating cash flow?", "Jon Olson", "Yes. We don\u2019t have a formal target, but if we look at our \u2013 look at the history over the last 10 years, we have returned 100% of our operating cash. We did 120% last year. We have increased our dividend for the 10th year in a row. We will continue a share repurchase program on an opportunistic level. And we have stated as long as we don\u2019t have an acquisition target or something that is using any of the excess cash. At a bigger level, we will return cash to shareholders. So, I think you can count on us continuing to do that, but again, I am not going to make a commitment on a percentage.", "Ryan Goodman", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ian Ing from MKM Partners. Your line is open.", "Ian Ing", "Yes, thank you. First question, could you talk about any sort of price increases you think your international distributor customers are seeing, whether it\u2019s based on currency or pricing more to reflect value and would there be any impact on demand or is demand pretty inelastic?", "Jon Olson", "Yes, we are not really seeing anything that\u2019s significant in the price increase area. I was concerned on the second part of your question about the demand impact, particularly at smaller customers and we have seen we had strong channel sales in this last quarter and we are forecasting strong channel sales again, including European, which I assume is the biggest source of your question, including on the European side. So, it\u2019s really not at this point has been a big of a deal as I was fearful of, but because while we had maybe a soft quarter a quarter or two ago, things have come back pretty nicely.", "Ian Ing", "Great. And then do you have any thoughts on the trends on the size of the FPGA design community, is it still growing and is it largely driven by Zynq? Do you have any sort of metrics to support that whether its design kits shipped or design kits installed?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, the Zynq product offering was a breakthrough offering. It was the generally the last part of the rollout. And as such, there was a large number of design wins. Now, those design wins, which were targeted at somewhat slower moving markets like industrial and automotive, those design wins are moving to production. So, it\u2019s a unique product. The number of design wins is phenomenal. We are learning because of its nature that in some cases it takes longer. It\u2019s also a more sophisticated product, hence it takes a little longer. To do the design it requires both software and hardware. It has a high performance embedded processor system. The number of design wins is just huge and the overall magnitude of the design win value on Zynq is very encouraging. It\u2019s very significant. And now, it is finally starting to grow a very healthy clip. So until last year, it was relatively negligible in terms of the portion of revenue, but now it's growing at a fast rate and as these applications in automotive, wireless and aero and industrial control are starting to hit production.", "Jon Olson", "I think you also \u2013 just you asked specific about design kits and our design board environment. I mean in terms of numbers of kits and boards, I mean it\u2019s just totally swamped in terms of numbers, all previous FPGA boards, because of the nature of the cost point or price point that many of these applications are going after, more of the $700 million versus the $800 or $900 kind of an ASP. And so both our distributor and Xilinx have a number of inexpensive boards and kits. And those numbers \u2013 the numbers of those that have been shipped out over the last couple of years is just really phenomenal. So we really think we are seeding the industry really well with these capabilities.", "Ian Ing", "Okay. Thanks Jon. Thanks Moshe.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland from FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey guys. It\u2019s Joe on for Chris. Thanks for letting me ask you question. So this past quarter, we had noticed a small bump in lead times for both you and your competitor, first, is that true. And then, in terms of responding to increasing customer demand, how long are the cycle times coming out of TSMC?", "Jon Olson", "Yes, so Joe, we really haven\u2019t had any, I would say, any appreciable lead time increase on a broad perspective. There is a class of products that we have had a little bit of \u2013 we have had some lead time increase, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s going to be that material of an impact to anything on our logistics. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s been a particularly and if there is anything there that to concern anybody from a logistic supply perspective. What was the second part of your question again?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Fab cycle time?", "Jon Olson", "Fab cycle time, no we see no push out or lengthening of any fab cycle time. We are getting all the wafers we order and when we order them there is no \u2013 nothing going on there either for us.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, great. And then we had also heard about possible consolidation in your distributor network, could you elaborate there if that\u2019s true?", "Jon Olson", "No, not really, it was our rep network where we are \u2013 as we terminated a variety of reps. In Japan, we are transitioning. We have a number of reps in Japan and the nature of that business is a little different than the rest of the world. And we are transitioning one of the reps to \u2013 into our other rep network. That\u2019s the only really transition that we have \u2013 excuse me, distributor in China, excuse me distributor in China, one distributor moving into our other distributors in terms of the business, but nothing other than those two things. So reps in the U.S. and Europe generally we are transitioning to direct sales. And then in Japan, there is a distributor that we are terminating and moving that business to other distributors that we already have.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna from JMP Securities. Your line is open.", "Alex Gauna", "Good afternoon everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Moshe, I know you have already touched on this twice, but coming back to the implications of a potential Intel-Altera merger and Altera\u2019s optimism around data center acceleration through the massively parallel architectures of programmable logic. I am just wondering are you in fact involved, I know you aren\u2019t heavily exposed to the data center, but are you involved in using the FPGA architecture to accelerate workload, is this tens of million, hundreds of millions of opportunity for you. And then if you think about what\u2019s obviously happening with co-packaged FPGA and CPUs, how far in the future does it make sense in the workload acceleration sense to think about convergence wherein the processing and the FPGA are a single die? Thanks.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. There is a lot of questions there. So we think there is an opportunity there, that's why we have the SDX product which now we are releasing completely [ph] to our customers. And we strongly believe that, that together with a stronger focus on this market should enable us to reap the benefits of it. We think it\u2019s a significant market. There is \u2013 whether it\u2019s tens of millions or several hundreds of millions of dollars, we think it\u2019s going to take time to grow to those larger numbers and it takes quite a long time. And we are committed to having the best solution with regards to acceleration which addresses those markets. And whether its X86-based or ARM-based or whatever approach then we are going to pursue solutions for that market. So now I think we are well positioned and the key to our leadership is now in the software which enables achieving or getting at that acceleration in the most efficient way. And that\u2019s how we view it. It\u2019s a big market, but maybe not quite as huge in the short-term as maybe others have positioned it.", "Alex Gauna", "Okay. And then just to clarify on that, obviously you said it will take some time but from a convergence sense, is this one of those situations where the nature of the architectures and the workloads mean that for the foreseeable future we can think of it as a co-loaded \u2013 co-located FPGA and processing solution or are there clear benefits to convergence where we think about single die FPGA and CPU being really important in terms of accelerating that market?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, single die helps, but comes with the cost and the cost that you get typically is flexibility. The nature of these applications is they are very, very fragmented. And every one of them tends to have the different payload and actually, that payload is dynamic. So if you are using it to accelerate some sort of algorithm, the algorithm that you are accelerating changes all the time. And so if you do too much integration and you tend to have a very inflexible solution, you might end up losing, right. So when we talk to the customers and these tend to be a different class of companies, their \u2013 and their approach is they want to retain as much controls over their acceleration path and they would rather not give that to anyone else. And if you look at the way their approach has been, typically they do not buy from the traditional server companies. They actually build their own and they try to come up with a very specific solution, which is the most valuable for them. So there is a case to be made for integration, but what you lose when you do the integration is a lot of the flexibility, which is inherently important for this market. And so I would say it\u2019s great. In some cases it might go towards integration and others actually having a separate solution and being able to maintain the flexibility there is a huge benefit.", "Alex Gauna", "Alright, that\u2019s great. Thanks so much. One more quick point of clarification, you mentioned seeing and it\u2019s intuitive maybe a little bit of pauses as Nokia and Alcatel try to combine operations, is that factored into your upcoming quarterly guidance or would that pause be further out and would it be a few percent or would it be a fraction of a percent? What kind of exposure would we talk about to a potential slowing there or pause?", "Jon Olson", "We have not seen a pause as a result of whatever has been in the newspaper and their stated position on this. Moshe was only I think talking in general about when two companies get together what can happen in terms of how their organizations melt altogether. At this point in time, as best as we can tell, this is not going to be consummated at the earliest later this calendar year maybe in next calendar year. We are not seeing any sort of pause with our business with either company at this point in time.", "Alex Gauna", "Okay, thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you. Next question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Suji De Silva from Topeka Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Suji De Silva", "Hi, guys. So, I think I heard you guys saying you were trying to beef up the direct sales effort versus the key reps. I am curious which end markets do you feel like that\u2019s most important for, if any? And if it is the datacenter and try and target the cloud guys, is that somewhere you feel like you have to catch up versus competition or is that purchased \u2013 I mean, is that the wrong weight on this?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "We have now restructured our sales force to be tiered with two direct elements and the third element, which goes through this deep. We are managing that a little more closely than we have before. With the largest accounts primarily in communications and datacenter, we believe that we would benefit from a more direct interaction, because fundamentally, several of engagement needs to be deeper than it was before. And are we doing this later than ideally we should have? We probably are. In retrospect, this would probably have benefited from making this transition a year or two ago.", "Jon Olson", "Yes, I think also I mean it\u2019s just not \u2013 this is only focused at one end market. There is going to be some transitions going on even in our aerospace and defense market coverage to more direct sales. And I know some of these kinds of wins don\u2019t turn into immediate revenue. They are slower, but it does have both industrial, aerospace and defense, test and measurement as well as the communication segments impacted. And we \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a net positive for us.", "Suji De Silva", "Okay, great. That explanation helps. And then also I know the China LTE carrier pause question has been asked a lot. But I just want to ask one out of the way, anecdotally, what are your customers and your customers telling you about why this group of buyers is pausing at this juncture. Is it macro, is it concerns about LTE sub-brand or is it technical reasons in terms of cloud ran architecture feature? What do you think anecdotally?", "Jon Olson", "As best as we can tell, this is more about a CapEx China macro. I mean, I don\u2019t want to say macro, but China macro-related CapEx spend in the pace that they are getting funded internally to do things. And I don\u2019t know what else. Some of it there is always the politics between the FD standard and the TD standard and it\u2019s hard to tell whether that\u2019s still causing delays in FD as a result of TD being \u2013 trying to be in China Mobile trying to be more dominant, but I don\u2019t know that I am qualified to comment on whether how much of that is true or not.", "Suji De Silva", "Okay, great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Earl Hege from Nomura. Your line is open.", "Earl Hege", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I am calling for Romit Shah. I guess, when we look at your gross margin, you guys are maintaining the guidance there. How do we look at the volatility of that moving through the year as China LTE improves as you expect?", "Jon Olson", "Well, definitely in China \u2013 the wireless business, because of the volume and concentration of customers tends to have a drag on our gross margin. So, we would expect and we have modeled this that the second half would be lower than the first half as a result of that. I am not going to get into the real specifics, but the second half will be lower than the first half, but we are still confident in delivering our stated goal from Investor Day.", "Earl Hege", "Alright, great. And just a quick follow-up, just regarding your guys\u2019 own appetite for acquisitions, where do you stand in terms of looking at opportunities to strengthen and/or diversify your business currently?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So, this is a topic which is very sensitive. We have the capacity. You can tell by our track record that we do this very, very cautiously. The nature of our business is such that it has a unique element to it. So doing acquisitions for acquisitions sake is not trivial for us. And so the answer is we can do it. We know how to do it. At this point, if you look at where we are and what we have done, it\u2019s primarily been technology acquisitions as opposed to acquiring other companies that have a totally different business model and modus operandi.", "Rick Muscha", "Okay. Thanks, for joining us today. We have a playback of this call beginning at 5:00 PM Pacific Time, 8:00 PM Eastern Time today. For a copy or our earnings release, please visit our IR website. With regards to conference participation this quarter, we will be attending the Baird Growth Stock Conference in Chicago on May 6 and the JPMorgan TMT Conference in Boston on May 19.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "Please limit your questions to one to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone. I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.", "Rick Muscha", "Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, our CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the June quarter and then we will open the call for questions.", "This quarter we changed our revenue by product category classification. We make changes to this classification on a regular basis as products mature and new products are introduced, and there have been the product categories to be more meaningful to investors.", "In addition, we consolidated the other end-market category into the Communications & Data Center end-market. For comparative purposes, we have provided supplemental schedule on our website at www.investor.xilinx.com that presents results based on the previous category classification.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially.", "We refer you to the documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.", "Let me now turn the call over to Jon.", "Jon Olson", "Thank you, Rick. Xilinx sales were $549 million, down 3% sequentially and within our guidance. Profitability remained strong during the quarter with a better than expected gross margin continued OpEx control and a healthy cash flow generation.", "New product sales decreased 10% in the quarter, almost entirely driven by 28-nanometer products which were impacted by weak sales to Wireless customer. Sales from 20-nanometer product exceeded $10 million during the quarter doubling from the prior quarter.", "From an end-market perspective sales from Communications & Data Center remained weak, decreasing 11% sequentially. The greater than forecasted decline was driven by Wireless Communications, which was weaker than anticipated due to continued decline from a broad-based of customers predominately serving the China and U.S. markets.", "Wired sales were as expected for the quarter. While shipments into the Cable Access business were particularly strong, overall CapEx spending remains weak. Wired Communications was the largest end-market contributor to 28-nanometer revenues in fiscal Q1.", "The Industrial and Aerospace & Defense segment was better than forecasted driven by ISM and A&D. ISM sales were a record during the quarter. Sales from test declined as expected.", "Lastly, Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive was essentially flat as expected. Although, flat sequentially, sales from Automotive are up nearly 50% from the same quarter a year ago and remained at a record 7% of total sales.", "Gross margin was 70.9% for the quarter better than anticipated, primarily as a result of product and customer mix, although we continued to be focused on driving improvements and profitability.", "Operating expenses including $2 million in amortization were $211 million in line with expectations. Other income was the net expense of $11 million, slightly better than forecasted due to long-term investment gains. Net income for the quarter was $148 million or $0.55 per diluted share. Operating cash flow for the June quarter was $183 million before $8 million in CapEx.", "Diluted shares for the quarter were 271 million, there was a 9 million share dilutive effect from a convertible notes. For questions relating to the dilution associated with our convertible debt, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com.", "We repurchased 2.2 million shares for $100 million during the quarter and made a record $80 million payment in quarterly dividends. We returned nearly 100% of operating cash flow to shareholders during the quarter.", "Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments were flat at $3.6 billion. We have $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed rate debt resulting in a net cash position of approximately $2 billion. Inventory dollars at Xilinx decreased $9 million sequentially.", "Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the September quarter of fiscal year \u201916. Our backlog heading into the quarter is down sequentially. Communications is forecasted to be flat. The Wireless market continues to be challenging and is negatively impacting our previously stated full-year revenue estimates. While we do expect improvement in the second half of fiscal \u201816 from increased spending in China, North America and India, the rate of improvement remains difficult to forecast.", "Wired Communications continues to be impacted by a weak CapEx environment, although, we expect to continue to benefit throughout the year from revenue growth in new programs where we have displaced ASSP\u2019s in addition to gaining share in traditional FPGA sockets. The strengthened of these programs are in the areas of Cable Infrastructure, Access and OTN.", "We expect the Industrial and Aerospace & Defense segment to be down substantially due to a decrease in A&D driven by the expected conclusion of a large program. Xilinx\u2019s 28-nanometer parts were recently design into subsystem to the next-generation program that is expected to begin production in fiscal year \u201817. Although the Aerospace & Defense market has been characterized by quarterly volatility, this segment remains an important business for Xilinx.", "Our 28 nanometer revenues are growing at a rate much faster than previous new product introduction as we expand our presence in areas such as situational awareness, public safety and embedded vision systems. ISM is expected to be approximately flat during the quarter and Test is expected to decline.", "Lastly, we expect all components of the Broadcast, Consumer and Automotive category to be approximately flat. We expect strong growth in Automotive in fiscal \u201816 as Zynq enters volume production at many large OEMs. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be down 2% to 6% to down 2% to down 6% sequentially. The midpoint of this guidance is predicated on turns rate of approximately 51%.", "Gross margin is expected to be approximately 69% to 70%. Operating expenses for the September quarter are expected to be approximately $217 million, including $2 million of amortization of acquisition related intangibles. As I mentioned last quarter, Q1 OpEx would be at the low point for the year. The increase in Q2 OpEx will be driven primarily by hiring in the sales force, an increase tape-out expense related primarily to the 16 nanometer technology generation.", "Other income and expense for the September quarter will be a net expense of $10 million. The share count is expected to be roughly 268 million shares. The tax rate for September quarter is expected to be approximately 12%. The reset of our tax rate guidance to 12% is due to a change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings.", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. Though the June quarter was challenging from topline perspective, we continue to be pleased with our focus on delivering sustained type of stability. Gross margin was 70.9% better than expectations, driving an operating margin of 32.5%.", "28 nanometer revenue decline as we anticipated, driven by weakness in wireless communication. However sales from our Zynq product family, the industry\u2019s first All Programmable SoC increased more than 40%. The primary driver for this growth came from ADAS applications. Important industry growth driver ideally suited to benefit from the Zynq product family\u2019s innovative and differentiated capabilities.", "We expect 20 nanometer sales to return to growth in September quarter driven by continued sales increase from the Zynq product as well as an increase in wired communication. Additionally, we\u2019re forecasting 28 nanometer revenue to grow for the balance of fiscal year 2016, driven by demand stabilization and communications, continued strong adoption in Automotive, ISM, Test and Aerospace and Defense.", "We\u2019re also executing very well with our 20 nanometer Ultrascale portfolio. Technology leadership at this node is very rapidly translating to sales leadership. We have now shipped 20 nanometer parts to more than 140 discrete customers in all of our major end markets.", "20 nanometer revenue in June quarter doubled sequentially more than $10 million with significant growth coming from Virtex Ultrascale, the industry's only ASIC class 20 nanomenter high-end product offering. The September quarter, we\u2019re forecasting 20 nanometer sales to exceed $15 million for experiencing a sales ramp that is more accelerated than our initial expectations.", "We estimate our share at this node in approaching 80%, confident of share of 20 nanometer will continue to exceed 65% market share we have delivered at 28 nanometer. The 16 nanometer node, we taped out the industry's first All Programmable Multiprocessor SoC using TSMC\u2019s 16FF class process. This product family targets applications in embedded vision including ADAS, Industrial Internet-of-things beside two wireless systems.", "During the June quarter, we also extended our world class partnership with TSMC, the undisputed leader in the foundry industry with the announcement that we will be leveraging TSMC\u2019s 7 nanometer processed technology, 3D IC technology for our next generation of All Programmable FPGAs, 3D ICs and MPSoCs.", "Technology represents the fourth consecutive generation where the two companies have partnered advanced process and cohort backing technology and will become TSMC's fourth generation of FinFET technology. We anticipate the first tape-out at 7 nanometer at full year 2017.", "Finally, with regard to design software, earlier this week, we announced the public access release of our SDSoC development environment to expand the user base of Zynq SoCs and MPSoCs to a broad community of systems and software engineers, both existing in new market.", "Despite weak global communications spending environment, I remain very confident in Xilinx\u2019s strong technology leadership and market expansion initiatives driven by existing and new SDx software designed development environment. We will continue to focus on maintaining high levels of profitability in any business environment with the overall goal of maximizing shareholder.", "Let me now turn the call back to the operator for questions and answers.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Seymore", "Hi guys. Moshe, a bigger picture question for you, similar to what we\u2019ve been asking linear attack. What is your view on what's going on with overall demand being weaker than expected whether by geography and market or whatever you believe the cause to be. And do you think that is more of a short-term pause or something that's a little more longer in duration?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "We see the weakness primarily in wireless and it\u2019s being choppy and less predictable than we had thought it would be for some time now. And as a result, we\u2019re very hesitant to call when the visibility will improve there. We do think it\u2019s a question of when, not a question of if but it has shrunk by significant amount. And if you compare where we were a year ago to where we are now, I think it\u2019s several tens of percent lower. So that\u2019s the major market of vertical where we think issues. On the other areas, I wouldn\u2019t say that they are buoyant and vibrant and doing great but they are sort of holding out for us. So that\u2019s the Xilinx\u2019s perspective. Jon, to you, concur.", "Jon Olson", "Yeah. I do concur. I would also add to that, that our share position is particularly in the wireless segment. It is still very strong. I think that helps bolster our confidence that when these things do come back, we are going to be a strong participant of that. And as I said, it\u2019s very hard to get exactly what the trajectory of the second half improvement is. And we see signs and positive statement from both customers and carriers but we\u2019re going quarter-by-quarter right now in this particular end market.", "Ross Seymore", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from William Stein with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. William Stein, your line is open.", "William Stein", "Sorry. I was muted. Thanks for taking my question. The negative outlook in the industrial end market where you are citing ending of a program in Aerospace and Defense, was there sort of last-time buy that was associated with that, that was going on recently and then I have a follow-up please?", "Jon Olson", "Well, this is part of the announced program where the joint strike -- specific with the Joint Strike Fighter where there is a very large set of purchases going on over a period of a year and a half to two years and this is just the -- essentially the end of that particular procurement and they are redesigning some of the key elements into electronics inside the aircraft and as I said, we are winning all the redesigns.", "It is just that there is this gap between when the older designs, materials being acquired versus the new periods. So, we are the end of that particular program and we won\u2019t see any significant revenue shift into that program for the remainder of this year. So, I wouldn\u2019t associate it wholly with any sort of a last-time buy situation.", "William Stein", "Thanks. And then the follow-up is a much broader question. Competitively when you talk to customers, I\u2019d love to hear about sort of positioning the company does relative to your competitor is soon likely to be owned by Intel, whether that changes the dynamic and how so, both on the relationship side and then the anticipated manufacturing change that might happen at that supplier?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. Well, let me take it. So, fundamentally, if you look at the markets we service there highly diversified markets that look for eights months technology and a significant level of support with a very long lifecycle. And this is a market we have serviced really well. We continue to service it well. We have delivered market share expansion of 28-nanometer.", "We\u2019ve seen that expand to better position the 20. We believe we are ahead of the game now being the first to tape-out at the node beyond that 16 and we are already working with TSMC on the 7-nanometer and we expect to tape out in the 2017 timeframe. So on the silicon side, the customers are very sure that they will continue to have the same level of excellence in terms of technology leadership and a timeliness and that\u2019s an opportunity for us. Now when you supplement that with the leadership we have on the software and expansion with the new product, the SDAccel and the SDSoC, which we have now are broadly, are making available to customers and not only is it the best silicon but it\u2019s the best software in the industry and the best support infrastructure in the industry.", "So, we actually believe that this is an opportunity for us and I would say the customers are reassured by that. And we know that we are the biggest and have been for the longest period of time, the leader and the bellwether player in this market. So, we remain committed to it and together with our unique relationship with TSMC and Avnet, we will continue to get the best products around the further requirement. So, the market will rollover, we don\u2019t know what will happen on the other side. I think generally speaking, this bodes well for us and that\u2019s why our interest -- continued interest heavily to make sure we can exploit this opportunity.", "William Stein", "Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Sure. Thank you", "Operator", "The next question is from Chris Danely with Citi.", "Chris Danely", "Hey, guys. Now that the Altera doubling is officially official, I guess I can stop asking my hypothetical questions and ask some real questions. So are you seeing any reaction from your customers on that and then Intel talked about a delay in 10-nanometers. How do you think that positions Altera versus yourselves?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, I'm not sure I can handle what I said before. We're focused on delivering leadership on silicon, on software in terms of support and we are working with TSMC and with ARM on the next-generation products. And we now have announced 7-nanometer tape out and TSMC and ARMS will be available 2017 and we expect to tape out at that point in time.", "So, we are focused on execution and all of the uncertainty with regards to the Altera acquisition by Intel. I think that's generally an opportunity for us as long as we continue to execute and deliver. And since we've done that at 28 and our results speak for themselves, the results of 20 are already demonstrating even better market share for us. We will first succeed and working on 7, I think as we continue to execute, there is upside for us from all of the uncertainty.", "Chris Danely", "Has there been any reaction from the customers?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "The customers are generally happy that they have the bellwether in the largest company in the business, continued focus on this mode of business, right. And I think it\u2019s a wait and see for them with regards to see what will happen on the other side, right. But we're around. We are open for business and we are committed and continued to be committed to delivering the leadership, both on the technology and the support side.", "Chris Danely", "Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Srini Pajjuri with CLSA.", "Ryan Goodman", "Hey. This is Ryan Goodman from Srini. I get another one for you on Intel and Altera? So now with that kind of in the works, I'm curious if you see any need to maybe go out and get access through a partnership or maybe start working in-house on a customer onboard just to stay competitive in terms of potential integration advantages that Intel may have with Altera overtime.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So that\u2019s a great question. And we were first the 28 with rank. We were first at 16 with our MPSoC product, which actually has a very attractive performance level and we believe that for most of the markets we are addressing, ARM is actually by far the best solution. I could say that the one potential exception to data is the data center market.", "But the data center market is likely to bifurcate into Intel and the rest of the world and so the rest of the world, we believe we are going to be the natural and best solution. So, there's upside for us there and we think we can do it with the ARM product roadmap and with the TSMC process and we\u2019ve already demonstrated that.", "There is a lot of cluster about the leadership that Intel would deliver to Altera. The fact is we already had -- with regards to that node. So, we believe that we are in good shape both strategically and tactically, and definitely the on roadmap will suffice knowing.", "If you\u2019re asking a very specific question, could there be markets where fully optimized x86 solution provides some advantage? The answer to that is yes, there are some markets. It tends to be a small subset of the overall market. And we think for most of the market, we will have a very adequate and competitive solution using our existing roadmap.", "Ryan Goodman", "Okay. Great. Thanks. And I just want to follow up on the financial model. You had hinted in the prepared comments that the wireless issues are kind of challenging. Your prior targets were flat, up 2% for the fiscal year. So just curious if there is anything else to add there if you\u2019re providing an actual update there. And also on the OpEx side too, I think you had a forecast out there, just maybe an update on how that\u2019s tracking? Thanks.", "Jon Olson", "Yes. So at this time, we aren\u2019t going to go quarter by quarter. The wireless as I said on the previous answer as well, it\u2019s really hard to understand what the pace of the change, the trajectory is on China and the US, specifically the Chinese base station rollout and more specifically Sprint for us, which was one of our leading growth sectors in North America. I mean, Verizon and AT&T are also involved, but Sprint was certainly one of the leading growth sectors there.", "So we are not giving a new number for the full year just because of the challenge of understanding what that really means to us. So meaning how strong will it come back, will it come back in the second half, all those things, really hard for us to say. So we aren\u2019t putting out a new number. Spending, we revised spending downward in our last call vis-\u00e0-vis what we said at Investor Day and we aren\u2019t changing that forecast this time.", "Ryan Goodman", "Okay. Thanks.", "Rick Muscha", "Okay. Thank you. Next question?", "Operator", "The next question is from Ian Ing with MKM Partners.", "Ian Ing", "Yes. Thanks for taking my question. A bit early a $10 million of revenue per quarter, but can you talk about 20 nanometers, perhaps yields, execution, volume ramps, as it compares to 28 nanometers?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "That\u2019s the great question, Ian. So if you look at 28, it was a very, very, very broad node and there is a low end, the midrange, high end, those the same product line which ended up with the large number of product. From our perspective, the 20 and 16 together which are coming out relatively close, closer than typical should more or less be equivalent to 28. So 20 is not as big as 28, but neither that we expect to be and 20 is now benefiting from the fact we have high end and midrange there.", "And that\u2019s what is generating this level of revenue, but there is no low end and then there is no Zynq equivalent on the 20-nanometer. Hence, overall, it\u2019s not as vibrant as 28 as well, but on the other hand it\u2019s doing better than we had expected. So we are quite pleased with the results so far and the pickup in terms of design wins, which are now rapidly turning into revenues were encouraging from my perspective.", "Ian Ing", "Great. And for my follow-up, I mean how much do you think Xilinx\u2019s customers are seeing price increases year-to-date, whether it\u2019s deliberate value-based pricing or the strong dollar overseas and what\u2019s the response has been? I know Avnet as early as June said there is really no impact to the strong dollar. I was just wanted to check in on that.", "Jon Olson", "Yes. I certainly have not seen much impact to the stronger dollar. Of course, it\u2019s pulled back a little bit now, but we really haven\u2019t. I thought I sensed the pause in our industrial business in Europe a few quarters back, but then it\u2019s bounced back the next quarter, I mean it\u2019s stable now. And it\u2019s got some growth going on there. So we really haven\u2019t seen anything there overall. So yes, generally, I think things are not being impacted on a worldwide basis because of the currency strength for us.", "Ian Ing", "Thank you.", "Rick Muscha", "Thanks, Ian. Next question please.", "Operator", "The next question is from Christopher Rolland with FBR Capital Markets.", "Joe Gallo", "Hey, guys. This is Joe on for Chris. Thanks for letting me ask the question. So you\u2019ve really recently been promoting Zynq for ADAS and Embedded Vision, but there is one clear winner in Embedded Vision and it appears they are using ASIC approach. So what gives you confidence there that there will be a gravitation toward FPGAs and who are your earlier design wins there?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. Well, we are very confident because we have design wins and we have models that are going into production. And I think there is already 12 and it could be that the number is slightly higher that are already 12 models that are going into production at this point in time with our solution.", "And we don\u2019t have the plurality of the market, it\u2019s a market which is emerging, but we believe that it\u2019s a great starting point for us and it\u2019s helping to drive our business. And for everyone who is looking for a differentiated solution as opposed to a cookie cutter solution, which will give you -- which won\u2019t give you an advantage, then we are the train to ride with that regard.", "We think more and more of the customers adopt our solution. I don\u2019t think we are going to have 50% market share this generation, but we are already garnering tremendous number of design wins with the MPSoC for the follow-on for that. So we are very pleased with the market share with the Zynq product offering and we expect that to expand with the MPSoC market, which is in its infancy. And I think that it\u2019s still too early to assume that there is only going to be one winner, we expect to be a significant winner in this market.", "Joe Gallo", "That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then as a follow-up. I know back to the 16-nanometer tape-out, I know there is a press release recently about taping out a program a little multi-processor 16-nanometer chip. What else are you close to taping out on 16-nanometer and how should we think about the progression of products that node will be high end first and midrange and how should we think about that?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, the 16-nanometer offering is quite broad and it has a midrange, high end and very extensive processor roadmap, so that\u2019s the MPSoC. So it covers probably 80%, or 70% to 80% of the total area that we tend to play and it doesn\u2019t cover the very low end. We will be -- we feel we had good coverage with the 28 and 45-nanometer solution at the low end and we will be bolstering that low end portfolio in the future with the new generation of technology, but that\u2019s what -- this has been taped out.", "The initial product is a relatively high end product with an embedded processor, but it\u2019s not the ultimate high end. It\u2019s sort of just on the same between the midrange and the high end of the product offering. And we are going to continue to expand going up and down. And the first version does has embedded CPU core and that will be the first one which will come out we will have, is targeted to have the embedded CPU core and that has a tremendous level of interest in the market.", "Jon Olson", "And other additional tape out as we move through the year. I mean this was just the first tape out as we\u2019ve wound down our 20-nanometer tape out focus and getting all those outer markets and 16 comes right behind it and they\u2019ll continue to have tape out throughout the rest of remainder of this year and to the following fiscal year.", "Joe Gallo", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Market.", "Kulin Patel", "Hi. It\u2019s Kulin Patel for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my question. I have question on earlier you mentioned that you plan to introduce 7-nanometer products in 2017. This implies that just to your gap between tape out for 15 and 7, are you skipping 10-nanometer and if it any reason why you are skipping 10-nanometer?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. So if you look at the sequence, there is 28 and then 20 and 16 came out in rapid session. And there was actually two flavors of 16, there was 16FF and the 16FF+. So we -- after we did the 20 we decided to skip the 16FF and go straight to the FF+. With the gap between 7 and 10 at TSMC actually is quite significant in terms of the capabilities of the two products.", "And from our perspective, our customers can only digest technology of the certain cadence. If we bring out the technology every three months, that\u2019s not going to help them. So to some extent the somewhere between every two to three years to have a major technology refresh for the business we\u2019re in is the right cadence.", "And what we decided to do is to shoot for the best technology, which will be available in that\u2019s sort of timeframe. And because of 7-nanometer fits the bill and its lower power and denser and actually higher performance, we felt it was better to do that than to split between the 10 and the 7. So that sort of the depth of the thinking and we\u2019re quite confident that this is the right decision in terms of our customer requirements.", "Kulin Patel", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Sure. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Vivek Arya with BofA.", " ", "Hi. This is [Shankar] [ph] on behalf of Vivek. So I just want to dig into the wireless weakness. So they are going to sign up a letter. They have been adding a lot of these subscribers. So the real reason for the weakness is that excess inventory or you think customers are using more ASICs, ASSP as well as FPGA like before? And what do you think will turn this around for you in the long run?", "Jon Olson", "Well, the answers are different by geography to that question. Really isn\u2019t the same. The transits of China in general has been stalled out both because the SD standard deployment, which is one of the bigger thing that was -- we were counting on for this year to actually began and be more robust as we move through the year. That was stalled out originally by China Unicom and China Telecom.", "The audits that they had relative to ethics and those kinds of things they were on. There has been an overall slowdown of capital spend in China and infrastructure, which is more of a macro thing going on relative to the China issue. So I think that\u2019s been the biggest driver there and there absolutely has been a build-up of base station inventory and our product in the Chinese suppliers that is being let off as China Mobile continues to deploy at a much lower rate than the previous year but China Unicom and China telecom not as much.", "So if you -- people have told me that if you\u2019re in China and you using one of those handsets from the China Mobile network, there is still a lot of coverage issues. So a lot things are left to be done there. So I\u2019m not so sure it\u2019s driven by the subscriber poll. I think there are some bigger issues going on there. Relative to North America, it\u2019s kind of bifurcated into Sprint who is also having some financial issues in terms of funding their network, so they slowed down the deployment of their network.", "And they\u2019ve gone through a rebating process and that process has been completed as best as we can tell. And so again, we think that because of those milestones, we think things are going to start to turnaround and grow for us in the second half of this year and into calendar 2016. AT&T and Verizon have slowed down their cap spending in the first part of the year. There was Spectrum acquisition.", "They also are trying to spend a little more money now and those are going to be additional capacitization of that network. So it really is different by different carriers and geography. The thought process about what\u2019s going to turn this around for us is just exactly the fact that subscriber and coverage is not uniformly sufficient and good in those geographies. The thought process about what\u2019s going to turn this around for us is just exactly the fact that subscriber and coverage is not uniformly sufficient and good in those geographies.", "And as Moshe said earlier, it's a matter of when. It's not a matter of if for us. And again, we\u2019ve seen positive press coming out of carriers relative to some improvement in that. We\u2019ve seen orders turn with respect to India, some growth there. So, we have some specific orders ahead of us on that. So, we are starting to see some positive signs that would lead us to believe that the second half of fiscal year will be better.", " ", "Great. So, I have one follow-up. So, on the data center side, actually the Exadata opportunity was a prime reason why Intel acquired Altera. Can you talk about how big the market is for you? Is it still an area of focus and is Intel acquiring Altera, they some how going to come over to optimize product that can even say knock you out of the market? Can you just give some color around the data center object?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. So the various element to the data center and there is elements that focus on storage, elements that focus on networking and elements that focus on compute. So the storage and networking are largely unimpacted by this acquisition. And in compute space, it\u2019s very clear that FPGAs provide a viable, very attractive lower-power solution, which significantly provide an improvement in the performance per watt by -- what we're seeing is somewhere between 20x to 30x in several applications, vis-\u00e0-vis standalone, high performance processor.", "And that\u2019s because these applications in the cloud tend to be massively parallel and these processors are inherently not parallel engines, they\u2019re very sequential. That\u2019s the way a CPU operates. And even if you have multiple CPU cores, you can only achieve a certain level as parallel as in that way. So, FPGAs actually can provide tremendous acceleration at the same platform or lower power consumption just to make sure, or they can provide at a much lower level of power consumption, they can deliver equivalent performance.", "Now we believe that when Intel consummates its acquisition, when that happens then there will be some integration opportunity. The challenge there is that you are taking a very high power solution, which is an x86 and you are adding to it another high power solution, which is a large FPGA. And to some extent you try to integrate both of those on same silicon and you are limited with regards to what you can do.", "So we believe that that market, the Intel x86 will have an element which will have an integrated solution and they will have an element which has these distributed solutions where the FPGA will be separate.", "And we see a lot of the traditional Data Center customers having a strong interest in actually retaining autonomy and independent in that second node, so they can decide how they design their system and obviously, would be a wonderful solution for that.", "So even in the Intel x86 space we believe we have a play. And not mentioned that everywhere where it\u2019s not Intel and this is a market which is emerging, right. So there is a lot of competing solutions that will come to the market over the next few years. We will be the natural show in for that -- for those solutions.", "So I would say there is upside for us definitely vis-\u00e0-vis beyond where we are today and we are committed to that market and we expect to see business growth in that market and we believe that market is it -- in its very early stages and of evolution and overtime we will have a stronger position in it than we definitely have now. So hopefully that answers your question? I apologies it was more than you wanted to hear on that topic?", " ", "No. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you. Next question?", "Operator", "The next question is from Tristan Gerra with Robert W. Baird.", "Tristan Gerra", "Hi. Good afternoon. Just as a quick follow to the Data Center question and answer that you\u2019ve just provided, which was very useful? How competitive you said you are relative to Altera now with software and OpenCL which I believe was the reason for the delay initially in you getting in that end-market?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Yes. To be total honest, we were not -- we did not recognized that market earlier. On the software side we did have product efficiency. Now based on what customers are telling us, not only are we not behind but we are actually ahead of the competition.", "So I think we have largely closed that gap and if anything it is a competitive advantage for us. We believe that the very deep synthesis technology that we have now delivered this part of our [indiscernible] product that give us a tremendous advantage over any other solution in the market today.", "As with product size update we are now starting to broadly deliver it to customer. We -- and the feedback we are getting is that we are ahead in terms of technology. So the software is no longer the issue if anything is working in our favor.", "Tristan Gerra", "Okay. That\u2019s very useful. And then just a quick follow-up. Is there any end of life product headwind embedded in your September quarter guidance?", "Jon Olson", "No. there isn\u2019t.", "Tristan Gerra", "Great. Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thanks. Next question?", "Operator", "The next question is from James Covello with Goldman Sachs.", "Gabriela Borges", "Great. Thanks for taking the question. Gabriela Borges on behalf of Jim. Just want to follow-up on all the challenges that have been articulated in the Wireless market? Curious if its changing the way you are thinking about providing quarter-to-quarter forecast as well, maybe handicapping customer forecast more than normal? And I guess, the other question would be how that reflects into the turns rate that\u2019s embedded in guidance, given that this was a transition towards distributors or distribution transition as well? Thank you.", "Jon Olson", "Hi, Gabriela. It is certainly a challenge in, I will say, any markets where we have a very high concentration and there has -- in this particularly situation it seems to be more of a worldwide trend that\u2019s going on and if you look at other semiconductor companies have the same challenges as we do in this area.", "I don\u2019t think, because we have such a diversified portfolio beyond just Wireless and overall Communications. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to cause us to change our -- it\u2019s our desire to try -- to do a forecast and do the best way possibly we can.", "I think we are at a point here of certainly a multiyear historical low for us in terms of revenue and -- in this segment and it is challenging but, I think, we will continue to try to push through and figure this out.", "Now relative to the turns percentage number that I provided, while it was quite a bit higher on a percentage basis than our actual turns from the previous quarter, I think we\u2019ve been relatively conservative on the wireless forecast to support that. We had quite a bit of business booked early in the quarter, the previous quarter and then moving into this current quarter that we just started, we\u2019re back to a more normal booking pattern.", "And the actual dollars we need in terms on a weekly basis is not that much greater than the actual dollars per week we had in the previous quarter. So I think we\u2019re pretty well balanced and we see how things go throughout the quarter.", "Gabriela Borges", "Appreciate all the color. Maybe just as a follow-up if I could on the gross margin profile of the business, maybe if we think about year-over-year how the gross margin profile of the company has changed. Help us understand how much of that is makeshift either between end markets or between different product groups? I mean, how much of it is structural initiatives that the company has been taking to improve the longer term gross margin profile? Thank you.", "Jon Olson", "Yeah. So at our Investor Day, we talked about it a 68% to 70% range for this year. So if you look at the midpoint, that would be 69%. And we\u2019ve been running at 70% and 71%. So all the cost reductions that we had in that forecasted Investor Day that drove the 68% to 70% are on track and we\u2019re doing very well. So I would say if I compare it to our previous forecast, we\u2019re on track on all the cost reductions.", "There is a lot of mix issues going on. We do have a slightly stronger Industrial, Aerospace and Defense profile than we thought at that point in time. And we had a substantially weaker communications business. And that mix would tend to push our gross margins to this very high elevated point that we are right now.", "So I think both product and customer mix is accounting for quite a bit. Of this, I think in the absence of more normal -- normalized end market mix that we would have envisioned at the Investor Day, we\u2019ll be running in the 68% to 70% range, probably pretty close to the center of that. So I guess, the short answer to your question is, a lot of it is product mix and end market customer mix.", "Gabriela Borges", "Understood. Thank you very much.", "Rick Muscha", "Okay. Thank you. Next question.", "Operator", "The next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.", "Charles Kazarian", "Hi guys. Charles Kazarian here on behalf on John. Not sure if this was addressed or not but I know you commented that Industrial, Aero, Defense was better than expected on ISM and A&D. I was just hoping if you talk a little more about Industrial within this bucket, for example, what you\u2019re seeing with end demand and then also your view on inventory today in going forward into the back half of the year?", "Jon Olson", "Yeah. Industrial, as we stated, our Industrial was a record quarterly revenue for us, had very strong contribution in North America and in Asia-Pac to be very specific on that. We\u2019re starting to see growth of the Zynq microprocessor-based FPGA in our numbers and broadly new applications in motor control connected factories, industrial, IOT, kinds of areas. We\u2019re starting to see those designs that we\u2019ve won over the last couple of years, start to accumulate in revenue.", "So while I know, there has been some challenging statements about the industrial market. Overall, we saw -- we started to see some of the positive things we\u2019ve been talking about over the last year or so, start to mount up and be more significant within our numbers in addition to our traditional areas.", "Charles Kazarian", "Okay. All right. Thank you very much.", "Rick Muscha", "Next question?", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.", "Hans Mosesmann", "Thank you. Hey, Moshe, I\u2019m looking at the roadmaps here. It turns out that by my reckoning in 2018, you guys are going to be ramping or very early ramping 7-nanometer. And if Altera chooses or if Intel chooses to be the provider of foundry services for Altera there will be a 10. Was there a competitive reasoning behind your decision to skip 10-nanometer besides the cadence aspect of your customers\u2019 preference?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Not really, that\u2019s great question. We just looked at what the right solution -- everything what was available to us and what would be the right solution and TSMC had their 10 and then we said well, there anything beyond that and they told us that they were working on this future technology. TSMC is very committed to driving technology and capacity leadership and when we saw what it is, we thought that it would be a no compelling and so just based on that. Now indirectly, we have no idea what Altera and Intel were going to do and Altera had said that they were looking at TSMC\u2019s roadmap and I would be surprised if TSMC did roadshows on the same thing to be on the strike with that. Probably just makes sense for TSMC to show what they have. So it wasn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t know what was available at Intel, but we just decided that the right thing for our customer base was to go to a 7-nanomter and that looks like a very compelling solution in particular as they are committed to delivering it in 2017 and that\u2019s when we needed.", "Hans Mosesmann", "Right. Okay. And if I could a follow-on on the Zynq side. In the automotive models that you are in, do you know if you are in the front-facing cameras? Is Zynq being used in that kind of an application within a car?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Absolutely. Absolutely.", "Hans Mosesmann", "Okay. And what image processing software, do you provide that or is that a third-party?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "It comes from a variety of sources. Some of which are internal to us, some of which come from that the customers provide and in some cases, it\u2019s the third-party which provides them. So it\u2019s a combination of all three.", "Just to sort of comment on that, what we\u2019re seeing and I said this in response to an early question, we are seeing customers look at a non-differentiated ASSP solution versus highly differentiated solution using our devices. And for the high end, it\u2019s a no-brainer that they wanted differentiated solution.", "And then as you look at the midrange, it\u2019s less clear and definitely, it\u2019s a low end time save and just prepare to have a meat and potato solution as opposed to something which is more specialized. But interestingly because this is become a platform play, then we are starting to see design wins where the customers are committing their entire product offering to our platform. And as a result, they are pushing us hard to provide them with a lower end and we typically would have provided or solution for that.", "And so that\u2019s a growth opportunity for us. And it\u2019s driven by this broad platform-oriented approach where the companies are sort of saying we can\u2019t afford to have different solutions. And because we want to have differentiation, they go with us across the board. And that\u2019s another reason that I believe that our market share which we are happy with the revenue at this point, but our market share is not high yet. We believe that there is an opportunity to grow it going forward.", "Hans Mosesmann", "Thank you. Very helpful.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. Sure. Thank you.", "Jon Olson", "Operator, we will take one more question.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.", "Rick Muscha", "Great. Thanks for joining us today. We have a playback of this call beginning at 5 PM Pacific Time, 8 PM Eastern Time today.

Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.", "Rick Muscha", "Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov CEO and Jon Olson CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the December quarter and then we'll open the call for questions.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company.

Xilinx sales were $566 million, up 7% sequentially and at the high end of our guidance. We experienced exceptional new product growth during the quarter driven by our 28-nanometer 7 series products and 20-nanometer UltraScale products.", "End market strength was broad based with Communications and Industrial and Aerospace and Defense recovering as anticipated.

We expect Automotive to post strong growth in the March quarter and to increase by 30% in the full fiscal year 2016.", "Gross margin was 68.5% for the quarter. In addition to the expected impact of customer mix shift to our larger customers, gross margin was impacted by higher than anticipated production ramp cost associated with the aggressive introduction of our new products. Our March quarter guidance incorporates a small impact from these costs.", "Operating expenses including $2 million of amortization expense or $228 million slightly lower than expected as a result of disciplined spending. Other income was a net expense of $5 million, better than anticipated due primarily to higher investment income.", "The tax rate for the quarter was 15.6%. There were two discrete tax items impacting the rate. There was a $0.03 per share benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit and a $0.05 per share negative impact due to a change in the amount of foreign earnings for which U.S. tax is provided.", "Net income for the quarter was $131 million or $0.49 per diluted share. Operating cash flow for the December quarter was $290 million before $6 million in CapEx. Strong cash flow for the quarter was positively impacted by net improvement in working capital driven by a reduction in receivables and inventories.", "Diluted shares for the quarter were 270 million. There was a 10.6 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions related to dilution Russia associated with our convertible debt, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com. We repurchased 2.1 million shares for $100 million during the quarter and paid $80 million in dividends.", "Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments were $3.6 billion.

I'm very pleased we delivered a significant growth quarter with revenue hitting the high end of our guidance. Overall, six of our eight end markets grew demonstrating the strength of our highly diversified multi-market portfolio.", "Particular, I'm gratified that this growth was driven by an exceptionally strong surge from our new products category, primarily our latest 20-nanometer and 28-nanometer production node which delivered an 18% sequential quarterly increase.", "December quarter 28-nanometer sales grew significantly staying a new record revenue level. 28-nanometer revenue growth benefited from broad-based sales contributions from Industrial, Broadcast, Defense, Test and Measurement and Consumer markets, in conjunction with a significant forecasted recovery in the Communications market.", "The current March quarter driven again by a majority of our end markets, we expect to repeat this trend and set a new quarterly 28-nanometer revenue record.", "Similarly, 20-nanometer revenue in the December quarter is significantly exceeded the $20 million target we had set last quarter. No 20-nanometer competition, the Virtex UltraScale high end family continues to represent the largest percentage of our20-nanometer sales.", "Additionally our Kintex UltraScale family demonstrated significant sales momentum with revenue doubling in the quarter. Looking forward to the March quarter, driven by many of our end markets and led by Test and Measurement, Defense and Consumer, we expect 20-nanometer sales to exceed our new $25 million quarterly target.", "These business successes both the 20 and 28 nodes are being bolstered by the significant milestones we have achieved with our 60-nanometer UltraScale+ family extending our clear industry into leadership.", "Since the September quarter, we've already shared the industry's first 60-nanometer all programmable MPSoC to tens of customers. This broad customer shipment milestone was achieved a quarter ahead of schedule enabled by the excellent functionality of our first 60-nanometer silicon.", "More recently, we received silicon of our 60-nanometer Virtex silicon which is exhibiting similarly pristine functionality. Consequently, we plan to ship it to customers by the end of January significantly ahead of our original schedule.", "In addition, we take out additional 60-nanometer devises last quarter and we fully expect to continue this accelerated ramp of new product tape outs throughout fiscal year 2017 to build up upon and expand our time to market advantage.", "The silicon leadership position is being complimented on the software front by our enabling broad public access to design tool support for the 60-nanometer UltraScale+ family.", "The breakthrough capabilities of the 60-nanometer UltraScale+ product family coupled with our very significant first mover advantage make it uniquely suited for high growth applications ranging from mixed generation front driver assistant, industrial internet-of-things to 5G wireless.", "Lastly, following the October announcement of our strategic partnership with Qualcomm for compute acceleration in ARM-based servers, Xilinx and IBM announced a similar collaboration to enable compute acceleration in servers based on the power architecture. This collaboration is expected to enable high performance and energy efficient FPGA-enabled work load acceleration of rapidly growing applications.", "Notwithstanding the recent turbulence in the global market continued focus and deliver upon the elements we can control, namely our total technology execution, our ability to expand the serviceable market, utilizing our leadership portfolio and our emphasis on maximizing shareholder value.", "Now, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]", "Your first question comes from William Stein with SunTrust.", "William Stein", "Great, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the good quarter. Moshe, I want to address a comment that I believe you made on the last quarter call about Xilinx having passed through the bottom and that the company sees growth in the coming quarters and I think one of the specific comments was more upside risk than downside risk.", "Guidance for the next quarter is I think seasonal or maybe slightly below that and I'm wondering if you can give us an update on sort of where you anticipate we are in the cycle, ignoring perhaps what you read in the papers and see in the markets, but based more on backlog and customer discussion. Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay, Will, as you look over the past couple of years, clearly we had a challenge in terms of our revenue and what we identified was there were two elements -- significant elements that were challenges for us. We're a multi-market company, so we're very diversified and I think that's generally good, but the two challenges we had were on the A&D front and on the wireless front and wireless depending on the point in time is typically north of 20% and A&D can be in the mid-teens, depending on the cycle and those two markets hit low points.", "The low point for wireless we believe was in the June quarter and the low point for A&D was in the September quarter and so those two markets which were a bit of a drag now we believe are in recovery mode and what we're seeing is generally speaking on most or all of our markets we're seeing growth.", "It isn't linear so it sort of goes up and goes down a little, but generally speaking, we think the worst is behind us and we expect to see over the next two quarters better results than we have seen in the past.", "And it's driven by a very strong technology cycle, so it's driven by the 28-nanometer and the 20-nanometer now hitting record revenue -- as they hit records in the December quarter, we expect them to hit higher records in the March quarter.", "This sort of impacts of the 14 weeks versus 13 weeks, we could sort of -- we've generally modeled that as between 2% to 3% in terms of benefiting from that this past -- during that obviously won't -- we won't have that in the current March quarter. So, we do think that what you're seeing is regardless of that you're actually seeing some growth on an apples-to-apples comparison.", "Beyond March, we're low to give predictions and we're probably going to give predictions on a quarter-by-quarter basis going forward because of the choppiness in the market. So, that's sort of the Readers' Digest version. I could spend a whole hour. Hopefully that helps.", "William Stein", "It's helpful. If I can have one follow-up please? I know that it's very early days, but with your primary competitor being acquired by Intel, I imagine that over time, there may be differences in competitive dynamics on the one hand in the data center opportunity and on the other hand in sort of the long tail applications. And I'm wondering if you're seeing early signs of that or maybe you can perhaps preview what you anticipate from a competitive dynamic perspective in the next few quarters? Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, with regards to data center in particular, you know it's an emerging market, its emerging market for everyone. It would be very correct to say that Intel is by far the market leader due to their very strong position on high performance servers and that helps them and undoubtedly, they will leverage that to help them keep as much as they can of that market.", "Our expectation is that notwithstanding that element, there is an expectation of coming solutions coming to market be they compete in architectures, the two that are obvious are the ARM and the POWER ones even on the x86 front, we believe that we can provide a lot of the big players in the market a differentiated solution.", "So, no, I believe that that market; there's growth opportunity for us. I would say it's definitely the market where Intel has the full position. It would be foolhardy to state anything other than that with that with regards to that market in the x86 world. In the non-x86 world, it's sort of ours by and large.", "With regards to the other markets, I think it's fundamentally driven by the customers looking for who has the best technology solution which at this point as you look at the 28-nanometer and 20 and our position on 16, we clearly have tremendous leadership and our market share is growing there.", "We have leadership on the software front and we clearly have the service demeanor which is important to this customer -- to customer in these markets. So, I think that it's a growth opportunity for us. We don't take anything for granted, we need to continue to deliver leadership and the best support and our intention is to continue doing that. So that's another long answer.", "William Stein", "Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Sure. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Seymore", "Hi guys. Just wanted to follow-up on the Industrial and Aerospace segment. Jon a clarification of the moving parts within that. I think you talked about that being down as an entire segment but the A&D side of it being up. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the industrial side, OEM versus demand and especially given in all of the uncertainty macro wise industrial data points are very helpful to us? Thanks.", "Jon Olson", "Sure. In this past quarter both the Industrial, Aerospace and Defense and Test and Measurement were all up sequentially and then the forecast, the guide was to have industrial down Test and Measurement down and Aerospace and Defense up so I was just wasn't 100% sure of which quarter you were referring to when you made those comments so I want to be clear on that.", "So aerospace and defense as Moshe pointed out earlier did bottom out in the September quarter and we're starting to see strength in that business particularly in many of the defense areas and I know the movement and the change in some of the things going on in the budgetary process is starting to, we're starting to see some general goodness in terms of programs and emerging things going on there.", "But most of our business comes from -- current business comes from existing programs and we're just seeing a very good continued very good penetration of products as are quite frankly our 65-nanometer products are growing in that categories and there's a big latency issue relative to the revenue ramp.", "But we're also seeing really good 28-nanometer growth over and above what we've seen maybe historically for a new product category growing, so I think our strength there is continuing to fill and grow Aerospace and Defense. And that's a U.S. and European statement more than it is any other geography from the military perspective.", "Then in industrial, it's pretty choppy. We're seeing overall growth in industrial from a full year to full year basis but by geography, it is kind of up and down. In this particular quarter, this past quarter we had stronger numbers out of Japan than anywhere else and everything else was kind of flattish to down -- flat to down kind of situation, so it continues to be challenging in China and Asia-Pacific as well as Europe where we have a significant strength set of customers so it's not like it's cratering and going down it's just kind of a very choppy environment for us in industrial.", "Ross Seymore", "Great, that's helpful. If I could sneak in one other more housekeeping, 8-K you put out along with your results tonight that had a change of control provision. To the extent it\u2019s possible and I know it might be a little bit difficult but can you give any color as to the catalyst behind those agreements?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So, let me take that and I actually lost the big bet because I have expected that to be the first question to be asked, but thank you for asking that.", "Ross Seymore", "Sorry, I was late.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "No, you're fine. So you know there is very clearly massive consolidation which is happening in the semiconductor world and the general expectation is that will continue. Having said that, we really don't comment on market speculation or rumors and there have been numerous ones.", "What we are doing is basically aligning the change in control arrangements for the company\u2019s executive management to be in line with those which are common for public companies both in our industry and actually across industries and it's just, it just happened now.", "It was the result of some feedback we got or the Board got from an external consultant that they had engaged to look at these issues and that was put in place as a result of the recommendations from the external consultant, so that's sort of the entirety of it.", "Ross Seymore", "Perfect. Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from Citigroup.", "Chris Danely", "Hey, thanks guys. I guess just a longer term question. I know you haven't commented on sort of the long term growth rate. Now that we're getting towards the end of the year here can you just talk about your kind of relative expectations for the growth in your end Markets and then any sort of operating margin or OpEx goals and then the plan to get those, thank you.", "Jon Olson", "So Chris, we aren't really giving prepared to give any real long term guidance or longer term guidance as Moshe mentioned a little earlier today but we clearly expect growth next year for us as the strength of our new products overall are going to drive us there. We seem to be in such a really strong position even at the latest generation of products of 60-nanometer products vis-\u00e0-vis competition.", "We're getting very strong interest and demand interest from our customers for 20 and 60-nanometer products and as we mentioned in Moshe's remarks the uptake in terms of shipments of samples and early products has been extremely brisk to our customers which demonstrates a lot of interest and of course we are hopeful that it does turn into real significant revenue dollars downstream.", "From a margin perspective we've been running kind of bouncing around a little bit between 68 to 70, but I'm still confident we're in the 68 to 70 range in any sort of near term plus or minus a few of the things that bumped us up to 70 and now down to 68.5 but I think we're solidly in the 68 to 70 range and we're going to provide more spending guidance at a later point.", "We really haven't gone through our plan fully and gone through all of that entire exercise, so to summarize, I do believe in top line growth year on year for next year and stable margin.", "Chris Danely", "So, just a quickie. Will there be an Analyst Day or should we wait until the next quarterly announcement to get some fiscal 2017 guidance?", "Jon Olson", "Yeah, we'll give a little more guidance at the next earnings release and we are planning on doing, having an Analyst Day, but we haven't set a specific date for that yet.", "Chris Danely", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Next question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from CLSA Securities.", "Srini Pajjuri", "Thank you. Moshe, you talked about wireless coming back a bit. I'm just curious how much visibility do you guys have into inventories at your customers and then what you saw last quarter and this quarter seems like more of an inventory normalization.", "And if so how should we think about where we are in the inventory cycle? And then can you also talk about what you're seeing geographically in terms of any new rollouts or new developments in wireless?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So the biggest rollout we're currently seeing is the SD rollout in China. We expect that to be significantly smaller than the TD rollout in terms of the length and the number of units but nonetheless we see that happening now and we believe that the improvement that we are seeing in our wireless business is driven by that.", "We are waiting for continuing rollouts in India. We do believe that the level we had reached at the very bottom of our wireless cycle which happened in the June calendar 2014 is behind us and we're seeing growth beyond that but we don't see anything short-term which will enable us to reach the peak which I believe was in the March 2013 timeframe. I might have the year. It was, I'm sorry? 2014, the March 2014 timeframe.", "So, we don't see anything which will bring us back to that anytime soon. We think that the 5G is the next big wave. We are being designed into all of the prototyping for demonstration of technology of 5G but that is not identical to being in the production vehicles which are likely to be very significant truthfully in the 2020 timeframe.", "So, everything until 2020 is likely to be of a smaller scale and the next big surge will be driven by 5G. There will continue to be rollout of 4G on a worldwide basis but it's not going to be anything like the previous level so wireless is not going to reach that peak of March 2014 any time soon.", "Srini Pajjuri", "Okay. That's great. Thanks for that. And then Jon, again on the inventory front, I just asked about customer inventories but also if you can comment on your Balance Sheet inventories I think they came down and you also said they are going to come down again in March and given your optimism about growth for next year, I'm somewhat surprised that inventories are coming down if you could shed some light on that it will be helpful.", "Jon Olson", "Yeah, quite a few quarters ago we had built up our inventory intentionally for two reasons. One is we thought we saw some stronger demand and particularly in SD coming at us and we thought the foundry was pretty tight in terms of their ability to supply us and then we had six quarters of down revenue and so essentially what I'm saying is we built up too much inventory and we've been bleeding it off, so yes, we did go down quite a bit this quarter and we expect to go down again the next quarter, will be much closer to our desired model by the time we get to next quarter.", "So, this is really getting us back to model which is more of the 90 to 100 day kind of range and that's the general target, of course that fluctuates depending on where we are on new product ramp capability, but this isn't, there shouldn't be viewed as some sort of a cautionary signal. This is really about getting inventory back into a historic model after we had built it up in about a year and a half ago.", "Srini Pajjuri", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.", "Harlan Sur", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Europe was down about 6% sequentially versus growth in all of your other geographies. Can you just help us understand what end markets in Europe were weak and how do you see Europe trending in the March quarter?", "Jon Olson", "So, generally, Europe I talked about automotive being down as being a customer timing issue, Automotive was certainly a driver that's where some of our largest Automotive customers are but I think in general, we've been looking at Wireless was down there in Europe as well as Industrial as part of that Industrial conversation I had previously, so I think we do expect Europe to bounce back some next quarter particularly with a much stronger Automotive revenue expected.", "Harlan Sur", "Great, thanks for that and then the team has done obviously a solid job on driving 20-nanometer and 20-nanometer new products. On the competitive front since your competitor has been in the midst of being acquired we've not really heard much in the way of their 14-nanometer program or product family.", "You guys are obviously out there with your 16-nanometer products and getting good early traction. Is the Xilinx team seeing the 14-nanometer product set from your competitor and any competitive engagements?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Harlan, we haven't seen them and we haven't seen any announcement from them. This sort of goes and contradicts the commitments that it's being made to share a long time ago so we think that this indicates the fact that we take out in June of last year, got silicon back in September, the silicon is very, very functional that we have a tremendous lead and we already have on the Virtex side which we expect to tape out", "Sorry we expect to sample customers we've seen the silicon and again it is in great shape and what we're going to do is we're starting to turn the crank and it will be a large number of tape outs at 60-nanometer devises because we do believe we have at least a significant time to market leadership at this node. ", "Jon Olson", "Typically, what would happen, Moshe talked about tens of customers shipping the 16-nanometer product to UltraScale+, and typically what happens is there might be a bake off between us and our competitor, et cetera.", "And at this point, we don't have any customer telling us there's a bake off going on, so that leads us to believe there are no parts out there but of course, we're not the center of all knowledge there but we haven't seen any as much.", "Harlan Sur", "Great. Thanks for the insights.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you. Next question?", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Chris Rolland with FBR.", "Chris Rolland", "Hi guys thanks for the question. You guys mentioned a potential down tic in wired Coms next quarter. Perhaps you can elaborate on what you guys are seeing there and how you kind of view this market longer term?", "Jon Olson", "Yeah, we had quite a bit of growth this quarter in the wired communications area. It was both in I would say core wired communications as well as data center and particular both data acceleration but in a big way also some of the solid state storage and so that sometimes those customers buy a lot and then absorb and buy a lot and absorb and really the down is more related to the customer absorption and some of those cases than it is to any other trend.", "What we are seeing is a very strong uptake of new products in wired communication so if you stripped out older products and just looked at the ramp of new products in 28-nanometer and newer you would see a very nice ramp in wired communications and growth next quarter in new products as well, so this is a kind of a timing issue more than it is a trend.", "Chris Rolland", "Okay. Great, thank you. And then not too much discussion on auto in the quarter, maybe that paused I don't know and then as we look at the ADAS market more specifically did you guys pick up any new guys there, Tier 1s, OEMs, I would love some color there.", "And just for your ARM products more generally, auto and everything, what percentage of revenue would you say are actually associated with or have an ARM core in them? ", "Jon Olson", "So, there's quite a few questions in there.", "Chris Rolland", "Sorry.", "Jon Olson", "So, our overall automotive business continues to be very strong. Year-to-year full year growth in FY 2016 over 2015 at 30% that growth is coming primarily from ADAS applications. Our traditional business is around infotainment and its stable, still doing well.", "Relative to the growth of new applications, I don't know that we have any new public something I can say publicly relative to new platforms but there were new design wins in the quarter in automotive that I'm just not at liberty to provide the name of the ultimate manufacturer at this point in time.", "We are seeing designs we have one ramped very strongly and those again, the ADAS application being the biggest driver of growth there is a growing percentage of that ADAS that has an ARM core in it and in some cases we end up having in more simple applications just straight FPGAs in there but the ARM core is growing very dramatically.", "So, if you'd say we talked last quarter about 50% of our revenue from automotive was ADAS related I would say at least half of that is associated with some level of ARM core and that will be growing over time.", "Chris Rolland", "Great. Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you. Next question.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Your next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo.", "David Wong", "Thanks very much. In which applications are you seeing the most initial interest currently for 60-nanometer product? ", "Jon Olson", "Hi, David. Well there's quite a lot of them because it's a broad product offering, so there's the MPSoC which is basically the ARM based product and then there's the Kintex and the Virtex derivatives, so if you look at the ones which I think are the most significant ones at this point, it's the Next Generation ADAS, so this goes beyond the Zynq.", "It's the industrial control and we do expect this to be used very broadly for 5G wireless at least for the prototyping versions whereas in the 20-20 time frame it's more likely to go into full-fledged production with 7-nanometer so those are three target markets which are driving the design wins in the 60-nanometer but reality is it's a very broad node so I'm probably doing a dissevers towards the others and I'm just sort of mentioning them.", "David Wong", "Great. Thanks.", "Jon Olson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura.", "Romit Shah", "Yes, thank you. Moshe, you mentioned earlier partnerships with IBM on open power servers using their CPUs and as well, with Qualcomm using their server CPUs and I'm curious, how much interest are you guys seeing from web and cloud Service Providers to deploy these chips?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "We're seeing tremendous interest because as I said, this is an emerging market. This is a market where performance per Watt is one of the, is the most important parameter and our all programmable solutions can actually put a huge dent in improving that for a broad range of applications.", "Now these tend to be at this point very large players who are very autonomous and control their software environment, so it's not a PC type environment where control is in the hands of the Microsoft, right? It's actually if you look at the big players, the Amazons, Googles, the Chinese equivalents, they absolutely control their environment and they are driven by the efficacy of their power footprint of their data center. That's why this is due to such an interesting and compelling opportunity going forward.", "Now, there's a lot of excitement about this now, this is a market which is starting to evolve and it has several years to grow, so we've expected it to be significant five years from now and I just want to make sure that everyone understands that at least from our perspective. That's where it will start having the biggest impact. That doesn't mean there won't be deployments before that but in terms of being a significant portion of our revenue, then its five years away. ", "Romit Shah", "And is the partnership at Qualcomm exclusive or do you have the ability to partner with other ARM server suppliers?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, we have a very close relationship with Qualcomm but it's not an exclusive one on our behalf and fundamentally, we can connect with whoever is developing a solution whether it's x86, whether it's POWER-based or ARM based and we can help accelerate all of those and can rest assured that we're in the midst of working with all of them but the ones we have announced we have now a very deep relationship with and we're working towards enabling their products when they have the equivalent CPUs and Board systems for those environments but it's more than just the two that we have announced. ", "Romit Shah", "Okay. And then Jon, can I just ask quickly my impression is that revenue growths in June and September have traditionally been weaker than December and March and is that your impression as well and is there a seasonal component there?", "Jon Olson", "Yeah if you look back at our pattern, it has changed from time to time and last year I think that was we had down every quarter so it's hard to pick that pattern out of that but we aren't prepared to talk about the June quarter right now, we will have to wait until the next earnings release.", "Romit Shah", "Okay. Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you. Next question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ian Ing with MKM Partners.", "Ian Ing", "Yes, thanks. Could you talk about scenarios to get gross margins back to the high end of the range, 70% is it the production ramp costs going away after March or does mix really need to turn more favorable here?", "Jon Olson", "Well, again our goal is to operate in 68-70 and we're comfortable with that so we don't have programs that are specific to have that target because we're obviously focused on adding the most value to the company and total on the operating margin dollar line but from a mix perspective, one of the bigger impacts that we had forecasted for this quarter was the fact that we knew we were going to be returning to a richer, large customer mix that tends to buy volume and therefore has better pricing as a result of that.", "There's also some end market characteristics where we were at a low point for aerospace and defense and as that builds that will counteract some of the large customer impacts, so I guess if you're looking for a scenario that drives margin up, it is large customers except for aerospace and defense customers but again, we are trying to add total dollars to the bottom line. That's the goal.", "Ian Ing", "Okay. Thanks that's all I had.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank Ian. Next question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.", "Hans Mosesmann", "Thank you. Hey, Moshe, just to go back on the aggressive ramp of new products this year. Is that a result of just faster than expected yield improvements at your foundry or are you being opportunistic to kind of take advantage of an opportunity versus the competition what exactly or is it just customer demand?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, it's basically driven by new technology and the maturity of the new technology and typically what happens when we start with the new process node then we tape out one version and then we go through an extensive debug cycle and once we have the debug done, then we can start turning the crank.", "What has happened is the level of functionality was so high on the initial silicon that we actually could sample its customers and we could almost immediately start taping out the other versions.", "And so the answer to your question is we're basically exploiting the high quality of the engineering execution and it behooves us to capitalize on that because as we tape out all of the other versions we expect to extend our market leadership in terms of breadth of product and in terms of having first mover advantage so it's that element which we're capitalizing on and it will manifest itself with tape outs, more tape outs having, happening faster than we had expected which is good news because there's more products out.", "Hans Mosesmann", "Great. Does that change, a follow-up does that change the timing of the tape out of 7-nanometer?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "No, it probably means that we will tape out more versions on 16 to exploit the maturity of it but it doesn't mean we'll do 7-nanometer earlier because in our industry the customers can only absorb the technology to a certain rate and we believe that on average every two and a half years to have a new node is the optimal time for their capacity to use the new technology and it also helps us contain our costs otherwise, we will just be burning money on tape outs ahead of when the customers can use it so we're still planning on 7-nanometer tape out in the 2017 calendar 2017 time frame generally speaking.", "Hans Mosesmann", "Okay. Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with Baird.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, good afternoon. You had said in past that 28-nanometer will be a larger node from a revenue standpoint than 20. Do you see expected that based on the response that you're seeing from customers and most of assuming that based on your 5G commentary 16 no matter revenues are expected to be lot where then the peak you expect at 28?", "Jon Olson", "Okay. So we absolutely expect 28-nanometer due to the richness of the product offering and the cost point that it's at and the customer needs to be a long lasting node and likely to be the largest node at least up to this point in the industry and we don't expect 16 or 20 to approach that.", "We do expect the 16 and 20 together to be generally in that sort of size but the two together are not any one of them virtually and the 28-nanometer as I said had a record revenue this quarter. We expect it to have record revenue that was December.", "We expect it to have another record revenue in the March quarter and we actually I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes our all-time highest record product in terms of quarterly revenue shipments sometime over the next 12 months and overtakes everything else in terms of that and what we're seeing is that we expect it to continue to grow albeit at a smaller rate over the next few years and it has several years until it actually hits its peak. So, that's the story on 28-nanometer for us. 16, we expect to be a very strong node too, but not as strong as 28.", "Jon Olson", "Not to confuse anything Moshe just said, but we are living in a multi-technology product family situation now. We just -- in the last couple of quarters, we've announced a Spartan 7 product line which is 28-nanometer technology and so we're extending -- using all of our technology to extend the low end and improve upon the low end of the FPGA market where 20 and 16-nanometer aren't as economical for us to go.", "So, when you start looking at the growth of the company and the long-term situation is going to be a multi-node kind of product family rollout as we keep going in order to cover all of the different price points in the spaces we're going to be in.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Very useful. Thank you.", "Jon Olson", "Yes, thank you. Next question.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Banc of America. ", "Vivek Arya", "Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the good results and execution. My question, Moshe, is on the long term growth for the PLD industry. If I look over the last three, five or even 10 years, the topline growth for the industry has sort of been flattish despite a lot of penetration and new markets.", "I understand the volatility in the Communications and the Aerospace market, but that's not going away any time soon and that's over half of the sales in this industry. So just the very basic fundamental question is what's going to be different over the next three, four year to create growth in this industry? Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. Well, -- I mean that's a profound question and I agree with your comments on it, we have been disappointed vis-\u00e0-vis growth over the past few years. I think -- and as a result there was a point in time where the general expectation was that you could deliver sustained double-digit growth and we're -- we believe that that is unlikely that it could happen, but it's unlikely to be the compound annual growth rate, so we're talking about single-digit growth even though we still need to deliver and as Jon indicated we do expect fiscal year 2017 to be a growth year.", "On the general question which we'll try to answer probably a little better at our Analyst Day, the point I'd like to make is that except for high volume -- very high volume markets, ASICs and ASSPs and this is no longer a wet dream, right. This is documented known and happening and has happened over the past few years of becoming less and less viable.", "And that opens a serviceable market and it requires the right silicon and it requires the right software and as we move forward and we continue to move forward with -- and being at the leading edge, there's less and less to compete with and if we have the right silicon and we have the right level of integration and we can enable a broader set of customers to use our technology, we should be able to benefit from that. That's sort of the very high level answer.", "I'd like to give you a more profound answer but you know that isn't something we can do now. We will try to address it a little better during our Analyst Day and explain what we're doing in order to exploit the opportunities and among other things just a snip it is if you look at the ARM product line that enables us to service a market, which up to when it was available, we couldn't even touch, right and that the ASSP market and we've gone from to it already being approaching 20% of our revenue on the newest node, right. And that just sort of shows you that it's an expansion play. We'll try and give more example on explaining that in the future.", "Vivek Arya", "Very quickly, could you help, Moshe, help us quantify how large is your Data Center and your Automotive business today? Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "I'll let Jon give you the official answer.", "Vivek Arya", "Okay.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Or not give you.", "Jon Olson", "I actually don't have the Data Center information, so I don't -- we don't track that as a different sub on a routine basis and our Automotive business has been running in the 7% range, I'd say on -- if you look at it over a broad spectrum of quarters.", "Vivek Arya", "Got it. Thank you very much.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Yeah. And that's double where it was a few years ago, so it has grown.", "Vivek Arya", "All right.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Curtis with Barclays.", "Blaine Curtis", "Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. You talk about turning the crank on 16 and are you adding anymore products or is it just a pull-in in terms of the timing? And I know you aren't giving fiscal year 2017 guidance, but how does that impact to shape OpEx?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "We don't have the numbers, but obviously it's the right thing to do, right because we have leadership and there is market demand, it would be foolhardy not to exploit that and we will give you those numbers when we get giving the fiscal year 2017 number.", "At this point, what we want to make is sure is that we exploit the breadth of the opportunity there and we're just accelerating the existing roadmap to provide it at an earlier point than we had expected before. There might be an option to actually also provide better coverage, but at this point, it's the former as opposed to the latter.", "Blaine Curtis", "Thanks. And then I just wanted to go back to a prior question on the Wireless segment. Is there a way to distinguish whether it's a recovery in inventory or are you actually seeing end market pick up? And then you talked about an average of 20% of revenue and not being able to get back to a prior peak, but average of 20, is that a good goal that this business could get back to as 20% of revenue?", "Jon Olson", "Well, I mean, I think that's a pretty reasonable play -- number, just plus or minus a reasonable error bar there. I think what Moshe was trying to communicate was that the very large build up in the overall 4G global network, we have passed that stage of the life cycle of 4G even though we continue to get a lot of long-tail business even from geographies that are [Indiscernible] deployed like North America for example, because of capacitation of the network adding on et cetera, and the situation and best as we can see it in China is they are building FD base stations, we've been told they are deployed, but as you know the last time we learned, we were told those kinds of thing that turns up they weren't all fully deployed and there were a lot of buildup in warehouses.", "As best as we can tell it is moving through the manufacturing line and out of the warehouses and being deployed and it is going to be a couple of quarters of good business and yes there was some replenishment of inventory going on this quarter, but we also see growth next quarter in the Wireless business and some of that is related to the China market as well.", "Blaine Curtis", "Great. Thanks.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thanks Blaine. I think we have time for one last question.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.", "John Pitzer", "Moshe, Jon, thanks for sneaking me in. Two quick ones first is housekeeping. Jon now that the quarter is over, can you just level set us on what do you think the extra week added to both revenue and OpEx in the December quarter?", "And then Moshe, I think this question might have been partially answered with Blaine's question, but when you think about getting Wireless back to prior peak, it sounds like that's more commentary on the overall CapEx cycle and inventory cycle and not the PLD opportunity set within base stations and I wonder if you could just comment a little bit on kind of what you think the content on PLD was supposed to be and how that's playing out through the 4G cycle?", "Jon Olson", "So relative to your first question on the impact, we had estimated a couple of a percent, 2% or 3% kind of in the last call and that's exactly where it turned out the last two weeks of the quarter were for us were 13, week 14 were quite muted on an individual basis and when you add those two together, it ends up being around a 2% or 3% kind of positive impact as a result of having that extra week. Of course, we get the spending -- and we have all of the extra spending as well in that quarter.", "And then your second question was around the peak, Moshe, do you want to answer?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Yes, so what we see is a continuing opportunity and actually a growing opportunity for FPGA content in Wireless, we're seeing number of players who can effectively design ASICS, which is the other option because there really isn't a viable ASSP solution at this point in time and we don't see that happening any time soon, so it's ASICs versus FPGAs.", "We're seeing less and less players with the capacity to do that and so the role of FPGAs grows and with each generation generally speaking, the average ASP per system is a little higher. It doesn't reflect the much larger role of the FPGA has in the system, so it's an integration play. We replace a lot of other components and so we have more major parts, but the ASP does not go out at the same level to reflect the value the FPGA provides.", "But generally speaking, it's one of those markets where the role of the FPGA continues to grow and major competition is the very, very, very few and actually diminished number of players who can design ASIC alternatives and that number continues with each generation of product to go lower and lower.", "John Pitzer", "Perfect. Thank you. ", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Hey. Thank you, John.", "Rick Muscha", "Thanks for joining us today. We have a playback of this call beginning at 5 P.M. Pacific Time, 8:00 P.M. Eastern Time today. For a copy of our earnings release, please visit our IR website. This quarter we will be presenting at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet conference in San Francisco on February 9th.

I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.", "Rick Muscha - Senior Director, Investor Relations, Xilinx, Inc.", "Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, Chief Executive Officer; Jon Olson, Chief Financial Officer; and Lorenzo Flores, Vice President of Finance and Corporate Controller. As we announced in February, Jon will be retiring in May with Lorenzo succeeding him as CFO. Jon will continue to support the transition through July. Jon and Moshe will provide a financial and business review of the March quarter and fiscal 2016. Moshe will add a high level perspective on fiscal 2017, and Lorenzo will follow with June quarter and FY 2017 guidance. We look forward to providing you with more details at our upcoming analyst day on May 23.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company.

This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.", "Let me now turn the call over to Jon.", "Jon A. Olson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Rick. Fiscal year 2016 was another profitable year for Xilinx although revenue did not meet our expectations going into the year. Revenue was $2.2 billion for the year, down 7% from last year but strengthening throughout FY 2016. Gross margin remained strong through the year, averaging 69.7% as our pricing and cost management efforts continued to have a positive impact. Operating margin exceeded 30% based on these margin management efforts and prudent spending.", "Cash flow margin was 33%, the same as last year. So our lower revenues contributed to a lower operating cash flow of $730 million. We repurchased 9.7 million shares for $443 million and paid $319 million in dividends, a total return of $761 million. This is the second straight year we have returned over 100% of cash flow and 11th straight year of dividend increase.", "Turning now to a discussion of the fourth quarter. Xilinx sales were $571 million, up 1% as new products continued to grow and we saw stabilizing trends across our end market segments. Communications was flat with a small growth in wireless offsetting a small decline in wired. Industrial and A&D was down slightly with strength in aerospace and defense offsetting declines in industrial, and test and measurement. Broadcast, consumer and automotive grew 6% powered by another record quarter in automotive, demonstrating our strength in ADAS.", "Gross margin in Q4 was 69.2%, higher than last quarter and higher than expected due to the mix of customers and products in addition to lower product ramp expenses. We continued to aggressively manage both the pricing and cost sides of gross margin. Operating expense at $217 million was slightly lower than our guidance. A reminder here that a significant part of the decline from Q3 was due to the 14th week in our Q3. The increase in revenue, gross margin, and lower operating expense drove an increase of more than 10% in operating income for the quarter, up to $178 million. Other income and expense was an expense of $8 million, higher than forecasted due to an equity investment write-off. The tax rate was 14.6% for the quarter.", "Our net income for Q4 was $146 million or $0.54 per share. Operating cash flow was $127 million, down from last quarter, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable. Diluted shares were 268 million shares including 10.5 million shares from the convertible. During the quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares for $143 million and we paid $80 million in dividends.", "Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $3.6 billion in gross cash and $2 billion in net cash after our debt. As mentioned above, we saw an increase in accounts receivable to $307 million. This was entirely due to the timing of customer shipments in the quarter, and we see no credit or collectability issues. Inventory was $179 million, down from $17 million from the prior quarter and down $52 million from the beginning of the year as we continue to manage inventory down.", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Jon. I am very pleased with both the financial and operating results of the fourth quarter. Our revenue has rebounded to its highest level in over a year, while expanding the growth momentum which started in the fiscal third quarter. As Jon discussed, both profitability and cash flow remained robust throughout the entire year, reflecting our strong business model. Our execution on the 28, 20, and 16-nanometer nodes has been exceptional. The realignment driven in our sales organization is leading to stronger customer relationships and expanding our reach. We are confident this will translate into revenue growth from both market share gains and market expansion. Following are some achievements, which illustrate the strength of our position.", "Our technology and product leadership has translated to 4 points of PLD market share gains over the past five years. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we delivered record sales on the 28-nanometer node and expect to set a significant new record in the June quarter. Our 20-nanometer family approached $100 million in revenue in fiscal year 2016, while significantly exceeding our targets in all four quarters of fiscal year 2016. We expect to ship well over $30 million of 20-nanometer product in the June quarter.", "In a successful demonstration of our market expansion efforts, revenue from our Zynq product line more than doubled in fiscal year 2016. Zynq is particularly strong in the automotive, wireless and industrial markets. For example, our automotive business has grown over 60% over the past two years driven by deployment of advanced driver assistance applications in over 60 automobile models. At the 16-nanometer node, we have delivered all three UltraScale+ product families ahead of schedule and have already shipped six unique products to several tens of customers.", "Our one year plus leadership in 16-nanometer products has generated multi $100 million design wins on customer platforms, which in the past have traditionally been ASSP based. We have established data center partnerships targeting data center acceleration initiatives with both IBM and Qualcomm and are deeply engaged with multiple hyperscale data center customers. Lastly, we completed the rollout of the SDx family of software-defined development environments. This is a key capability to significantly expanding our user base beyond traditional PLD designers to a much larger community of systems and software engineers.", "We finished fiscal year 2016 with undisputed product leadership on the silicon, software and IP fronts, very well positioned in multiple markets coupled with much deeper engagements with key customers and partners. Our excellent execution could not have come at a more opportune time. The consolidation in the semiconductor industry is leading to rationalization and elimination of competing product lines at both traditional ASIC and ASSP companies. This phenomenon has opened up new growth opportunities for Xilinx as the vendor of choice with our existing and new customers. This is a carpe diem opportunity. The time is ripe for us to capitalize on the three successive generations of leadership to expand our market position. We intend to do this by simultaneously pursuing on the following four fronts.", "On the 16-nanometer UltraScale+ front, due to its excellent software and pristine silicon functionality, we have elected to both accelerate our currently planned 16-nanometer tape-outs and expand the original product portfolio. These multimarket 16-nanometer products complement our successful 20-nanometer family with its estimated 80% market share. They address near-term revenue growth opportunities in the data center market tailored for the first wave of 5G deployments in the 2018 timeframe, while positioning us for longer-term massive 5G deployment. After that, serve the automotive market and form the basis for expanding our platform wins in the Industrial Internet of Things.", "Similarly, we are executing on our plans to deliver our 7-nanometer product offerings. This capitalizes on our extremely tight relationship with our absolutely outstanding foundry partner TSMC to satisfy the advanced technology needs of our leading-edge customers. This is another pillar of our SAM expansion strategy. In parallel, we are committed to providing our customers with an attractive high volume spot in 7-nanometer family. This family will be implemented in 20-nanometers and will expand our market position in the price-sensitive parts of the market.", "On the software front, we will enable market expansion by a breakout in integration and programming models targeted to high growth segments driven by cloud computing, vision processing, including, but not limited to ADAS, the Industrial Internet of Things and 5G. Our plans for fiscal year 2017 while aggressive are based on the financial principles we have consistently demonstrated. We're committed to continuing to invest prudently to preserve and extend our market position, while delivering longer term a 30%-plus operating margin and preserving our commitment to return cash to our shareholders.", "Before I turn the call over to Lorenzo who will discuss the financial guidance of Q1 and the rest of fiscal year 2017, I would like to use this opportunity to personally thank Jon for his 11 years of extremely significant contributions and exemplary partnering at the helm of Xilinx. Lorenzo, you have big shoes to fill.", "Lorenzo Flores - Vice President-Finance & Controller", "Thank you, Moshe, and I also would like to thank Jon specifically for the leadership function over the past 11 years. Moshe has established the compelling opportunity for Xilinx, and now I want to provide you all with the financial guidance aligned to our taking advantage of that opportunity. Starting with Q1, revenue will be approximately flat. We entered the quarter with backlog down slightly and are expecting turns to be about 49%. We expect new products to continue to grow with 28-nanometer growing to a new record, and 20-nanometer exceeding $30 million. With respect to end markets, communications and data center growth will offset a decline in industrial and A&D. Communications and data center growth reflects a continued ramp of our customers' wired designs and a near-term firming in wireless. The decline in industrial and A&D is primarily due to program timing in A&D. Broadcast, automotive, and consumer will be down slightly reflecting a small inventory cycle in automotive and a small decline in broadcast.", "Our gross margin will be between 69% and 70%, and our operating expense will be approximately $220 million including $1 million of amortization. Other income and expense will be an expense of $5 million and our tax rate is expected to be 14%. Share count is expected to be 266 million. As we move into the discussion of our full year guidance, I want to remind the audience that we have our analyst day on the May 23 in Boston. While I expect there will be questions on the full year guidance, we will give further details at our analyst day.", "First on revenue, we see annual revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 8%. This will be driven by growth in communications and data center and broadcast, consumer and automotive and to a lesser degree by industrial and A&D. Within communications and data center, all end markets will show growth including wireless, as it has recovered from the low points in FY 2016.", "In broadcast, consumer, and automotive, we expect automotive to continue to grow strongly, although at a reduced rate with the other end markets showing some growth. In industrial and A&D, the overall growth of the segment will be mitigated by program timing factors in A&D, although the underlying business in A&D remains healthy. We see the growth of our overall business weighted into the second half of the fiscal year. For gross margin, we expect to remain in the range of 68% to 70%. Our price and cost management efforts will continue to support our gross margin, though we expect some pressure from product ramp expenses and customer mix through the year.", "For the past few years, we have been deliberately increasing our relative emphasis on R&D, while extracting efficiency from SG&A. This has provided the resourcing for the execution we have seen on 28-nanometer, 20-nanometer and now 16-nanometer, and has put us in the advantageous position Moshe has described. We are continuing that approach with an investment level and focus consistent with addressing the opportunity we see in front of us. In order to capitalize on and extend our market position, operating expense is expected to grow 7% to 9% with almost all of the growth being in research and development. This growth funds the expansion of our leadership position with the 28-nanometer Spartan-7, significant increases in tape-out expenses to accelerate our lead in 16-nanometer, and our leading 7-nanometer product development.", "Other income and expense will decline slightly through the year from the $5 million quarter level in the first quarter. This will mean that we will see approximately half the expense we saw in fiscal year 2016, a significant improvement driven by last year's interest rate increases and a small anticipated increase in interest rates in FY 2017. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 14%. With the growth in revenue and the operating assumptions I've described, we anticipate low single digit growth in earnings per share in fiscal year 2017.", "Let me now open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "The floor is now open for questions. Our first question comes from Romit Shah from Nomura.", "Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Oh, hi. Thank you. It's the first time I'm hearing about some softness in automotive. I think you guys made the comment for fiscal 2017 that it would grow, but perhaps a little bit more slowly. So could you give us some more color on what's happening with your automotive business?", "Lorenzo Flores - Vice President-Finance & Controller", "Sure. I'm not exactly sure I relate to the softness characterization. I think what we're reflecting is the rate of growth in the past couple of years has been very significant, although the rate of growth in FY 2017 will also be significant, it just won't be at that same rate.", "Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "You mentioned in your prepared remarks that there was some inventories in automotive, I wasn't sure specifically where that might be.", "Jon A. Olson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey, Romit. This is Jon. I'm not exactly sure where you heard that. What we're trying to characterize is that the automotive segment for us is growing quite significantly and has been and is going to continue. We are experiencing in the industrial side a period of slower growth than we had anticipated, just because of some macroeconomic areas, but definitely no inventory issues with respect to automotive.", "Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Okay. Maybe I just misunderstood, Jon. And the other question I had was on 7-nanometer, can you give us a sense on when you think you'll be ramping 7-nanometer and in particular, what does that sort of mean for your opportunity in data centers?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Let me take a cut at that. So, data center is a fast-emerging market, and it's still in the nascent period, so it's a market which we expect over the next five years to grow at a rapid rate. For us, it could be significant and in that sort of timeframe as we execute, we believe that it could be a multi $100 million market, which for us is a big number. We can service it and we are servicing it already with our existing product portfolio, so we actually have design wins in 20-nanometer, 16-nanometer, and I'm pretty sure we would expect to have significant design wins in 7-nanometer too.", "What you will get from 7-nanometer is typically higher level integration, higher performance, lower power, all of these things are important to this market where every two years to three years, there's a total refresh of the data centers due to the rapid rate of evolvement. So data center is a big driver of our 7-nanometer business, but actually part of the expansion of our 16-nanometer we expect to have significant benefits, that's targeted at data center too. So, you don't need to wait until 7-nanometer in order to see our revenue growth in data center, it should come ahead of that.", "Given the nature of our business, after we tape out the device, it typically takes a year to move into production, and then the deployment is very market-specific. So, there are markets that deploy very quickly. Emulation is an example of the one which deploys fastest, but data center is also a fast time to market for us, so probably 7-nanometer, our data center product, should be generating revenue, 2019-2020, that sort of timeframe. All right, hopefully that answers your question.", "Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "It does. Thanks, Moshe.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from William Stein from SunTrust.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'm hoping you might be able to help us understand what looks like a bit of a lower than expected outlook in the industrial, aero and defense. It sounds like it's more aerospace and defense linked both for the June quarter and the full year. And I guess I'm a little perplexed because my expectation was that that end market was improving this year owing to DoD budgets and the like. Maybe it's more commercial aerospace that you're exposed to. Any clarification there could really help, in particular both for the quarter and for the full year.", "Jon A. Olson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, This is Jon. Let me take that one. So I think, Will, you're familiar with the fact that we characterized we had a roll-off of a very large program and we bottomed out, I think, in our June quarter of this past year for aerospace and defense. And we have had incremental improvement in each quarter from that point. Actually, bottomed out in September, excuse me, in the September quarter, not the June quarter. We've had incremental improvement in every quarter and we do expect that incremental improvement to continue in aerospace and defense. It's just that when you look at the full year, we still ship quite a bit of product in our first quarter of last year that is dragging the year-on-year comparison down, so it's a modest growth in aerospace and defense.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Right.", "Jon A. Olson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "It is actually a very stable, strong comeback for us, and when the redesign of the F35 capability starts kicking in more towards the end of the next fiscal year, I think you're going to see some acceleration there. Industrial has been more bit of a timing issue for us with certain customers, A, and then some recent softness particularly in the APAC that we're seeing softness in industrial and in a couple of our regions, and that's going to grow a little more slowly than we thought, but we still are expecting pretty significant growth on a year-on-year basis.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "That's helpful.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I'm sorry.", "Jon A. Olson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Was going to add something.", "Lorenzo Flores - Vice President-Finance & Controller", "Yeah, I was just, you know, the FY 2017 A&D business is, I would characterize as there's a very broad base of projects underneath it extending from electronic warfare to munitions to data analysis and communication systems. And it's different from when we had the very large GSF program as Jon described. So, I think I would characterize it as a very strong and diverse market in A&D. But it is coming off of the cycle that Jon described.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "That's helpful. Maybe if I can ask for a brief update on the broadcast end market. I know it's relatively small, but it's one of these sub-industries in your end-market categorization that tends to move around a lot. I'm wondering what the trends are there.", "Lorenzo Flores - Vice President-Finance & Controller", "Well, there's two parts to that, the way I think about it. One is the cameras and then the other part is a distribution aspect of things. And the distribution aspect is moving more towards server and common platforms, and in some cases we're actually seeing some of that start to bleed into what we would call our classic communications business as IP protocols are used more. Camera business has tended to be more around trends of the technology, so thinking of the move to 4K and then 8K beyond that. So we are seeing relative strength in the whole camera side of it, because of those trends more towards 4K in terms of recording content and things like that. The other side of the distribution we're seeing relative softness.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hi. Thank you. I had a question on the OpEx. You guys have done a very good job the last couple years being very disciplined on the OpEx side. What are you seeing that OpEx is going up so much this year?", "And then I had a longer-term architectural question for you, Moshe, if you could please address that. There's a lot of conversation around accelerating compute in the data center. And so if you could please provide us your perspective on where do FPGAs sit. If we look at the different kinds of workloads and what's the trade off in power versus performance, and specifically, does the fact that Intel is able to put FPGA and a server chip on a single, either on a package or a single die. Does that create moats or disadvantages for your solution? I noticed you had another announcement at the POWER Summit. Thank you.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Okay, Ambrish. So thanks for the first question, I wanted to make sure that I clarify. What we believe is we now have almost a once in a lifetime opportunity, and this is driven by two things. One is outstanding execution and I'm not going to keep beating that dead horse. I think I can assume that the issue of credibility on that topic is no longer in question. I hope so.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "No, it's not.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Thank you.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Not for me at least, Moshe.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. It has been in the past, and I think now with three generations of leadership, allow me to feel vindicated on that topic. So when you've delivered on that and you see the massive changes which are happening in the market, and no way am I minimizing the challenges of competing with very large corporations like Intel, like the new Broadcom, et cetera. But in reality what is happening is, the semiconductor market has matured, is changing radically, and it's changing in a way where a lot of applications which in the past could justify an ASIC or there would be a small and medium-sized ASSP company that would provide a complete solution. Neither the ASICs are particularly viable and most of those little companies and medium size companies have gone. They've disappeared and some have merged, some just are no longer viable. But in reality, a lot of those product lines do not have a path going forward.", "And this is a multimarket trend, right? So I wouldn't say that it's true in every single market, but it's true in a lot of the markets that we service that we actually now are finding that we have the \u2013 it's a much larger TAM we can address through our product offering, because our product offerings have evolved and with the Zynq product line and the like and the integrated capabilities, we can provide an alternative to ASSPs. And so both through our technology, through our market leadership and through the fact that the consolidation largely is eliminating solutions for a lot of these markets, which might not be multi-billion dollar markets, but they're nice markets for us, we are the best game in town, and the customers are telling us that.", "So I'm sitting in front of this great opportunity saying, okay, we have the technology leadership, and these opportunities are coming up. Do I take my foot off the gas? Do I keep my foot on the gas but where it was? Or do I push the pedal all the way down to the metal? And this was a strategic discussion we had, and we figured out that we can still remain at 30% plus operating margin and grow to that point in and around and over time grow a bit there, and we'll talk a little more about that in May. But we're at the high end of profitability, so we might as well exploit this. And in a nutshell, this is an opportunity, and we think it would be foolhardy not to pursue it. And as I said, we can do this while retaining a fabulous return of cash to investors with almost best-in-class operating margin, we can still do all of that.", "So, yes, that's the message we try to deliver and we will provide a little more clarity on that, and that's why you're seeing the investment grow, and it's almost all in R&D because we have to do more tape-outs and we have to develop a few more things in parallel. So one way of doing it, of encapsulating this, and this could be viewed as being arrogant, we're doing it because we can. The other way of looking at it is we're doing it because we can't afford not to exploit this great opportunity, right? And that's the thinking behind this. So, hopefully, again that clarifies the strategic question.", "On the architectural issue and data centers, so again, this is an evolving market, which is nascent at this point in time, and it's a market which traditionally has been serviced by CPUs. And over the past several years, NVIDIA in particular has identified that there are segments that are well serviced by GPUs and they actually have established a strong foothold in the market.", "What has become very clear and there's a lot of papers from third parties, there's one from Microsoft which analyze what happens with these massively parallel applications and how well they do if instead of just using a CPU or a GPU, you actually use an FPGA or programmable logic. And what they found is that for a lot of very critical applications, there's anywhere between potentially a 10x to 35x improvement in performance per watt if you use programmable logic. And that's the essence. That market is evolving. It's a market which is unique because most of it, at this point in time, is controlled by very large independent companies that actually control the ecosystem for this.", "So it doesn't require a Microsoft with all of the x86 applications. It can be thought of as an embedded application, which is controlled by these very large companies. And these very large companies are looking for alternatives to Intel and alternatives to GPUs, and this was cited by Intel justifiably as one of the reasons that they acquired Altera and paid what they did for Altera. It was worth that much for them.", "Going forward, we expect the market to bifurcate into an Intel x86 camp and everyone else, with everyone else regardless of their x86 or power-based or ARM-based, and for most of these other players this is a significant growth market, then we are realistically the only game in town. Hence, we believe that that's very profitable for us. On the Intel x86 side, we do believe that Intel will do all sorts of integration things. Regardless of that, as we talk to these hyperscale customers, they're indicating to us that for a lot of their requirements, actually a non-integrated solution which they totally control is more attractive than one which is dictated to them from above.", "And so we're investing heavily. We think we have a big lead on the technology side, and we do expect this to be a multi-hundred-million-dollar opportunity, but again this is in a five-year timeframe. We have design wins, we have several of them. They are going to go into production soon, and this is both likely in North America and outside North America. But it's still early days. And again, being a multimarket company, we believe that this will be a significant growth opportunity for us. So I apologize for the verbose answer, but there's a lot to cover on both...", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "No, I appreciate it, Moshe. Thank you very much. Good luck.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ian Ing from MKM Partners.", "Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC", "Yes. Thank you. More questions on these investment levels for the fiscal year. I know you talked about it being a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and customers are saying you're the best game in town. But how many years are you willing to grow investments faster than revenue? Do we have to wait until 16-nanometer materializes to get the benefits, or should 20-nanometer help reverse the trend at some point? I mean, is 30% op margin the line in the sand here? Thanks.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. That's a great question and I think we will answer it in more detail in May. But just to sort of give you a preview, we're going to be approaching that either way, and we intend to grow the company over time to beat that number and to grow beyond it. So we'll give a little more clarity as to when you can expect that in May, but you're not going to need to wait several years for that.", "Now this year is particularly significant in terms of growth, because to be totally open, we have so overachieved on the functionality of the 16-nanometer that we are just accelerating the tape-outs, and each of these tape-outs is a multimillion dollar cost to us. So knowing realistically, we're sort of pulling several of them in, which is good news because that means that over time it should translate to revenue quickly. But what you're seeing now, this rate of growth in R&D, which potentially could be larger than the top line, we do not expect that to continue in the future. And again, in May we'll give you more.", "Lorenzo Flores - Vice President-Finance & Controller", "Yes, Ian, it's Lorenzo here. I think we are really, really conscious of the strength of our operating model, and I want to point out again what was said earlier, we've been very disciplined at how we've spent and invested our money in the past. I think this is a strategic investment area, and as Moshe said, our objective is to get back to our target operating margin levels as quickly as possible.", "Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC", "Thanks. And, Jon, congrats on your retirement. Hopefully you attend a lot of Green Bay Packer games this season.", "Jon A. Olson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Ian.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Not more than 16.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi. This is Ji (39:26) for Ross Seymore. Thank you for letting me ask a question. So, Moshe, what gives the company confidence in spending so much more in OpEx that the OpEx spend will yield revenues given the past few years where revenue growth has been difficult to generate?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. That's a great question. What sort of has happened over the past few years is we're in a business where most of the markets we serve take a long time to come to fruition. And so if you look at 28 nanometer, which we taped out six years ago, it is now approaching $200 million a quarter. It hasn't quite reached that level. $200 million a quarter is, give or take, only a third, in and around it's about 30% of our overall revenue.", "So what you're seeing is the time it takes for the new nodes starting from 28 nanometers and now at 20 nanometers, which as we said we shipped close to a 100 million relatively quickly for us during the past fiscal year. They're in their continued growth phase, and also the Zynq product line is now in its more accelerated growth phase. For example, automotive is driven by the Zynq product line, which is an expansion play.", "And so we're at the point in time where all of the headwinds we had, which are all technologies, some execution challenges we have had in the past which we are paying the price for, et cetera, they're tailing off. And the new technologies where we have much higher market share and where the expansion plays are starting to pick up, and so I think your question is very fair and a very good one, but the reason is that we now see that the headwinds are tailing off and, hence, the growth from the new products will happen. And we're also seeing the changes in the industry.", "For example, I'll just throw one thing at you. Five years ago we predicted that the Japanese ASICs vendors would depart the stage, right. And at the time, that was considered a heresy, right, because they had owned the market for the longest period of time. And to a large extent they're gone, right. So that's an opportunity for us. A lot of the other ASIC vendors have gone. I mean it's not that there are no ASIC companies, but there are fewer and fewer of them. The same thing is true on the ASSP side. So the serviceable market is now growing, and in order to exploit that, we're making these larger investments.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. And then as a follow up, is the OpEx expected to be back-half weighted in the fiscal year similar to revenues, so it can be moderated if revenues don't follow?", "Lorenzo Flores - Vice President-Finance & Controller", "The second half operating expense will be significantly higher than the first half. But you'll start seeing the increase in the second quarter.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay, thanks. And we echo congratulations to Jon.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Jon A. Olson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I said the first thank you.", "Jon A. Olson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Okay, all right, Moshe.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Hans Mosesmann from Raymond James.", "Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Thanks. Hey, Moshe, on the going back to the 16-nanometer and the decision to accelerate and expand on the tape-outs and such. How much of it is a result of a competitive dynamic? I understand the customers are eager, but perhaps there's another element here. Your competitor might be delayed or delayed significantly. How much of it is that potentially that you're taking advantage of an opening, if you will? Thanks.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Clearly we believe we have a year lead, potentially a more significant lead than that, and it behooves us to exploit it. And because our silicon is in such good shape and we can do multiple tape-outs and we're already shipping six products, which for us would be unheard of. This is a product we taped out at the very end of June. So it's only nine months since we taped it out and we already are shipping six derivative unique products. So that means that we've done six tape-outs, which means that it's really in very good shape. And you're right that if we sit back and we have a very worthy competitor and we just let them, don't exploit that, we're likely to compromise the potential here.", "So, yeah, there is an element of that. That's on our core programmable logic business. But this goes beyond programmable logic because with 16-nanometer and with 7 and with Zynq, we can provide an alternative to ASICs and ASSPs and those are our nontraditional competitors. And obviously we just need to keep running as quickly as we can to maintain the lead we have in terms of technology, so it's both.", "Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Fair enough. And then a quick follow-up, please. On the Zynq side, on the automotive business, what's the competitive dynamic there? Are you gaining share? What's the size of the market? If you can just give us a little framework there as you look into fiscal 2017. Thanks.", "Jon A. Olson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, Hans, this is Jon. Let me take that one. So, we talk a lot about ADAS, and I think we get a lot of comparisons to what we're doing in the forward-looking cameras which is where we have a lot of strength, particularly in the stereo versions of those. But our ADAS business is really very broad. So Zynq is a driver of it, and it's a driver of us not just in the forward-looking cameras, but also in some of the other safety and lane departure and those kinds of things as well.", "We have developed a really broad business in the automotive world, and it isn't just one competitor. There's a variety of competitors now that we're meeting. And when we talk about, when you see the presentations in May, I think you're going to see a lot more conversation around the breadth of what we have and why we're so confident about successive years of growth in this market. So in other words, FPGA technology is not just the programmable processing unit. It's really broader than that for us, and we're doing really quite well.", "Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Thank you. Very helpful.", "Jon A. Olson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tristan Gerra from Baird.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Good afternoon. You've talked about 5G starting to ramp in 2018. How should we look at the wireless infrastructure market between now and then? What's the status of the 4G ramping in Europe, and how should we look at wireless infrastructure trends over the next couple of quarters given kind of the turmoil that we saw in China last year?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So I'll give you my cut, and then I'm sure there's a lot of additional information Jon and Lorenzo can add. But we hit the low point in the June quarter of calendar 2015. And that was a really low, low point. So if you do peak-to-trough, it was almost one-half of the peak or maybe even less than one-half of the peak. And what we have seen is it's recovering. We think there's a lot of things that happened because wireless is a multi-geography, multi-generation phenomenon on the infrastructure side. What we saw was there was the combination of all of the bad news on all of the fronts happened at the same time for us. Since then, it has improved.", "We're seeing renewed deployment in China. We're seeing deployment in India, and this is all triggered around, this is not 5G. This is largely LTE. We think that LTE still has a lot of deployment left. And that will probably, for the next few years, continue to carry things. What we're seeing which is very encouraging to us is if you go back a year or a year-and-half ago, the general feeling was that there would be no rush towards 5G. And that has sort of totally changed within the past year. And there now seems to be a race towards 5G with an amazing amount of prototyping and proof-of-concept being done now. And we actually have a great footprint there.", "We expect a quasi-5G or an early 5G to be deployed in 2018 at a minimum in Korea, but actually I won't be surprised if there's some early signs in North America. And then 2020 onward, we expect it to grow. It's expected to be a very large market, and there's a lot of applications which are driving it. Smartphones, even though they're not growing, their footprint in terms of bandwidth is increasing, right? So maybe there's not that many new smartphones, but the refresh cycle is for ones which require more bandwidth and significantly bigger load on the infrastructure. And the applications are driving that and, the other one is the Internet of Things both on the consumer and the industrial side, and that's expected to generate totally new set of needs for infrastructure. So we think it's a big market. Again, we'll shed some more light on that in May with people who are more expert in the field.", "Lorenzo Flores - Vice President-Finance & Controller", "Yeah, I think despite Moshe's saying, Jon and I could have a lot to add, his answer was \u2013 it was fairly comprehensive. In the near term what we see is, as Moshe described, firming up the recovery from where we had been in the low points particularly in China, backfills geographically around the world, and ramp in India although we don't expect that to be of the same magnitude as China. And then finally, the 5G prototyping pre-production type of business is actually pretty good business for us this year.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Great. That's very useful. And then a quick follow-up question. What opportunities do you see in small cell? I mean, we've learned obviously that the price points were high and have kind of delayed what people thought was a ramp starting a few years ago, but it looks like we're now starting to see signs in China notably. Do you expect to participate, or is that type of market naturally gravitating toward ASIC given the high volumes?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So that trend is continuing but certainly not as robust as people had indicated a number of years ago that it was going to be deployed. We are participating in small cells. It is still a market that we can be in if we're talking about urban areas where there \u2013 where the number of users and densification requirement, so I would say not on the home or local kinds of things, but in urban areas where they're trying to augment macro base stations, we are playing in those, particularly in the radios. So, yeah, but we don't see it as a big offset to the long-term macro station.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thank you.", "Jon A. Olson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you. Next question?", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.", "John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. First, I just want to thank Jon for all the help over the years, I really appreciate it. Moshe, I know on an earlier question you kind of addressed that the OpEx guidance for the fiscal year 2017 is pretty back-half loaded. I guess I just want some clarification, how dependent is that OpEx number in kind of hitting the revenue guidance number you gave? If for some reason revenue were to come a little bit short, would that OpEx number have some modulation in it, or is a lot of that just kind of fixed OpEx based upon projects that you are planning on doing in the back half of the fiscal year?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, let's say there's a huge downturn and we're rational people, and we behave accordingly. Right? So we generally realize that we have a responsibility here, and we take it very seriously. So if that happens, we will act accordingly. Lorenzo's guidance for the year is 4% to 8%, and we're not planning on some huge surge to justify this. We're planning on a gradual growth during the year. We think that's very reasonable given our strong design win situation, and the fact that we do see them moving into production now at a greater rate on the newer nodes. So I'm not discounting that. Things happen. And if they do, we will act accordingly.", "John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "That's helpful, Moshe. And then my guess is you'll address this in a lot more detail at the analyst day, and I'm not a huge fan of looking at seasonality because there's so much variance around seasonality. But if I just pivot seasonally off your June guidance, I'm getting fiscal revenue year growth in 2017 that's more flattish versus kind of the 6% midpoint guidance you gave. I'm just kind of curious, can you give us some broad strokes as to what end markets or what product portfolios you think are going to start driving sort of better than seasonal growth as you go throughout the year?", "Lorenzo Flores - Vice President-Finance & Controller", "So let me take that, because I've actually looked at the issue of seasonality. I think the complexity of our business and the multi-market nature of our business makes seasonality a tough model to apply because we're more prone to be following longer term growth or decline trends than we are necessarily seasonal behaviors like, say, a retailer. And I know you acknowledged that up-front, John, but I think what we're really saying in this market environment, it is the continued growth of our new products which you can view as not being terribly impacted by seasonality.", "And the expansion into new markets which are also not impacted by seasonality that are driving our overall growth for the year. And those would be the continued ramp of new products in our wired business, and I've made in my commentary, there's relative firmness in Wireless. Expansion in the Data Center, continued growth in the expansion opportunities we've developed in automotive. Those are the things that are going to drive us. And like I said, I don't see that kind of expansion impacted significantly by seasonality.", "John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Helpful. Thanks, guys.", "Jon A. Olson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you. Operator, we can take one more question.", "Operator", "Our last question then comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays.", "Christopher Hemmelgarn - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. This is Chris Hemmelgarn on for Blayne. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just had a longer term question about the direction of the auto business and architectures there. I mean, the systems today are kind of a hodgepodge of ASICs and FPGAs, each controlling different functions and you've seen some players lay out a vision that involved more of a centralized control as the market matured. You clearly have long-term engagements with customers. I guess what is the interest you're seeing? Are you still seeing, you know, them desiring discrete chips to drive each of these functions? Or are you seeing an interest in more of a centralized controller?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So we'll give some more depth here, but again this is an emerging set of applications, and there is various ways of skinning the cat. We do think that it won't all end up with one centralized monster processor regardless. Now, there may be more done centrally, or there may be less done centrally, but it won't all be done centrally for a whole host of reasons. In order to enable this distribution, one of the biggest issues is of course the issue of security. And that's where our products, because the security can be built in our products, and embedded in hardware as opposed to software which can more easily be hacked and manipulated. We believe that we have a strong potential advantage as that turns out to be the case. Right?", "But I think this is going to evolve over 10 years, 15 years, right? And this is a long-term transition. And regardless, I don't think that even at the very end it will all be in one place. I think, there will be lots of reasons for it to be distributed over. But for sure for the next two generations of products we don't see anything other than distributed solution.", "Lorenzo Flores - Vice President-Finance & Controller", "Yeah, I think the whole issue with latency and you can't wait for a decision to be made by a processor unit to get information to the driver at essentially real-time speeds. And that's where we excel. And there will be many of those applications that are so critical to getting that information there, that you cannot stand any sort of a latency kind of an issue. And that's where we're finding huge interest even in our more advanced products from customers.", "John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Very helpful. Thank you very much, guys.", "Rick Muscha - Senior Director, Investor Relations, Xilinx, Inc.", "Thanks for joining us today.

Thank you Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.", "Rick Muscha - Senior Director, Investor Relations, Xilinx, Inc.", "Thank you and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO, and Lorenzo Flores, CFO. We'll provide a financial and business review of the June quarter and then we'll open the call for questions. During the quarter, we reclassified our product categories to be consistent with how these categories are analyzed and reviewed internally. Specifically, we are grouping the products manufactured at the 28-nanometer, 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer nodes into a category named Advanced Products, while all other products will be included in the category entitled Core Products. This representation is consistent with what was presented at our recent analyst meeting.", "For comparative purposes, we have provided supplemental information on our website at www.investor.xilinx.com that presents results based on previous classifications. Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available, that actual results may differ materially. We refer you to the documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It could be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.", "Let me now turn the call over to Lorenzo.", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thank you, Rick. In the June quarter, Xilinx sales were $575 million, up 1% sequentially and up 5% on a year-over-year basis. Advanced Products increased 10% sequentially and 60% year-over-year, with 28-nanometer and 20-nanometer products each reaching record sales and 16-nanometer beginning its revenue ramp. As expected, Core Products declined on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Communications increased 4% sequentially with growth from both wired and wireless. Communications has staged a modest, but consistent recovery since bottoming in the June quarter a year ago and is up 22% on a year-over-year basis. Industrial and A&D was down slightly with strength and test measurement and emulation not quite offsetting expected declines in industrial and aerospace and defense.", "Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive was flat on a sequential basis, slightly better than anticipated due to stronger orders from Zynq-driven ADAS applications. Both automotive and test and measurement reached record levels for the company in the June quarter. Gross margin in Q1 was 70.7%, higher than guided due to the mix of customers and products in addition to increased manufacturing efficiencies. We continued to aggressively optimize gross margin across our product portfolio. Operating expense, at $220 million, was in line with our guidance. Operating income for the quarter was $186 million or 32.4%. Other income and expense was an expense of $5 million, as guided.", "The tax rate was 10% for the quarter, better than guided. This included the impact of the early adoption of an accounting standard related to the treatment of stock-based compensation. Our net income for Q1 was $163 million or $0.61 a share. This included a positive $0.02 a share impact associated with the accounting standard I just referenced.", "Operating cash flow was $339 million, driven primarily by strong profitability and a significant reduction in accounts receivable. Diluted shares were $266 million, including $10.5 million from the convertible. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for $100 million and we paid $84 million in dividend.", "Some key points on the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in gross cash and $2.1 billion net cash after our debt. Inventory was $195 million, up $17 million from the prior quarter and down $27 million from the same quarter a year ago. We continued to manage our inventory by balancing levels against expected demand and potential upsides from customers. Accounts receivable declined $90 million to $217 million, reflecting ordering patterns during the quarter.", "Now, turning to our September quarter guidance, we expect revenue to be approximately flat. We enter the quarter with backlog that is down sequentially, but we have forecasted demand from key customers that is not currently reflected in our backlog. As a result, we expect turns for the quarter to be approximately 54%. We expect Advanced Products to continue to grow, with 28-nanometer sales increasing to a new record, 20-nanometer exceeding $40 million and our 16-nanometer UltraScale+ family demonstrating material growth.", "With respect to end markets, Communications and Data Center is expected to decline after four consecutive quarters of growth. An increase in wired business will not completely offset a decrease in wireless sales. Industrial and A&D is expected to grow, driven primarily by strength in test, measurement and emulation along with growth in Aerospace & Defense and ISM. Broadcast, Automotive and Consumer will be flat sequentially.", "Our gross margin will be approximately 70% and our operating expense will be approximately $230 million, including $1 million of amortization. The increase in operating expense is in line with the investment in accelerating our leadership position, as we discussed at our Analyst Day. Other income and expense will be an expense of $4 million and our tax rate is expected to be 14%. Share count is expected to be $266 million.", "Finally, at our Analyst Day in May, we discussed our expectations for 4% to 8% growth in revenue for FY2017 along with gross margins in the 68% to 70% range and the accelerated investment I just mentioned. As we end our first quarter, we believe we are on track on all of these elements.", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you. (7:43) the financial results of the first quarter. We delivered revenue growth which was above the midpoint of our guidance and profitability was very strong. Our overall revenue growth was driven by sales of our Advanced Products, which increased 60% year-over-year and reached a new quarterly record. Overall, this demonstrated the strength of our diversified multi-market portfolio, with five of our eight end markets growing in the quarter.", "Gross margin reached 70.7%, resulting in an operating margin of 32.4%, the highest level in a year. We generated a record level of cash in the quarter, continued to demonstrate a commitment to shareholder return through both dividend and share repurchase. Our exceptional execution on the 28-nanometer, 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer nodes has now delivered three consecutive generations of unquestionable technology leadership. This is a testament to the success of our engineering and operations teams, working in concert with our world-class, industry-leading foundry partner, TSMC.", "The June quarter, for the third quarter in a row, our overall 28-nanometer sales delivered a new record. The overall 28-nanometer sales growth benefited from broad sales contribution from communications, industrial, automotive, test and measurement and consumer. In addition, our Zynq product family, a significant element of our market expansion efforts, reached a new sales record in the June quarter. Overall, 28-nanometer sales, including our Zynq offering, are expected to grow again in the September quarter.", "20-nanometer revenue again reached a record level as sales in the quarter significantly exceeded our $30 million forecast. Virtex UltraScale, the industry's only high-end 20-nanometer product offering, continues to grow at a very significant rate as do sales from our Kintex UltraScale product family. We expect to ship over $40 million of 20-nanometer product in the September quarter. This accelerated 20-nanometer ramp continues to exceed our original expectations.", "At the 16-nanometer node, we have delivered all three UltraScale class product families ahead of schedule. We are already shipping six unique products to well over 100 customers and getting excellent feedback, in particular with regards to its production level quality, further extending our industry lead to well over a year. Consequently, we are accelerating our 16-nanometer tape-out schedules and broadening our offering at this node. This broad 16-nanometer product offering is being designed into applications in all of our major end markets and is enabling more platform-based designs than any previous generation.", "These advanced products are building significant momentum, enabled by four multi-market industry growth drivers: cloud computing, Embedded Vision, Industrial IoT and 5G wireless. In cloud computing, we're in production with three of the largest hyperscale data center consumers with two more in extensive trials. Additionally, we led the formation of the very broad CCIX Consortium with the singular role of bringing a high-performance, open acceleration framework to data centers. We're winning in fast-growing Embedded Vision applications across numerous markets including industrial, aerospace and defense, automotive, broadcast, and consumer. In particular, our ADAS penetration in automotive will reach 85 models this year.", "With regards to Industrial IoT, we're seeing continued success with both Zynq and Zynq UltraScale+ families, securing platform design wins with the largest Tier 1 players. Lastly, in 5G Wireless, we have 90% market share in pre-5G proof of concept deployments and 5G prototyping. We have attained an unprecedented position of strength, opportunity and momentum. This is driven by our exceptional execution, leadership products and customer adoption in the four multi-market drivers which will fuel long-term revenue growth. We are committed to maintaining this leadership while delivering 30% plus operating margin in the long term and continuing our strong commitment to shareholder return.", "Let me now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "The floor is now open for questions. Please limit your questions to one to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone. Our first question comes from the line of Ian Ing.", "Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC", "Yes. Thank you for taking my question. So Intel last week talked about being on track to ship Stratix 10 to customers, some samples this year. Obviously, you already shipped last year. Any thoughts in terms of what the potential share split is given the timing of product in customers' hands? Perhaps some boundaries around the share splits.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We can say that being more than a year ahead is tremendous benefit, having the broadest product offering is a tremendous benefit, having. Having production level material faster than we've ever achieved before is a tremendous benefit and that's why we're investing to exploit the leadership we have. So we have no idea how it will turn out, but this is the strongest position we've ever had over the past three nodes.", "Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC", "Thanks, Moshe.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of David Wong.", "David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks very much. What were your total revenues from Zynq in the quarter and what are currently the biggest end markets for Zynq?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So Zynq, just a second, well, let me start with the end markets for Zynq. The Zynq end markets, I think the showcase end market for Zync is really automotive and ADAS applications. The product is strong in wireless as well in many different applications and is also leading the Industrial IoT platform wins that we have. We think it's a little bit in the, what we call it, as a percent of our total revenue, 8% or so of our total revenue in Zync and continues to grow strongly quarter on quarter and year on year.", "Operator", "And our next question is the line of William Stein.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Great, thanks for taking my question. Moshe, you talked about the CCIX at the Analyst Day and you mentioned it again today. Can you sort of frame the current impact or expected impact of this? Are there products that are relevant to this consortium? Is there any revenue or customer interest? Any details would be helpful.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. So this is a market which today is dominated by Intel's very strong position on the server space. It's a market which is fast emerging; it's expected to be a very large market going forward and the expectation is that it will get split between additional players as competitive products are available from these players. Now these competitive products can come from a variety of architectures. They can come from x86 solutions; they can come from power-based solutions and then they can come from the numerous players who are committed to the ARM architecture. Those additional ones are still to emerge at the performance level which will enable them to penetrate the market.", "CCIX is basically an opportunity which now has been identified by all of these other players as the need to have a common interface standard that all can integrate and support. From our perspective, we did, at the analyst meeting, talk about one product, at least conceptually, which targets this market which will be implemented in 16-nanometer and then will have our traditional all-programmable devices at 16-nanometer and also a whole host of solutions at 7-nanometer that address the market. For us, we believe this has the potential of being several hundred million dollars in the 2020 timeframe. In order to get to that point, it was really essential to have this multi-partner opportunity, open multi-partner opportunity, in order to enable us to participate broadly in it. And so, at this point in time, our revenue in data center does not yet comprehend this opportunity. It's more in traditional storage and networking data center applications. Over the next few years, we expect our business to grow to reflect that. So that's about as much information as I can give at this point in time. I hope it helps.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "That's helpful. If I can get a follow-up, in server acceleration in the data center, there is discussion not only of FPGA being helpful here, but also GPU. And I'm wondering if you view that as a stable competitive environment or if the dynamics there are changing. Thank you.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So as I said, this is an emerging opportunity. And as such, the historic position is clearly led by Intel. And that's driven off their server and high-performance strength. NVIDIA definitely identified several years ago this as an opportunity and they have invested heavily and we believe that there is a host of applications which are served well by a GPU solution. But that is a subset and not a particularly dominant subset of the future applications that will use this. And so we do expect this market which is a large market and will grow rapidly over the next few years to be serviced by numerous solutions from numerous players. GPUs definitely will be one, but they have a whole host of applications where, due to power and a whole host of other issues, they don't provide an optimum solution and programmable logic actually can provide much higher performance per watt per dollar, the most \u2013 the best solution in that regard. And that's why we're talking to all seven major hyperscale players and a few other players too. And we believe that our solution will have value for a whole host of these new applications. Having said that, we expect that GPUs will continue to do well in this market too.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Chris Danely.", "Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, thanks guys. Just a clarification on the yearly guidance. So you're sticking with the guidance provided at the Analyst Day. On the gross margin, could it be 70% for the next couple of quarters? And then on the OpEx, are you still saying that SG&A is going to be flat and that the 7% to 9% growth is all R&D?", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So I'll start backwards. On OpEx, that guidance is essentially true, we can see plus or minus a couple million dollars. But in aggregate, the expense growth is R&D.", "On gross margin, I'm not going to go into specific guidance for the second half. The 68% to 70% range for the year that we provided at the Analyst Day comprehends a few different scenarios about how the actual revenue, product and customer mix would come out. And so I think we're comfortable leaving that range.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Ross Seymore.", "Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi guys. Just a question from the end market side of things in your Communications and Data Center side, out of that 44% of revenues, can you remind us the split between wireless and wireline, and to the extent the wireless side is falling off, how do you view where we are in the wireless market? Obviously a year ago, we had a huge inventory drawdown and then you've grown nicely since then. Is that inventory refill back to a normalized level and will we ship with demand from here forward? And if so, what are your views on demand? Thank you.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So as you look at Communications and you break it down between wired and wireless, what happens is they tend to have different characteristics. Wireless tends to be more choppy. Wired tends to be more gradual in terms of its growth. What we've seen is on the wired side, basically driven by a very strong technology portfolio, that business has been growing now consistently, and in particular, it's being driven by 28-nanometer and 20-nanometer shipments.", "On the wireless side, it is volatile. It had its ebb, its lowest point in the June quarter of last year and since then it has recovered. It's grown by about 40% since that low point. It hasn't gotten back to its peak and we don't necessarily expect it to get back to its peak. Its peak was about 2X higher than its low point. But it's hovering just about in the middle and we expect it to continue to go up and down, but more around this new number, right, as opposed to the low point. And it will be based on deployments. During the past quarter, China was steady, India was up; EMEA was weak. North America was steady; it sort of tends to change from quarter to quarter as the deployments are geographically spread around the world. But we do expect Communications generally to continue to grow. And if you can neutralize the wireless volatility or sort of flatten it out, we do see that the communications market overall, including data center, to be a long-term growth driver for us. Next question, please?", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Vivek Arya.", "Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks for taking my question. And Moshe, thanks for the color around the wireless business. I had one follow-up to that. If you look at your content in a base station today, how does it compare to what you had the year before or the year before that? I understand the volatility in deployments. But over a longer period of time, when I look at the low growth in this Communications business, for not just yourself, but for your competitor as well, has it been a unit issue or has it been a content issue? That yes, units have been volatile, but is it possible that content has not grown at the same pace? And any color around that would be very useful. Thanks.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. So from generation to generation, the level of integration is much higher and the power reduction requirements are becoming more and more significant. And as such, we're seeing a higher level of integration and our customers are moving to the higher end of our product offering. It's still \u2013 it's not the high end. It's not Virtex products, but it's Kintex and Zynq products. And generally speaking, the percentage of the dollar content which is implemented in programmable logic, be it Zynq or be it a non-programmable solution, has gone up from generation to generation.", "What we're seeing \u2013 and so if you look at the numbers, on average, 4G was higher than 3G. Best we can tell, 5G is an incredibly sophisticated requirement with \u2013 and as we are being used in a vast majority of the early deployments, these are not going to be the massive deployments. Those are still three or four years ahead of us. But we're sort of seeing the level of complexity is very high and unquestionably, the level of integration is high. And I would say generally speaking, the average price that we realize has gone up with a significantly higher level of functionality. The volatility is due to markets happening at different rates. In particular, China is very difficult to predict, but I wouldn't say that overall we've seen the dollar content shrink at all. It's gone the other way at this point, per unit.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Tristan Gerra.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Good afternoon. Could you elaborate a little bit on the operational efficiencies and mix? I know you're not providing a gross margin guidance beyond this current quarter. But if you could explain a little bit what's happening in terms of operational efficiencies and whether there is a lasting effect that we can expect beyond this coming quarter.", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Right. So, Tristan, as you know, the gross margin has direct price, direct cost and manufacturing overhead type of components that drive it. And we have a portfolio of customers, a portfolio of end markets. And the customers all take, in those end markets, a portfolio of different products. So what we see across the board is a continued drive toward manufacturing side efficiencies, getting our products at lower costs over time. We see continued price pressure from our customers across the board. And larger customers, obviously assert more price pressure. And we just \u2013 we try to balance that and continue to get the broad savings to manifest themselves in our overall gross margin.", "On the overhead side, that will swing from time to time with different factors and what we're doing with inventory strategies. But in general, we're approaching manufacturing efficiencies there very aggressively as well. So as is common in the semiconductor industry, costs continue to go down, but price pressure continues to increase. And we, again, try to manage that through the broad portfolio that we have.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And just to sort of summarize because Lorenzo gave you all of the data without answering the question, we think the 68% to 70% will continue to be in the foreseeable future where we are. Could we from time to time, as we are now, just rise above that? Yes. But that is neither our target nor do we think that it's a sustainable goal going forward.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Ambrish Srivastava.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hi. Thank you. We talked about Communications. I was wondering if you could talk about the other end markets. And specifically embedded in your guidance, what are the \u2013 how are these end markets behaving versus what you would normally expect if there is any such thing as normal in the semi industry? That would be helpful if you could provide us with some \u2013 extra additional color on the other major end markets. Thank you very much.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. So, Ambrish, we break it down into eight markets overall. And we're very pleased that we hit above the midpoint. But if you look at the growth overall, it was not huge. It was driven by five of the eight markets I think we highlighted, which \u2013 those were in terms of the past product. And it's wired and wireless were up, automotive was up, Consumer was up and test \u2013 yes, test was up quite significantly.", "Going forward, we're looking at flat, right? So there's probably going to be some up and some down. And I can only give you a short-term projection at this point in time. But as you look into the second half of the year, if I had to guess, we do expect Communications to continue to grow slightly. We expect A&D to be flat. We expect Automotive to be up significantly, driven by the large number of design wins we have and we would expect ISM also to get back into a growth mode. So that's the best forecast we can give you for the second half based on what we know now. And just for the upcoming quarter, I think Lorenzo gave some of our prognostication there. Next question, please?", "Operator", "Please limit your questions to one to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone. Our next question is from the line of Anil Doradla.", "Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So Moshe, I think you referred to Zynq contributing about 8% of revenues right now. A little surprised. I thought that would be higher; might be in double digits. Now is this contribution volatile or it's been pretty much in the \u2013 kind of the high single digits over the last couple quarters?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, Anil, I think we were quite clear in the past. If you look at our entire offering, there's several generations that are now contributing, the first generation where there was a Zynq product line was a 28-nanometer and that's providing nearly all of that number. It's driven by three markets, as Lorenzo mentioned: wireless, automotive and industrial market. Of those three, wireless has gone into production; automotive is going into production and should grow very rapidly and the industrial market tends to move quite a bit slower. So that is ahead of us.", "What you will see is as the 28-nanometer grows, then the next growth vector, which is driven by the Zynq product line, will be a 16-nanometer where we have a lot of design wins. You could assume that that will follow a similar pattern to what we've seen at 28-nanometer. So \u2013 and this'll drive our market expansion. It'll just be delayed by three years or four years vis-\u00e0-vis what you saw at the 28-nanometer in terms of its significance. And that's the nature of the businesses we're in. They move at a slow rate. So as it's a new product line with a new role in the customer systems, it has now \u2013 starting to be significant. But in the same way the 28-nanometer took several years to get to where it is now, Zynq, which is a subset of that and was late \u2013 was the last part of the product offering we rolled out is now starting to hit its stride market by market.", "And the next growth in 28-nanometer is going to be in automotive then. By industrial, we actually see a lot of aerospace and defense going forward and then we'll start seeing the 16-nanometer version. Would I like for it to be faster and \u2013 yep, I would. But reality is that's the nature of the business we're in. Hope that answered your question.", "Operator", "Our next question is Romit Shah.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi. This is Kristin Shaka (37:14) in for Romit. So my question is more on the automotive side. Even though we've had some strong results in the automotive semi space so far this earnings season, I think we're still seeing some concern about declining vehicle unit SAAR. Are you seeing any weakening in auto unit demand in the coming quarter or do you think demand is going to hold steady?", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So we are expanding both the footprint we have in terms of the models that include Xilinx-based ADAS systems, and those \u2013 as well as the depth, continuing to move from premium to mid-tier to lower-tier in terms of the offering. So unit growth is going to be less of an impact to us than overall penetration and expansion. That, as Moshe said earlier, will show as significant growth in the automotive business for us through the year.", "Operator", "And our next question...", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of John Pitzer.", "John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Moshe, I kind of want to go back to the gross margins. And given how high your gross margins are, it's a little silly to nitpick. But when I look at the quarter just reported, you would have thought that both by end market and geo, that the mix would have provided actual headwinds to gross margin, you guys actually put up really good numbers. And I understand the long-term target that you talked about of 68% to 70%. I'm just kind of curious as to why that is the long-term target. Do you feel like that's the gross margin level needed to drive your growth aspirations? I'm just kind of arguing, given the value you bring to customers, why shouldn't gross margins migrate up to that sort of low- to mid-70%s range permanently?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You know, you're right, it's a balance between growth and profitability. And we think we are striking the right point here with \u2013 we believe that we can over time generate more gross margin dollars if we stay at this level and not aspire to higher levels. And that's the trade-off that we are striving for at this point in time. And there's very few examples that are sustainable at higher levels that can provide growth. And one of the things we want to do is to deliver the 6% growth on average over the next few years. And so that's what we are targeting at this point in time.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Ian Ing with a follow-up.", "Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC", "Hi, yes. Thank you for a follow-up. Apologize if this was asked, but turns higher in September because key customers are giving you forecasts instead of firm orders. Could you talk more about the applications there and what gives you confidence those forecasts will become orders actually?", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So I won't talk about the specific customers or applications, but we have done extensive work in identifying the additional orders that we expect to come in this quarter to hit our revenue guidance, and we have confidence that those will come in.", "Operator", "And our next question is another follow-up from Chris Danely.", "Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hey. Thanks, guys. So your major competitor was acquired a while ago. I was just wondering if you can maybe give us some perspective on, has anything changed over there? Has it been about as you would have expected, anything different going on across the way?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, we're definitely focused on our execution. What we are seeing is, we seem to be very far ahead. We were far ahead on 28-nanometer, definitely very far ahead on 20-nanometer and we appear to clearly have this one-plus year advantage on 16-nanometer versus their offering. We are pursuing this with gusto. I think that by the end of the year, it will be clearer how Intel will decide to maximize their return on their $17 billion investment.", "And \u2013 but at this point in time, I would say that the \u2013 as I check with our sales force, they appear to be winning based on the very strong technology portfolio, both on the silicon and the software and the IP that we have. And that is a multi-year investment we have made which has come to fruition now. And I believe that most of the success we're seeing now is a result of that as opposed to anything else. I do believe the jury is still out with regards to how Intel will pursue the market long-term. There are various options they have, some of which may make more sense to them than the others.", "But when you look at the customer base, we're seeing customer base becoming more and more interested as there's massive consolidation in the semiconductor industry which everyone, including yourself, have commented on numerous times, the customers are recognizing that they need to align with companies who are around and are committed to perpetuating their model. And that, I believe, has benefited us over the past year as it has become clearer and clearer that we're committed to this business and we're committed to technology leadership. And I think that's the other thing which maybe has changed in the competitive environment is actually the customer's approach is quite different. And that's not only due to Intel, but it's due to other things that have happened in the industry which are highlighting that there are fewer and fewer players who are going to be around to advanced nodes. And Xilinx has demonstrated that it can and will do that. And our increased investment is another proof point that we're going to be there for them. Any more questions?", "Operator", "And our next question is a follow-up from Blayne Curtis.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Lots of calls tonight. I just wanted to follow up back on that, Moshe. Obviously, you can see the timing of your products and it does appear that you have a lead. I guess when you look at the results and you still get them from your competitor, they're growing a little faster year-over-year. And obviously, it's hard \u2013 you have to look at a broader period here. I'm just kind of curious. At this point, 28-nanometer and 20-nanometer should be contributing some outperformance. So you're in the weeds. I'm just kind of curious to hear your perspective as to why that hasn't shown up yet and when do you think you should be able to see some outperformance from this year again?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, Blayne, the numbers \u2013 the competitive numbers are very sparse. There's one number. There's no breakdown. There's lots of things that can be done. There's no understanding if it's new nodes or old nodes, right? And all I can say is we knew \u2013 we've grown our Advanced Products 60% year-over-year. That's 28-nanometer, 20-nanometer, and 16-nanometer. So \u2013 and that's what is happening. The old nodes are now contracting, in the contraction phase. They're contracting at a slower level than they had been in the past, so we think that the headwind from that is going to be slower. And what we're seeing is massive growth of our new technology and massive sets of design wins and very close alignment from the customer.", "So I don't \u2013 I think all of the data which is available is such that indicates that Xilinx continues to do extremely well. And I think it's \u2013 if there was a huge breakdown, we could \u2013 a more detailed breakdown, we could tell, right? But it's like this is great in terms of technology leadership and in terms \u2013 and it's great in terms of revenue growth at these new nodes. And that's what matters for us. So it's going to be more and more difficult to do meaningful comparisons going forward. But we're very comfortable with our position; we're very comfortable with the absolute results we're delivering and we're very comfortable that our market share on new nodes now for three nodes in a row is substantially \u2013 and that is substantially \u2013 above the natural market share in the past. The analysis of that and what the outcome is, is pretty clear.", "Operator", "Please limit your questions to one to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone.", "And at this time, I'm showing no further audio questions. Presenters, I turn it back to you.", "Rick Muscha - Senior Director, Investor Relations, Xilinx, Inc.", "Okay. Well, thanks for joining us today.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.", "Rick Muscha", "Thank you and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Lorenzo Flores, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the September quarter, and then open the call for questions.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially. We refer you to the documents the company files with the SEC including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks.", "These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.", "Let me now turn the call over to Lorenzo.", "Lorenzo Flores", "Thank you, Rick. In the September quarter, Xilinx sales were $579 million, up 1% sequentially and up 10% on a year-over-year basis. Sales for the first six months of the fiscal year were up 7% versus the same period of the prior year. Our advanced products increased 10% sequentially and 61% year-over-year, with 28-nanometer, 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer sales are reaching new records.", "Sales from our 16-nanometer UltraScale+ family were significant and exceeded our expectations. Our sales in the September quarter demonstrated the resilience of our multi-market model, growth in Industrial and A&D and Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive categories more than offset the expected decline in Communications.", "The Industrial and A&D category stood out with strength in test, measurement and emulation, as well as Aerospace & Defense. In fact, sales from test, measurement and emulation reached a record during the quarter. Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive was up slightly, better than expected due primarily to strength from AVB.", "Gross margin in Q2 was 69.6%, lower than guided due to the impact of a licensing agreement with Rambus. Moving forward, the impact of this agreement is expected to be immaterial to our gross margin. Operating expense was $227 million, lower than guided due to lower compensation expenses. Operating income for the quarter was $177 million or 30.5%.", "Other income and expense was an expense of $1 million, lower than guided due primarily to an investment distribution. The tax rate for the quarter was 7%, which included the previously disclosed benefit of $9 million or $0.03 per diluted share related to closure of the audits of fiscal years 2012 through 2014, and a $0.02 per diluted share benefit related to other discrete tax items.", "Our net income for Q2 was $164 million or $0.61 per share. Operating cash flow was $184 million. Diluted shares were 270 million, including 14.8 million from the convertible, higher than guided due to the impact of our higher share price. We repurchased 1.9 million shares for $100 million and we paid $84 million in dividends.", "Now some key points on the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in gross cash and $2.1 billion in net cash after our debt. Inventory was $197 million, approximately flat with the prior quarter and down $16 million from the same quarter a year ago.", "As I turn to our guidance, I would like to refresh the key points of the annual guidance from our Analyst Day in May. At the Analyst Day, we forecasted our revenue growth to be between 4% and 8%, our gross margin to be between 68% and 70%. And our operating expense to be between $930 million and $950 million. Our performance for the first two fiscal quarters, our guidance for Q3 and our expectations for Q4 indicate that we remain centered in the range of the guidance provided at our Analyst meeting.", "In the December quarter, we\u2019re expecting sales to be flat sequentially. Our backlog is slightly down heading into the quarter. We expect advanced products will continue to grow and we are expecting communications to increase with growth in both wireless and wired.", "Industrial and A&D is expected to decline as test and measurement comes off of two consecutive record quarter. Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive is expected to be approximately flat sequentially. Our gross margin will be approximately 69%. For operating expense, we continue to invest in accelerating our leadership position as discussed at our Analyst Day. We expect to see operating expense increase to approximately $245 million with a significant portion of the increase coming from tape-out expenses.", "Our operating expense outlook includes $1 million of amortization. Other income and expense will be an expense of $2 million, and will likely approximate this level again in Q4. Finally, our tax rate is expected to be 14%.", "Now, I\u2019d like to say a few words on our capital allocation strategy. We are confident in our long-term growth strategy and expect to continue to generate healthy cash flows. Note our operating cash flow from year-to-date exceeds $500 million. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same: invest in our business to capitalize on our leadership position and return of capital to our shareholders with a commitment to an increasing dividend over time and through share repurchases.", "With respect to share repurchases, as we previously announced in May of this year, the Xilinx\u2019s Board of Directors increased the repurchase authorization by $1 billion. Our plan is to take a more deliberate approach on share repurchases with the intention of exhausting the $1 billion authorization over the next several quarters.", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you, Lorenzo. I\u2019m very pleased with the financial results of the second quarter. We delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth, resulting in operating profit in excess of 30% for the third consecutive quarter. Our overall revenue growth was, as in the previous quarter, driven by our Advanced Products. These increased again by over 60% year-over-year, delivering yet another significant quarterly record and now account 46% for our total sales.", "Overall, five of our eight end-markets grew in the quarter demonstrating the robustness of our diversified multimarket portfolio. Our unparalleled execution on the 28-, 20- and 60-nanometer nodes has now delivered three consecutive generation of very significant technology leadership. Our world-class partnership with TSMC, the foundry technology and market leader has been key to the success.", "In the September quarter, for the fourth consecutive quarter 28-nanometer sales delivered a new record. 28-nanometer sales growth was enabled by our Zynq product line, which is a significant component of our market expansion efforts. Zynq product sales increased 25% sequentially, driven by automotive, wireless, industrial and consumer applications.", "20-nanometer revenue again reached a record level very significantly exceeding our $40 million target. Sales were driven by strong contributions from our test and measurement, wired and wireless markets. We expect to ship over $50 million of 20-nanometer products in December quarter. 60-nanometer sales grew significantly in the September quarter, similarly exceeding our forecast, while shipping to a broad-base of end markets, including automotive, data center and communications.", "At our Analyst Day in May, we discussed the strategic increase in our R&D investment in fiscal year 2017 to both solidify our leadership position and expand our product portfolio. We recently highlighted two significant accomplishments that demonstrate the early fruits from that investment decision.", "First and foremost, we reached ahead of schedule a critical production milestone with our 16-nanometer UltraScale+ portfolio, further extending our product lead to well beyond the year. We\u2019re already shipping nine unique revenue generating products to approaching 200 active customers. Per Lorenzo\u2019s earlier comment, we expect to deliver multiple production tape-outs in the current quarter to solidify this lead.", "In addition, we announced the expansion of our cost optimized Spartan, Artix and Zynq 28-nanometer product families, targeting a wide range of applications including Embedded Vision and Industrial IoT.", "We recently made two announcements illustrating our significant momentum in cloud computing, another of our key emerging market expansion opportunities. Baidu has adopted Xilinx to accelerate machine learning applications in the data center and will leverage our platforms in their initiatives to develop commercially-viable autonomous cars.", "In addition, the CCIX technology consortium, formed to bring a high-performance open acceleration framework to data centers, tripled its membership, has released the specification to consortium members. We\u2019re uniquely positioned to capitalize on our excellent execution, and innovative and game changing products to both accelerate share gains and drive market expansion.", "We remain committed to maintaining and extending our leadership, while delivering to our long-term operating margin targets of 30% plus, and per Lorenzo\u2019s earlier comments, underlying our commitment to returning cash to shareholders.", "Let me now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Q - John Pitzer", "Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Lorenzo, in your prepared comments, it sounds like you\u2019re still on target to hit that 6% growth guidance for the fiscal year. I hate talking about seasonality, because there\u2019s so much variance around seasonality.", "But given the guide for the December quarter, that kind of implies the March quarter up about 6% versus, seasonal up 3%. I wonder if you guys can just talk about if there is anything specific you\u2019re seeing maybe around the F35 revenue stream or any other sort of new product revenue stream that gives you confidence as you look out that far that that you have that kind of above seasonal growth?", "Lorenzo Flores", "Yeah, so thanks, John. Obviously, as we close this quarter and we go into Q4, we\u2019ll be providing you with more specifics. But I think right now, what we will tell you that underneath our view of Q4, of our fiscal Q4, is a view that communications will be firming and we will see growth in the Industrial and A&D category as well as the Consumer, Automotive and Broadcast category; some for the reasons you\u2019re alluding to, but there is more there than that.", "John Pitzer", "Got it, and then, as my follow-up guys, Moshe, the Baidu announcement was a nice announcement around acceleration. I\u2019m wondering if you can help us understand kind of the opportunity there. Are you sitting next to Intel processors? And then how do we think about the acceleration sort of a growth developing in the near-term, because our thought process was that was perhaps going to be more a 2018, 2019 event relative to the Analyst Day you guys had earlier in the year? It seems like you\u2019re getting some of that earlier.", "Do you expect to see sort of additional follow-on here or is this going to be still something you expect it to mature in the next couple of years instead of the next couple of quarters?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "John, it\u2019s next couple of years, it\u2019s not the next couple of quarters. We believe that this has the potential of being $200 million to $300 million by 2020. And it will have to grow to that number. It\u2019s not going to happen overnight and it won\u2019t happen over the next six months. It\u2019s going to take more than six months just for these devices to go into volume production. So this is a - as most of our businesses, this grows a little faster, but it still will take time and will take several years till it gets to the several hundreds of millions of dollars.", "So the - let\u2019s put it this way, this will not generate the Q4 upswing that you asked about earlier.", "John Pitzer", "Okay. Thanks, guys. Congratulations on the good results.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Sure, thank you.", "Lorenzo Flores", "Thanks, John.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Your line is open.", "Ambrish Srivastava", "Hi, thank you very much. I had a question on the share buyback. And I\u2019m not very clear, to me at least, Lorenzo, what you meant by a more deliberate approach on the buyback. And I have a quick follow-up after that, please.", "Lorenzo Flores", "Sure. So I think we\u2019ve had questions over the past few months after we announced the Board\u2019s authorization of an additional $1 billion in May, about what our plans are. And I think in the past we\u2019ve characterized our approach to share repurchases as opportunistic, which is fairly ambiguous. What we\u2019re trying to communicate is we have the intent to utilize the authorization over - and I chose the word several - next several quarters deliberately to indicate a rather more defined time-span on when we\u2019re going to utilize the authorization.", "Ambrish Srivastava", "Okay. And then a quick follow-up, Moshe, on the nodes, 16-nanometer, where is the difference in this node versus what you\u2019ve seen in the past? And Intel just announced their product and they said that they would be shipping for revenues. So just help us understand kind of where you are in terms of being I think over a year ahead versus them, and then what kind of opportunities does it open for you. And if we\u2019re just going back to the last nodes it\u2019s clear at least to us that it opens up like a 65-35 kind of market share. So any help on the opportunity you\u2019re seeing versus the last node will be great. Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Sure, Ambrish. So we taped it out in June of 2015. It came back in September of 2015. It was in such pristine condition that at that point in time we were able to demonstrate devices working and achieving the specs, which for silicon immediately in the first day is as good as it gets and probably better than nearly everyone else. And we sampled the parts to our customers and we have been shipping them to numerous customers in a whole host of applications. And the feedback we\u2019re getting is between the software, the silicon and IP customers have never seen from anyone anything at this level of functionality.", "And as a result what we have done is we now have nine products that are shipping. And we\u2019re moving into production and part of the bump that is happening this quarter, the current quarter we\u2019re in, in terms of R&D and the quarter after that will be a whole slew of tape-outs, which indicate that we\u2019re going to move into production at an early point.", "So in terms of sampling, we believe we are clearly a year ahead in terms of the maturity of the product and from what we\u2019re hearing from our customers we\u2019re much more than that. And that\u2019s position we\u2019re in, it\u2019s a very enviable position. And that\u2019s why we are increasing our investment to exploit it. Hopefully, that answers your question.", "Ambrish Srivastava", "Yeah, thank you, Moshe. Good luck.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Sure. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is open.", "William Stein", "Great. Thanks for taking my question. Moshe on the automotive side, can you remind us what\u2019s driving that growth today? And then turning to this autonomous driving agreement with Baidu, is that expected to drive Xilinx units in the vehicles, so for scoring or inference? Or is it more on the deep learning side, not so much on the client side?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. So our automotive business historically was more on the entertainment side. And our Zynq product offering was defined specifically to address driver assistance. And that is a huge step towards delivering autonomous vehicles. What is happening now is the part that is growing is the advanced driver assistance. And we actually shared that we expect to have 85 models in production in this year. And we remain on target for delivering those 85 models.", "If you noticed, I had mentioned that quite a bit of our early revenue on 16-nanometer was in automotive and that comes from the second generation of our Zynq product, which is the MPSoC. It\u2019s a more powerful element.", "Now, in parallel to that as being in a pull position for this market, we are working on the next generation, which is the 7-nanometer product. And there, we expect that as the world moves from driver assistance to autonomous driving, we expect it to move in phases. There are question marks with regards to how quickly it will happen. There is a whole host of barriers with regards to safety security and legislation that will modulate and throttle that growth.", "And so, we believe that a lot of the work is being done now and there has been a lot of early deployment. And what we\u2019re seeing is that that market is expanding beyond the traditional suppliers, beyond the tier 1 providers to those suppliers and there is a whole host of new players who are entering the market in addition and are deploying technologies which they have developed for their data center applications.", "And so, we expect this to continue to unfold to be honest over the next 10 years. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to all happen tomorrow. We do think there is going to be lot of proof of concepts and very limited deployments over the next year or two. But we think that the massive volume will actually come in the 7-nanometer in the 2020 and beyond timeframe. And there will be a lot of different approaches. We believe that our technology and our solutions will be relevant to most, if not, all of those target, right.", "And there is quite a bit of fragmentation, there are a lot of different approaches there. But our technology fundamentally should be very viable to address all of those. And our early position with ADAS, gives us good understanding and good relationship to - with the providers to address that market.", "William Stein", "Thanks for the color.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Sure. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Vivek Arya", "Thanks for taking my question. Moshe, this is sort of a longer-term question. The promise of FPGAs has been that there is a very long life to current generation and legacy products. And then you lay around growth from next generation, so certainly your next generation as growing at a very phenomenal pace. But when I look at your legacy or core products they are declining at a mid-teens pace or so. Is that different from what you\u2019ve observed in the past i.e., that the core products are declining faster than they had in the past or am I not looking at this the right way?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "No. You are looking at it right. And those numbers are difficult to argue with. I would say that first quarter effect is, are you winning or you not winning at a certain node. And to be honest, the decline in the old product is because there is two significant generations where we did not do well, right. And if you look at the 40-nanometer, at the high-end we were late, where the product had some issues. And prior to that, there was also a generation, which had its challenges.", "And so as a result that is now declining at a fast rate. The good news is now we have three nodes in a row, that we have had great execution and significant market share. And because it takes a long time, and you are absolutely right in that, it takes time for that to compensate for the old node.", "The good news is once you get to 50%, right, and we are very close to that 50%, then you have a bigger, a much stronger tailwind, and the headwind is diminishing. And so, what you should see is the percentage which has the tailwind is growing now at a faster rate and will soon reach magnitude that it can compensate, and actually more than compensate for the products which are not growing.", "And so your analysis is correct. But I think you need to take that first order impact is, did you have a good node or not have a good node. If you have three good nodes in succession and our recent nodes, then once that gets to 50% of the revenue that should more than compensate for the shrinkage of the old portion.", "Vivek Arya", "Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up, when I look at the growth rate that Intel has given for Altera, I understand that they are not having too many details. But they are saying it\u2019s about similar to what you\u2019re targeting, it is about 6%, right, or so. So is it that it is too early for us to see your share gains at some of these new nodes, because if you have been gaining so much share at 28 and then 16, and at 20-naometers, why isn\u2019t Xilinx growing faster than the growth rate that Intel has mentioned around Altera? Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Yeah. It\u2019s very difficult for me to answer that question. And it\u2019s even more difficult for me to answer it, as they\u2019re part of a very large company with a lot of things going on. And so, what I would say is we believe in the 6%, we need to deliver the 6%, if they deliver 6% or higher, good for them. We need to deliver 6%. All of the published numbers with regards to new nodes show that Xilinx share at 28 is well over 60% at 20 is significantly higher than that, and obviously at 16, 14, right. We are in terms of shipments for revenue we have all of the shipments for revenue at this point and we have over a year lead.", "So I think we\u2019re in a good position and that position has strengthened over the past three generations. And we now believe that that is at the root of enabling us to deliver 6% growth and the comparisons are going to be more difficult in the future.", "Vivek Arya", "Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Sure. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Blayne Curtis", "Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. You mentioned 25% sequential growth in Zynq and you mentioned autos first. Just curious if you could give any primers as to how big auto is getting within that bucket or maybe what that business is growing for the fiscal year?", "Lorenzo Flores", "I\u2019m sorry, Blayne. When you say what that business are you referring to auto or was it\u2026?", "Blayne Curtis", "You said - autos were the first one you mentioned so I was curious if you could give any color as to how big auto is getting within that segment and what that may grow for the fiscal year.", "Lorenzo Flores", "I think last time I got tangled up in the Zynq and the auto. So auto, again the dynamic in auto is we are seeing the decline in the older line business, which is infotainment, and the growth in the ADAS part of the market which is driven by Zynq. In aggregate, the automotive business for us is around 7% or 8% of our overall business. We think that will grow overtime as the ADAS growth rate outpaces the decline in the infotainment part of the business.", "Blayne Curtis", "Got you. And I was just curious, your perspective on the wireless market, a decline in September, but then slight growth. Just curious just - what you think the end-market is doing and whether you\u2019re benefiting from any share gains?", "Lorenzo Flores", "Well, what we see in terms of the end-markets are the customers we have, have been doing relatively well with, I don\u2019t think I would call it strength. I would call it stabilization; in the China market and growth in India, both contributing to our year-over-year growth.", "Now, we had - we\u2019ve said this before, we had a relatively poor year last year in wireless. Again, aggregate though this year we\u2019re expecting the overall segment to grow little less than 10%. But what we\u2019re seeing right now through the year is not unexpected for us, which is it will be up and down throughout the year a few million dollars a quarter. But again getting to a place where we show year-over-year growth.", "So it\u2019s going to be a few million dollars of cycling in and out each quarter. We were down last quarter from Q1. We expect to be up in the third quarter from the second quarter. So that\u2019s not unexpected from what we had looked at for the year in wireless.", "Blayne Curtis", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Christopher Danely", "Hey, thanks guys. Just first a clarification on the share count. So you said, it\u2019s going to be a little more deliberate. I think your shares are basically the same they were five quarters ago. So is the goal to slowly take the share count down or keep it flat overtime?", "Lorenzo Flores", "The share count should go down. I think, if you\u2019re - and Chris, you need to always keep into account when you\u2019re looking at our diluted shares, the impact of the convertible that we have, which will obviously increase the diluted shares if our share price goes up. So overall though, we\u2019re tending to bring the share count down.", "Christopher Danely", "Yeah. Okay, great. And then, just another clarification on the data center opportunity, Moshe, you had a question on Baidu earlier and you said $200 million to $300 million by 2020, is that just Baidu alone or is that total data center?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "No, that\u2019s total data center.", "Christopher Danely", "Okay, great.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "And we already have - we have two in production. We expect to have five in production in a year or two, five of the major seven in production.", "Christopher Danely", "And still on track for the tens of millions of revenue next year?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Yes.", "Christopher Danely", "Great, thanks, guys.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Sure. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "David Wong", "Thanks very much. Can you give us an idea of what your total Zynq revenues in dollars are at the moment?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "We\u2019re [indiscernible] looking it up.", "Lorenzo Flores", "Yeah. I just want to make sure. In aggregate Zynq will be between 6% and 8% of our overall revenue.", "David Wong", "Okay, great. And what functions are the Xilinx chips typically used for in ADAS? And what\u2019s your dollar potential per car?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. So the way to look at it is we just talked about the 8%, right, which is automotive, over 50% of that 8% is in ADAS. And those - right, so let use 5%, right. So we are looking for the year, if you look at our target it\u2019s about $120 million for the year, give or take, which will come from ADAS. So lot more than that if you look at all automotive. And this is spread over 85 models. The devices typically are used at the high-end and mid-range, but now are spreading down. And they are in the tens of dollars per unit.", "David Wong", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Sure. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Your line is open.", "Ian Ing", "Yes. Thank you. Just a question on the gross margin guidance, obviously going to the midpoint of the full year expectation, 69%, it is down 60 basis points sequentially at the midpoint. Mix is slightly less favorable. And the Rambus licensing headwind is going away. So just I\u2019m just trying to understand the trend there to get to that guidance.", "Lorenzo Flores", "Are you talking specifically about Q3, Ian?", "Ian Ing", "Your Q3, yes.", "Lorenzo Flores", "Yeah, so I think, if you look at my end-market discussion, where we talked about communications strengthening, we have a wireless element to that. And the test and measurement part of the business coming off of record-highs. You can rationalize the mix down on gross margin.", "Ian Ing", "Great.", "Lorenzo Flores", "There are other factors obviously, but if you - that\u2019s the most kind of straightforward way to look at it in terms of mix.", "Ian Ing", "Okay, great. And just a question here, obviously, it\u2019s a period of elevated 16-nanometer investments, a lot of new parts in each of the families. I\u2019m just trying to understand, I mean, how confident that you are that each part that is being defined can generate some pretty good ROI? Is each of these parts sort of addressing a specific application in a top customer and do you see almost like tailored parts now in terms of resources?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Yes, the parts are - if you look at the entire family, there are lots of family members. And what we try to do is to make sure that the mix of resources addresses the different needs of each of the market. If we had perfect planning and vision of what the customers really would need as opposed to what they tell us they need, then I would tell us we are doing great.", "Based on our experience you look back and then you find out that some have overachieved and some have underachieved. But we do try to target the different requirements. And sometimes we get it more right and wrong. But it\u2019s not a perfect science and it\u2019s not necessarily because our ability to predict is impaired. The customers\u2019 need tend to change and what we find is that they end up requiring different mix and higher performance et cetera.", "And so, that\u2019s the beauty of our business and that we have this whole range of products. So if we miss it on one, we can typically get it on the larger one, albeit sometimes it comes at a margin cost to address the specific market requirements.", "Ian Ing", "Okay. Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Sure. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is Vinay [ph] calling in for Joe. I wanted to follow up on the Industrials and A&D segment. And can you just talk about now what kind of visibility do you have in that segment? And more importantly, how should we think about the long-term growth trajectory for the different buckets in that segment?", "Lorenzo Flores", "Okay. So this is a really mixed category for us in light of the elements which you\u2019re thereafter. Then in certain cases with very large customers, and large and more public deals like the Joint Strike Fighter in A&D, we have fairly good visibility up until the actual letting of the purchase orders on when you can see the business. But in general, we can map those over time.", "Test and measurement to a large degree, with some customer concentration, we know we\u2019re doing extremely well there based on our leadership products, it\u2019s just unmatched. There is no competition for the capability we bring there. And so we have relatively good visibility to the program health. What we actually can be positively surprised by in that area is the success of our customers, as their platforms win in the market.", "Industrial is a lot of customers for us. And so, what we are typically doing is looking at a few specific opportunities with customers, and then looking at an aggregation on the broader customer base and seeing what we behave there. So each of these actually has relatively strong growth prospects, kind of defined by the markets they serve. Industrial as we said before driven by the Industrial Internet of Things and platform adoption will be broad based and grow, but at the nature of that business is more slowly over time.", "A&D has actually been a relative bright spot for us. We continue to win broadly and designed outside of the Joint Strike Fighter and the Joint Strike Fighter follow-on technology insertions, and so we\u2019re seeing a lot of broader program strength there. In test, measurement and emulation, what you will see is that our leading products would gain share and grow relatively rapidly. And then will be filled in by other elements of that category like semiconductor test business as that broadens our footprint.", "So again it\u2019s a very complex category for us to provide one answer to. Hopefully, I gave you some color.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. From a follow-up I want to talk about 5G, you talked about 5G build starting in 2018 timeframe. But can you provide us an update there in terms of what are you hearing from carriers in terms of roadmap and more importantly, what does that mean for you in terms of content opportunity?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So 5G, the market has changed quite a bit and up to a couple of years ago. It looked like it was going to get pushed out. And definitely the standard is not quite stable and isn\u2019t complete yet. So there is quite a bit of work that still needs to be done to come up with the standard. But what we have seen over the past two years is that all of the major players have shifted to a desire to be first and have significant market share. And we\u2019re seeing them all race.", "And we believe that our 16-nanometer portfolio and our 20-nanometer portfolio is being used in close to 100% of the early prototypes, which are being used to demonstrate the technology.", "What we do expect is that the massive deployment will start in 2020 onward. And that the initial deployments, between now and 2020 are happening and they will - there is various flavors, 4.5, 4.9; there is the whole host of numbers which are being thrown around; pre-5G, 5G prototypes.", "But we are in a good position for all of those, but we can tell just based on technology position, but we do believe that the massive deployment will be 2020 and onward with the combination of programmable devices. And then for some of the companies they will definitely over time design ASICs to address that market. As it stabilizes and as the standards become clearer and the market requirements become clearer. Hopefully, that helps.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Got it. Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Sure. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Ross Seymore", "Hi, guys. I have one question and one housekeeping item as a follow-up. And the main question, pulling the wireless incomes back to a little bit of a near-term timeframe, generally, what gives you confidence both the wireless and the wireline business will grow both in the December and March quarters?", "They\u2019ve been notoriously lumpy over the last couple of years. And so I\u2019m a little surprised that you\u2019re confident in sequential growth in both of those quarters. So any color you could give there would be helpful.", "Lorenzo Flores", "Yeah, I mean, the straightforward answer is on wired we actually have seen the design-wins, that I think we\u2019ve alluded to several times in the past, actually beginning to ramp. Obviously, there is some aggregate macro CapEx uncertainty that could impact that. But underneath what\u2019s going on in the industry that the products we\u2019re in, OTN and GPON, we tend to seeing those ramp with infrastructure build-out internationally and domestically is happening.", "But you\u2019re right, that can be lumpy. And wireless, again, I\u2019ll go back to the answer I said earlier. We have actually visibility into our customers\u2019 demand on us and their view on what they need to build out in particularly in China and in India on 4G and then the pre-5G business that Moshe referenced just a second ago internationally, North America included, that\u2019s what we see.", "Ross Seymore", "Great. And then I guess just a one housekeeping one back to the share repurchase plan that you talked about. Just any color you could give, Lorenzo, on the percentage of the $3.5 billion in gross cash that you have that\u2019s held onshore and what percentage of ongoing free cash flow is generated onshore?", "Lorenzo Flores", "So the way to answer that is of the $3.7 billion of gross cash, about two-thirds of it is categorized as permanently reinvested offshore. But about a third of the total has been deemed tax covered, I guess if you will, for the United States, so approximately two-thirds is available in the U.S. for use without book tax implications. It will be some cash tax implications on about a third of the total.", "Okay, and the mix of it as we generate it overtime, it\u2019s a little dynamic, okay.", "Ross Seymore", "Did you say two-thirds of it was offshore or one third was offshore?", "Lorenzo Flores", "Well, it\u2019s - so there is two-thirds of it offshore, but two-thirds of the total are - so half of that two-thirds, so one third of the total. We have basically provided tax provision for domestic purposes. So we could utilize that without having a U.S. tax book consequence.", "Ross Seymore", "Got it. Thank you.", "Lorenzo Flores", "There is a [little impact for it] [ph], yeah.", "Ross Seymore", "Thank you.", "Lorenzo Flores", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Vinh with Pacific Crest. Your line is open.", "John Vinh", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. As we look at 4G, it appears that we\u2019re in the kind of the latter stages of kind of the rollout here in China. I think most of the operators in China forecasting 4G CapEx down over the next several years. And obviously in mature markets, it\u2019s probably rolled out.", "So as we look forward to 5G, which likely is going to roll out in a few years in 2018, do you think you\u2019ll be able to continue to grow your comps revenues over the next few years or are there other offsets to that?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, 4G indeed has peaked and is no longer growing. But there are still deployments that are happening on 4G. Even in China, there are deployments. There are waves of 4G deployments and they are still going through those. And whenever there are waves you see some growth. On the - India now we are seeing - it\u2019s a smaller market, but we\u2019re seeing - we\u2019ve been fortunate to get the right design wins. And those are being deployed in major way in India.", "Our expectation is that there is a level of densification, which is happening even in 4G, part of which we\u2019re benefitting from. And then, we are already benefitting from the 5G early deployment. But that tends to be not huge volumes, but nonetheless it\u2019s nice revenue for us.", "So we expect - the takeaway on wireless is we expect it to continue to be choppy. What we are seeing is on wired communications that now is growing at the nice rate and that\u2019s where our technology lead - and that tends to be a less volatile market anyway and that\u2019s where the technology leadership, in particular, initially in 20 and now even in 16 is helping grow our business.", "So we do expect communications overall to grow. I don\u2019t expect it to grow as a percentage of our business, generally speaking over the next few years. And it\u2019s been fluctuating between 40% to 45%. And I don\u2019t expect it to grow beyond the 45%. Neither do I expect it to shrink below the 40%.", "And that\u2019s sort of the general elements. And from time-to-time, when there will be massive deployment cycles on wireless, it could sort of push it up, but on average, we don\u2019t expect that to change.", "John Vinh", "Got it, thank you. And my follow-up question is on kind of the Joint Strike Fighter. It seems to be more of a measured ramp this time around versus Phase 1, which was a little bit more lumpy. What is giving you better visibility this time around? And can you talk about kind of the magnitude of the second tranche? And how far through the ramp of Phase 2 are we at this point?", "Lorenzo Flores", "So we have a little bit better visibility. I think we said before, but it bears repeating that for all of the elements of the second cycle or the cycle we are on now, from the technology insertions. We\u2019ve won all the designs available to us. So that\u2019s how we get this visibility. We do expect it, and actually I\u2019m at a loss right now for the aggregate number, but we can get back to you, but the - this is going to be - our view is it\u2019s going to be spread over, let\u2019s call it, 10 years in terms of the buying patterns and the build out.", "And, again, we\u2019ll see actually business from the new technologies. And we\u2019ll also see some of the business from the older technologies in the form of spares, replacements and things like that.", "So our visibility, John, is based on the design wins we have and the discussions we\u2019ve had with the government primes, because they need to tell us when they are going to want them and expect to provide business to us. But it is not concentrated, right. That is the definite difference from what we saw in the last phase.", "John Vinh", "Great. Thank you.", "Lorenzo Flores", "Yeah.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Next question?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Your line is open.", "Steven Smigie", "Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Lorenzo, I was hoping you could clarify a little bit on your color about where you are relative to your target model for fiscal year 2017. It sounded like you were saying you guys are tracking at the midpoint of that range. And I just want to clarify that you are saying you are sort of tracking at the midpoint towards the, say, 6% [ph] and 69%, versus saying, yes, we\u2019re still within that range, though it could be a wide variance within that range of growth.", "Lorenzo Flores", "I think you got it. That\u2019s what I was trying to communicate. Our best view right now is we are in the middle of those ranges.", "Steven Smigie", "Okay, great, thanks. And then with regard to using FPGAs as accelerators, in the last call you talked about the fact that there would be certain workloads where FPGAs would work well versus GPUs. I was hoping you could go into a little bit more detail about what workloads you see you guys are good at and where you are not good. And has that changed over time since you have gotten in there? Have you found, hey, we are better at some of these things than we initially thought?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, it\u2019s a fast emerging market with a lot of excitement and a lot of invention just happening there. And there is a lot of ways of skinning the cat. You can do it through just using a lot of processers. The issue there is the - a lot of the applications tend to be extremely parallel. And then if you try to do it through processers you can only achieve so much, right, and what typically kills you is the power there.", "There is a certain class of applications, which require tremendous amount of floating point and that\u2019s clearly the area, where GPUs have the edge. And Nvidia, in particular, has targeted this market for several years and has established a very good position. And I believe they\u2019re shipping hundreds of millions of dollars. What is clear is that for a whole host of applications, the parallelism inside the FPGAs and, in particular, the fact that it\u2019s dynamically reconfigurable, in other words, you can change the way the programmable logic behaves to adapt to the payloads and what the customer is doing, provides a significant advantage.", "And what we are doing is we are focusing on enabling that target market and those sorts of applications to use programmable logic. The key to enabling them to achieve that is actually to abstract the design, because these - if you look at the seven large players, they are not renowned for having FPGA designers, right? They tend to have a lot of software engineers and system engineers, but no - but very small number of FPGA designers.", "So at this point, the biggest issue is not in the architecture of the programmable logic. It\u2019s actually in enabling the extraction. So the target users can expand. And that\u2019s what we are focusing on. And as we have a whole range of products, which are called our SDx products, system design products, which are targeted to enable that.", "And we believe that those are the key to enabling us to unlocking the potential of the programmable logic. And over the next two to three years, we are going to make tremendous strides to address that and to broaden the set of customers. At this point, we need to do it one by one. And it\u2019s based more on the skill-sets that our customers have, which are limited.", "Steven Smigie", "Great, thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Sure. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Baird. Your line is open.", "Tristan Gerra", "Hi, good afternoon. A quick question on the backlog items for a slight decline. Does that compare with the backlog that you provided a quarter ago, which excluded some customers on which you had good visibility, but were not in the backlog then?", "Lorenzo Flores", "So, Tristan, yes, we are - as I said, our backlog is slightly down. But we are in very, very analogous situation to where we were last quarter, which is - it looked like the turns requirement was greater than average. But we did have specific visibility into the accounts and the deals we were going to get in this quarter. And we are similarly positioned this quarter.", "Tristan Gerra", "Okay. And then kind of a higher-level question. There are obviously some very topical scenes in terms of growth in automotive, artificial intelligence, HPC. And at a high level, can you just give us a refresh on your views on why you think FPGA is a better position for any type of parallel processing application relative to GPU architecture, and in terms of growth outlook for the next few years? And what you think is most promising on the FPGA front?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. So this could, how long do you have?", "Tristan Gerra", "Sorry.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "But, I mean, I\u2019ll try to do it in a couple of minutes which is basically what we have. So at the core of our business is we are a diversified multimarket company. And that actually provides us with significant strength, because markets go up and down. And the fact that we have a lot, shields us from some of that volatility.", "As you look at the eight markets we play in, there is now an emergence of new markets which sometimes are part of existing markets that benefits significantly from the parallelism which is inherent in the programmable logic. And wherever you talk about artificial intelligence and that\u2019s clearly an area which is in vogue now, there probably isn\u2019t any architecture out there which is more parallel than programmable logic and has that ability for reconfiguration.", "So you can architect an ASSP which is very, very parallel. But then it typically isn\u2019t reconfigurable, right. So if the target application changes or the payload changes then you tend to have a mismatch. And so, as you look at these then clearly data center and automotive fall into emerging applications, which benefit for that inherent parallelism.", "And then for each of those you need to have a different approach, but sometimes a similar underlying technology, which is market specific. And if you look at these players, it\u2019s not a total coincidence that the data center companies are now expanding into autonomous driving, right. Because there are technologies which are an extension of what they\u2019re developing that can be deployed there.", "And so, we see these areas as expansion plays for us. We try to be very realistic with regards to the growth of those markets. And we gave the number that for us we expect that these expansion plays, generally speaking, in a five year timeframe will enable us to expand by $500 million, right. And those two markets are two of the major ones. And if you look at our comments on data center for Xilinx for it to be $200 to $300 million market and you can see that we believe that automotive can also be a $200 to $300 million dollar market in that general timeframe.", "Tristan Gerra", "That\u2019s very useful. Thank you.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Sure. Thank you.", "Lorenzo Flores", "Operator, I think we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "All right, thank you. Your final question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Your line is open.", "Romit Shah", "Yes. Thank you. Sorry, I missed this. But what is the motivation for the, I think, you called it a more deliberate share buyback? Thank you.", "Lorenzo Flores", "So like I said, Romit, when we - in May when the Board was considering increasing the authorization part of the discussion, it was obviously how we would use it. And over the course of the last few months we\u2019ve delivered it more on the use of it. Where we are in terms of aggregate cash, gross cash has been about the same since FY 2014. And then looking forward to our ability to invest in the business support the continually growing dividend and have the strategic flexibility around dealing with the debt that we have in FY 2017 - I mean, sorry, in calendar 2017, 2019 and 2021.", "And what then to do in terms of addressing questions we\u2019re getting from our shareholder base in terms of the total capital we have and what our plans for, and our decision was really to be more deliberate about the utilization of the authorization as well as be a little more open in the communication about our plans on doing it. So that we communicate to our shareholders what we are doing and we go off and do it. That\u2019s the broad context of what we did.", "Romit Shah", "Got it, thank you.", "Rick Muscha", "Thanks for joining us today. We will have a playback of this call beginning at 5:00 PM Pacific Time, 8:00 PM Eastern Time today. For a copy of our earnings release, please visit our Investor Relations website. Our next earnings release date for the Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 will be Wednesday, January 25 after the market close.", "We will be attending the following conferences this quarter; the NASDAQ conference in London on November 29; the Credit Suisse Technology Conference in Scottsdale November 30; and the Barclays Global Technology Conference in San Francisco on December 7.

My name is Ian and I'll be your conference operator. I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. Please limit your questions to one to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.", "Rick Muscha - Xilinx, Inc.", "Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO, and Lorenzo Flores, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the March quarter and then we'll open the call for questions.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially. We refer you to documents the company files with the SEC including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.", "This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website. Let me now turn the call over to Lorenzo.", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.", "Thank you, Rick. Sales in the March quarter increased for the sixth consecutive quarter to $609 million, up 4% sequentially and up 7% on a year-over-year basis. Growth was driven by our Advanced Products, which increased 9% sequentially to a new record. Gross margin was 69.5%, at the high end of our guidance, due primarily to favorable end market mix.", "Operating expense was $250 million. This was $6 million higher than guided as we accelerated some 16-nanometer tape-out expenses to extend our technology leadership and add some increased litigation expense. Operating income for the quarter increased 6% sequentially to $173 million or 28.5%.", "Other income and expense was an expense of $2.2 million, better than guided due primarily to investment gains. Tax rate was 10% for the quarter due to discrete item. Our net income for Q4 was $153 million or $0.57 per share.", "We are pleased to have delivered on our financial plan in fiscal 2017. We met our target of 6% revenue growth, driven by a 45% increase in Advanced Products, and operating margin was 30% for the year. This profitability led to the generation of a record $934 million in operating cash flow. Finally, our EPS was $2.32 for the year, a 13% increase over FY 2016.", "Now, some key points on the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $3.4 billion in gross cash and $2 billion in net cash after our debt. Accounts receivables decreased by nearly $100 million, as we collected last quarter's higher than normal receivables balance. Inventory was $227 million, up $21 million from the prior quarter, with nearly all the increase coming from our Advanced Products.", "Operating cash flow was $306 million for the quarter. In the quarter, we paid $82 million in dividends, and we repurchased 1.8 million shares for $108 million, an average price of $58.45. We ended the quarter with diluted shares at 267 million, which included the impact of 15 million shares from the convertible and the warrant associated with it. For a complete explanation of the impact of these instruments on share count, please refer to our convertible FAQ on our Investor Relations website.", "As we have discussed, capital allocation remains a top priority for the company. This year, we returned $855 million to shareholders through $333 million of dividends and $522 million of share repurchases. This total capital return is $90 million more than we returned to shareholders in the prior year.", "Our board recently authorized an increase to our dividend for the 12th consecutive year. We continue to execute on our share repurchase program with the intention of exhausting our $1 billion authorization over the next several quarters. We currently have $680 million left on that authorization.", "Now to guidance. In the June quarter, we are expecting sales to be between $600 million and $630 million. Our backlog is up heading into the quarter, and we are expecting continued growth in our Advanced Products.", "On end markets, we expect the communications category to be up, industrial and A&D categories is expected to be flat sequentially. And, lastly, broadcast, consumer and automotive is expected to be slightly down.", "Our gross margin will be approximately 68% to 70%. We expect operating expense to decline to approximately $242 million, including $1 million of amortization. Other income will be $1 million. Finally, our tax rate is expected to be between 12% and 15%.", "We will provide full year FY 2018 guidance at our upcoming Analyst Meeting in New York City on May 22. We look forward to seeing you all at that meeting. Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Thank you, Lorenzo. I am extremely pleased with our March quarter financial results. Sales increased 4% sequentially to $609 million, marking the sixth consecutive growth quarter. Gross margin was at the high end of our range. The combination of higher sales and higher gross margin drove our strong operating profit growth.", "We continue to benefit from our diversified multimarket portfolio. Five of our eight end markets increased in the quarter. The automotive and test measurement and emulation markets drove the largest incremental sales increases, and both delivered new record revenue levels. Overall, revenue growth continues to be driven by our Advanced Products, which increased 9% on a sequential basis and 45% overall on an annual basis. This category now comprises 49% overall of our revenue.", "28-nanometer product family very significantly surpassed $200 million in the quarter, setting by far a very significant PLD industry record. 20-nanometer generated $60 million in sales, driven by a very broad base of markets. 16-nanometer sales grew significantly in the March quarter to a new record, significantly exceeding our forecast with sales from all of our end markets. Our Zynq SoC platform, which includes both our 28-nanometer and 16-nanometer product offerings, increased nearly 20% sequentially and now represents more than 10% of our overall revenue.", "One of our key 16-nanometer customers is Amazon Web Services. Just last week, AWS announced the general availability of our FPGAs for cloud-based acceleration. Our world-class silicon technology, coupled with our optimized software tools, allow AWS to offer optimizable and programmable hardware acceleration to their users.", "I'm very excited by this because this has the potential to create a new disruptive business model for our technology, where the flexibility of the programmable logic is an inherent benefit over fixed-function ASICs, thereby expanding our reach into a much broader set of customers and applications.", "More broadly, our investment and exceptional execution at the 16-nanometer node has extended our competitive lead to approximately 18 months. We are now shipping 14 unique products to more than 450 discrete customers. This represents a substantial increase from last quarter, where we shipped 12 unique products to 300 customers.", "Additionally, we recently announced a major expansion of the 16-nanometer portfolio with our All Programmable RF SoC product family. This is a disruptive integration and architectural breakthrough to 5G wireless with RF class analog technology. This family provides 50% to 75% power and dramatic footprint reduction, 5G, cable and wireless backhaul applications.", "Lorenzo mentioned we're extremely pleased that we delivered on our commitment of 6% revenue growth for fiscal year 2017. We remain committed to delivering to our longer-term operating margin target of 30% plus.", "Our June quarterly guidance of $600 million to $630 million will again be driven from broad-based growth in our Advanced Products portfolio. As I mentioned before, this is already 49% of our current business, and hence helps drive our overall revenue forward. I look forward to sharing more details on fiscal year 2018 with you at our Analyst Meeting on May 22 in New York.", "Let me now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question is from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thank you very much. And, Lorenzo, good to see the accounts receivable come down. That had caused a lot of consternation last quarter. Moshe, I had a question on inferencing. And I know that the investment case for Xilinx is not just on AI and machine learning, but there has been a lot of talk about it and you guys are showing up as well in the inferencing market. So my question is, help us understand some of the benchmarks. And I don't expect you to get into a blog fest with the existing or potential customer, but Google put out a TPU specs against the GPU against the CPU. Where do the FPGAs stack up? Latency, throughput, anything you are willing and able to share will be very helpful. Thank you.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Okay. Well, I'll do my best. But realistically, we're going to provide a lot more information on this topic on May 22. So I encourage you to look for more detail then. But generally speaking, first and foremost, the most valuable element we have is actually in the flexibility, and that is inherent to the programmable logic, and that is something which is very, very, very difficult to provide in an ASIC. And similarly, it's quite difficult to provide in a similar way at least using a CPU and a GPU. And the importance of flexibility is that even though it sort of sounds like machine learning and inferencing and all of that, we are into the 70th year of hearing about it.", "Reality is it's an emerging technology with very broad applicability where the benchmarks are very dynamic and the ones which are important today are going to be likely totally useless two or three years from now. And the biggest benefit we have is the fact that our devices can be programmed to match the new payloads and new algorithms, right. Now, so that's sort of the generic thing, and I think everyone sort of misses that, and that's why I'm starting with this long semi-diatribe on this issue because that sort of is something that I think the market underestimates the inherent advantage we have there.", "Now, if you sort of look at a specific set of applications, generally speaking, on things which do not require floating point, we tend to have higher performance and lower power than all other options. Now, if you take one fixed application and you target a dedicated ASIC to it, yes, I'm sure they can do better, but then if anything changes then that ASIC all of a sudden becomes a lot less attractive on the new application, whereas the programmable logic can be modified to adapt to that. And so generally speaking, we have much better performance than CPUs and GPUs for everything except floating point for each application and we have performance which is generally on par to a fixed but actually the biggest benefit is in the flexibility of our products and the fact they can be adapted.", "With regards to specific benchmarks we can share the numbers we have with you, and we would be happy to do that. And this is one of the reasons that we're so excited about this market. And if you sort of look at Amazon in addition to the inherent technology advantage we provide, it actually provides us with a perfect conduit to a very broad set of new customers. So both in terms of technology and access to the technology, this is a tremendous benefit for us. And we'll talk a little more about that too. I think I've overstayed my welcome on this.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.", "Rick Muscha - Xilinx, Inc.", "John?", "Operator", "John, your line is open.", "John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Can you guys hear me now?", "Rick Muscha - Xilinx, Inc.", "Yes.", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.", "Yes.", "John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Moshe?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Yes, we can hear you.", "John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Congratulations on the strong results. I guess, Moshe, my question is pretty simple. Up until about two or three months ago, a lot of our field work was suggesting that, while FPGAs were a great architecture for accelerators in the data center, there were still a lot of software compatibility issues. And I guess we've been fairly impressed over the last three or four months how quickly some of those software issues, programmable issues, have been resolved. So I guess my question to you is, relative to three or even six months ago, how is the acceleration opportunity today versus then? At last year's Analyst Day, I think you talked about $250 million of potential incremental revenue by 2020. I wonder if you'd just give us a sense of whether or not relative to those expectations the acceleration market is actually accelerating? And I apologize for the pun.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Okay. So you're right. Last year, at our Analyst Day, we projected it to be between $200 million to 300 million in the calendar year 2020 timeframe. At the time we gave those projections, we were aware of the engagement with Amazon, but we were unaware of what they were planning on doing with it. And so for us, we have lots of customers. And actually all of the big hyperscalers are customers, but they don't always initially share what their plans are.", "What has happened over the past year, and in particular with Amazon, and that became clear only at the tail end of the calendar year, so I think it was November at the very earliest that we sort of found out what it is that they wanted to do. We also detected that in order to make them successful, we needed to prioritize the software environment, which was something we were working on, but was probably at least a year away. We identified that that needed to be raised in terms of priority, and a lot of resource was put in place.", "Now, they've moved very, very quickly. We have been delighted to support them with their very significant requirements, and at the beginning of the calendar year, they actually opened it up to limited release, and the limited release enabled FPGA experts to access the technology. So the technology became available in the cloud, but it was available to a limited set of customers. And when they announced general availability, then that's a much broader set of customers.", "So the change is that Amazon has now legitimized this, is putting it in the cloud. The software, which was clearly a handicap we had, we have invested very heavily and now the results the customers are seeing are very positive, and there's a follow-up release less than a month from now which will even broaden the target customer base even more significantly than it does.", "Now, the underlying question is how much can this do for revenue, and I think it's still too early to predict that. Clearly, the potential is there for it either to be larger or for it to happen a little earlier. It's still unlikely to impact the next 18 months in a significant way, but it is possible that by 2020, if this goes well, that the market could be larger than what we said, and this is for our technology, or it could maybe happen faster in 2019.", "But what we're really trying to do is, we don't want to sort of generate any short-term frostiness because there really is not the proof in terms of deployment to justify that. There is the potential of that happening in a little further-out timeframe than what I think most people are looking at. And so there is goodness and there is goodness in the technology. There is goodness in the opportunity, and there is definitely tremendous potential with Amazon putting this up in the cloud and making it available to everyone broadly.", "And they were very clear. You can look at their blog. They sort of said this is initially being deployed in one location. If that is successful, then the implication there is that there could be significant deployment in other locations, which in of itself would be an accelerator or a potential enhancer of the business. But that first deployment needs to be successful. And obviously both Amazon and Xilinx are working hand in hand to do the best we can to support it.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Tristan Gerra from Robert W. Baird.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hi. Good afternoon. Similar question in the ADAS business. How should we look at this business medium term for Xilinx? You've mentioned a high 20s market share in the past. Do you think that there is a trend where FPGAs can actually gain share against ASIC in that market? And we know the product cycles are very long. And is programmability as critical as it is in the other market that you just discussed?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Well, the programmability and the flexibility is valuable in this market, because this again is a market which is in flux. It is changing rapidly. What we are now deployed in is ADAS. We have a lot of design wins in advanced ADAS. Those put us in a good position to transition into the automated or autonomous driving over time. We think that this is a process which, until it really becomes mainstream and very, very broadly deployed, it has a 10 to a 15-year horizon until that sort of happens. And at that point in time, it wouldn't surprise me if it becomes significantly commoditized.", "But until it gets to that point, we do believe that the programmability is a major asset that we have. And this is a market we identified early, and we think that for the next two generations of deployments over the next five to seven years, we're in a very good position. And our market share should grow a lot of the growth this current quarter in our automotive numbers, which hit a new record were due to a surge in ADAS. And we'll give more data with regards to our overall practical businesses in May, but you can be sure that automotive is likely to be the highest growing or amongst the highest growing markets for our next year projections. Next question, please.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley.", "Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the Zynq being over 10% of revenues. I was kind of excited about that. Can you just talk a little bit about what the drivers are? And you've talked about the number of design wins that you have in Zynq, the mountain of design wins, I think you've referred to it as. Where are we in terms of monetizing that and how much do you think, how long do you think that you can grow at the rate that you have been in that Zynq product?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Well, if you look at the Zynq products offering, it was introduced at the tail end of our 28-nanometer, so I believe the first tape-out was at the end of 2011 for Zynq. And then silicon was probably available a year later, and we got a lot of design wins in three initial markets which it was targeted at were wireless, and it was won a lot of business in wireless. Actually it's at the core of our wireless strategy. Most of the deployment that you're seeing now in wireless at Xilinx or a lot of it is Zynq-based.", "Second area, and this was a major driver for the definition of the product, was automotive, and that's a market that takes quite a bit longer, but is now hitting its stride. And the third is industrial control, and that's where we have the proverbial mountain of design wins, which are now starting to turn to revenue, and that's just a function of how long it takes.", "What we're seeing in parallel is a second generation Zynq that was targeted at the high and mid range of the market at 16-nanometer, but what we've done is we've since taken the 28 nanometer and expanded it down to lower-end devices. So, you can tell from that that we expect it to be a big driver going forward and at 7-nanometer it's going to be part and parcel of a broad deployment in our technology, because we believe that at that point, 7-nanometer, it's going to be an integration play. And nearly all of our customers will use the high-performance multi-CPU cores, which are part of that in their technology.", "So, if you sort of look at it, it's grown from 0% to 10% of our business. And my expectation is that it can grow from 10% to 20% much faster than it took to grow to 10%. And maybe we'll try and quantify how much faster, but it's now no longer a new wonder. And just the repeat business that we can get in of itself should be a major driver in addition to the expansion that we have. And if you go far enough into the future, it's likely that close to 100% of our business over time will be driven by the Zynq product offering. But that's probably 10 years out. That's probably not now.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of C.G. (sic) [C.J.] (27:23) Muse from Evercore.", "C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC", "Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess the question here is you guided comm and data center up sequentially. Curious if you could talk about what you've embedded in the guide for incremental growth from the data center. And then as a quick housekeeping question, if you could offer your outlook for share count for the June quarter. Thanks so much.", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.", "Yeah. So two things. So I might frustrate you by not being very precise. But in the comms, we do show data center. We do expect data center to grow meaningfully. And again that's in the context of some of our older data center business not growing as much as we would like. And in certain cases, our design wins that we've had were slowing down. So we do think that, in summary, that the data center growth, which is part of the overall comms growth, all the end other markets in the comms area we expect to be growing as well, but the data center growth will be driven by hyperscale.", "Then with regard to share count, so I haven't been providing detailed share count guidance for the past couple of quarters for a couple reasons. One is I don't want to kind of signal exactly what we're doing on our buyback. And the second part is, the complexity of the convert and its impact on our diluted share count is hard to describe briefly. So I would though recommend you, CJ, go to our website. We're going to update what we expect to be the impact on diluted share count from the redemption of the convert in this quarter.", "Like I said, it's fairly complex, but we've tried to make it understandable. And you will see that it will have a significant impact in this current fiscal quarter, and then because of the way the accounting is done for the share count, it will actually even translate to a further reduction in the next quarter. So I mean, I will actually, I'm happy to take a follow-up if there's something specifically you were looking for, but I'm not going to give you a precise share count guide.", "C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC", "No, that's very helpful. Thanks so much.", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Thank you. Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of John Vinh from Pacific Crest.", "John N. Vinh - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Question on 5G. I think you guys have talked about your 5G trial win rate at roughly 9% plus. Also if you think about 5G as versus 4G, you've got a 3x to 5x increase in radio heads, which is an area that you historically have done extremely well. And you've also announced the RF SoC, which gives you an opportunity to expand your footprint because it integrates additional discretes. So, I was wondering if you could just put into context, how do we think about the 5G opportunity versus 4G. Right, and conceptually it sounds like a very sizable opportunity, but I'm just wondering if you could also just talk about what are the other offsets that we should be thinking about.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Okay. So great questions, actually. There's a whole series of very detailed questions. So we will try and give you more clarity on that in May, but let me give you Reader's Digest. The broad deployment of 5G is expected to start in earnest in 2020 and we believe we're going to have a very good position there based on the design wins we have. It is indeed quite likely that at least on the radio head side there will be a larger number than was done, you know, than were deployed in 4G. And fundamentally 5G is going to be essential in terms of enabling the infrastructure or a whole host of things which are extremely visible today, like this entire industrial IoT. To do that well, the 5G technology is going to be a key enabler there.", "So we absolutely agree that the potential is larger. Our technology position is very strong. We think that between now and 2020, there is going to be ongoing deployment for 4G, including there is going to be additional rounds even in China, which is now the tail end of I think the fifth round of LTE deployment. And they will do a sixth round that is expected to be about two-thirds of the size of the fifth round, but that's still a very significant number. India is going strong, and there is other countries in the world where there is deployment.", "So if you look at the overall wireless business, we expect it to hover around the mid-point of, for us, our high was close to $150 million a quarter. Our low was $75 million. We expect to hover around the midpoint over the next few years on average until the 5G starts in earnest. Our technology position makes us very confident that during these next two years, all of the pre-5G deployment is likely to benefit us. And then when the real thing starts, then that's when you could see it approaching or maybe even surpassing the previous levels.", "But that's a few years away in terms of hitting over $150 million per quarter. We don't see that happening any time soon. Hope that answers your question, and we'll try and give more visibility into that in May.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of William Stein from SunTrust.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Great. Thanks for taking my question. Moshe, I'm wondering, as we head into the Analyst Day, in order to prepare for it, what should we be thinking about sort of the puts and takes that could take your top line above or below this year's roughly 6% growth?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Well, we'll give you an annual projection. And we're delighted that we have, if you look at one year, we have 100% hit rate in terms of hitting that number. If you look back more than one year, we have a very low hit rate. And we're very proud of actually delivering the 6% on the nose and actually just exceeding that. But we will provide you with guidance.", "I think the thing that gets overlooked and despite the fact that we emphasize it again and again and again is, we benefit immensely from the multimarket portion, and that sort of provides us with a lot less volatility than most other players. And what we'll try to do is to highlight which of these markets are likely to, or have the potential of doing better, which are just likely to hit the natural growth rate and which some of them, for better or for worse are below the growth rate. And we'll sort of highlight those, but there are sort of eight disparate markets and they all tend to have somewhat different dynamics.", "The ones which get the sexiest and get the most air time are data center and automotive, but we're actually doing very well on A&D. We're doing very well on test and measurement. We've done better than most other semiconductor or all other semiconductor companies on wireless, in a time where the wireless industry has not done well. So, I think the under-appreciated part is the multimarket portion. And if I have a request is that you'll come with some openness with regards to hearing about the other markets, even if they're less, have less curb appeal than the ones everyone is talking about.", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.", "That was a very artfully phrased question, too. Good for that.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of David Wong from Wells Fargo.", "David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks very much. Can you give us some idea of what you expect 16-nanometer revenues might be in the current fiscal year, fiscal 2018?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "We will give you guidelines for that in May. It's too early, but it's done great, and a lot of that is driven by the Amazon deployment, but it's not all of it. There's actually, you can just tell from the number of customers in the number of markets we're in that it's doing better. It's actually getting deployed faster than any other technology we have seen in the past and we're also benefiting from a very favorable competitive position.", "David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay, great. And for my follow-up, can you give us any idea of whether you're seeing any pickup in defense, in sales into the defense segment?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Well, there was a nice pickup this quarter.", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.", "It's generally been on an upward trend as design wins that we have, one in our 28-nanometer generation ramp in. As you know, in defense, it's a very, very long-tailed business. So at any point one time, we have multiple generations, multiple of our product generations being sold into the industry. So given our competitive position and strength of design wins and our continued design wins in large opportunities like Joint Strike Fighter, we feel very good about the business.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "It's already the third largest.", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.", "Largest business.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Market we're in, and it's not that far away from wired and wireless. Smaller than wired and wireless, but it's approaching those numbers.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to circle back to the AWS announcement, just kind of the concept of FPGAs as a service, or available in the cloud. And kind of what size of consumers do you think would use this, whether you'd see any larger scale customers deploy it, or is this more for smaller? And then you can you just talk about competitive landscape there, if you expect you'd be the only offering or if you would see any from Altera as well?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "So there's seven big players, and we are talking to all seven of them. The one which has the largest existing deployment is Microsoft, and that is using the Intel slash Altera for that. We believe we have a product which is so much better than that, that obviously that is at the core of our success with all of the players.", "With regards to the breadth of the usage, the beauty of this is, in particular in the Amazon case, is that this enables a broad new set of applications to evolve in a way which the traditional way of pursuing the business was just not capable of doing. And it is inherent to the Amazon model that they don't actually know themselves yet, because they don't have the end system expertise. They're not experts in all of these areas. What they do and what they are experts at monetizing is making it easy to use and making it available and then enabling an amazing ecosystem where the players use it. And what we are seeing and just they talked about thousands of customers applying from the very first minute, several hundreds getting access during the limited release and then being open to the potentially thousands of customers in the general availability.", "Our expectation is as this unfolds, and that's why we're being cagey on providing numbers, right. That's sort of what we're trying to \u2013 we believe this could have a viral impact and not only would it be used in a public cloud sort of applications like Amazon, but when people start seeing the benefits of that, they'll just think that even for their specific applications, they could see huge improvements. And as this transition is happening into a world where machine learning is becoming broadly used for a whole host of applications, that these sort of open up and hence there's huge potential there.", "Also, that's the reason that we are loath to try to quantify it yet. But yet, all of this change is quite a monumental one in terms of accessibility, in terms of ease of use, and the breadth of the benefits and the benefit of the programmability, because there are some misguided notions that an ASIC by definition is better than an FPGA. This is the one set of applications which an ASIC, due to the fact that it takes years to design and it's very rigid, you could do a wonderful job designing absolutely the wrong ASIC, and then deploy it at a time where the market has changed, whereas if you use programmable logic, you can change it in situ, in live applications and it can adapt to these new applications and benchmarks, so hence the benefits.", "The other benefit is that a lot of these applications, in particular on the inference side tend to have more of a integer nature to them as opposed to the traditional floating point applications. And as a result, and it's sometimes it's a flexible integer format that they use, and there is nothing more flexible or better than programmable logic in terms of doing that. So I know I haven't quite answered your question, but I think that's the potential. Lorenzo, also?", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.", "Yeah. So I think an element of your question, Blayne, was maybe related to whether the applications on AWS are kind of nichy or small or whether there's some big entities using it. And the launch partners range obviously from some smaller entities to some very large entities, and they're doing a range of applications that are fundamental to each of the companies in the core businesses. So I do think the scaling opportunity is there and very well represented.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.", "Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi, guys. Just one near-term question. The guidance for the June quarter for industrial, aerospace and defense being flat and then down in the broadcast, consumer and auto segment, could you give a little bit more color about the moving parts in that? And then maybe a slightly longer-term aspect of it, I know you said that automotive would be a fast grower, and you'll give us more details at the Analyst Meeting in May. But the other part of that equation, the broadcast and consumer, has been a bit of a headwind for a couple of years. So I just wondered what the trajectory of that might be over the course of the year. Thanks.", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.", "Yeah. So the industrial A&D softness is due to program-specific things in defense primarily. The rest of the business areas are relatively going to be flat relatively quarter on quarter. In the automotive, consumer, broadcast space, as we've mentioned in this call already, we've set a record in automotive. And if you go back a quarter, we talked about kind of a low based on some inventory things. So we're going to see a little bit of dip in automotive. And by the way, though we expect a longer-term trend upward based on the strength of our ADAS design wins, we won't be surprised by some quarterly fluctuations.", "But underneath that, the ADAS business is very strong. It's just kind of a quarterly correction and the rest of the end markets in that segment are flat. We will probably talk a little bit more in May about longer-term trends in audio/video broadcast, but you're right, the industry is facing some headwinds, and we are feeling those as well.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities.", "Hans C. Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. Hey, Moshe, can you give us your feel for your roadmap as you go from 2016 to 2017 and beyond in terms of process technology? And that is in the context of the update that Intel gave the Street a few weeks ago regarding their roadmap and their density advantages. Thank you.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Well, we're delighted to be with TSMC. It's one of the best decisions I've ever made. Maybe professionally, it's the best decision I've ever made. We don't regret it for one minute. They are great. You know, look at everyone who has tried someone else, including Intel. Great company, great manufacturing technology, great CPU provider. The foundry business is a service business. It requires technology leadership. It requires support. It requires an ecosystem. TSMC is second to none, absolutely second to none.", "I mean, that's sort of really not something I worry about and I'm not in any way understating Intel's capabilities. I'm just sort of saying, as a foundry, I think we're absolutely with the right foundry. What we now uniquely benefit from is, they have such a huge portion of business which comes to them from the wireless smartphones, which in a very, very short period of time enables them to get to incredible defect densities. If you can their investment in capacity, they have for several years now invested $10 billion every year. In terms of access to technology and support technology, in terms of addressing fluctuations, in terms of requirements, they really are best-in-breed.", "So yes, Intel is great, has great manufacturing capacity. TSMC is by far the best foundry in the business, and they didn't get to having $30 billion worth of foundry business without that sort of excellence. So I'm not at all concerned about access to leading-edge technology. I believe that TSMC can provide us with that and has in the past, is now. If you remember, there was a huge excitement when Altera initially committed to Intel, and the common wisdom would be that they're two years ahead of us. I would say now they're comfortably, and this comes from customers, 18 months behind us. Right. So, we will continue to pursue TSMC and benefit from that relationship.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Chris Danely from Citigroup.", "Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hey thanks, guys. Nice job of bringing the OpEx down. Can you just talk about OpEx trends after this quarter?

My name is Sarah, and I will be your conference operator. I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.", "Rick Muscha - Xilinx, Inc.", "Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Lorenzo Flores, CFO. We'll provide a financial and business review of the June quarter, and then we'll open the call for questions.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company.

It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website. Let me now turn the call over to Lorenzo.", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.", "Thank you, Rick, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today.", "Sales in the June quarter increased for the seventh consecutive quarter to $615 million, up 1% sequentially and up 7% on a year-over-year basis. Growth was driven by our Advanced Products, which increased 8% sequentially to a new record. Gross margin was 68.8%, in line with our guidance. Operating expense was $243 million, also as guided. We are executing to the plan we outlined at our Analyst Day in May.", "Operating income for the quarter increased 4% sequentially to $180 million or 29.3% of revenue. The tax rate was 8.2% for the quarter, below our guidance of 10% to 13%, due primarily to a discrete item related to the accounting standard for the treatment of stock-based compensation. Our net income for Q1 was $167 million, or $0.63 per share.", "Some key points on the balance sheet and our cash flows. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in gross cash and $2 billion net cash after our debt. During the quarter, the Company raised $750 million of fixed rate debt at a rate of 2.95% with a seven-year term. We redeemed the remaining balance of $458 million on our convertible debt on June 15.", "Operating cash flow was $191 million. During the quarter, we paid $82 million in dividends, and we repurchased approximately 1 million shares for $67 million, at an average price of $65.09. We continue to execute on our share repurchase program with the intention of exhausting our authorization over the next several quarters. We currently have $615 million remaining on that authorization.", "We ended the quarter with diluted shares at $266 million, which included the impact of 14 million shares from the convertible and the warrant associated with it. Due to the redemption occurring in mid-June, the full impact on share count will be in the September quarter. For a complete explanation of the impact of these instruments on share count, please refer to our convertible FAQ on our Investor Relations website. Inventory was $215 million, down 12 million from the prior quarter.", "On to guidance. In the September quarter, we are expecting sales to be between $605 million and $635 million. We continue to expect growth in our Advanced Products. Regards to end market, we expect the communications category to be down, driven by wireless. Industrial and A&D is expected to be up. And lastly, Broadcast, Consumer and Automotive is expected to be up as well.", "Our gross margin will be approximately 69% to 71%. Consistent with the guidance we provided at our Analyst Day, we expect operating expense to increase to approximately $253 million, including $1 million of amortization. Most of this increase will be in R&D. We continue to invest in both our technology and our customer relationships as we expand our leadership in our markets. Finally, our tax rate is expected to be between 10% and 14%.", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Thank you, Lorenzo.", "I'm very pleased with our ongoing execution as manifested in our June quarter financial result. We delivered our seventh consecutive growth quarter with sales increasing 1% sequentially to $615 million. Operating profit increased to over 29%, reflecting the strength of our business model.", "We continue to benefit from our proven technology leadership of three consecutive node, and its positive implication for our broad multi-market thrust. On the market side, five of our eight end markets increased in the quarter. Special mention is due to our test measurements and emulation business, which delivered record revenue yet again.", "In addition, our broad-based channel business was a very noteworthy area of strength. We're delighted to realize the benefits from our expanded and very focused global relationship with Avnet.", "As has been a recurring pattern, overall revenue growth was driven by our Advanced Products. This increased by 8% sequentially and 33% year-over-year. This category now represents 52% of our overall revenue, significantly up from 49% last quarter and 42% a year ago. As Advanced Products now comprise over half of our business, it will continue to fuel our growth going forward.", "Our 28 nanometer product portfolio sets another significant industry sales record with strong sequential growth from the ISM, TME, broadcast and consumer market. 20 nanometer sales also significantly increased in the quarter, driven by vibrant sales in wireless, primarily for pre-5G deployment.", "The largest surge in the June quarter sales was driven by our 16 nanometer portfolio. We continue to receive consistent customer feedback that our exceptional execution of this node has extended out competitively to over 18 month. We are now shipping 22 unique products to more than 530 discrete customers, representing all end market, a substantial increase from last quarter.", "I'm delighted with the consistent progress we have made in Xilinx's transformation from the premier FPGA company to one addressing a much broader market through uniquely differentiated All Programmable devices. Great manifestation of this transition is the Zynq platform, a very deliberate multi-market expansion play into the SoC space. Our pro Zynq portfolio, which is implemented in both the 28 nanometer and 16 nanometer node, again delivered a new sales record while almost doubling over the past year. In that vein, we recently began customer sampling of our breakthrough 16 nanometer RFSoC family. This highly disruptive product offers an architectural resolution \u2013 revolution of 5G wireless with integrated RF-class analog technology. It provides both 50% to 75% power and dramatic footprint reduction for future 5G deployments, cable and wireless backhaul applications.", "I'm particularly pleased with the Amazon FPGA-as-a-Service F1 deployment that enables cloud-based acceleration. The general access phase targeted for traditional hardware application developers was very successfully launched in mid-April of this year. We're currently working shoulder to shoulder with the AWS team to facilitate the second very significant market expansion phase of this program.", "The expectation is that within a month of unique SDAccel technology will be made available to AWS F1 users and will enable the much larger community of software application developers to derive the benefits of FPGA acceleration.", "Returning to the here and now, our September quarter guidance of $605 million to $635 million will unquestionably be driven from broad-based growth in our Advanced Products portfolio. We remain focused on achieving the fiscal year 2018 revenue target of approximately $2.5 billion. In addition, while we continue to invest in our leading technology and market expansion efforts, we remain committed to delivering 30%-plus operating margin exiting this fiscal year.", "Let me now turn the call back to the operator for questions and answers.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "The floor is now open for questions. Please limit your question to one to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone. Your first question comes from the line of C. J. Muse with Evercore.", "C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC", "Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question. I know it's small part of your business, but one that we're all interested in, the Data Center. Can you provide an update on what you're seeing in FPGA-as-a-Service? And I guess, as part of that, how you're ramping R&D to support that and how we should think about that going forward. Thank you.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Okay. Well, this program, which has been ongoing for over a year and a half with Amazon is now online. And since mid-April, I think it was April 19, it was opened up for general availability. The nature of that is that it really targets the traditional hardware FPGA designers. And that's gotten very good reception, and we worked very closely with Amazon and their design team to enable that. But the real potential for this technology, both in terms of the ubiquitous accessibility of the technology, and the \u2013 broadening the set of users, is to move beyond traditional hardware designers and facilitate for software developers and algorithm developers to use the technology.", "And we have made the technology, which is an abstraction layer or think of it as a wrapper, an abstraction wrapper on top of our hardware technology now available to Amazon, and that's this SDAccel and this is sort of a journey, it's not one set of technologies. But that is, by far, the most significant portion, and we expect that to be rolled out by Amazon within a month or so.", "So, we've developed the technology, we've handed it over to them, and now we're working very closely with them to make sure customers have the best experience possible. As with every new technology, it typically has some teething challenges. And you know this is very advanced technology so it undoubtedly will have that, and we expect to continue to work closely with Amazon over the next six months so that as it broadens its usage, it becomes: A, easier to use; B, has much higher performance and gives the benefit of the parallel processing capability, which is inherent in the FPGA, to the customers so they can use it in their end applications. And everyone's sort of \u2013 I know there's tremendous desire to see this happen overnight, and reality is that this probably will take six months to go through this phase of the software technology deployment and acceptance by the market. And at that point in time, it will clearly have the potential of going viral and expanding in a big way.", "With regards to all of the numbers we've given in terms of engineering investment, they already relate to this becoming the highest priority for the Company. So, all of the numbers that Lorenzo and the team shared back in May in New York are the numbers, and it's been done by our existing engineering resource. But it is clearly an area that we are significantly increasing the investments over what it has been in the past. You shouldn't sort of assume that that will impact the overall engineering investment, right? So, it's an issue of prioritizing the resource.", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.", "And I want to expand just a little bit on one aspect of what Moshe said, C. J., which is the investment we're making is primarily on SDAccel, which is intended to be broadly available technology outside of Amazon as well, right? So, this is a horizontal leveraging play as well for us.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Next question, please?", "Operator", "Okay. Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.", "John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Yeah. Guys, thanks for letting me ask a question. Congratulations on the solid results. I guess, Moshe--", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.", "Hey, John, we're having a hard time hearing you. One second.", "John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Is this any better, guys?", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.", "Yeah, now it's better. Thank you.", "John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Apologies. Moshe, I won't ask about the Data Center opportunity, but I was curious, in your prepared comments, you started talking about some revenue, early revenue for 5G. And so, I guess, I'm just trying to figure out how we should be thinking about the deployment of 5G, both the trial opportunity for you, which is going to start to come, I guess, in a little bit more volume as you exit this year and more so into 2018. And then how you see that 5G opportunity developing when trials eventually move into kind of full deployment in sort of the late 2019, 2020 opportunity. How much revenue do you think you can get out of the trial phase? And then, how do you think about 5G under a full deployment, that revenue opportunity? Thank you.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Okay. Well, we agree that 5G, in terms of real deployment, it's a 2020 onward timeframe. And the expectation is the technology needs in order to support 5G, which is a massive expansion in terms of bandwidth and reduction in terms of latency, all of those \u2013 the hardware requirements are huge. And so, the expectation is that this will be a long rollout, but the overall area under the curve will be larger than it has been in previous generations of technology.", "And we're seeing now a massive race to use our products, and in particular the RFSoC we believe is a very attractive element which should enable us to capture very significant parts of that early deployment. And then over time, what we'd expect is when you move into the later phases, that will be addressed by our 7 nanometer product offering. And so, we expect both of those to be addressed by our technology and in particular by this integration of the mix signal.", "When you look at the overall market, we expect wireless to sort of generally, until 2020, to move sideways, but not at the trough level, somewhere in the middle. And we're sort of seeing this, if you look at our trough and peak levels of wireless, they were \u2013 there's about a 2:1 ratio between the two, and it's now hovering in the middle. And in quarters like the quarter we just reported, actually, wireless went up substantially and was well above that midpoint. And in the current quarter, best we can tell, it's going to go down a little, just below that midpoint. And no, we can't sort of \u2013 that's the nature of this business, we expect it to continue to fluctuate. It's good for us. We expect it to be on average at that level, which is better than most and that's due to the very strong technology position we have.", "And that's probably why you're seeing us do somewhat better than probably other traditional players in this market. But to summarize, we expect it to sort of be, on average, moving sideways until 2020. And from 2020, we expect it to sort of get to the previous peak levels. And when there will be rapid deployment, it could be above the peak level, but it won't sort of stay there the whole time. The area under the curve is very substantial, and it's just, the technology requirements are much larger and the density of the MIMO and all of that is really much higher than it has been in the previous generation.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo.", "David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks so much. Can you give us some idea what percentage of your total revenues Automotive made up and what sort of growth you're seeing there sequentially and year-over-year?", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.", "Yeah. So, our Automotive business is around 7% of our overall business. And it's been driven \u2013 the strength of our Automotive business has been driven primarily by the ADAS applications over the past few years as they've offset the Infotainment legacy business we've had. So, that will be the driver for us in the future.", "Let me just see if I have some sort of year-over-year. You think \u2013 our Automotive business over the past few years has grown from less than 5%, in the order of 4% of our business to where it is today. So, it's been one of the fastest growers in our overall suite of end markets, David.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.", "Vinayak Rao - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hello. This is Vinayak, calling in for Joe. I had a follow-up on your ADAS business. Can you just touch upon the breadth of ADAS applications, where you're seeing traction, as the last diversity of the design wins you have there? And longer term, how do you see your positioning in a full year world (22:01)? Thank you.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "So, this is a market we have invested in for several years now, and both \u2013 and what you're currently seeing in terms of our revenue is largely our 28 nanometer Zynq product offering. And we're seeing it, no \u2013 the numbers we had shared is approaching 100 models in just over 25 manufacturers. And we're seeing that continuing, we're seeing the usages of technology. It's sort of forward looking, backward looking, inward looking, sideways looking. There's a lot of applications where it's being used.", "What we're seeing now is that a lot of the early designs are now transitioning to the second generation of product, which is the MPSoC, it's the 16 nanometer product offering. What we expect to happen and obviously there's a lot of press on this, but these are still really very, very early days, and when you sort of hear about vehicles driving around, they don't really have the level five or anything close to that available. And the expectation is that over the next several years, that will roll out, and we expect this to be a combination of potentially a very powerful central CPU or CPU cluster, and then a whole host of other inputs.", "We are targeting that using our 7 nanometer as the ultimate solution for this market, with more of a focus on the other elements as opposed to the supercomputer at the center of it all. And our expectation is that the market will evolve in a way that because things are unknown, it will take probably until 2030 before it's clear how it's evolving, and we expect to be a significant player addressing that and building on our ADAS leverage. And so, if you sort of look at the ADAS and if you look at our 16 nanometer solution, we already have tremendous investment in things like security, which are essential to this, where we're way ahead everyone else in terms of providing the best security for these solutions.", "And I think you're probably aware that this is one of the biggest concern in this market going forward, because if the cars can be hijacked, that's not a particularly comforting thought, right? And so, we're in the midst of it all, we're continuing to invest the current business that's driven by 28 nanometer, it's now moving. And over the next five years, there will be significant deployment, and we already know the models, in 16 nanometer, the MPSoC solutions where we have a larger role, and then we're working on the 7 nanometer, which will enable us to continue to stay in the game going forward. So, hopefully, that answered your question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Vinh with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "John Vinh - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Hey, Moshe, my question for you is on competition. I was wondering if I could get your updated thoughts on how you're thinking about competition these days. Obviously, since your main competitor has been acquired, it's been no secret that they've really had struggled to execute. You guys have clearly have dominated the last three nodes and even moving forward, it doesn't look like you're going to get a lot of pushback. And I'm wondering, given your success that you're getting in Zynq and embedded SoC, are you starting to see your competition becoming more the ASICs and ASSP players, or are you still see your competition is traditional FPGA? And if your competition is starting to shift a little bit, are there any sort of changes that you need to make to address that?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Okay. Well, that's a great question. And indeed, you're right. And actually this is an ongoing transition which is happening. And as our devices are becoming more and more sophisticated, they're all in the systems exchanging. And whereas in the past, the programmable logic for the FPGAs used to have a relatively well-defined role, but it was more of a auxiliary capability. Now, these All Programmable have very sophisticated SoCs with highly integrated programmable logic of moving to the center of the customer's system. And now, because we're using this technology and it's happening in conjunction with the transition to heterogeneous computing, right, which is people moving beyond the traditional computing models to others where there's a need for parallelism, we have a very good match with a lot of these new applications. And in particular, if you look at machine learning and artificial intelligence, that sort of the killer application which transcends all of these and actually can be very well addressed by our solution.", "As a result of that, we definitely are seeing very different competition. I would say that the market is about 60% in terms of revenue is in our more traditional historic competition, but there are \u2013 actually there's less players in that market, and I'm not only talking about Altera, which is now part of Intel, but you're seeing less and less competition in those markets like A&D, Broadcast and the like. They really are seeing less competition because that's very fragmented, and test and measurement is another example of those.", "And then about 40% what we're seeing, and this is very market specific, we're seeing different competitors. So, if you look at wired, the biggest competitor would be Broadcom and in some case high-end ASICs. And if you look at wireless, it's more ASICs than anything else, and a solution for that is the high level of integration with our RFSoC.", "You look at things like Automotive and Data Center, then what you see is the big semiconductor companies there, and they are addressing it through their SoC-based solutions. And the way we're attacking it is not frontally, it's based on our strengths because we believe that the ability to use the programmable logic as the differentiator is a key element, which is very difficult to duplicate any other way.", "And so, we're addressing those markets there. But it is a very different and competitive map and it was \u2013 it's also one which requires us to invest a lot in ease of use, and that's the biggest knock on our technology in the past whereas it would only work with hardware designers, and a lot of these companies don't even have hardware designers or have very small teams, and that's why the SDAccel and SDSoC products were so important, and those are the things that Lorenzo highlighted.", "The Amazon deployment of this technology not only will benefit our business with the hyper-scalers but actually will enable us to compete on a broader base in all of these markets against other SoC providers.", "Next question, please?", "Operator", "I'm sorry. Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Great. Thanks. Moshe, congrats on the good quarter and outlook, in particular. On the quarter you just posted, the Broadcast, Consumer and Auto end market did very well. I wonder if you can maybe dig into the components there. You gave us a little bit about Auto, but can you talk about the other two sub-segment or sub-end markets there?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Yeah. Both the other two elements of those end markets actually did a little bit better than expected. They're still relatively and, as everybody knows, consumer isn't a focus area of ours, but we're seeing some interesting opportunities develop in certain end market niches there that we're particularly suited for. And so we'll see how that evolves over time. The ABB strength is really I think a cycle, product cycle, where, again, our products are particularly well suited for the evolution of that industry, and so we've seen success there. And we probably will continue our strength there. As Moshe said, we're seeing less intense competition from a traditional sense there.", "And we'll point out, auto was coming off of pretty spectacular record quarter for us last quarter. So, where it is today, we see it continuing to strengthen through the rest of the year. So, again, based on the designs that we have on our 28-nanometer Zynq product line, in particular.", "Does that get to your question, Will? Okay.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Next question, please?", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.", "Next question?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi. This is Ji (33:23) on for Ross. Thanks for letting me ask a question. The growth expected in the Industrial, Aerospace & Defense segment in the September quarter is actually a little bit better than our prior expectations for a flat to slight decline. Can you discuss some of the sub-segments within that IAD segment in the September quarter? And does this imply that fiscal year 2018 growth can be above the prior guidance for 5% to 9% growth year-on-year?", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.", "So let me take the bigger question first, which is, as we go through quarter-to-quarter and as each of our end markets trends through the year, there'll be pluses and minuses throughout the year. So I wouldn't read next quarter's guide as anything on the full year yet. I mean, ideally, all the positives continue, but that's just not the reality. Within the \u2013 each of the end markets for Q2 in the Industrial and A&D space, we actually expect each of them to be growing different degrees. So we see strength across the board.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thank you very much. Moshe, I just wanted to clarify something, and I'm not expecting your AI-related business to grow overnight, but I just wanted to revisit something you said a few quarters ago and are we still on track for that. You had said that by \u2013 exiting fiscal 2018, it could be tens of millions of dollars. And so question, are we on track? And would you need to get additional wins beside the AWS? And also, if you could please highlight any details you could give us on the Baidu announcement that came out a few weeks ago. Thank you.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "So, no, there's seven hyper-scalers, and then there's also two significant systems companies that are very close customers and partners. You can look at our release and you can sort of figure out the people who are in CCIX. CCIX is the protocol which addresses and is targeted at \u2013 particularly, this market addresses this area.", "So, as you look at those, the tens of millions of dollars do not require massive adoption by additional players. It's sort of \u2013 it's based on what we believe and, for better or for worse, this is the way it's panning out, but this is based on the existing business we have with numerous players, which is going to be relatively small, the business with AWS, which I think will carry the bulk of this. And then any of the other players, and we're working with all of the other six hyper-scalers and these two system-level companies who are pursuing these businesses, which is to be cloud-based providers, they're likely to contribute, but not significantly this year, right?", "And that's \u2013 and as they come on and as the AWS potential deployment increases significantly, then that's what sort of enables us to grow beyond these numbers. But there's nothing in those tens of millions of dollars which sort of assumes huge design wins translating to revenue other than the ones that you're sort of aware of. And the Baidu one generally belongs in that other category. We're not counting on it yet for this \u2013 for our fiscal year 2018 numbers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, thanks for taking my question. And actually, if I could just follow up on what you just said, Moshe, on the Data Center. One, curious if you could just level-set us as to just how big that segment is in the June quarter. And then to your comments about the projects that you have, I'm just kind of curious if you can delineate between FPGA-as-a-Service with \u2013 so similar offerings to Amazon versus more direct deployments for internal use such as what Microsoft is doing.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "So those numbers are primarily driven by the Amazon, which is FPGA-as-a-Service. Now, FPGA-as-a-Service is a lot more difficult to do than an internal deployment, which has a very limited usage model. And I'm not implying that that's easy either, but that's a contained challenge.", "Our expectation is that the \u2013 when the benefits of FPGA-as-a-Service, which is an incredibly aggressive move by Amazon, when those start to manifest themselves, they could, in of themselves, lead some of these other players once they see the benefits of that to integrate All Programmable devices into their solutions. And whether they do it as a service or whether they do it to enable their existing business, both would benefit from that.", "But you're right, in the interim, it's the \u2013 FPGA-as-a-Service is the major driver short term. Now, we are working with all of these players on numerous options. And as you have numerous times pointed out, there's four categories of ways to skin the cat. And we believe that our way and the benefits of it are going to be clearer and more obvious over time. And we do expect to see the potential of that to being adopted in some of these other players for their core capability as opposed to just as a service solution. Hopefully, that answered your question, Blayne?", "Operator", "Okay. We have a follow-up question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Dr. Srivastava.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thank you for the extra effort, operator, for pronouncing my name correctly. I had a quick follow-up for Lorenzo. On the turns, seems like on a \u2013 if we just look on a yearly basis, we've gone from 50% to 42%, is there a structural change in the business? We \u2013 I say, \"we grew up thinking PLDs, FPGAs were very high turns business, low visibility.\" Is this a structural change or reflective of the current condition we are in, i.e., visibility has extended maybe artificially because of some tightness in the supply chain?", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.", "So there's a couple of different things driving this. And I do think if you look back and just over the past year, you'll see a fairly big range in terms of the turns we've seen each quarter. A couple of things that \u2013 we are trying to get more orders in the book and make our quarters more predictable. Sometimes it just doesn't happen and customers don't make decisions based on our quarters. So, for the previous two quarters, we had a relatively high book; in the two quarters prior to that in FY 2017, we had a relatively low book. And in each of those cases, we managed to come pretty close to our guidance because we go through a couple layers of effort to understand what else is out there, what's likely to turn, where are consumers at in their decision process.", "So we've seen a range of turns. I think we evaluate that internally. We are trying to get the bookings earlier in the quarter. It helps us with our predictability and it helps actually with our accounts receivable at the end of the quarter. But we can't always get what we want in working with our customers, but we do the rigor in understanding where the business is \u2013 where we think the business is going to come from in any given quarter.", "So, I wouldn't say there's a structural change. I think we are working at obviously the whole optimization of our supply chain through time, but there will still be volatility.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Robert W. Baird.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hi. Good afternoon. You mentioned that you're going to be working with AWS over the next six months to optimize ease of use and performance. Is this ramp purely contingent on the customer ramp timeline at this point, or is there any update to your software, anything implementation related on your side that needs to be finalized first?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Well, it's a joint effort. The technology we have provided that to Amazon and being packaged by Amazon in a way where they have their own deliverables. We continue to \u2013 to the extent they need more help from us, we're very motivated to help them and it is our top priority for that.", "I would say that, in terms of anything profound from us, we've already delivered all of that. The big invention has been done, and now it's being handed over and needs to be productized in a way where Amazon feel comfortable with deploying it broadly. And of course, we'll provide what they need, but we don't know of anything which is a fundamental problem at this point in time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.", "Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have a couple of related questions, I hope you don't mind. On AWS, and the first part is a clarification, to what extent is this based \u2013 the interface going to be solely SDAccel versus like a Vivado interface? That's the first one.", "The second one is, can you talk about what you view as the competitive environment with SDAccel? Are you picking up that your competitor has anything like this?", "And the third one, Moshe, I believe last earnings call, you mentioned that you were not quite \u2013 it was a bit of a surprise, correct me if I'm wrong, but it was a bit of a surprise that you learned kind of late that AWS was working on this. And I was wondering if you had a sense, if any, of the other super seven guys are kind of engaged on this FPGA-as-a-Service also? Thank you very much.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Okay. So, three questions is normally one more than I can remember. So if I might ask you to step in. But the initial deployment, they started the deployment at the beginning of the year, and that was an internal deployment which was just accessible to their hardware design team. The GA, which was on April 19, was a Vivado-oriented deployment. And that again is targeted at customers who have traditional hardware design \u2013 designers. And the new one, which we expect to be rolled out over the next month or so, is the one which has SDAccel. So, you are right, the first one was Vivado. And now, the new one will be SDAccel, targeting software developers.", "With regard to the nine players who are targeting these markets, most of them are not looking at FPGA-as-a-Service and they're actually looking more at providing acceleration capabilities as part of their cloud-based footprint, but to enable their business as opposed to making a business of it. But having said that, there are quite a few who are looking at making a business of it, and I'm not at liberty of saying who is and who isn't. But obviously, Amazon is a tremendous homing beacon for quite a few of these. And some of them have announced capabilities but no one is anywhere close to where Amazon is in terms of the level of deployment.", "And then the middle question...", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.", "Does the competitor have anything like SDAccel?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Does the competitor have anything like SDAccel? I'm sure they're convinced they do. But truth is that this is technology which, at the core, is some unique proprietary synthesis technology, which we believe we're the only people in the world that have that. So we believe that this sort of approach is maybe not limited to us, but we have, by far, the best, the highest likelihood of being successful there.", "That doesn't, to be totally honest, doesn't eliminate them as a competitor because they can try to address it in other ways, which are maybe more limited and maybe don't give the same benefits, but they can sort of try to do that. And I'm sure that that, to the extent that they're interested in pursuing it, that's the most likely way that they will, in which case we will have likely a very strong competitive advantage on that, too. And so that's the third of the three.", "Next question, please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura.", "Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International", "Yes, thanks for letting me ask a question, guys. I just wanted to make sure I understood the math to getting the 30% operating margin by the end of the fiscal year. So, for the current quarter, OpEx is, per guidance, $253 million, which is a little higher than what we are forecasting, but you're also forecasting gross margins to be better, too, I think, at 70%. So, I guess, should we assume that you hold OpEx here at that current level, in the $250-million-plus range? And I guess on slightly higher quarterly revenue, that's how you get to 30%, or is there other dynamics? Thanks a lot.", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.", "So what I tried to describe at our Analyst Day, Romit, was some of the general trends over the year that we were expecting. And on OpEx, we do expect to step, as we've said, this quarter, and then a little step next quarter from tape-out expenses and then have a leveling off or a decline. And concurrent with that, as you have anticipated, our revenue growth throughout the year, that would give us the result that we've been talking about.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.", "Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Yeah. Hi, guys. Just taking a step back, I'm looking at the deep learning and AI on the Data Center side. If you look at the Comm & Data Center segment, are you still sticking with the 1% to 4% year-on-year growth given the trends in the wireless and the Data Center side for fiscal 2018, that is? Thanks.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Yeah. We don't see a reason to change those ranges. For all of the three components we provided two months ago, we believe that they'll end up in those ranges. Now, they probably won't all end up in the middle of the range, some will be higher, some will be lower. But we don't see a reason to modify the range at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna.", "Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Hey, guys, congrats on a solid quarter. For Aerospace, it seems like that's being helped by strong passenger growth year-on-year right now. Do you see kind of a reacceleration in that business? And similarly, for Defense, there are \u2013 some believe there are kind of multiple new global defense cycles beginning. Do you agree with that or do you just kind of see this as steady as she goes?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Well, we \u2013 I would say, we are less dependent on passenger patterns primarily because \u2013 well, there's a few reasons. But, A, it's much broader than planes. We play in a lot of areas. And even when it gets to planes, they don't immediately change the number of planes they are building. That takes years to sort of put the infrastructure in place.", "So, what we are seeing is the latter element that you talked about, which is seeing across the board, not only in North America, but first of all, there's a bigger investment in Aerospace & Defense. And it appears to be just going in that direction. And the budgets are growing and as you know, there's sort of pressure from the U.S. administration on the Europeans to pay a larger portion of the NATO bills, and one of the ways of doing that is by buying more equipment. And I think we're seeing that across the board. And it's difficult for us to predict which way it's going to go, but it doesn't appear to be going away by any stretch.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James.", "Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Yes, good afternoon. Thank you. Just a question on gross margins, which in the guidance is a bit higher than what you indicated in the Analyst Day, what you've shown in the past couple of quarters. Is that mix related? If you could provide some explanation of that and what we should expect going forward. Is what you talked about at the Analyst Day still the right way to think about gross margins going forward?", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.", "Yeah. Again, I'll start with the end and then come back to this current quarter. We're still comfortable with the range that we provided for the year, which is 68% to 70%, we're not changing that as of now.", "For Q2, what you'll see, what we've talked about already, is relative weakness in wireless and relative strength in the Industrial and A&D segment for us, at which that mix shift tends to help our gross margins.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi.", "Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hey, thanks, guys. As I'm near the end, hopefully I can trade in one question for two quick clarifications. Lorenzo, I think you said that R&D or OpEx will be trending down towards the end of the fiscal year, is that true? And should be assume then that OpEx will be down on a year-over-year basis in fiscal 2019? And then, are there any more discrete tax items coming for the rest of the year that you anticipate?", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.", "So, again, I'll kind of start in a different direction. We're not going to give FY 2019 guidance yet. And to clarify on what we said on OpEx for the year, we're showing a step-up this current quarter, primarily driven by R&D. We'll likely see a step-up in the next two quarters. Tape-outs will be a big driver of that, but we're also continuing to invest in supporting the business. And then we will see \u2013 we're likely to see a decline in the fourth quarter as \u2013 again, driven by tape-out expenses not happening. We get through of bulge of them by the third quarter. And like I said, we'll talk about FY 2019 sometime later.", "With respect to discrete items, one of the drivers that I pointed out in my remarks was how we are accounting for excess stock-based compensation. And that's driven by a difference in stock price, current stock price versus historic stock price, really. So we'll see some of that going forward. We haven't sized that yet and we can't size that yet until we actually go through the quarter and see what the stock price does.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie Research.", "Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Thank you. Hi, Moshe, how are you? Just a question, a clarification on the wireless segment, you said it's a little bit weaker in the short term. Could you give us a bit more color by, I guess, China and India, what you're seeing out there? And then you mentioned that 5G won't happen for a couple of years. And as we bounce around these levels for the next couple of years, what's the risk that you could see some ASIC conversions in the existing 4G business, given the maturity of that business?", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "So, let me start with the ASIC conversions. To the extent that they are viable, they already have been done on 4G, right? That's sort of been in production for several years. And I would say you never take your eye off that, but I think most of the important ones with the people with that capacity probably have already happened. So I don't think there's a huge risk on 4G there.", "What I do think is going to happen is there's \u2013 this past quarter, the June quarter, there was a surge, a very significant surge on the wireless business. And the current quarter, the September quarter, we expect it to go down quite a bit. And I expect this sort of volatility to continue over the next few years until 2020, but I don't think that the average business is likely to go away because there are ongoing deployments and there is densification and a whole host of other things which we tend to see, and there's more global deployment still ahead of us there.", "So, on average, we expect it to remain this way. And, yes, indeed, India, which was growing very well, is taking a hiatus and China is currently not in a huge surge in terms of deployment, but we do think that some of these areas will start the pre-5G deployments, and that should help fill things in in addition to additional deployment of the older protocols.", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.", "Operator, I think we could...", "Operator", "Your next...", "Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.", "We'll take \u2013 this will be the last question, Sarah, if that's okay?", "Operator", "Okay. Yes, sir. Thank you. Your next question comes from Ruben Roy with MKM Partners.", "Ruben Roy - MKM Partners LLC", "Hi. Thanks for letting me ask a question at the end here. Moshe, you mentioned something when talking about AWS, it was interesting to me, you were saying that you're working arm in arm or shoulder to shoulder, I guess, with the engineers there. And as you spend more time on that specific program, are you \u2013 I'm wondering if the resources that Xilinx will need to support that type of customer and that type of program are different from traditional FPGA programs and applications. Have you gotten any sense that that might happen?", "And then longer term, as the service is actually being used outside of AWS by end users, does that change kind of your sales process where resource is required to support? I think that's it. Thank you.", "Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.", "Yes. So, generally speaking, I 100% agree with your observation. The challenge is how to do it and how to scale it. And one of the benefits we have is the model which can scale to thousands of customers very effectively. And so what we're doing is \u2013 this is being done through a combination of elements.", "If for every new deployment we'd need to add additional resource, it would not be particularly attractive. Clearly, the level of investment on the Amazon side is a huge one, but that is a singular point. It's about as complex as it can get. And that's why we're so excited because we figure out, if we can make them successful, then this technology and the SDAccel, and there's a whole host of other things that have been in put in place, are going to be applicable to the breadth of our customers and should enable us to support the business and continue to leverage the resources we have.", "And so the answer is it's a combination of things, it's a transition we've been going through for several years. The Amazon is the ultimate in terms of what they are trying to achieve. It's a very different support infrastructure, it's one which is built through collaborative interaction on the Web, and we're figuring out how to support that. But once we have that in place, it should scale for our other customers, and I don't think \u2013 the best we can tell, it doesn't change our business model. But we need to constantly make sure that we address this to facilitate that more efficient support infrastructure.", "Rick Muscha - Xilinx, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks for joining us today.

With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Lorenzo Flores, CFO. We\u2019ll provide a financial and business review of the September quarter, and then we\u2019ll open the call for questions.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company.

It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.", "Let me now turn the call over to Lorenzo.", "Lorenzo Flores", "Thank you, Rick, and hello, everybody.", "Sales in the September quarter increased for the eighth consecutive quarter to $620 million, up 1% sequentially and up 7% on a year-over-year basis. Sales for the first six months of the fiscal year were also up 7% versus the same period of the prior year. Our growth continues to be driven by our advanced products which grew 21% year-over-year, supported by the overall strength of our product portfolio. Gross margin was 70.2%, in line with our guidance.", "Operating expense was $249 million, less than guided as R&D came in slightly lower than expected. Operating income for the quarter increased 2.6% sequentially to $185 million and our operating margin was 29.9%. Tax rate for the quarter was 10% including a discrete item related to the accounting standard for the treatment of stock-based compensation. Our net income for Q2 was $168 million, or $0.65 per share.", "Some key points on the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in gross cash and $1.9 billion net cash after our debt. Operating cash flow was $202 million. We returned $257 million to shareholders during the quarter in the form of $87 million in dividend and the repurchase of approximately 2.6 million shares for $170 million, an average price of $65.04 per share. We continue to execute on our share repurchase program with the intention of exhausting our authorization over the next several quarters. We currently have $445 million remaining on that authorization.", "We ended the quarter with diluted shares of 258.2 million shares, which included the impact of 7.6 million shares from the warrant associated with convertible debt. The convertible note itself had no impact on shares for the quarter, as the note was completely settled in mid June. For a complete explanation of the impact of the outstanding warrants on share count, please refer to our convertible FAQ on our Investor Relations website. With our stock price higher since the time we established our FY18 share count guidance, we are now expecting ending share count in Q4 FY18 to be in the range of 255 million to 260 million shares.", "Now, onto guidance. In the December quarter, we are expecting sales to be between $615 million and $645 million. Our backlog is up significantly heading into the quarter and we expect continued growth in our advanced products. From an end market perspective, we expect industrial and A&D to increase again. Communications is expected to be approximately flat while broadcast, consumer and automotive is expected to decline.", "Our gross margin will be approximately 69% to 71%. We expect operating expense to increase to approximately $260 million, with R&D driving the increase. We continue to invest in both our technology and our customer relationships as we expand our leadership and our markets. Finally, our tax rate is expected to be between 11% and 14%. Our financial performance year-to-date and our guidance for the third quarter indicate to us that we are on track to our annual guidance that we provided at our analyst day.", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you, Lorenzo. I\u2019m pleased with our consistent execution as demonstrated in the September quarter financial results. We delivered our eighth consecutive growth quarter with sales increasing sequentially to $260 million. Our operating profit increased approximately 30%, enabled by gross margin and with slightly better than expected and tightly managed operating expenses.", "We continue to benefit from the combination of our diversified multi-market portfolio coupled with clear technology leadership over the three most recent nodes. Five of our eight end markets increased in the quarter. Our industrial, aerospace and defense primary end market set the new quarterly record with sales of $278 million an increase of 17% from the year ago quarter. The broadcast consumer and automotive segment also delivered significant sequential and year-on-year growth.", "On the product front, our advanced products category delivered record revenue. This category, which already represents 52% of our overall revenue, will continue to be our growth driver in the foreseeable future. Our Zynq SoC platform, critical element of our multimarket expansion effort, delivered another sales record of growing 65% from the year ago quarter. The Zynq SoC platform now comprises 12% of our overall revenue. Expanding on this theme, our industry disrupting RFSoC family targeted at 5G cable and wireless backhaul applications is already shipping to numerous customers.", "20-nanometer sales increased very significantly and also attained the new sales record, driven by strength in multiple end markets. 16-nanometer portfolio continued its accelerated sales ramp, again setting a new record. We\u2019re now shipping 34 unique products to more than 930 broad market based customers. This is a very substantial sequential increase of 50% in the number of unique devices, 75% in the number of customers, both are significant harbinger of future success and demonstrate our technology leadership as noted.", "I\u2019m gratified by the recent significant announcements highlighting our strong customer momentum in cloud computing. This is one of our key medium to long term market expansion opportunities. As projected in our previous earnings release, Amazon Web Services has made a uniquely differentiated SDAccel development environment available to F1 users while also expanding their FPGA as a service F1 deployment to multiple region. In addition, Huawei announced their FPGA as a service instance based on our Virtex UltraScale+ FPGA. Finally, Alibaba, the largest cloud service provider in China recently announced their next generation FPGA as a service F2 and F3 instances, both based on Xilinx technology.", "The significant type of scale customer adoption momentum is enabled by the combination of silicon leadership coupled with advancements we\u2019ve made with improving ease of use. This will enable a much larger community of software and application developers to derive full benefit of FPGA acceleration.", "Finally, as we look forward to the December quarter, our guidance of 615 to 645 is expected to be driven by the accelerated growth of our advanced products portfolio delivered across numerous end markets and all three of its technology components. Achieving the midpoint of this guidance will establish a very significant new sales record for Xilinx. Consequently, we remain confident that we\u2019ll deliver on our fiscal year 2018 revenue target of approximately $2.5 billion. In addition, while we continue to invest in our technology leadership, share gains and market expansion efforts for sustained revenue growth, we remain committed to delivering 30% plus operating margin exiting this fiscal year, as well as preserving our commitment to returning cash to shareholders.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from William Stein from SunTrust.", "William Stein", "Moshe, I\u2019m hoping you can help us sort of align what we hear as very good traction in the early stages of these deep learning projects by the web scale providers on the one hand versus sales coming in a little bit lower than expected in that end market for the quarter, and perhaps some effervescent optimism about that end market? I\u2019m wondering if you can help us sort of think about how we should expect that end market to trend over the next few quarters and beyond.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Actually, sales didn\u2019t come less than expected; they came where they were expected. If you look at communications on a whole, wireless was down but data center business was up. But, we are at the very, very early stages of deployment of this technology. And it takes series of time, typically years from when the deployment starts to when the potential is realized. As such, what we are directing everyone is to $200 million to $300 million in calendar year 2020, and that\u2019s still a plan and we are on plan to deliver that number. It just takes this length of time. The biggest impediment we had was expanding the potential customer base. And programmable logic in the past has been directed only at hardware designers. And in order to make it available to a broader audience, we have developed this SDAccel capability that is now being deployed. That should enable the adopters beyond the traditional existing users of our technology and that will -- that gives us confidence in the potential of achieving the $200 million to $300 million.", "But patience is important on this because it just takes time until it has that viral impact. And the broad acceptance by, by far the biggest things we think is huge stepping stone towards that. And as the -- that together with the SDAccel are the enablers. And over time, we do expect to see this translate into revenue at a faster rate, but we have been very clear with regards to setting expectations as to when that will happen and we continue to project the $200 million to $300 million in the 2020 timeframe. It\u2019s the right thing to plan [ph] at this point.", "William Stein", "One more, if I can, related to the same topic. Investors are seeing some outstanding growth from NVIDIA in GPU for similar applications. Maybe you could give us a very summarized version on how you compete with that technology among the web-scale providers and all the engineers and companies that want to develop AI applications, what\u2019s the sort of pitch for FPGA relative to GPU today?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Sure. So, the biggest historic advantage, and NVIDIA had two significant advantages, one is they recognized this market very early and pursued it several years ago. And as a result of that what they\u2019re seeing now is the fast growth but that similarly to our predictions, it took several years until it manifested itself in revenue. The other advantage they had is that inherently a software -- it\u2019s a software program technology and now we\u2019ve gotten to the point where our technology can be addressed in the same way. The advantages we have largely in the area of providing overtime superior performance in a broad set of applications, typically at lower, significantly lower power point. And over time, we expect that to be important in a broad set of applications. So, that\u2019s the value proposition and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing these deployments that these -- obviously very significant hyper scale companies are one of the biggest issues when you look at these big compute firms is power is the big limiter. And we can provide them with either higher performance in some applications, not in all of them or definitely on a broad basis we can provide similar performance at a much lower power points. And the combination of those two are prevalent and are likely to provide over the next few years the opportunity for growth for us. But that\u2019s the biggest difference is the delivering the software accessibility, which we now have and also catching up, which we\u2019re executing with vigor on that front too.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets.", "Ambrish Srivastava", "I\u2019ll be courteous to my fellow analysts and ask only one question. It may not be your favorite one, Lorenzo, but certainly one of my favorite ones, accounts receivables. Going up two quarters in a row, they went up last I think three or four quarters ago and then you brought them down. But, I\u2019m just looking at Q-over-Q and Y-over-Y, receivables are going up higher than sales, both on Y-over-Y and Q-over-Q comparison. Could you please help us understand why that\u2019s the case?", "Lorenzo Flores", "Sure. I think in general, the same phenomena is happening over the past couple of quarters that happened when we had the relatively high numbers in the past, and that\u2019s just timing of shipments in the quarter. As you may recall, we had a quarter where our receivables got very high; next quarter, we reported very low receivables, and that\u2019s about a year ago. And the key thing we monitor on that is the quality of the credits underneath that, -- are these customers going to pay? And the answer is in general, it\u2019s a very, very, very high rate; we have minimal, negligible write-offs on the receivables. And so, we\u2019re highly confident, this is all collectible and will show up in cash flow. And we\u2019ll see different patterns maybe in the future based on timing of shipments during the quarter. But that\u2019s really all what happens. Shipments in the last months tend to be collected the next month or the first month of the next quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays.", "Blayne Curtis", "Moshe, I was wondering if you could just go back to the com business. You mentioned in the September wireless was down. Just curious what trends you are seeing in wireline. And then, I know visibility has been kind of low for people, just curious your perspective as to when wireline can come back?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, if you look back at the previous quarter, the June one, wireless had a huge surge, and that tends to volatile. And indeed this past quarter, the September one, it trended down quite a bit actually. And our expectation is that wireless in December will go up again, maybe not as high as it was in June, but we should see growth there. Wired, generally speaking has been flattish with somewhat of a downturn, downward trend, it sort of -- not a huge downward trend but it is trending down, and we are not at this point predicting any huge surge; it\u2019s likely to go sideways or maybe continue on a very slow downward trend this coming quarter. If you look at our overall results and Lorenzo broker it down into the three categories, then, our expectation overall is for communications to be flattish and very significant growth on the industrial; and the third market, the broadcast, auto and consumer to be slightly down. And that should net significant upside overall.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Tristan Gerra from Robert W. Baird.", "Tristan Gerra", "Looking at data center, are you seeing interest from anybody for a Xilinx FPGA becoming the first access point in the data center, basically delegating the CPU as a second integral? [Ph] And how big is the opportunity for FPGA to become more of a central point in some data center application in the medium term?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "If it become any time soon, the first one, then my $200 million to $300 million would be ridiculously low number. And so, what is happening is a transition, which is now accelerating in the industry and it\u2019s a transition where CPUs have basically exhausted their ability or have only minimal ability to provide higher performance to these very parallel applications. As a result, there is this transition to heterogeneous architectures, which have a CPU and have other forms of acceleration. GPUs have been pursuing that several years now and now it\u2019s very significant business for the GPU vendors. And programmable logic has emerged as a third alternative. But, we don\u2019t expect it to supplant CPUs totally. And that\u2019s -- but it will provide a very significant enhancement for this heterogeneous computing and will provide an alternative and that it\u2019s not that CPUs will go away but there\u2019ll be a need for less CPUs for some of these applications and they will be replaced by other modes of acceleration in particular programmable logic over time.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Seymore", "Moshe, I wondered if you could just go a little bit into the broadcast consumer and automotive segment. That had a nice pop sequentially. So, could you just describe what that driver was behind that? And then, with the guidance for that to be down a bit in the quarter, I know the automotive is the sexiest part about that. But, could you give us a little more detail on what\u2019s driving that sequential decline as well, please?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, I believe that all three of the sub markets actually grew quarter that we just reported. And we expect automotive actually to continue growing but the other two to shrink somewhat. And overall, it\u2019ll be flattish to slightly down with -- I mean, that\u2019s our current prediction with automotive continuing to grow. And these markets are actually quite desperate, you can call them the other markets to some extent, and they\u2019ve different dynamics, which drive them, automotive what is driving our growth is continued deployment of numerous generations of driver assistance technology and that\u2019s sort of the biggest driver of the technology there. In consumer, it\u2019s a whole plethora of applications, which from time-to-time have surges and we benefitted from one of these surges this past quarter. And broadcast has been doing well but it\u2019s a small market for us and that\u2019s a market which is going through structural change where as a market generally, it\u2019s not growing in a big way and there\u2019s a transition to the cloud in some of the broadcast applications. So, that\u2019s one of the inhibitors to its growth. That\u2019s about as much color as I can share with you at this point.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore.", "C.J. Muse", "I guess the follow-up to Ross\u2019s question on ADAS. I believe this was roughly a 5% business for you guys in fiscal 2017, curious if you think this could be a 10 plus percent business over the next two to three years. And then, specific to today, can you provide an update on customers transitioning to 16-nanometer and how this is impacting both unit demand as well as your ASPs? [Ph]", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So, let me start from the last question, or the last sub question that you asked. We are seeing in ADAS transition from our original Zynq product to our MPSoC, which is the 16-nanometer generation, pickup there has been quite substantial. And quite a lot of the customers are now deploying the second or third generation, which is in 16-nanometer and we expect that to be a big growth driver for us going forward. We do expect this market to provide double-digit growth per year with the potential for that continuing for next few years. And that\u2019s just with the -- for the deployment of ADAS and the new generation of ADAS, and then early versions of automated -- autonomous driving, which will have very powerful, centralized control unit, but then will continue to have a lot of additional auxiliary technology required to implement the solution. And we will likely play significant role in the second part. We are not differing the first ultra-high performance processing portion of it. And so, if you look at the arithmetic, could it get to 10%? Yes, it\u2019s sort of moving that direction but I think it has a few years ahead of it to deliver on that potential.", "Lorenzo Flores", "Just to clarify, C.J., was your question on 16-nanometer related to the broader adoption or just in ADAS?", "C.J. Muse", "It was just within ADAS.", "Lorenzo Flores", "Okay.", "Operator", "And then next question comes from David Wong from Wells Fargo Securities.", "David Wong", "Further on the thoughts products for ADAS. In the future, will there be any specific types of hard course or other specialized types of circuitry that you might want to incorporate in your offerings for ADAS or autonomous driving applications?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "I\u2019ll let Lorenzo, go first because Lorenzo drives much fancier car than I do and that you can take that one for the bank. So, I think he will be more of a true consumer advocate of this. And then, I might add color later.", "Lorenzo Flores", "My car is 10 years old and the driver assistance is in the form of mirrors. But the serious answer to your question, David, is embedded in the products we have today, particularly the Zynq-based SoC products are hard in IPs that are well-targeted to the needs of our customers who are developing ADAS applications, not the least of which our features that enable safety and security at the device level. So, yes, I think we continue to evolve our platforms in that area with -- again, overall, it drives a greater integration of capabilities that really provide that longevity and the platform design for our customers. So that\u2019s the overall view of what\u2019s going in our products that will be suited for ADAS. Moshe, do you want to add anything?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Yes. And specifically, if you look at the MPSoC and I\u2019m tying this to previous question, if you look at that that\u2019s a 16-nanometer product, then there is hardened safety, hardened security, there is hardened [ph] graphics, there is a lot of hardened cords. You just can look at that. A lot of those were added there based on request from our automotive segment, and that will continue to be the trend going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley.", "Joseph Moore", "I guess one clarification, I think you said, Lorenzo, that backlog was up significantly. Is that quarter-on-quarter? And if so, how does this extend backlog and then sort of flattish guidance or slightly up guidance, are you just seeing longer lead times, can you talk about what\u2019s driving that?", "Lorenzo Flores", "So, let me talk. Yes, backlog is up significantly in the quarter. And this actually relates back to Ambrish\u2019s question on AR. We do have an unpredictable, if you will, pattern in any given quarter of what goes in the book, when the customers want to ship. And, we work with our customers obviously to hit their schedules and their requirements and drive our business at the same time. So, there are occasions when we\u2019ll have the book fill up toward the end of the quarter and that kind of carries forward into the next quarter, and that\u2019s the phenomenon we\u2019re seeing. So, no, it\u2019s not a function of lead time or anything structural like that; it\u2019s a timing thing.", "Joseph Moore", "And then, for industrial, you\u2019re obviously growing a lot there. I mean, can you talk a little bit the sustainability of that? And how much of that is sort of the share gains you guys have been talking about, whether it\u2019s Zynq related or process node related, versus just a stronger industrial environment?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "I believe, it\u2019s a combination of the two. And the environment is stronger and we\u2019ve been waiting a long time for this to happen. But now, we had a very, very, very broad set of design wins in industrial, which was Zynq based. And we were getting a little antsy because they were taking a long time to translate into revenue. Good news is that that is happening now, happening very broadly, and it\u2019s where we believe we have a very strong position vis-\u00e0-vis a traditional competition but we\u2019re also seeing fewer and fewer dedicated ASSPs which are targeted this extremely fragmented market. It\u2019s just the market which has built up a lot of very small niches and it\u2019s very difficult to come up with an ASSP that addresses them all. And so, our position there we believe is very strong. And what we\u2019re seeing now is the Zynq design wins, 28-nanometer move to production.", "If you look at Zynq, then the first generation was primarily wireless oriented and there was a lot of that and that\u2019s happened relatively early. Then the second generation, which is continuing now is in driver assistance in automotive. And now, we\u2019re seeing the expansion into a lot of different markets and the industrial also -- aerospace and defense is also, we\u2019re starting to see those translate to revenue now. So, both the markets we believe are doing reasonably well or actually better than they have been in long period of time. And our competitive position is stronger than it has been as this market continues to be very fragmented and there\u2019s less, very targeted ASSPs that can pick off these small niche applications.", "Lorenzo Flores", "Joe, I want to go back to something I actually didn\u2019t address in your question that I picked up, which is you said, a flattish guide. I think I would want to point out that the midpoint of our guide is $630 million, which is meaningfully up from where we are today, so strong backlog is consistent with that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America.", "Vivek Arya", "Moshe, I just wanted to revisit the assumptions underlying the $200 million to $300 million opportunity that you have set out of calendar 2020. Is that opportunity just for Xilinx or do you think that\u2019s for the entire FPGA market? And if it is for all the FPGA makes, then, how does the competitive landscape impact that number? Because even if it may not be all the way there today, surely in the next three years, they can use their incumbency to add more competition in that market. So, any color there would very helpful.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Sure. So, we -- I agree with your observation. When we look at the 200 million to 300 million, this is our number. We expect the overall number for programmable logic to be significantly higher, at least twice as much. Intel does have a very significant design win in this area with Microsoft that\u2019s being very well documented in its public domain information. And this is just starting. And there is seven major hyper scale companies and then there is the two additional ones who are pursuing this with vigor, at least two that we\u2019re involved in, which is Huawei where have the design wind and IBM where we have a very type relationship. So, if you look at our overall position together with the ones we\u2019ve already announced and we\u2019re engaging with all of the others. The 200 to 300 is what we believe we can do in data center in its various forms in that time frame. And the market in of itself we expect to be quite a bit larger than that, at least twice as big. And obviously Intel has its incumbency that is true but we have superior product on the acceleration side. And we believe it will get a significant share of the market based on that. Market overall should be significantly more than that.", "Vivek Arya", "And as a very quick follow-up, maybe for Lorenzo on OpEx growth and I know you\u2019re not providing the guidance for next year yet. But, at what point should we start to see your sales growth do better than OpEx growth? Thank you.", "Lorenzo Flores", "So, you\u2019re right. We have not provided any FY19 guidance yet and we will do that in the course of time. Just on OpEx, I will -- want to repeat something I\u2019ve said in previous calls with respect to the flow this year; we are expecting it to decline in the fourth quarter of this year. We have some local highs here in this current due to take out expenses primarily. So, we expect it to decline in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.", "Toshiya Hari", "I had a follow-up question on your cloud computing business. Last month, at your developer forum, I think in the keynote, the gentleman from the AWS gave a very constructive and positive commentary on your offerings and how they would expand that business going forward? And obviously, from a customer diversification perspective, you have announced couple of partnerships. So, I guess the question is, I appreciate this is going to take a long time, but what would you need to see to gain incremental confidence then for you to raise that long-term number?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "We would need to see broad adoption, and that tends to be viral, so you get the early adopters, we start using it, some of them start seeing superior results. It generates some excitement, and then you start getting more and more of these application developers. And I think, the key metric will be when will we see the next acceleration in the application developer. Realistically that couldn\u2019t happen up to now because it was limited to FPGA designers with SDAccel and all of the additional things we are doing. We now have provided the foundation for that. And expectation is that it will feed upon itself, once they start seeing superior results in terms of acceleration. And so that will be the thing to watch. And I think the fact that you are seeing Huawei and Alibaba within less than a year jumping in and following in Amazon\u2019s footsteps that is a proof that there is a lot of potential here, because you now have three very significant players providing this as a service. Amazon obviously started a year ahead of everyone and is still way ahead of everyone, at this point, but the others are going to pursue them with vigor, as you can tell from their announcement. And the expectation is that the applications, which will benefit from this -- from parallelism, which is inherent and available, and programmable logic will be the driver for expansion of this, both in the cloud and over time in embedded applications too.", "Operator", "Our next question, we will retry the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.", "John Pitzer", "Quickly, Lorenzo, going back to the OpEx and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I thought that this year was going to be a relatively tan [ph] year for tape-outs and that would have been a tailwind for OpEx reductions and what sort of offset that was some of the software development work you needed to go after new application acceleration. One, was that wrong? And I guess, two, on the second side of software OpEx to go after new opportunities. Has that expense peaked or is that something that will continue to grow out over the next couple of quarters and how do we think about OpEx around these new applications?", "Lorenzo Flores", "I think the best way to think about OpEx with respect to those new applications and in general is, go back to the guidance we have provided for the full year, which is going to be between 990 and 1010 millions of dollars for the year in terms of OpEx. Take the guidance I just gave and add to it the first couple of quarters, we are right around $750 million of OpEx for the year. We are going to be -- going to be in our range. We\u2019ve accommodated both the new investments that you talked about with respect to software development and our tape-out schedule. The comment I made around tape-out was explaining why this particular quarter we\u2019re going to see OpEx go up and then go back down in Q4.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "And the current tape outs are due to 16-nanometer going to production and happening faster than we had expected, plus a few additional expansion products like the RFSoC, which was sort of new. And so, it was never expected to be the low tape-out there. And the reason that it\u2019s a high tape-out here is the technology is doing so well or relatively high tape-out, the technology is doing so well and it\u2019s in such pristine condition that we are now rolling out the entire product offering, and that\u2019s why we have 34 unique products already shipping. And that\u2019s been -- you multiple that 34 number by several million dollars for each tape out. That\u2019s sort of an expensive occasion. [Multiple Speakers]", "John Pitzer", "My second question is just a follow-up, Moshe. Last week when TSMC reported, I was a little bit surprised after the first time ever they called out sort of crypto currency ASICs as being a meaningful driver of their business in the quarter. And if you start to look at the breakdown of some of these crypto currency hardware devices, often times you are finding an FPJ sitting next to these ASICs. And so, I\u2019m kind of curious, is this the sizeable market that you guys think about, how big today under what sort of end market category are you putting this or how do we think about the size of this market and I guess importantly the sustainability?", "Lorenzo Flores", "Actually, you\u2019ve framed the question quite well, John in that. So, maybe, we are little too elliptical when we are talking about our -- the strength in our consumer business. We do see -- we do have meaningful business with some of the crypto currency providers, like you said the role our product plays, which is typically a Zynq-based product is as a controller, if you will for these ASIC-based mining platforms. We don\u2019t -- at the same time, we say that we acknowledge this meaningful business in this quarter. We obviously want to see some longevity in that business and breadth of that business before we point it out as a key driver. We are really happy with it right now but we don\u2019t want to get a little bit overheated in talking about the potential for this. We do, as I said, I\u2019ll go back to same words, some longevity in that business and some breadth across multiple customers for that business for us.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Chris Danely from Citigroup. ", "Chris Danely", "On the communications and data center business, how much these days is comp versus data center? And then, where do you expect that to be in say year or two?", "Lorenzo Flores", "As we continue to talk about the nascent state of the data center business, or at least emerging hyper scale data center business. And as you know, Chris, from following us, we\u2019ve always had storage and network-based business in the data center. It\u2019s about the same size as it ever was. The vast majority of the data center, I mean, the communications and data center business is wireless and wired. And then the true data center piece has been around 5%. And that\u2019s again transitioning from the older businesses that we had their into this newer hyper scale data center opportunity.", "Chris Danely", "Any projections for year two?", "Lorenzo Flores", "No, not yet", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, 200 million to 300 million, and it\u2019s not there yet. So, it\u2019s significantly less than that, but that\u2019s the projection.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie Research.", "Srini Pajjuri", "Hi, Moshe, just a question on competitive landscape. It looks like Intel is finally shipping their 14-nanometer part. Just curious as to what you\u2019re seeing out there and which end market, if any do you think that they\u2019ll be more competitive versus less competitive?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, from everything we\u2019re hearing, there continue to substantially issues on performance, power and software. And to the extent that they have shifted with relatively selectively to their very, very largest customers, which makes a lot of sense. We, to contrast, shipping it now, it\u2019s close to a 1,000 customers and we have 34 distinct products and counting, so already shipping. So, we believe that the leadership we have in terms of the breadth of applications that we can support, quality, the lower power, the better service performance are still very significant. And what we\u2019ve heard from customers is that the lead we have in terms of the majority of the technology is a year and a half or more, which is very significant, it\u2019s probably more than we\u2019ve had any point in time in the past. So, not saying they\u2019re not around but so far our breadth and quality are helping us prevail. And if you look at the results on the 16-nanometer, it\u2019s growing at an incredibly fast rate, it\u2019s actually growing much faster than we had expected it to grow, at this point in time. So, we continue to do well with this technology. And we never rest on our laurels as we have a very worthy competitor, but we\u2019re raising to exploit the huge lead we have.", "Srini Pajjuri", "And then, just one clarification, Moshe. I think you said wireless will grow in December quarter. I know it\u2019s a lumpy business but just curious as to what\u2019s driving that growth in December, whether it\u2019s China or India or something? Any color would be helpful.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, we think it\u2019s all of the above. We think that the past quarter was a substantial low quarter -- substantially low quarter. And that what you\u2019re seeing is we saw some inventory reduction at our largest customers and we think that now they\u2019re going to be shipping again based -- and we\u2019ll benefit from their lower levels of inventory which they had built up before, and that should help us across the board but in China and India in particular too. ", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Chris Caso from Raymond James.", "Chris Caso", "My question is on automotive. And I guess what we\u2019ve seen presently in ADAS system, there is generally some content from PGA, some purpose-built silicon and general purpose. As we go forward and that industry matures, what\u2019s the reason that FPGA stays on the board and what\u2019s the reason that that content stays with FPGA and wouldn\u2019t necessarily consumed into ASIC or general purpose?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Okay. That\u2019s the great question. What is happening is this market is evolving very, very, very quickly and much faster than it typically has in the past for traditional automotive. And there is huge race to provide higher content and to address new sets of sensors and things of that nature. And those are evolving very, very rapidly. So, if you look at where we\u2019re seeing success is we are seeing success not with our traditional programmable logic, but actually with our Zynq product line. And as the Zynq think product line is actually very powerful embedded processing, don\u2019t think it\u2019s just this programmable logic; it\u2019s actually a very powerful embedded processor with a lot of hardware built accelerators and tightly linked with programmable logic.", "Now, the value of the programmable logic there is that it enables the customers to have a platform-based solution where they can adapt the platform very quickly to address numerous models and numerous changes. And as this market is evolving very, very quickly and there is new sensors and new algorithms and there is some elements of machine learning which now being integrated into it, then the programmable logic is actually very well-suited medium to address those. So, that\u2019s why we believe that there will -- as it continues evolve rapidly, we can actually provide a fine tuned solution with the control, with a lot of the embedded hardware, accelerators and with the programmable logic. And so, it\u2019s sort of a different from the traditional ways of thinking of programmable logic but it\u2019s just used for prototyping. Here it\u2019s actually -- the Zynq product offering covers huge portion of what the customer requires; the embedded hardware addresses other areas; and then the programmable logic and its flexibility is actually well attuned to rapidly changing market.", "Where I do agree with you is saying 2030, 15 years from now, if the whole market becomes commoditized and doesn\u2019t move, that\u2019s when it is likely to be less advantageous to have these capabilities. But, there is a long way between where we\u2019re now and when it reaches that stable point. And as -- even though there is a tremendous level of excitement on autonomous driving, it\u2019s going to take several years before it becomes the prevalent form of transportation. And that\u2019s likely to take tens of years in reality. And as it evolves over this period of time, it will change, and we are likely to continue to have attractive value proposition for all of the areas which are dynamic.", "Now, just to sort of highlight, so I\u2019m not overselling, we are not addressing the ultra-high performance central processing element, the ones which NVIDIA is pursuing and Intel is likely pursue and potentially other players, we are looking at the rest of the market even when it evolves to autonomous driving; there\u2019s going to be a lot of additional auxiliary functions which we will be very well adaptive.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ruben Roy from MKM Partners.", "Ruben Roy", "Moshe, I had a follow-up on the competitive discussion you were just having a couple of minutes ago. It seems like you are competitor, Intel, has recently increased their focus on 10-nanometer, and it seems a little surprising given the issues, the well-known issues they\u2019re having with 14, the conversation has shifted to 10 at this point. But just wondering from your perspective and now that you have some product in hyper scale data center customers and various new applications. Are you hearing any feedback from customers around acceleration potentially of your own roadmap or how is that all working out?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, we have accelerated 16-nanometer very significantly, and that the significant number tape-outs this year were to move it all into production. That\u2019s where we believe we have the broad leadership at the current nodes. And so, I think we\u2019re in violent agreement with you on that front, as our customers. We are working feverously on our 7-nanometer solution with TSMC. We expect to tape that out next year. And we are very pleased with the progress that TSMC has made. And I was just at their 30-year anniversary and they\u2019re full steam ahead. We are -- very, very, very big mobile customers of sort of standing in line, they are all there and they are targeting their next generation 7-nanometer and we will be immediately after them, taping out our devices and benefiting from the huge learning that that volume will run through the system. So, in this business, if you ever stand still, you are likely to have the tortoise and hare scenarios. So, we are running as quickly as we can to make sure that we continue to exploit our leadership and prolong it into the next generation. For us that is taping out next year and it is going to be a phenomenally attractive generation of technology.", "Ruben Roy", "Just a very quick follow-up, just point of clarification on the commentary on data center and percentage of revenue et cetera. When we think about traditional products that you are selling into whether it\u2019s networking, storage et cetera. How do you think about that? Is that sort of a steady state type of business that\u2019s going to grow at low single digit percentage type of growth rates? And the new stuff is really just starting out from a very small numbers today, obviously with the expectations for fast growth or as the traditional stuff sort of maturing in and following off while the new stuff comes up?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Well, that entire industry is going through a transition and significant portions of it are getting cloudified. And when they get cloudified, there is opportunities on the networking and storage as well as the acceleration side. So, what we expect to see is portions of what we called wired communications, reemerge as our data center business but they will still be used for storage and networking. And it\u2019s sort of somewhat similar with regards to the technology requirement. So, that\u2019s likely to be a significant transition for us. But, it will probably offset each other without having tremendous impact either away.", "The growth area is acceleration and the acceleration is the growth area because it really provides an alternative to the traditional CPU computing. So, I think your read is correct that the transition is happening and the classification is going to change and to some extent, it might at some point become a little more difficult to figure out what is wired business and what is data center business. And at this point, we look at them as adjacent and transitioning from one to the other, but the technology requirements are similar on the networking and storage side, and they are unique and different on the acceleration side. And that\u2019s the growth opportunity. So, hopefully that provides some color to your question.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho.", "Vijay Rakesh", "I was just wondering when you look at, you talked about incenting [ph] and how you see Intel performing down the road. Have you seen NVIDIA coming into incenting market as well? And today the GPUs are probably bit tied but do you see them being a viable competitor in that market too?", "Moshe Gavrielov", "They are definitely focused on influence too [ph] and they are coming out with new versions of their technology, which are quite departure from their traditional GPU architectures. And if you blur your eyes, they actually look a lot like more technology that we have, a much better match for than the traditional GPUs. And I think what they are doing makes sense. They have a good position and good starting point. But for broad applications and influencing, different architectures than traditional GPUs or GPU derivatives are required. And as you look at some of their new solutions, they actually are moving in that direction. And we believe we are ahead of them in the flexibility we can provide actually as the advantage, the inherent advantage we will continue to have over time.", "Rick Muscha", "Okay.

My name is Victoria and I will be your conference operator. I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.", "Rick Muscha", "Thank you and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Lorenzo Flores, CFO and Victor Peng, COO. We'll provide a financial and business review of the December quarter, and then we'll open the call for questions.", "Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and actual results may differ materially. We refer you to documents the Company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks.

It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.", "Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thank you, Rick. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining what is my 41st and final Xilinx earnings call. Been a great privilege to have lead Xilinx over the past 10 years. Needless to say I'm extremely proud what the Xilinx team has accomplished. On the business side, we're questionably on the very consistent growth trajectory having just delivered our ninth straight revenue growth quarter while attaining a 30% operating margin target. In addition, we're quite confident that we'll make it 10 in a row potentially exceed our revenue target of $2.5 billion of this fiscal year.", "On the operations and technology front we've delivered three consecutive generations of technology leadership by developing both world class silicon and highly optimized software capability. This has facilitated the strategic transition from our FPGA roots of the premier All Programmable Company thereby enabling Xilinx to participate in a much broader and deeper way in our customers multi-market solution and expand beyond our traditional market. I'm delighted to have this opportunity to hand over the CEO of reigns at Xilinx to my long-term colleague Victor Peng, a huge contributor to our success over the past 10 years. I'm very confident in the future success Xilinx under this stewardship.", "This time I'll turn the call over to Lorenzo.", "Lorenzo Flores", "Thank you Moshe and it's been a pleasure to work with you for almost 10 years I've been here particularly to serve with you as the CFO over the past almost two years.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "That is great.", "Lorenzo Flores", "It's not but I'm adlibbing. I'll go back to the script now. But we do wish you well. Sales in the December quarter increased for the ninth consecutive quarter to a record of $631 million, up 2% sequentially and up 8% on a year-over-year basis. Sales for the ninth months of fiscal year-to-date were up 7% versus the same period of the prior year. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by our advanced products which grew 10% sequentially and 30% year-over-year to a new record.", "Gross margin was 71.1% higher than our guidance as product mix was more favorable than expected. Operating expense was $259 million in line with our forecast, we continue to execute to the plan we outlined at our analyst day last May. Operating income for the quarter increased 2.4% sequentially to $189.7 million. Our operating margin hit 30.1% one quarter ahead of schedule. As a result of the enactment of Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, we incurred a tax expense of $183.2 million or a rate of 94% in the December quarter. This one-time tax impact was related to the transition tax on accumulative foreign earnings and the remeasurement of certain tax assets and liabilities somewhat offset by the reduction in the US Statutory rate.", "Our net income for Q3 was $11.9 million or $0.05 per share. For comparison purposes if our tax rate had been in the middle of our forecasted range, our EPS would have been $0.67 per share. Now onto the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $3.6 billion in gross cash and $1.9 billion net cash after our debt. Operating cash flow was $185 million. We returned $162 million to shareholders during the quarter in the form $89 million in dividends and the repurchase of approximately 1 million shares or $73 million, an average price of $71.34 per share.", "During the first nine months of the fiscal year we have returned nearly 100% of our operating cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. As we have said in the past, we continue to invest in our business to capitalize on our leadership position and will continue to return capital to our shareholders. We are still executing on our share repurchase program and have $372 million remaining on that authorization. We expect ending share count in the March quarter to be in the range of $255 million to $260 million diluted shares.", "For guidance, in the March quarter we're expecting sales to be between $635 million and $665 million. Our backlog is up strongly as we begin the quarter and we continue to expect growth in our advanced products. With regards to end markets we expect communications and data center to be up. Industrial and A&D will be approximately flat. Broadcast, consumer and automotive is also expected to grow. While auto and broadcast are growing. A significant amount of growth in this set of end markets will be from consumer which bear some explanation. We've treated crypto currency as it has emergency as a consumer business. This business has become larger and more durable driving growth in the fiscal Q4 though it is still potentially volatile, Victor will also talk more about this.", "Our gross margin for the quarter will be approximately 69% to 71%. We expect core operating expense to decrease to approximately $255 million. However, in this quarter we will recognize one-time expenses of approximately $30 million related primarily through our CEO transition. Finally, our tax rate is expected to be between 0% and 5% for this quarter as impacted by the Tax Reform Act. Our financial performance year-to-date and our guidance for the fourth quarter indicate to us that we're on track to meet or exceed our annual guidance on all operating parameters.", "Let me now turn the call over to Victor.", "Victor Peng", "Thank you, Lorenzo and my sincere thanks to you, Moshe. I'm going to stay on script because well this is your 41st call. This is my first. And I probably shouldn't blow it at. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm truly honored and extremely excited to be speaking with you on my first Xilinx's quarterly earnings call. And I'm particularly fortunate to be assuming leadership not only with Moshe taking this company to such a great position, but and truly a very dynamic time in our industry. By focusing on delivering unique values and emerging areas as well as our traditional markets, we will build on this revenue growth we've established and create the next wave of shareholder value.", "In an era where the pace of Morris [ph] law has showed. Xilinx is in a unique and unprecedented position of strength. Enormous amounts of data being created, stored and processed presents tremendous opportunities with Xilinx. Applications like machine learning, computing and storage acceleration, autonomous driving and 5G all promise to make an enormous impact on people's lives.", "Tomorrow's compute intensive applications require optimize platforms and are capable of delivering both acceleration and adaptability. Xilinx presents the right technologies and capabilities to take leadership position. And I'm delighted to have this opportunity to help the company maximize this potential. I would like to add my comments about both December quarter and the outlook for the March quarter. I'm very pleased with our consistent execution as demonstrated in our December quarter results.", "Revenue grew as Moshe said for the ninth consecutive quarter to the records $631 million. Additionally our operating margin exceeded 30% one quarter ahead of our plan driven by better than expected gross margin. Our overall revenue growth was again driven by our advanced products. Revenue from these products increased 10% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. This category now represents 56% of our overall revenue significantly up from 52% last quarter and 47% a year ago. Both our industry leading 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer technology node had significant sales records.", "With our 16-nanometer portfolio we're now delivering 43 unique products to approximately 1,160 customers. Revenues from our Zynq SoC platform an integral element of our multi-market expansion efforts increased nearly 40% from the year ago quarter and is expected to grow again in the March quarter. This platform has established sales traction in all of our end markets with significant success in the automotive, industrial, wireless and consumer market. As Lorenzo noted, our product is finding some success in crypto currency mining system. We're finding that our products and customer support capabilities really fit the need of this emerging market and we do anticipate future growth while being cautious about the volatility of this segment.", "With regards to end markets the industrial, aerospace and defense markets had another quarterly record. With sales of $297 million, an increase of 7% sequentially and 23% from the year ago quarter. This growth was driven by both semiconductor test and the emulation applications. Our unrivaled technology leadership has been a very significant driver for this record setting revenue performance. Our strong momentum in the data center continues unabated. Market leader Alibaba recently announced plans for two generation of FPGAs as a Service. The F2 and F3 using Xilinx Ultrascale plus FPGA.", "And beyond the public eye, we're seeing strong activity in workload specific compute acceleration, storage and smart mix. These data center opportunities continue to be one of our key medium to long-term market expansion opportunity. As we look forward to the March quarter, our guidance of $635 million to $665 million is again expect to be driven by the continued growth of our advanced product portfolio. If we achieve this guidance we will establish another sales record with Xilinx. Our overall revenue performance through the three quarters of the year and our Q4 guidance gives us confidence that we will exceed our $2.5 billion plan for fiscal 2018 and as we mention, we already reached our goal of 30% plus operating margin a quarter [indiscernible].", "Now I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.", "Ambrish Srivastava", "And I'm going to adlib here, Moshe. Thanks for being a gentlemen as these years. We've not always seen eye-to-eye but you always treated us very fairly. So good luck and on the next innings. Question on the up margin and also kudos for hitting the target and my question is for you, Victor. How should we think about sustainability of that given the increase in the next node and that's been the case forever but it seems like a step jump in that and also you're spending more on the FPGA as a Service model. So just help us understand how should investors have confidence that this has been a bogey that has been illusive on a consistent basis for Xilinx. So how should we think about that? Thank you.", "Victor Peng", "So from a gross margin, that has a lot of factors, but a big factor is mix. So in terms of the way the segment came out, we had really strong growth in segments for which we generally have very good value. Of course it's more complicated that, there's a lot of things we're doing for controlling the COGS and so forth. So I would say we absolutely can excuse me, I was referring to gross margin but in terms of the operating margin obviously that's all true but, so at that level in terms of operating margin. I think we've been very careful about investing where we see bigger returns and also being mindful of where we are on the gross margin line.", "So I think that we're going to be balancing those things right. We generally give a range of the upper 60s up into the 70s and I think if we look at how return we would get by investing further we'll do that aggressively and other places we absolutely want to give return to the shareholders, so.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "So Ambrish, I'm going to think maybe I'm going to ramp some other questions on this. We're - I guess outside of tax which I'll help you guys out a little bit on for the future. We're going to stick with our traditional cadence of providing specific financial guidance initially in our Q4 earnings call and then more in detail at our analyst day. So I think the kind of fundamental principal both that Victor and I laid out will be what we apply, right? Which is we're investing in the company and we're continuing to manage it to return the mostly to the shareholder.", "Ambrish Srivastava", "And I think the piece that you have given us is the scale and I think that's what I was hoping to hear from you, is that you're reaching, you're about to reach the inflection point on the FPGA as a Service model, which will help fund that.", "Victor Peng", "I'm sorry I didn't even mention, I didn't answer that piece of the question. Look I think we've been pretty consistent in saying FPGA as a Service is a more mid-term to longer term opportunity. From a revenue perspective that is not yet in a very material state. And also point out, that FPGA as a Service is only one segment of the compute acceleration which is only one segment of our opportunity in the data center. I think we've been pretty consistent in saying that, we have many opportunities not only in the compute side but also in storage and the networking side.", "So I think that a little less connected to your question regarding sustainability of the operating margin. I think on the operating margin side again you're seeing right that we have achieved our goal ahead of plan and we do think there is legs [ph] there on the other hand, if we feel like the right thing to do is invest to ensure the strong growth, we'll do that but we'll always be mindful of returning good value to the shareholders.", "Ambrish Srivastava", "Okay, thank you good luck.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.", "Blayne Curtis", "Moshe, best wishes on your next adventure here. I was just wondering if you could just talk about the consumer bucket. Obviously the crypto currency is been a big driver for a lot. Maybe just talk about December and then outlook in the March if you can kind of frame how big that's getting and how much of driver is it for that segment in the March.", "Victor Peng", "Blayne I'm glad you asked that because we're flagging it because in the past this has been really not materially enough to even mention because of the fact that. It's growing and this is - we're talking about like in the below tens of millions. We wanted to flag this however this is not like a GPU size kind of exposure right. And again you heard both Lorenzo and I say that there's a lot of volatility here. So I wouldn't we're mentioning it because now it's not something that's totally negligible but just to give you right order of magnitude. It is not something we're - we suggest you try and model, it's very volatile and it's very new and emerging thing.", "Blayne Curtis", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.", "C.J. Muse", "I guess first I'll start - Moshe congrats, pleasure working with you and Victor, look forward to working with you and congrats to you as well. I guess for my question maybe a kind of follow-up to the first one, as you think about tax reform and access through all that cash, how does that change your thinking if at all in terms of R&D investments as you project to head into beyond fiscal 2018.", "Victor Peng", "I don't think there is a first order impact from tax reform on our operating model. It comes mostly into play for us in terms of capital allocation. So I think regardless of tax reform and regardless of the quarter-to-quarter specifics we'll maintain very highly profitability and very high cash flow generation. So we see as the primary benefit as tax reform is freer uses of cash on a global basis. I think we're right now understanding some of the longer term impacts of it because there is some second order or more detailed aspects of tax reform that will impact cash payment, so we're modeling that as best we can out into the future and we'll use that to influence what we do on capital allocation, that's still on the works and again we'll probably talk more in detail about that at our analyst day.", "C.J. Muse", "Do you have a sense of your gap and or cash tax rates or that's something for the analyst day?", "Victor Peng", "Sure. Like I said totally I think it's unfair to you guys to say okay one quarter 93%, the next quarter it's going to be 0% to 5% and not leave with you any guidance past that. We actually wrap all the considered caveats around this, but as we understand it right now our forward tax rate should be between 10% and 15%. So pretty much like we had experienced in the recent past. So that's our best guidance right now, but it's obviously not without some caution on the potential for regulatory changes as more technical guidance comes out in different aspects of that, but right now it's the best we can get.", "C.J. Muse", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.", "John Pitzer", "And Moshe I'll echo the sentiment. Thanks for all the help - helping to understand Xilinx through the years, greatly appreciated. I guess my question is sort of follow-up on the margin side. I want to focus really on the gross margin side. This is only the second time in corporate history that I can see in our model that you've had gross margins above 71% and Victor I understand the importance of mix. So I guess part of one of the question is, can you help me understand what happened in the quarter from a mix perspective to make things this rich. And I guess more importantly just given that your broadening your lead against the competition and broadening the number of applications that you can address, why shouldn't we think that there is a continued structural upward biased on gross margins overtime. The caveat being no one should - have to apologize for 71% gross margin.", "Moshe Gavrielov", "Thanks for that.", "Victor Peng", "Yes, thanks for that. As I said I talked about mix that was really oversimplification. Look on the one hand, we are creating a lot of value, where our products, our leadership not only because we've executed well and delivered what we said but we've done innovations the most recent one for instance the RFSoC, where we integrated RF class data converters monolithically whereas 16-nanometer digital process. Right. Where that's saving the customer power, cost, size, weight all these things. And some of the other areas we have the larger capacity by factor. So part of this is, you got to be creating value right and then if you do that and on top of that you execute and you get out and so forth and you're going to get value.", "There is also just of course the natural factor, the mixed piece is that, the different segments have natural different levels of margin, right. So but crypto currency side, well of course consumer to the extent that we play is more price challenges, more margin leanness other places that we play in aerospace and defense for instance so forth and in general if you're delivering value you can get the value. So on the one hand I would agree with you is that, I think with our innovation and what we're doing that we're getting value and we're giving value to the customers, but you know the variability does become when you have certain markets if they pick up very strongly and they're naturally in that market have more ASPs competitive and you know that can change mix. But we certainly think that with leadership and the products and continue to innovation that in generation we can and will get good solid gross margin. They always have that variability and then of course.", "Lorenzo Flores", "The gross margins are just to remind you all John, I know we've had this conversation before. It's not reflective only of one quarter shift in mix. There is a decade now long legacy of focus on improving the gross margin of the company and our approach to it, I think it does provide us with a solid basis for just as Victor said consistently strong expectations on gross margin. But we're in very competitive markets in the lot of places and in markets where by the nature of those markets you're under consistent cost pressure. So yes while we have a firm basis saying we're keep growing it, I think it's probably a little aggressive.", "John Pitzer", "And Lorenzo, what specifically this quarter about mix was such a tailwind.", "Lorenzo Flores", "So we had actually the benefit from Victor and Moshe both mentioned our advanced product growth particularly our newer products which happened to be the highest value products we can provide, those provided and uplift and we also had good business in the general, in the industrial and aerospace, defense test measurement and emulation end markets which generally provide an uplift for our margin structure.", "John Pitzer", "Thanks a lot, very helpful.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo.", "David Wong", "Reading off my carefully crafted questioned script. Can you fill us in on what percent of overall revenues came from automotive and how much automotive was that year-over-year?", "Lorenzo Flores", "Auto was up year-over-year on the order of a little more than 20%, but I think that's a little bit of measurement anomaly. We had somewhat of a low point last year this quarter in auto and we are seeing it still in around 7%-ish of overall sales. Most of that business again is ADAS related and most of the growth is ADAS and Zynq based for us going forward.", "David Wong", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Vinh with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "John Vinh", "Good luck to you, Moshe and Victor, congrats on your new role. My question is around comms last night you heard TI kind of call it out as a source of area of weakness that they're seeing. It looks like comms where you came in, maybe slightly below what you're expecting but you did guide comms to be up in March, so wondering if you could give us some color in terms of what sort of demand trends you're seeing there and also if you could comment on what you're seeing between wireless and wireline, that will be great.", "Victor Peng", "Sure. So wireless is actually up some. I think we've mentioned several times that we're virtually all of the pre-5G prototyping so we saw some growth there. We also saw some strength in 4G deployments in India. Wired slowdown some mainly due to some of deployment of some products, but when we look at the current quarter we see that wired will be back up and wireless will probably be about flattish.", "John Vinh", "Got it. Thank you.", "Lorenzo Flores", "It's not inconsistent with what we've been saying, wireless will bounce around this level until we see the 5G inflection point.", "John Vinh", "Great. Thanks and I had a follow-up question on M&A. it seems like M&A activity is starting to pick up and seem really with the tax reform ability to repatriate cash seems like activity in the sector could pick up. One does that give you an opportunity to be a little bit more proactive on the M&A front. And can you also remind us in terms of how much offshore cash you will have an opportunity to repatriate.", "Lorenzo Flores", "So let me take the more specific the cash question, first. I think Victor can elaborate on the market situation for M&A. the easiest way to think about it right now is, after we pay the transition tax which for the most part is a book number because the structure is deferred over eight years. Pretty much our cash balance is free to move about the world. So that's part of this assessment that we're doing overall so gross cash at $3.6 billion net cash of $1.9 billion. We don't foresee limitation on [indiscernible] deploying that cash anywhere in the world or seeing any sort of tax penalty for doing it. We'll have ongoing tax which on a cash basis will be higher than we've experienced in the past, but there won't be restrictions on cash utilization or maybe better put economic disincentive to use it anywhere. So that's a good news part of tax reform for us.", "Victor Peng", "On the M&A side I viewed as our focus is what is our strategic objective and goal and M&A could be a tool to sort of further add, so we look at it that way and we obviously consider that as along with other many option. Ultimately of course you want to maximize shareholder value that the financial sectors is the main goal. But I would say that the focus is to think about what all our options are in the strategic concepts and we're trying to accomplish and if M&A is the thing then that would be considered along with that option. Now clearly on this call, this isn't the time to talk about that kind of vision. I think there will be time later in the quarter where we'll have the opportunity to talk a little bit more about direction in vision.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Seymore", "Also I want to echo the congratulations to Moshe and Victor. Just wanted to follow-up on the end market splits. You guys have done a great job growing for I think it's nine consecutive quarters on a sequential basis and the annual guidance range, is you've given been very helpful and it sounds like you're going to beat those for this fiscal year but there is some pretty big deltas between what you guided by segment and what you delivered with the comms and data center side being well below your guidance but the industrial, aerospace and defense being well above. So I guess with that all being said the question is what was surprising in those two segments versus what you originally thought and what's the duration of the new trajectory. You think it's phased this week on one side and strong in the other or is something in the mean revert [ph].", "Lorenzo Flores", "So versus where we thought I think you've gotten the primary point which are the industrial and A&D that have been markets which includes true industrial, aerospace and defense and test measurement and emulation. We're very pleasant surprise with their strength this year and that's pretty much across the board in those end markets. The consumer automotive and broadcast sentiment markets is on track with maybe automotive not as strong as we initially thought, but as I said earlier still growing in ADAS applications and so good platform for us in the future. And the wireless, wired communications data center end market that is underperformed partially because wired and data center is not a strong collectively as we thought and then wireless was bouncy and tough to predict to being with. But as we go forward, without being very specific about the direction like I said we'll provide more of that later on this year. The characteristics that are driving industrial and A&D seemed to be sustainable.", "The consumer automotive and broadcast business as we talked about, we could see some good upside from the, as we talk about it now from applications like the crypto currency and we look to maintain our position in automotive. Wireless, we still think is going to have that same basic characteristic of flattish with up and downs until we see the 5G and wired and data center I think we're going to continue to slow growth.", "Victor Peng", "Can I just? I'm not going - I do want to add a little just to certain applications. A&D has been strong that is not a surprise frankly I think that is something that is something that's been strongly and we definitely see that continue and test measure and emulation. I think we expect to be strong maybe is a little stronger than we expected, but I wouldn't say it's a surprise. I think some of the other comments that Lorenzo shared we agree, but I mean overall I don't want you to think that some of these things we didn't anticipate I just happens that a lot of the growth sell in that single bucket right, if you break it down as Lorenzo said there is good growth in multiple sub segments.", "I would also say that in general if we're talking about by segments. We talked also about the fact that I mentioned in my remarks I think is also a very strong platform I see that strengthening across multiple market. So I think there are definitely areas where we've been seeing and we see that sustained.", "Ross Seymore", "That's helpful color. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra with Robert Baird.", "Tristan Gerra", "I'll join my peers and congratulate both Moshe on many years of significant achievements and also Victor on your new role. Regarding 5G is it fair to assume that this ramp is going to be more small cells based versus base station based and so as such should we view 5G as potentially being more of a higher unit but lower [indiscernible] content opportunity and perhaps if you could refresh us a little bit on when you think the ramp beyond field test can become more meaningful overtime.", "Victor Peng", "Let me and answer that last part first. So I think we've been pretty consistent in saying we really see the ramp more in the 2020 timeframe. I mean there is some early things going on now and we've got like approximately 90% of those early pre-5G and proof of concepts and then I also referred to really disruptive product in the RFSoC but of course that's just getting out. Now it's a transition to the first part of your answer is that? let me start with RFSoC in that regard, I mean RFSoC is something that is something that is not just 5G, it's the right technology and really the way to deal with any massive MIMO kind of architecture so that's a very large [indiscernible] and that's a trend that's being moved to across in general not only in wireless infrastructure but even in other very adjacent applications, right.", "And then in terms of small cells. Yes in small cells but I think that it's really a range of different types of infrastructure so I wouldn't say that it's just small cells. So in general I would say we see good very strong position there but again the ramp is more in the 2020 timeframe and as far as RFSoC we're seeing great momentum, but it's really not a meaningful revenue at this point. People are just starting to design with that, that goes into production in this calendar year.", "Tristan Gerra", "Okay great and then just a quick follow-up. So it looks like the tens of millions of revenue target that you had for this fiscal year for [indiscernible] potentially gets pushed out a little bit, how should we look at the ramp, is there a timing at which we see more [indiscernible] inflection point and any quantification that you may want to put forward for the next year or two from a data center and this customer.", "Victor Peng", "I'm sorry were you referring to the tens of millions on being pushed out, could you?", "Tristan Gerra", "I think that was a somewhat of soft target that Xilinx had put in place regarding this fiscal year in terms of data center ramp.", "Victor Peng", "Okay, I see I mean again what I would say is that, first of all data center. The traditional portion of our data center revenue right, the kinds of deployments we've been in the past largely in storage, but not only in storage that still is actually the larger part of the revenue overall. I think the revenue is the emerging part that we referred to and I think what you're probably really targeting early the discussion about FAS and so forth. I mean that's, that is in the smaller number that you're talking about, now it's still in those tens of millions, I don't see this as a push out. I think we've been pretty much consistent in saying that, this is the period where we're building applications, we're getting the tools and the infrastructure out there, we're building an ecosystem and so forth. Just to put this in perspective in the re:Invent Conference that Amazon had back in November 2016, that's when they announced and they were the first ones to announce FPGA as a Service. They actually announced it, but it didn't even start going online until April, 2017 since that time we now have five announced FAS deployments, but again many of them are just coming online.", "In the re:Invent Conference Amazon just had this past November. They announced the fact that they have now instead of just one region, there are three region which FPGA accelerated or deployed including the secure US GovCloud and I think a total of 11 [indiscernible] regions. So I think what I'm trying to suggest here is that, it is not at this stage where we're talking about big revenue growth. This is all about building the applications, the infrastructure, getting the deployments and we're seeing very good momentum on that perspective. I don't see that there is a push out per se, I think it's just again building that the foundation and getting the applications out and getting these engagements going. Does that [technical difficulty]?", "Tristan Gerra", "Great. Very useful. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust.", "William Stein", "And again my congrats to Moshe as well. If you could help us understand the commentary on crypto it will be helpful. Specifically you're saying you think it's more durable or maybe [indiscernible] sustainable, is there something about your position in that market or demand trends that you think reflect something that indicates sustainability in that marketplace. Thank you.", "Victor Peng", "The crypto currency is extremely volatile and so I think one in some situations what happens is, that things change so much that A; it's hard in that sense to sort of predict. In terms of the sustainability though we do see as we said, we do see that we've had revenue in the low tens of millions, we see that kind of level of revenue continuing, but we also are providing support for these customers. Okay, it's not secret there's so much involved there that people doing custom ASICs for this and they're also using GPUs. Now the reason why we do see some flip here is because it's a very dynamic situation to a different and Bitcoin gets a lot of press, but really there is multiple different currencies and there is lot of things happening, so with that kind of change the flexibility we have that has that value. But we are very cautious here because of the volatility of it and we don't want to you to over read in what we're saying, right? That's why in the TPU space they've had much bigger exposure, but nonetheless it's gotten to the point where we don't want to just have it not lease rate.", "Lorenzo Flores", "I think the durability point comes from when we first saw it, it was very small business and then it grew significantly but we didn't have any line of sight to any future business path what was currently in the book. We now have better line of sight by working closely with some of these customers to what their plans are and the future potential of the business, that's really what I was going after when I said that because it's something we understand a little bit better, but again as we keep saying we're cautious about the macro factors that drive the core demand for these products.", "William Stein", "It helped. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James.", "Chris Caso", "The question about the revenue turns [ph] percentage that seems to have been steadily dropping is that a function of where product lead times are now, if you could explain that relationship and basically what you're seeing both turns perspective how it gives you visibility for the business before you're seeing lead time.", "Victor Peng", "We don't really have any lead time issues and actually that's one of the things our customers have appreciated about us, which our ability to support them. I do think it's more function of us continuing to drive the business and get the orders on the book as soon as we can and it does help us plan and it does help us from some downside variability it if ever occurs. We just - trying to drive the business not to say that it will be always be this way but we're making a deliberate effort to get the orders on the book.", "Chris Caso", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citigroup.", "Chris Danely", "Moshe thanks for everything over the years. Mazel Tov caim sheli. Anyway. That's Hebrew for those of you who don't know out there. I don't know if you guys. [Foreign Language]. I don't know if you guys went into the relative growth rate you expect in your three main end markets for the calendar years, if you could just run through those real quick.", "Victor Peng", "I'm sorry, so you said for the calendar year or for the last quarter.", "Chris Danely", "For this calendar year what's your relative growth rate expectations between comm, industrial and broadcast.", "Victor Peng", "I don't think that on this call I want to give guidance for the quarter, right. But I mean for the calendar year but in terms of where we see now in the quarter that we're in, the aerospace, industrial, A&D that we definitely see will be a very strong quarter. I mean overall that basket. I think the AVB consumer and auto will be holding slightly up.", "Lorenzo Flores", "Yes, well so I think Chris so the for the year I mean the calendar year is three quarters over next fiscal year and I guess we'll do that guidance first in at the end of this quarter and then more completely at Analyst Day. But for this current quarter the fourth quarter with respect to the third quarter with what I had reference in my guidance piece earlier.", "Victor Peng", "Yes, I was talking about the fiscal year. I'm sorry. I was referring to this fiscal year of which sub segments was going to show pretty strong growth.", "Lorenzo Flores", "Yes, so I got I think we're both little bit confused about the time and horizon your question, sorry about that. But for this quarter the industrial, aerospace and defense end market set will be relatively flattish as the two industrial and aerospace and defense segment growth offsets decline from actually a record setting performance on test measurement and emulation. The communications and data center end markets will be up slightly and the consumer automotive and broadcast business will be up and that's where the right now we've bucketed the crypto currency business and that's where we spent a little bit more time explaining that.", "Victor Peng", "And that's for the quarter.", "Lorenzo Flores", "For the quarter, yes.", "Victor Peng", "Sorry, I thought you were saying when we complete the fiscal year, how it would look?", "Chris Danely", "Yes, I'll wait for the long-term guidance for the analyst day.", "Lorenzo Flores", "Okay, yes great thanks.", "Chris Danely", "Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna International.", "Christopher Rolland", "Congrats Victor on the promotion and congrats Moshe on a great career. So I just Victor wanted clarification first. So you said low tens of millions from crypto was at per quarter or for the full year and then I assume that's most heavily weighted for this last quarter here. And then also the 30% growth in broadcast consumer and auto, great job there. And I know Dave already asked about auto growth here. But what was consumer growth year-over-year and broadcast growth. Thanks.", "Victor Peng", "I guess in general in terms of the crypto currency like we said that kind of came from a very low number to in that order of tens pretty quickly, so when you sort of said how was it, was that on a quarterly basis, actually that would be for like the whole year, but you know it kind of came up from a year ago virtually zero. So yes, so the answer to first part is yes. Yes, it is stronger in the recent quarter but you know for the year it's still be in that order of magnitude.", "Lorenzo Flores", "So the other aspects of the business, the AVB end markets are on the order of 10% up and consumer business is up substantially more but I think again there is some data anomalies that you wouldn't want to use that as a predictor of the future just because the way that business had bounced around historically.", "Victor Peng", "Again as you know consumers are very in general a more opportunistic one for us, that is in - we definitely when we see certain opportunities go after it on the other hand that doesn't have the kind of emphasis that we have in some of the other markets. And again we flagged the crypto because that became from quickly essentially zero to something that you wanted to flag.", "Christopher Rolland", "Yes, I certainly understand you don't want to leave anything on the table. Thanks guys.", "Victor Peng", "Yes, we won't do that.", "Operator", "You have a follow-up question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.", "John Pitzer", "Just quickly on the balance sheet. Inventories were up a little bit more than I would have thought and so are receivables and so Lorenzo I know you talked about not having any availability issues. Is this just a new norm for inventories, what should we expect going into the March quarter or how should we think about that. Thank you.", "Lorenzo Flores", "In general you will see our inventory grow in anticipation of the business. We've had I think there's one quarter in the past we actually had a higher dollar value of inventory that was for specific business area I think that was getting ready to support wireless ramp and last generation. Again I think that was the case, but we see just in general broader end market strength particularly in our advanced products and that for we're focusing our inventory builds. So I think the inventory number is quite consistent with what you'll see in the business. It should growth as the business grows, but periods it will drain down a little bit and others it will build up a little bit, just depending on what we're actually seeing in the market. On AR, this is been a story that I've told a couple of times it is relatively high and it is again driven by how consumers take shipments and during the quarter and payment patterns. I will reassure you all we have no collectability issues on the AR, so that's just high quality and it's purely a timing thing.", "John Pitzer", "Perfect. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is Vinayak calling in for Joe. I wanted to follow-up on your ADAS business. Now that's one space where you have seen good traction for using product. So when you look at your customer design and pipeline, could you just discuss how happy and applications sort of ADAS evolved overtime and what are the applications your most [indiscernible] going forward?", "Victor Peng", "ADAS again has been as I mentioned for Zynq automotives is one of the areas that we have [indiscernible] strength. For the most part this is all 28-nanometers by the way, right and of course the ADAS requirements for the market keep going up, right they keep raising the safety standard, so there is already been quite a bit activity and design ins for the next generation ADAS. As everybody knows that there is also a lot of development and excitement around autonomous driving and these things are evolving from advanced driver assist systems towards autonomous driving, so we have a natural set of relationships, design activities and in fact some wins frankly that move us along that whole continuum the earlier events driver assist systems to more sophisticated ones to the earlier levels or autonomous driving.", "So yes it's I think that we're definitely participating that entire evolution because of our flexibility we're participating in all of the major sub portions of the architecture meaning like we have engagements where we're in the central unit, we have [indiscernible] some of the sensors, aggregation points and so forth. So yes, we're quite well engaged there and think that's one of the definite areas we think out in good, very good traction. First generation in our 16-nanometer MPSoC as well.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Got it very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "You have another follow-up question from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.", "Blayne Curtis", "I just want to follow-up on the March guidance for consumer. Given you said your [indiscernible] seems like should be up double digits and obviously we talked about crypto currency. I'm just trying to understand how strong automotive is because that business has had kind of unpredictable path typically it's seasonally strong but sometimes it's up larger if you could just look at the sequential growth in the March and maybe kind of get any color between the segments there.", "Victor Peng", "That's sort of end market in a percentage basis, the consumer aspect will grow the more substantial as you just pointed out. Both AVB and auto will grow in the low single-digits.", "Blayne Curtis", "Very helpful. Thanks.", "Rick Muscha", "Victoria, we can take one more question.", "Operator", "Certainly. Your last question will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie Securities.", "Srini Pajjuri", "Moshe, let me echo my congrats and again thanks for all your help over the years. Just a quick question I know you guys don't make CPUs but you do sit next to a lot of them. Just curious if you know the recent security issues with Meltdown and Spectre and if you're seeing any impact one way or the other, directly or indirectly in the near term. Do you expect any impact from those issues?", "Victor Peng", "I know that's a quite a lively topic. Of course we lead the industry in integrating in RMSoC into All Programmable FPGA so and as you know we license those cores from ARM. So one is, I'll say that we absolutely know that there is no susceptibilities of the Xilinx specific implementation of the Arm cores that we license from ARM and according to information, we work very closely with ARM. We don't believe there is any susceptibility to the meltdown aspect of it. Regarding Spectre there is no known susceptibility in terms of the 16-nanometer Zynq MPSoC and in terms of the first generation Zynq SoC, we use there the ARM Cortex A-9 which has the possibility of having some of that however I'll point out that, most of our customers do and closed embedded systems. And if that's the case that's highly unlikely that there will be exposure to that.", "In addition if the customer does have something to get, gets user kind of code exposure if they use authentication, security features that are there then that exposure is also same thing highly unlikely. We haven't heard anything from customers but of course we monitor that very closely and we're working with ARM very closely on any further news or mitigation. Just to round out the basis, by the way we've had our proprietary Microblaze SoC [ph] embedded processor. We know that there is no vulnerability there in that architecture is very simplistic so there is no vulnerability in either of the Meltdown or the Spectre. Does that?", "Srini Pajjuri", "Yes. Great. That's it.", "Rick Muscha", "Great. Well thanks for joining us today. We'll have a playback of this call beginning at 5 PM Pacific Time, 8 PM Eastern Time today.
