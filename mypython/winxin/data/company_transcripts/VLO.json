I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Locke, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "John Locke", "Well, good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations and Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero\u2019s senior management team.", "If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we\u2019ve described in our filings with the SEC.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Joe for a few opening remarks.", "Joe Gorder", "Thanks, John and good morning everyone. The fourth quarter and the full year 2016 were good for Valero as we achieved our best performance ever in the areas of personnel and process safety, plant reliability, and environmental stewardship. We are very proud of our team\u2019s exceptional execution, which we believe is imperative in our business and critical during the low margin environment like we saw for most of the year.", "In the fourth quarter, we continued to see good domestic demand supported by low prices and solid export volumes due primarily to demand strength in Latin America. While we saw seasonal declines in available margin in some regions, margins in the Gulf Coast region remained healthy and distillate margins in all regions were bolstered by a return to more normal weather patterns in North America and Europe. We also saw attractive heavy sour discounts relative to Brent. A persistent headwind again this quarter was the exorbitant price of RINs. We spent $217 million in the fourth quarter to meet our biofuel blending obligations. At this level, this is a significant issue for us so we continue to work it aggressively with regulators. Our efforts are focused on moving the point of obligation because we believe this will level the playing field among refiners and retailers, but more importantly, it will improve the penetration of renewable fuels, lower RIN speculation, and reduce RIN fraud. However, based on current rules, we expect costs in 2017 to be similar to the $750 million amount we incurred last year. Given significance of this cost to our company, this issue continues to have our full attention.", "Turning to our refining segment, we initiated turnarounds at our Port Arthur and Ardmore refineries in the third quarter. Both events carried over into and were completed in the fourth quarter. Our employees and contractors worked hard to safely complete these events. We believe distinctive operating performance is highly correlated to capturing more of the margin available in the market. In our ethanol business, we also ran very well and saw strong margins in the fourth quarter due to high gasoline demand in the U.S., strong pull from export markets, and low corn prices.", "Also in the fourth quarter, we invested over $600 million to sustain and grow our business. Construction continued on our $450 million Diamond Pipeline project, which we believe is on track for completion at the end of this year, and we continue to work on our $300 million Houston alkylation unit, which we expect to be mechanically complete in the first half of 2019. We also have additional growth investment opportunities under development around octane enhancement, cogeneration, and feedstock flexibility.", "And finally, regarding cash return to stockholders, we delivered a payout ratio of 142% of our 2016 adjusted net income, which was 78% higher than our payout ratio for 2015 and well above our target for 2016. Further demonstrating our belief in Valero\u2019s earnings power, last week our Board of Directors approved a 17% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.70 per share or $2.80 annually.", "So John, with that, I will hand the call back over to you.", "John Locke", "Thank you, Joe. For the fourth quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $367 million or $0.81 per share compared to $298 million or $0.62 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. Fourth quarter 2015 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $862 million or $1.79 per share. For 2016, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $2.3 billion or $4.94 per share compared to $4 billion or $7.99 per share in 2015. 2016 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.7 billion or $3.72 per share compared to $4.6 billion or $9.24 per share for 2015.", "Please refer to the reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts as shown on Page 3 of the financial tables that our company released. Operating income for the refining segment in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $715 million compared to $876 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $1.5 billion. The decline from the 2015 adjusted amount was primarily due to narrower discounts for most sweet and sour crude oils relative to Brent, weaker gasoline margins in some regions, and higher RINs prices.", "Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.9 million barrels per day, which was in line with the fourth quarter of 2015. Our refineries operated at 95% throughput capacity utilization in the fourth quarter of 2016 with major turnarounds at the Port Arthur and Ardmore refineries completed early in the quarter. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.83 per barrel were $0.36 per barrel higher than the fourth quarter of 2015 primarily due to favorable property tax settlements and adjustments in 2015 and higher energy cost in 2016.", "The ethanol segment generated $126 million of operating income in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $37 million. The increase from the 2015 adjusted amount was due primarily to lower corn prices and higher ethanol prices.", "For the fourth quarter of 2016, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $208 million and net interest expense was $112 million. Net interest expense was lower than guidance due to prepayment penalties associated with the early redemption of the 2017 notes being reflected in other income. Depreciation and amortization expense was $468 million and the effective tax rate was 21% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The effective tax rate was lower than expected due primarily to stronger than projected relative earnings contribution from our international operations that have lower statutory rates and other items as referenced in the release.", "With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $8 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $4.8 billion, of which $71 million was held by VLP. Valero\u2019s debt to capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 23%. We have $5.6 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which $720 million was available for only VLP. We generated $998 million of cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter. With regard to investing activities, we made $628 million of capital investments, of which $244 million was for turnarounds and catalysts. For 2016, we invested $2 billion, which was slightly lower than guidance due to lower turnaround costs and the timing of some growth spending. And of this total, $1.4 billion was for sustaining and $600 million was for growth.", "Moving to financing activities, we returned $440 million in cash to our stockholders in the fourth quarter, which included $271 million in dividend payments and $169 million for the purchase of 2.7 million shares of Valero common stock. For 2016, we purchased 23.3 million shares for $1.3 billion and had approximately $2.5 billion of authorization remaining. For 2017, we maintain our guidance of $2.7 billion for capital investments, including turnarounds, catalysts, and joint venture investments. This consists of approximately $1.6 billion for sustaining and $1.1 billion for growth.", "For modeling our first quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges; U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.63 million to 1.68 million barrels per day, U.S. Mid-Continent at 415,000 to 435,000 barrels per day, U.S. West Coast at 195,000 to 215,000 barrels per day, which reflects a major turnaround at the Venetia refinery and North Atlantic at 440,000 to 460,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $4.15 per barrel, which reflects projected increased natural gas prices. Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.39 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. We expect G&A expenses excluding corporate depreciation for the first quarter to be around $175 million and net interest expense should be about $115 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $485 million and our effective tax rate is expected to be around 30%.", "That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions each. This will help us ensure other callers have time to ask their questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.", "Brad Heffern", "Good morning everyone.", "Joe Gorder", "Good morning Brad.", "Brad Heffern", "Hey Joe. So I was wondering, obviously a big topic of conversation has been the border adjustment tax in the space, so can you go through your thoughts on how that\u2019s going to affect feedstock costs, your ability to pass it on and maybe the likelihood that you see if that\u2019s actually making it through?", "Joe Gorder", "Yes, you bet. We will give you a point of view. What I would like to do is let Jason Fraser answer that question. Jason has recently taken the position as the individual responsible for our public policy and strategic planning group, so we brought him back from London to take on this job. And it\u2019s interesting we put the two functions together, strategic planning and public policy, because in our view you really can\u2019t bifurcate the two anymore. They are going to be very intertwined. So Jason, you want to go ahead and share your point of view?", "Jason Fraser", "Sure. Yes. I will give you a heads-up on where we are with the house tax blueprint. And we have read all of your reports. As you know, there are greatly differing opinions on the blueprints, including the border tax, border adjustment tax aspect, how it affects our industry, and Valero. We are performing our own analysis as well as working through scenarios with AFPM, our trade association. We are also engaged with the legislative process. We are at the very early stages. No legislative tax has been released by the ways and means committee yet, so we are not sure exactly what\u2019s going to be in it. But we are going to continue to work this issue. Regarding the likelihood of passage, you guys know that any kind of major legislative change like this is difficult to pass. If there isn\u2019t bipartisan support, the Republicans may have to use the budget reconciliation process. We also have a new administration which adds another variable. So it\u2019s really hard to handicap at this stage how it\u2019s likely to turn out.", "Brad Heffern", "Okay. Thanks for that. And then Joe or maybe Gary or Lane, the South Coast AQMD in California has talked about potentially banning the use of hydrofluoric acid, I was curious if you know what the impact will potentially be on Wilmington and maybe the chance of that going through as well?", "Lane Riggs", "So Brad, this is Lane. So yes, we are engaged in the process and there is obviously a conversation around it. And I can\u2019t really share much more than that than it does impact our operations, so we did have an HF unit [ph] there as long as the operator there in Torrance, and there are technologies out there. Obviously, the most straightforward one is the sulfuric acid, but there is also one of the other technology providers in the space has another solution and \u2013 but we are certainly working with them in terms of how long it might take to \u2013 if they choose to go down that path and how long that \u2013what the phase-in or at least the requirement would be, but we are very involved.", "Brad Heffern", "Okay. I will leave it there. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.", "Phil Gresh", "Hey, good morning.", "Joe Gorder", "Hi Phil.", "Phil Gresh", "I just wanted to start with the return of capital, obviously the year ended up north of 140%, you are guiding to 75%, which is consistent with the guidance you have always said, but there is obviously a big delta between those two numbers, so I guess, I am wondering how you are thinking about that target relative to what you accomplished in 2016 and just taking note of the fact that 4Q did step down a bit from the rest of the year on the buybacks?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Okay. Phil, this is Mike. We continue to spend our discretionary cash according to our capital allocation framework. When we look at how much we are going to buyback in a particular quarter, we do look at the net income, but we also consider cash flow, and so for the quarter or for 2016, we did have 142% of net income and that equated to 51% of cash flow.", "Phil Gresh", "It\u2019s okay. So you are suggesting we should consider cash flow as a metric as well?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Well, not suggesting that as our overall guidance, but in a lower margin environment where net income is hit with our depreciation, we do take that into consideration when we are returning to our shareholders.", "Joe Gorder", "Phil and we have talked about this before, we set the 75% target because it\u2019s easy to see and cash flow can move around, obviously. And Mike is right, looking at net income in a low-margin environment, we set an expectation and we consider it to be kind of the floor. It\u2019s our commitment to our shareholders to the extent we can do more and it\u2019s the best use for the cash, we will go ahead and continue to buyback shares. I think the move we made with the dividend this quarter clearly reflects our comfort level and our Board\u2019s comfort level with the earnings capability of the company in a down market. And so obviously, if you look at a $2.80 dividend, it\u2019s going to continue to be a more significant component of the 75% payout ratio. We are very comfortable with that. But we will continue to buyback shares and the guys will do it in the way they have done it in the past, to some extent ratably and to some extent opportunistically.", "Phil Gresh", "Sure. Okay, that makes sense. And if I could maybe push a little bit more on Brad\u2019s question, more from the angle of if something were to happen, maybe just talk through your system, the amount of crude you import, the amount of product you export, you gave some numbers on product exports, but maybe just what changes you think you would potentially make if this were indeed implemented?", "Joe Gorder", "Yes. I mean it\u2019s \u2013 and I will let Gary and Jason and Lane can \u2013 we can all speak to this. But obviously, you are going to optimize your crude slate. The big question around this whole border adjustment is how are the markets going to react to it and frankly, we have read everyone of the sell side reports on this and then consulting reports, as Jason mentioned and it\u2019s got a lot of moving parts. Some people look at it on a static basis. Some have looked at it when you take into consideration the markets adjusting and some have taken into consideration the currency adjustment also. So right now, there is a skeleton out there that they are trying to put flesh on and we don\u2019t know exactly what it\u2019s going to look like. But I think it\u2019s fair to say that we are going to continue to optimize our operation. And if you recall, Gary, I don\u2019t remember how long ago, but we are running over 1 million barrels a day of light sweet crude and there has been times when we have run 600,000 or 700,000 barrels a day of light sweet crude. So, Phil, we have got the flexibility in the system. Gary, you want to talk at all about the markets and...", "Gary Simmons", "Yes. So if you just look really over the last several years, our strategic objectives have been around developing feedstock flexibility and developing export markets. And so we believe that puts us in a really good position to be able to handle whatever the border tax may throw our way.", "Phil Gresh", "Okay, got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.", "Neil Mehta", "Good morning, guys.", "Joe Gorder", "Hi, Neil.", "Neil Mehta", "Joe, I want to start off on the product markets here. We have seen couple of weeks of gasoline inventory builds. I want to just get your sense of what you think is going on there? Is there an issue with underlying gasoline demand? And how do you see it playing out from here?", "Joe Gorder", "Yes, it\u2019s a great question, Neil. Gary, you want to share your thoughts? ", "Gary Simmons", "Yes. Neil, I guess to me when you look at the DOE numbers, it\u2019s always difficult this early in the year to tell a lot from the numbers. But certainly, when you look at gasoline demand, we were trending below last year\u2019s level. Last week stat showed gasoline demand really at the lower end of the 5-year range. The part to me, though, when you look at implied demand, which includes the exports, implied demand is actually tracking above last year\u2019s level, which is a little confusing. It\u2019s certainly confusing to us when we look at our operations, because what we have seen in our operations in the Gulf is we have had a number of weather impacts in the Gulf, primarily fog, which has hindered our visibility to really load ships, which hinders our ability to do the exports. So at least, in our minds, the exports in the DOEs are probably overstated, which would in turn tell you that domestic demand is understated. And so I think you will see a revision in the stats to where exports will be lowered and the domestic demand raise, but we will have to see how that plays out. Really, when you look regionally, we don\u2019t see any indication to believe that domestic demand is down. You have a few locations. We had high levels of rain on the West Coast, which hindered our demand there. You had some instances in the Upper Midwest with some ice storms, but none of that is abnormal. So I don\u2019t think we see anything that tells us demand this year is going to be dramatically different than what we saw last year.", "Neil Mehta", "And then so Gary, what do you make of the inventory builds, is that just a function of fog and having some issues getting the product out or the refining industry running too hard in response to the strong crack to end the year last year?", "Gary Simmons", "Yes. So I would say PADD III is definitely is a result of fog. And weather clears and you will start to see the PADD III market clear. Obviously, the concern is the PADD I market. And our hope certainly was, with less carry in the market, you would see less of an incentive to put barrels into New York harbor and store them for summer. And really, we have been on a similar trajectory is what we were last year. I think the only thing that we see that\u2019s different in the market we don\u2019t have a lot of line of sight to the barrels people are putting into tanks, but it does look to us like a lot more of the inventory this year is a winter grade gasoline which if that\u2019s true you should see play out is before RVP transition, people will have to liquidate those barrels and the market will get a little soft, but then you should see inventory cleanup before you get to gasoline season. To your comment, I do think part of this is obviously the utilization rates are just too high and we are producing more diesel and gasoline than the market can absorb. When you look at the Northwest Europe crack, it looks like this week we have gone below a level where we generally start to see some run cuts in Northwest Europe. I also believe regionally, the Rocky Mountain region, the Upper Midwest Chicago market, those markets are long and you will see some run cuts there. So, you combine that with turnaround activity and I think you will start to see inventories come back in line.", "Neil Mehta", "That\u2019s great. And my follow-up here is for Cisco, there are lot of puts and takes in the quarter. Do you mind walking through the tax rate, which was a little bit lower, the interest expense guidance, which was a little bit different and some funkiness in other income?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Okay. Yes, Neil, I can do that. Okay. First, on our tax rate for the quarter, we were 21% versus our guidance of 31%. We had a couple of things going on there. First, we had higher income than previously projected with most of this being in Canada and the UK, which has the lower statutory tax rate. So that was worth about 3% on the tax rate. Next on a few of our tax audits, the statute of limitations expired, therefore, we reversed reserves associated with these audits and those reversals, along with a few other small adjustments was about 7% on our tax rate. Okay. We had a few items that we did -- we chose not to identify them as special items for this earnings call, but I will walk through those. First and you talked about one already, the debt prepayment penalty. We inadvertently on our last call included that penalty in interest expense. It actually flowed through other income. That was a charge of about $42 million. Offsetting that, however, was kind of a unique item. It\u2019s the Canadian commercial paper recovery. Back in 2009, we wrote off that investment. Part of the deal, we exchanged our commercial paper for some notes. And in the fourth quarter, we received payment on those notes and that was about $50 million. So, those two kind of offset each other in other income. And then lastly, we had in the fourth quarter a LIFO charge. We had a decrement and we had a LIFO charge of about $55 million. So we chose not to identify any of these four items as a special, but I did want to go over that. So in summary, we had two expense items, the debt prepayment and the LIFO charge. We had one income item, commercial paper recovery and then we had the lower tax rates. So when you net those four items together, that was $0.02 per share on our earnings.", "Neil Mehta", "That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot.", "Mike Ciskowski", "You bet.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Doug Leggate", "Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Joe, one of the other, I guess, policy moving parts that has emerged in the last week or so is Keystone. Of course, OPEC, the newswires should suggest it\u2019s heavy barrels that are getting cut. So, I am just wondering what can you share with us about the dynamics of what you are seeing on the Gulf Coast specifically as it relates to how you expect the heavy differential at this kind to evolve over the next uncertain periods, I guess, that we have?", "Gary Simmons", "You bet. Hey, Doug, this is Gary. What we have seen is we have certainly seen some impact to the OPEC cuts. Our crude allocations have been cut a little bit primarily from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. But we have seen minimal impact to our system from the cuts. We continue to see good availability of grades from Latin America, Canada and U.S. sources to replace the volumes that have been lost from OPEC. Thus far, the impact from the cuts has really been offset by lower refinery demand due to refinery turnarounds. So it will probably be April, May before the full impact if any cuts are seen. Directionally, we really didn\u2019t see the meetings to how our discounts react at all to the OPEC cuts. When the cuts were announced, you saw an increase in flat price but the discounts really didn\u2019t change. Here over the last week, the medium sour discounts have come in a little bit, but we have actually seen heavy sour discounts move wider. PMI adjusted their K factor to make [indiscernible] a little more \u2013 the discount a little wider, and I think they had to do that to compete with the Canadians. So we have seen heavy discounts actually move wider. We always look at 3% fuel oil as kind of a leading indicator of where the discounts are going. And 3% fuel oil has actually moved from 85% of Brent last week to 82% of Brent. You see fuel inventories at Singapore that are above the 5-year high. The ARB to ship fuel to Singapore is closed, so that would kind of indicate that the discounts will actually move wider.", "Doug Leggate", "Okay. Just on the Keystone issue, I guess, I don\u2019t want to push the point too much, because I realized how much uncertainty there is, but I seem to recall in the past that you guys had \u2013 maybe I have got this wrong with talking about becoming an anchor shipper with an option to even acquire interest on that. Have I got that wrong or is that back in the table?", "Gary Simmons", "Well, so we are a shipper. We are still a strong supporter of Keystone. We don\u2019t have the ability to actually be an owner in the line. So, we are working with TransCanada as they try to better understand the executive order and drum up customer support. Our belief is that the direct connection from the Western Canadian production to the U.S. Gulf Coast is a good thing, because we have the most efficient capacity to really process those growing areas of production. Our intent, again, will be to process those barrels in our system, not to export the barrels.", "Doug Leggate", "Okay, I appreciate that. If I could just squeeze in a last one because that was kind of a follow-up, I guess, but Joe, you have put it down in \u2013 but I realized you addressed there earlier, but I just want to ask you a question about that very quickly, it\u2019s become the MO, I guess of your tenure as CEO, the return to shareholders, what are you thinking now in terms of the dividend yield, because you are not sitting, if not the highest, pretty close to the highest yield in the sector, is that kind of \u2013 do you have a target in mind, do you have an idea of how that dividend growth can evolve relative to buybacks, just what are you thinking in terms of the overall balance of one versus the other, I leave it there? Thanks.", "Joe Gorder", "Thanks Doug. The yield obviously is a function of the stock price. And we can\u2019t control the stock price. What we can control is how we reward the shareholders of the company and how confident we feel about our ability to produce cash flows, free cash flows within the company, that we try to manage, right and we do it through a capital allocation framework that Mike mentioned earlier. The dividend and our maintenance CapEx is non-discretionary in our minds and it will continue to be. So making commitments to our shareholder returns through the dividend is something that we don\u2019t take lightly and we modeled extensively. The buybacks and the growth projects, organic capital projects and acquisitions are areas that we consider to be competing for the use of free cash flow. And we look at the timing on our project development activities. We look at the return on our projects that Lane and his team are developing and that Rich and Martin have and we compared it to the value of buying back shares. And so we make the decisions accordingly to provide the highest returns for the shareholder. I would tell you, I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 I would be lying to you if I told you that we look at the absolute yield and say that is what determines our decision around the dividend policy. It\u2019s more how do we feel about the cash flows that we can produce within the system.", "Doug Leggate", "I appreciate the answer Joe. And I guess we will see you in a couple of weeks. Thanks.", "Joe Gorder", "Doug thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.", "Johannes Van Der Tuin", "Hi. Thanks for taking the call. It\u2019s Johannes here. I have to pinch hit today unfortunately for you all, but fortunate for me. Thank you for taking the call.", "Joe Gorder", "Glad to hear.", "Johannes Van Der Tuin", "The first question, I guess has to do with the other big policy that\u2019s not border adjustment taxes, but it\u2019s being pushed aside for the moment, but still probably later important to you and that\u2019s RINs, you mentioned it earlier up in the call, and what\u2019s your progress are you seeing in terms of trying to move the point of obligation or engaging with the EPA as there has been a transition, I know that Scott Pruitt is not in his seat yet, but nonetheless, if you have got any sort of color on that. And then would you expect the RIN market to move before any sort of policy change once there is some sort of color clarity on which direction it\u2019s going or are you modeling out for 2017 with the higher RIN expense because you don\u2019t think the market is going to move?", "Joe Gorder", "Okay, fair enough. Jason, you want to take the crack in our RIN?", "Jason Fraser", "Sure. Yes. To talk about the point of obligation effort meant maybe somebody else can speak to the RIN price. The comment on our petition to change the point of obligation is February 22, so that period is still open and there is till comments being generated. We firmly believe that once all the evidence is reviewed, the EPA is going to agree to the change the point of obligation. Regarding the introduction of the process, the Attorney General Pruitt as EPA Administrator, which has been there is some discussion about that is whether that will change the dynamic. In his confirmation hearing, he said he would administer the RFS in accordance with Congress\u2019 statutory objectives and he would make a decision based on the evidence and their administrative record. And it all sounds great to us, that\u2019s all we would ever ask for. So we think that after hearing all the arguments and reviewing the facts and what\u2019s in the record and consulting with the staff that they are going to agree that it should be moved. So we don\u2019t really see anything changed due to this changeover of administrators.", "Johannes Van Der Tuin", "And then on the actual RIN price and the trading price?", "Gary Simmons", "Yes. So again, our view is certainly you would see a reaction in the market if this gets done. And you would see RINs come off, we have seen some market reaction already. It\u2019s difficult for us to model because of all the uncertainty around it, so.", "Joe Gorder", "But yes, I guess Gary, we started the year like $0.95 per RIN and now it\u2019s like at $0.50.", "Gary Simmons", "Right.", "Joe Gorder", "So we have made the point all along that this is a market that we believe is right for manipulation and the fact that you have had this movement in it, it sure is based on fundamentals.", "Johannes Van Der Tuin", "It sounds good. So hopefully, there will be some movement. The other question I have I guess just had to do with the California margin weakness, clearly, the margin environment in California has come off quite a bit over the last six months, do you see an underlying reason for that, what the big driver is, is there a difference in the way the market clearing, is it just the Torrance has come back online, is there some sort of dynamic whether it would be weather or something else in terms of EMT that you would like to say, king of just curious as to what\u2019s going on out there for you rise on an operational basis?", "Joe Gorder", "Well, I certainly think Torrance coming back online has impacted the market here in the prompt market. As I mentioned, we saw some weaker demand with RIN on the West Coast. But overall, LA is moving to summer grade expect today, which you pull butane out of the pool, which directionally tightens it [ph], next month, the bay will go to summer grade gasoline. So all of those things should directionally help demand and bring supply and demand back into balance.", "Johannes Van Der Tuin", "Okay. So you don\u2019t see any sort of a grinding issue there?", "Gary Simmons", "No.", "Johannes Van Der Tuin", "Okay, perfect. Thank you very much for taking the call.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays.", "Paul Cheng", "Hi guys, good morning.", "Joe Gorder", "Good Paul.", "Paul Cheng", "I have to apologize first. I joined late, so my question, you already addressed, just let me know, I will take it offline. Two questions, if I may. First, if I am looking at the Contango curve, their current structure seems to suggest that you want to build inventory because that May and June, the margin was very high for gasoline, on the other hand, the stock is high right now, so just curious that internally for Valero, how you guys contemplate on those diverging forces and when you plan one, how you go with the process?", "Gary Simmons", "Yes. Paul for us, most of our tankage is more operational in nature, so we don\u2019t do a lot of storage plays to take advantage of the market structure. We do some of it especially on the crude side, but it\u2019s more related to buying opportunistic barrels that we believe have wide discounts and then you can also take advantage of the markets structure. But overall, we don\u2019t do a lot of that.", "Paul Cheng", "But I mean with inventory, at that high today Gary, is that influencing your decision that you may want to slowdown your run, even if the physical asset availability is there or that you don\u2019t really do that just because you are off the game favorably, that if you slow other people it is going to take up the slack anyway, so you are just going to max out your production even though you may build inventory yourself?", "Gary Simmons", "Yes. I think to me, the key on the inventory build is that what we are seeing out in the market is a lot of winter grade gasoline. And so our view is that those barrels are going to have to clear before we have our VP transition. And as those barrels clear, it will bring the market down and you will see economic run cuts and lower utilization while those barrels clear before we actually going to summer driving season.", "Joe Gorder", "Yes. But Gary, you are not suggesting that its Valero, it\u2019s going to make the run cut?", "Gary Simmons", "No, that\u2019s right.", "Joe Gorder", "I mean Paul, we are the lowest cash operating cost guys in the business and we don\u2019t have any strong interest in balancing the market ourselves.", "Paul Cheng", "Very good. If I may the second question is that, maybe this is either for Lane or for Gary also. I am looking at the margin capture RIN, system-wide in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s about 56%, 57%, which is 6% lower than the third quarter and 21% lower from the year ago level and if you are looking at your last 5- year average, it\u2019s about 65%, 66% and this year, it\u2019s about 60%, just curious that is that just a \u2013 because of the rising oil price or what \u2013 is there anything that you can see structurally, what then you will see in your system or that in the market new condition to make you believe that this year, the 60% margin capture weight is what the future may look like or that this is really more of an one-off certain items impacting that?", "Gary Simmons", "Yes. Paul, this is Gary. I will take it. Mike started the call with some comments that we took a LIFO charge in the fourth quarter of \u201816 and really, that LIFO charge explains the third quarter to fourth quarter variants that you talked about. It also explains a portion of the fourth quarter \u201815 versus fourth quarter \u201816 results. In addition to that, we had a couple other items. There is really nothing operational that I see, but the other big things that affect the year-over-year results. In \u201815, the blenders tax credit was enacted in December of \u201815 and so all of the credit was booked in the fourth quarter of \u201815, whereas in \u201816, that blenders tax credit was kind of spread out through the year so that had an impact on the capture rates. And the other big thing that we are looking at in terms of the capture rates is just the cost of the RINs. So in the fourth quarter of \u201815, RINs were around $0.49, whereas the fourth quarter of \u201816, they were $0.96. And so that delta in the cost of RINs also impacts our capture rates and that really is the bulk of it.", "Paul Cheng", "Gary, I mean, this certainly explains for the quarter. And for the year, RIN probably is part of the explanation. But for the full year of 60% capture rate also seems quite low comparing to the last several years what you have been able to achieve?", "Gary Simmons", "Yes, we can dive it into it more with John, I would suggest. But those are really the big items that we see. We don\u2019t really see anything operational, Paul.", "Paul Cheng", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.", "Roger Read", "Yes. Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.", "Joe Gorder", "Good morning, Roger.", "Roger Read", "I will leave some of the policy to decide for now, but I guess specific question for you. Exports have been a huge part on the product side, 2016 story looks like a good start to \u201817. Pemex is out saying they intend to run a lot better in \u201817 than \u201816. That\u2019s their forecast. I mean, we will see what turns out to be true, but could you characterize maybe the incremental growth in exports for you as to where that\u2019s gone and if Pemex were to run better in \u201817, is that a risk we need be concerned about or are there enough other growth areas internationally?", "Gary Simmons", "Yes, Roger. It\u2019s hard to tell. As Lane can tell you, it takes a long time to improve refinery mechanical availability, so we will see what happens there. But I think, one of the things that we are looking at and we export to Mexico and to South America and certainly when you look at a lot of the consultant views where Brazil has had negative demand growth over the last couple of years that are forecasting some decent demand growth in Brazil, so even if we are to lose some volume into Mexico, I think you could be absorbed in other locations in South America.", "Roger Read", "Okay. And then second question, M&A, I know with some of the policy uncertainty, maybe sellers don\u2019t want to sell and buyers want to be a little questionable. But I was wondering, Joe, as you kind of think about the longer plan here, Lyondell pulled their unit off the market, but maybe some of the other opportunities that exist there right now?", "Joe Gorder", "Mike, you want to speak to this?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Well, yes, Lyondell did pull their refinery back for now. Other than a few things on the West Coast, there are no opportunities really for the refining space presently.", "Roger Read", "Well, that was brief. And I heard that Lane was a miracle worker, so maybe we could get him to work for Pemex that will fix them?", "Joe Gorder", "No, we don\u2019t want to do that. But Roger, you are right, I mean, what Mike said is exactly right and it was characterized earlier. The Lyondell refinery is a nice opportunity, but they chose not to sell it. And we are just not seeing a lot of refining assets that are for sale that would add any value to Valero\u2019s portfolio. So from an acquisition perspective, what do you focus on? You focus on the opportunities in logistics and other areas where you could improve the earnings capability of the company by improving your logistics, your feeds in, your products out, and then potentially upgrading your stream. So we are not in a position \u2013 we don\u2019t believe we are in a position where we have got to go do a deal to balance on our portfolio. We will look at this a little differently and then we continue to seek ways to try to improve the quality of the portfolio we have got in place.", "Roger Read", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Chi Chow with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.", "Chi Chow", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Joe Gorder", "Hi, Chi.", "Chi Chow", "Hi. Mike, do you have the cash balance held by the company\u2019s international subsidiaries as of year end \u201816? We have noticed that balance has been steadily growing over the last couple of years. I was just wondering if you could also talk about whether, one, that cash is available for use for domestic CapEx and capital returns to shareholders. Two, what are their \u2013 are there any repatriation inefficiencies in the current tax structure? And then third, how do some of the tax policy changes proposed under the new administration impact repatriation of that cash going forward?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Okay. Roughly at the end of the year, we had about $2 billion of cash that was in the UK and in Canada. So presently \u2013 okay, our current structure that we have today would allow us to move most of the cash back to the U.S. without incurring a significant tax penalty. We haven\u2019t needed to do that presently given where our U.S. cash balance is as well.", "Joe Gorder", "That was an incredibly clever way to ask three questions.", "Chi Chow", "That\u2019s all related, right.", "Joe Gorder", "That was good.", "Chi Chow", "Well, do you feel the need, any urgency to get that cash back given the potential changes in the repatriation policies going forward here?", "Joe Gorder", "The need to get it back, I don\u2019t think we have a sense of need to get it back. Would it be nice to have access to it? And Jason and the team are looking at the repatriation implications of the border tax adjustment. You always want to have your cash totally accessible to you. So, it will be great to get it back. But I would tell you that this \u2013 let\u2019s just assume that we are able to bring it back and bring it back in good shape. The question is that what do you do with it? You reinvest it in the business? I don\u2019t see us changing our approach to capital if we had the cash back, okay. I mean, I don\u2019t think Lane is going to say gee whiz, now I can do a whole bunch more, because we are not holding back on things that we are doing today. So it will be wonderful to have access to it without paying any tax on it. That\u2019s not likely. But I don\u2019t think it changes anything we are doing, Chi.", "Chi Chow", "Great. I will leave it there. Thanks, Joe. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis with UBS Securities.", "Spiro Dounis", "Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for squeezing us in here. Just wanted to follow up on the RFS. Without getting into what does it look like and then when does it change, just thinking about, I mean, I guess, an environment where the point of obligation has actually moved away from the refiners, just curious in terms of the reaction or just change in behavior on your part, maybe the refining industry in general, what are some of the things you think happens, I guess, on day 1 without the point of obligation? I think one thing we think about maybe is that exports actually go down, because of course, that\u2019s a good way to avoid the RIN. Just curious if you are thinking about anything else in terms of changes in product mix?", "Joe Gorder", "Gary, you want to?", "Gary Simmons", "Yes, I don\u2019t know that to some degree, the export market has over time recognized the RIN, so I don\u2019t really know that it really changes the dynamics of the export markets that much if the point of obligation moves.", "Joe Gorder", "Yes, I mean we have all adjusted to this. Really, the frustrating thing from our perspective is the negative effect it has by shifting the value of doing business from us to the guidance capturing the RIN. And so obviously, it would be beneficial to Valero if the point of obligation moved, which would reduce our burden. And frankly, we believe it would take a lot of the speculation and the manipulation opportunities out of that RIN market and it should lower the price of RINs. Now, the RVOs will have a factor on that and so on. But from a refiner, from an independent refiner\u2019s perspective, it will be positive.", "Spiro Dounis", "Appreciate the color. Thanks, everyone.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Dietert with Simmons.", "Jeff Dietert", "Good morning.", "Joe Gorder", "Hi, Jeff.", "Jeff Dietert", "I am sitting here in Houston looking out my back window and the fog has cleared in the Houston ship channel, so hopefully, that\u2019s good news.", "Joe Gorder", "It is good news. Yes, do you see our ships loading, Jeff?", "Jeff Dietert", "They are going out one right after another. I had a question on your pace of the MLP drops and there are a few things going on, one of your peers accelerating, there is also the potential for lower corporate and individual tax rates under the Trump administration, potential for higher interest rates, how do these things impact your thinking on MLP valuations and the attractiveness of dropdowns?", "Joe Gorder", "Rich, you want to?", "Rich Lashway", "Yes. I will take a crack at our peers accelerating. So we have been pretty consistent in the execution of our strategy from the IPO that we are going to take a very measured pace. We believe that that\u2019s more of prudent to have a measured pace on our dropdowns. Valero\u2019s exceeded their targeted total payout ratio for the past 2 years. VLP doesn\u2019t really need to do any acquisitions or dropdowns to meet our distribution growth. There is not a need for the cash as we have kind of talked about, the cash balance at Valero. So we are just going to stick to our measured approach of growing, focusing on growing the distributions. We have been clear that we are growing distributions in \u201817 at 25% and at least 20% in \u201818. So it\u2019s really the focus is on the distribution growth at VLP. And we have got the coverage to achieve this and without doing anything drops.", "Joe Gorder", "And then Jeff, the tail on that was tax rate changes.", "Mike Ciskowski", "I mean the lower corporate tax rate, if that\u2019s what gets put in place, obviously would make the corporation a little more attractive. However, the MLP will still have the tax advantages structure versus the corporation.", "Joe Gorder", "In interest rates, I mean it just \u2013 it provides an investor different option, right. But you still have the benefits of everything that you have today with an MLP ownership position.", "Jeff Dietert", "Thanks for taking the questions.", "Joe Gorder", "You bet.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.", "Ryan Todd", "Hi. Thank you. You may have touched on parts of this over the course of the call and I apologize if I missed some of that. But can you talk through what you see as some of the similarities and differences as we look at the macro environment versus last year at this time margins are a little bit better, but we have seen some pretty significant inventory builds over the last four weeks again, I mean what are some of the lingering challenges that are maybe similar to last year and what\u2019s different this year that gives you confidence that we won\u2019t just repeat the 2016 environment again?", "Gary Simmons", "Yes. This is Gary. I think the similarities, we continue to see the industry running at high utilization rates and so the production of gasoline and distillate is exceeding demand in the marketplace, which isn\u2019t good, causing inventories to build. The difference we see is it looks like on the gasoline side a lot of what\u2019s being put into inventory is winter grade. So again, our view is this will have to clear before RVP transitions could bring inventories down before gasoline season starts, which would make this year look different than what we saw last year and should lead to better gasoline cracks. On the distillate side, not too much different I think the things that we are seeing on the distillate side is slightly better demand. So year-over-year, we will have a little colder weather here in the U.S. and also in Northwest Europe, which may distillate demand. And then as we see some resurgence in the upstream, the drilling activity, it also leads to a little better incremental diesel demand. So those are kind of the key factors we are looking at in the market.", "Joe Gorder", "And you are right, we don\u2019t know enough yet about the infrastructure projects that are being talked about, at the Federal level right now, what the implications of those are. But any time you get projects like this taking place, they tend to drive distillate demand, of course it would drive gasoline demands also. But \u2013 then there is the other things, petrochemical feeds, asphalt, things like that. So we are actually encouraged by the outlook and by the focus on the infrastructure within the U.S. So we will just see how it all plays out.", "Ryan Todd", "So I guess at a high level, it\u2019s safe to say you have just \u2013 is your view on \u201817, but it\u2019s still a little bit better that \u201816, but we will wait and see, is that...?", "Gary Simmons", "Yes. I think definitely, we will see the gasoline market being similar to \u201816, but a slightly better diesel market than \u201816.", "Ryan Todd", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez", "Gents, good morning. I am not sure I\u2019m as good as, but I am going to do my best at least two in for one here. The question is on pipelines, I know you talked about Keystone, but I am curious for one, do you have a sense of what the current transport cost is in the market and where that might go to once the pipe is in the ground. And then secondly on dapple, can you think of any direct maybe indirect positive impacts that you may have, whether it\u2019s just additional crude, light sweet on the Gulf Coast? Thanks.", "Gary Simmons", "Yes, that\u2019s some of the things that we are working with TransCanada on, so we don\u2019t really have guidance on where the Keystone itself tariff is going to be and that\u2019s certainly something that we are working with them on. In terms of dapple, yes I think you kind of hit on it, it\u2019s definitely will be bringing more light sweet to the Gulf Coast, which should be good for us.", "Blake Fernandez", "Good deal. Thank you.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.", "Faisel Khan", "Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Faisel. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just going back to Excel for a second and back to I think Doug\u2019s question, have you guys talked to them about taking an equity interest in the pipeline, I mean now that you have the sort of the MLP up and running, it might make sense for them to have an equity partner with their anchor shipper?", "Joe Gorder", "Faisel, you should never ask us that question when you got a guy who is responsible for the MLP in the room. But to answer your question, honestly, no, we haven\u2019t talked about an equity stake in Keystone.", "Faisel Khan", "Only because it might make sense for them to syndicate out some of that risk, given how large the pipeline is, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s?", "Joe Gorder", "That maybe true, but that does not mean that we would be the guy.", "Faisel Khan", "Along with the price.", "Joe Gorder", "That\u2019s right.", "Faisel Khan", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Joe Gorder", "You bet.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.", "Craig Shere", "Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in.", "Joe Gorder", "Sure Craig.", "Craig Shere", "Quick follow-up on Phil and Doug\u2019s questions about capital deployment and buyback questions, it seems that the buybacks were kind of turbocharged little bit in \u201816 when shares were more in the mid-$50 area versus in the $60-plus area, as you think about flexing buyback metrics from earnings to cash flow in a low margin environment, how does the share price itself factor into your analysis?", "Joe Gorder", "Mike, you want to?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Well, I mean we don\u2019t have specific seasonal targets for our buybacks. It\u2019s on an annual basis, at least 75% of net income. And our program does consist of both somewhat ratable purchases, but also opportunistic purchases, too. So we just evaluate when we want to accelerate that depending on the stock price.", "Craig Shere", "Is it fair to say that the mid-$50 area is kind of turbocharged area for you?", "Joe Gorder", "We couldn\u2019t answer that question. But \u2013 and I think Mike answered it properly. It\u2019s \u2013 we sure don\u2019t want to signal our timing on our buying, but we look at what we view to be the earnings capability of this company. And if the returns on the buybacks are better than the returns on the growth CapEx project, then we are going to buyback shares. We said for years that we are not going to hoard cash, to the extent that we produce free cash flow. We will continue to look at the buybacks.", "Craig Shere", "Fair enough. Thank you.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.", "Paul Sankey", "Hi guys. Good morning. Forgive me if this has been asked\u2026.", "Joe Gorder", "Paul, where have you been?", "Paul Sankey", "On the Exxon \u2013 let\u2019s be honest, that it may be way \u2013 further to an earlier comment about the Houston ship and all the good news for you from New York is that it\u2019s snowing very heavily here, so there should be a bit more gas flow demand, I guess. Guys, I am sorry if you asked this \u2013 answered this already, but what\u2019s the latency on the border adjusted tax and what are you doing, I guess you have to some level plan for the potential for that to happen, what would you do if it did occur, so I guess the question is what\u2019s your understanding of the likelihood of that happens and what would be your response to if it did? Thanks.", "Joe Gorder", "Okay. Jason did talk to that earlier. Just want to give him the likelihood and then we can talk, Gary or we can talk about the other components of that question.", "Jason Fraser", "Yes. We really at this stage, we haven\u2019t put a handicap on the likelihood yet. It\u2019s so early, we don\u2019t even have any draft on legislative tax floating around the committee, so we don\u2019t feel it\u2019s proper for us to try to guesstimate that now.", "Joe Gorder", "And then Gary as far as well \u2013 Paul, it comes down to how are the markets going to react to this, right. And we have read all of the reports and we have read the consultants reports. Something is going to be good for refining, something that may not be as good for refining. And we talked earlier about the fact that we can adjust for the crude slate. But Gary, the markets are going to react.", "Gary Simmons", "Yes. So everything we have been doing is to increase de-stock flexibility and also be able to grow these export markets and both those things aligned well with this and we can optimize the system around border tax.", "Paul Sankey", "I guess the punch line kind of goes back to 2010 to \u201814 when we were trying to maximize usage of U.S. light sweets, where did you end up on all that, how much more could you use at the end of the process and do you have any numbers to illustrate the flexibility?", "Gary Simmons", "Yes. So if you look in our IR presentation, I think its Slide 9, it does a pretty good job of going through how we can swing our system between individual grades. We got to where we were processing over 1 million barrels a day of domestic light sweet crude, I guess that was pretty tougher, so we have added some additional capacity since that time as well so.", "Joe Gorder", "The interesting thing was, I guess at Port Arthur, you were able to increase overall run rates, throughput rates, because we were running the lighter slate. So Paul, we will be able to flex the system to deal with it. I guess the question is how to \u2013 how do the global crude markets respond to the duty, do they price to continue to push their barrels into the market or do they find a different home. And I think Gary has made the comment in several of the meetings that we have had that the natural home for a lot of the heavy sour crudes tends to be in the U.S. Gulf Coast refining system. So I don\u2019t know if that changes in any material way.", "Paul Sankey", "Absolutely and I guess, the other question is we would assume the gasoline prices at the pump would go up pretty much by the amount of the tax in the short-term?", "Joe Gorder", "Look that is certainly what we have read also, okay. And I think your friends at Goldman did a report here recently that I have gotten to study, but I thought okay, maybe they moved up and then they move back down, something rise, the market suggest to it. So Paul, the interesting thing is because this is kind of a topic du jour, right. But none of us \u2013 they got the skeleton out there and the House seems very committed to this today. But they don\u2019t have the flesh on the bones. There is lots of conversations that are taking place around do you have carve-outs, don\u2019t you have carve-outs and so on. I think what I have encouraged our investor base to do is just let\u2019s be patient, not over-reactive and let\u2019s just see how it shakes out. We will adjust to maximize the value to the company, but I don\u2019t think anybody knows enough yet to really understand what the full implications are. And then when we have seen changes like this, the markets tend to respond. So here again, we don\u2019t have a great deal of concern and consternation around us right now. We are just trying to understand it better.", "Paul Sankey", "Yes. I totally understand. Thank you very much.", "Joe Gorder", "You bet.", "Operator", "And thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. John Locke for closing remarks.", "John Locke", "Okay. Well, thanks everybody. And we appreciate you joining us today. Please contact me after the call if you have any additional questions. Thanks.", "Operator", "And thank you.

(Operator Instructions). Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Locke. Mr. Locke, you may begin.", "John Locke", "Thank you, Daniel. Good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our CEO and President; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero\u2019s senior management team.", "If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also, attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.", "Now, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we\u2019ve described in our filings with the SEC.", "Now, before we review the quarterly results, I\u2019d like to highlight some of our strategic accomplishments in the last quarter. These actions aligned with our key strategies to reduce feed stock costs by improving access to North American crudes and to grow our logistic investments and Valero Energy Partners LP, our sponsored logistics partnership.", "In August, we secured shipping rights and the option to purchase a 50% interest in Plain All American Diamond Pipeline. When completed in late 2016, that 440-mile pipeline will connect our Memphis refinery to the crude oil hub at Cushing Oklahoma.", "Regarding Valero Energy Partners LP, we completed our first drop for $154 million in cash at the beginning of the third quarter. We also continue to advance in our capability to access and process advantage crudes during the quarter, with the commissioning of our rail unloading facility at the Port Arthur refinery.", "With the startup in September, this is the third crude-by-rail facility we\u2019ve completed in the past 13 months, with the other two completed facilities located at our St. Charles and Quebec City refineries.", "As mentioned in the release, we are also progressing on our other key investments as part of our strategy, including the completion of investments to receive advantage crude at our Quebec refinery on Enbridge 9B Pipeline reversal.", "We also expect to complete the hydrocracker revamp at our Meraux refinery later this quarter. Now, looking out a little further, the two crude topping units at our Corpus Christi and Houston refineries are progressing as planned.", "Moving on to our quarterly results, as you saw in our earnings release we had a strong quarter. We reported third quarter 2014 earnings of $1.1 billion or $2 per share. Third quarter 2014 operating income was $1.7 billion or $1.1 billion higher than the third quarter of 2013. Most of the increase within the refining segment although the ethanol business also contributed.", "Refining throughput margin in the third quarter of 2014 was $11.81 per barrel, an increase of $4.05 per barrel versus the third quarter of 2013. Wider discounts on sweet and sour crude oils versus brand and strong gasoline margins in most regions were slightly offset by weaker distillate margins versus brands in most regions and higher natural gas costs.", "Also contributing to the higher throughput margin, although Quebec City refinery\u2019s higher year-over-year consumption of North American light crude in the third quarter. The refinery\u2019s feedstock diet consisted of 79% North American grades in the third quarter of 2014, which is up from 6% in the third quarter of 2013.", "In addition, we realized a reduction in crude cost in our Mid-Continent region when we completed our connections with pipeline in Childress Texas. This connection allowed us to receive an incremental 40,000 to 50,000 barrels per day at Midland price WTI crude oil primarily for our McKee refinery.", "Lastly, we continue to ramp up North American crude consumption in our Gulf Coast region by replacing an additional 100,000 barrels per day of foreign crude in the third quarter of 2014 versus the third quarter of 2013, with some of those volumes delivered to Port Arthur by our new rail unloading facility I mentioned earlier.", "Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.8 million barrels per day in the third quarter of 2014, which is an increase of 42,000 barrels per day versus the third quarter of 2013. Less turnaround activity and higher throughput capacity utilization led to the increase in volumes which was supported by strong product exports and the increased availability of North American light crude on the Gulf Coast. We operated our refineries at 98% throughput capacity utilization for the quarter.", "In our refining, cash operating expenses in the third quarter of 2014 were $3.81 per barrel, which is $0.07 per barrel higher than third quarter of 2013 due mainly to higher energy costs. The ethanol segment generated record earnings of $198 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2014 versus $113 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2013.", "The increase in ethanol segment operating income was mainly due to $0.27 per gallon increase in gross margin driven by lower corn prices on an abundant corn harvest, higher production volumes from the startup of our Mount Vernon, Indiana plant. Ethanol production volumes averaged 3.6 million gallons per day in the third quarter of 2014.", "General and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation were $180 million in the third quarter of 2014. Net interest expense was $98 million and total depreciation and amortization expense was $430 million. The effective tax rate was 32.9%.", "With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $6.4 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $4.2 billion of which $231 million was held by Valero Energy Partners LP.", "Valero\u2019s debt to capitalization ratio net of cash was 10.5% excluding cash held by Valero Energy Partners LP. Valero had approximately $5.6 billion and Valero Energy Partners had $300 million of available liquidity in addition to cash.", "Cash flows in the third quarter included $622 million of capital expenditures of which $123 million was for turnarounds and catalyst. In the third quarter we raised our dividend for the second time this year with 10% increase. We returned $489 million in cash to our stockholders, which included $145 million in dividend payments and $344 million in purchases of approximately 7 million shares of Valero common stock.", "And subsequent to the third quarter, we continue to return cash to stockholders by purchasing an additional 3 million share of common stock for $138 million, which brings our total for 2014 to 18.4 million shares for $937 million.", "For 2014, we are lower in our guidance for capital expenditures including turnarounds and catalysts by $100 million to approximately $2.9 billion. We expect stay-in business capital to account for slightly less than 50% of total spending with the remainder related to growth investments primarily for logistics and advantage crude oil processing capability.", "More than 50% of Valero\u2019s estimated growth investments in 2014 are for logistics, and we believe most of this will be eligible for drop-down into Valero Energy Partners LP.", "Now, for 2015 capital expenditures including turnarounds and catalyst, we expect to spend approximately $2.8 billion consisting of approximately $1.8 billion for stay-in business capital and $1.3 billion for growth investments, a majority of growth investments are allocated to logistics and increase in our capability to process manage crude.", "So, for modeling, our fourth quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges, Gulf Coast at 1.55 million to 1.6 million barrels per day, Mid-Continent at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day, West Coast at 260,000 to 280,000 barrels per day and North Atlantic at 410,000 to 430,000 barrels per day.", "We expect refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be around $4 per barrel. For our ethanol operations in the fourth quarter, we expect total production volumes of 3.7 million gallons per day and operating expenses should average $0.41 per gallon, which includes $0.04 per gallon for non-cash cost such as depreciation and amortization.", "We expect G&A expense excluding depreciation for the fourth quarter to be around $190 million and net interest expense should be about $95 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense in the fourth quarter should be approximately $425 million and our effective tax rate should be around 35%.", "So, now I will turn the call over to Joe for a few remarks.", "Joe Gorder", "Well, thank you, John. And as you may have seen, last week announced that Bill Klesse has chosen to step-down as Chairman of Valero Energy\u2019s Board of Directors at the end of this year.", "So, on behalf of our Valero team, we just want to thank Bill for all he\u2019s done to make this company successful over his 45-year career. And we really like to wish Marty and Bill, all the best going forward. John?", "John Locke", "Thank you, Joe. So, before I turn over to Q&A, I just want to clarify on the 2015 stay-in business capital should be $1.5 billion, I believe I said $1.8 billion.", "So, okay, Daniel, we have concluded our opening remarks. In a moment, we will open the call to questions. During this segment, we request that callers limit each turn to two questions. The callers may rejoin the queue with additional questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our very first question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons", "Yes. It\u2019s Jeff Dietert with Simmons. Good morning.", "Joe Gorder", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons", "So my question has to do with some of your crude feedstock costs and specifically one with Saudi having raised their prices to the U.S. It appears that some of their crudes were not terribly competitive. We saw the crude imports for the total U.S. drop from 1.6 million barrels a day in April to less than 900,000 barrels a day in September while Saudi was increasing prices during that period of time.", "Since then they\u2019ve had four consecutive months of price reductions. And I was wondering if you could provide some color as to how attractive the Saudi crudes have been in the market through the spring and summer? And whether or not these recent reductions in prices make them more competitive now?", "Gary Simmons", "Hi Jeff, this is Gary Simmons. You\u2019re exactly right. I mean the Saudi barrels that gotten to wear, we felt like they were competitive versus all alternatives. In the third quarter our volumes from the total Middle East were down considerably where we\u2019ve historically run.", "We\u2019re now seeing this they\u2019re making pricing moves to bring their barrels back being competitive in the market. I would say with their recent announcement on their OSP they were competitive or at least within basic sense of marks.", "Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons", "Okay. And secondly with the Brent pricing being weak and some of the West African prices being soft, have you seen those barrels price themselves back into either of the East Coast market or the Gulf Coast market with some of the softness relative to LLS, we\u2019ve seen this fall?", "Gary Simmons", "Yes, Jeff. The place that we pivot first is really our Quebec refinery. And we definitely as Brent got weak, we saw some synergies start buying from West African grades again and backing out some of the grades that we were taking from U.S. Gulf Coast.", "Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons", "Yes. So both that sounds like increases in imports in a market where we\u2019ve got pretty substantial domestic production growth. Do you think domestic prices have to soften to back those imports back out of the market?", "Gary Simmons", "Yes. And you could kind of see that in the markets. The Brent got weak about three or four weeks ago. We started to pivot as others did. And then we\u2019ve had three straight weeks where crude goes towards in the U.S. bill. So it kind of tells you the differential has to come back off to force those barrels back into the market.", "Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons", "Thanks for your comments.", "Operator", "Our following question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "Hi guys. Good morning.", "Joe Gorder", "Good morning.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "I have one request and two questions. The request is that it seems that some of the part in losses may turn out to be an emerging investment team in the sector. I know there\u2019s still a small number, but it would be helpful I think for your shareholders if in your press release somewhere that you put down what is the GP cash flow and your total number of units in the LP and also that the total LP unit. I mean even though that those numbers can be found in your VLP disclosure it\u2019s just helpful there to be in one document.", "In terms of the question, with the announcement or that from one of your competitors last week in terms of their strategy in drop-down they have substantially as their rate, is there any key or more transparent strategy or data that you can put one in terms of your VLP drop-down pace or the distribution growth for the next several years?", "Joe Gorder", "Yes, Paul that\u2019s a fair question. This is Joe. If we look at VLP, since the IPO we\u2019ve stated that we\u2019re going to grow our distributions between 20% and 25% a year. We\u2019re in target to be in the middle to the high-end to that range. We just completed a drop and a distribution increase and we\u2019re working on the next drop.", "Now, VLP is less than a year old, well we don\u2019t have a debt rating yet, we\u2019ll be in the process of getting that the next year or so. And it\u2019s our intention to be investment grade. Now, when you consider the size and the pace of our drops to VLP, our original plan was to start with the logistics assets that would be more traditional.", "And that\u2019s when we said that we\u2019ve got the $800 million of EBITDA that is not a specific business unit that we have within Valero, it\u2019s assets that are used to support the rest of the operations. And so we haven\u2019t had P&Ls for them.", "That being said, that we can go in and we can calculate what the EBITDA would be for those assets based on market rates and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. Now, what\u2019s come up here recently is this additional set of cases that would include do you put fuel margins and process units, into the MLP.", "So, we\u2019re going to take a look at everything and we\u2019re going to act accordingly. Obviously it\u2019s never simple of taking EBITDA, putting the multiple on it and the same that\u2019s what the value is. You got a lot of tax effects that need to be considered.", "The other thing then is, with the use of proceeds, could they be used, I mean, I expect we\u2019re going to use them to do growth projects or to return the cash to the shareholders depending on which option has the highest returns.", "One of the questions we ask ourselves is if we do accelerate the drop we\u2019re going to get some of the parts valuation increase in Valero because that\u2019s something that although we\u2019ve executed the MLP, we haven\u2019t seen it yet.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "Yes. But at least based on what Tesoro and MPC reaction on the last several weeks that seems like that is started catching on as a new theme?", "Joe Gorder", "Yes, we see it too Paul.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "Yes. A second question on the $2.8 billion next year budget is that including anything in the methanol projects? And if it is indeed going to go for FID, should we assume it is just an add-on or that you\u2019re going to compensate and adjusting it so that you still could get the $2.8 billion?", "Lane Riggs", "Hi Paul, Lane Riggs. That $150 million in the 2015 led to $2.8 billion, and I\u2019ll predict we\u2019re in the Phase 2 development of the project and we\u2019ll go \u2013 we\u2019ll have another review in for side view, we\u2019ll then go somewhere in the second quarter of \u201815.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "And Lane if you do go ahead should we assume you\u2019re still keep $2.8 billion or that this is incremental? In other words will you adjust your other projects so that you don\u2019t go beyond the $2.8 billion?", "Lane Riggs", "It is in the $2.8 billion.", "Joe Gorder", "Yes, Paul the $150 million \u2013 we have a $150 million as a place folder in that $2.8 million budget. If we didn\u2019t perceive with the methanol plant, we wouldn\u2019t spend that $150 million and we\u2019d be at $265 million.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "Okay, got you. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our following question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.", "Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil", "Guys, good morning. Thanks. Congratulations on the rollover in CapEx into \u201815. I guess this is kind of a combination of a higher level question from Paul and maybe a tie on from Jeff as well as with regard to the Saudi pricing. It looks like the lower \u2013 the logistics spending is decreasing like 45% of the total down to about 30% of the growth total.", "And I guess I\u2019m just wondering with the Saudi\u2019s changing their pricing and I guess I\u2019m just wondering is there a chance where some of the infrastructure in North American crude investments that have been made, do we get to a point where some of that isn\u2019t quite as necessary? Do you still have the flexibility to shift back and forth to foreign versus domestic runs in your system?", "Gary Simmons", "Yes, Blake. I would tell you I think we\u2019ve been very selective on what we should invest capital around logistics. We still think it makes sense that as you talked about, we haven\u2019t done anything to lose our optionality that we can continue to import the foreign barrels and Saudi makes more sense around those barrels, we haven\u2019t lost any of our optionality to be able to do that.", "Joe Gorder", "Yes, Blake, Gary makes a great point here. I mean, what we\u2019re dealing with the markets that are really volatile. And the opportunity today is the opportunity today and it will change tomorrow or the next day. Again, one thing that is certain is if you don\u2019t have the logistics in place to take advantage of the opportunity when it\u2019s there is gone.", "And so, we feel very good about the projects that we\u2019ve undertaken. I mean, the rate approved projects to move heavy sour crudes in are very good projects for us as are the unloading facilities that we\u2019ve got. Our commitment to pipelines I think are very solid for us going forward.", "And the fact that you\u2019ve got the pressure on the crude price right now affecting the start is willing us to move barrels back in. At the end of the day it\u2019s going to be good because we\u2019re going to see pressure on all of the barrels as they try to find all-mineral refinery going forward.", "So, we feel pretty good about what we\u2019ve done and what we\u2019ve got on the place to do going forward.", "Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil", "Okay. Thanks. The second question is on exports. We\u2019ve seen record high utilization levels earlier this year and you mentioned product exports in your press release. For one, can you give us a capacity number of what your current capacity is?", "And is that kind of one of the main drivers that\u2019s been driving this higher utilization? Because when I look at my modeling it seems like the earnings in 2012 were very comparable with where we\u2019re going to land this year and basically that insinuates it\u2019s not really that much more incentive from an economic standpoint to run, so is it simply a function of additional export capacity?", "John Locke", "Yes, what we did in the third quarter is we did 90,000 barrels a day of gasoline exports, that time early we went to Mexico and Latin America. We did 227,000 barrels of straight distillers and 240,000 barrels of diesel when you include the currency.", "The distilled and exports went to Latin America and Europe. We still have quite a bit of capacity left. On the gasoline side, we can probably give about 255,000 barrels a day, it\u2019s around 400,000 barrels a day this to the next quarter. So, we still have a lot of room to increase our exports.", "But for us, this is just an optimization that we do every day, Blake. And it\u2019s just the matter of where we can get the best net-net for the barrels. So, when you look today, the domestic diesel market is very strong. And so, some of our diesel exports have slowed down a bit as we send barrels to the best net-net market which today is some of the domestic markets.", "Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Our following question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America", "Hi, thanks. Good morning everyone. Good morning Joe.", "Joe Gorder", "Hello Doug.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America", "And by the way, Joe congrats on your ascending to the Chairmanship as well. It\u2019s nice to see with all of the titles.", "Joe Gorder", "Thank you.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America", "My, you\u2019ve see what Tesoro has done here recently by talking about a full-service MLP. And obviously a lot of \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of different strategies seem to be going on within the space I guess Phillips is pursuing a similar kind of thing. I guess I\u2019m curious as to looking outside of the refining backyard, so to speak, how do you view your MLP vehicle strategically in terms of maybe moving beyond just what we would associate as a normal course of business in the refining?", "Joe Gorder", "I\u2019ll tell you Doug. We do look at it as an entity that\u2019s there to support the core business operations of Valero Energy. I mean, we\u2019ve set it up with that in tens, we set it up as a traditional logistics MLP that was going to primarily focus on transportation and terminalling assets.", "Obviously the market\u2019s changing here a little bit, people are making decisions to quit, a lot of their party assets in some cases in support some of the margin, the fuels margin in the assets also. I mean, that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll take a look at going forward. But our view of it is a very attractive low cost of capital way to support Valero\u2019s core business.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay. I appreciate. I\u2019m going to just I\u2019ll take some follow-up offline because there are multiple costs seeking down with one but. I guess my follow-up is really, could we get your latest thinking on the fuels market, generally the gasoline market in particular.", "You still have little bit refinery kind of more fold recycled then might found a buyer. And obviously there is a whole crude context has come down. So I\u2019m just kind of curious as to, what\u2019s your prognosis for the Atlantic Basin gasoline market and should we expect the kind of resilience in parts we\u2019ve seen in these last couple of years, of these known supply risk emerging on the margins? And I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.", "John Locke", "Thanks Joe.", "Joe Gorder", "Yes, I guess two separate questions, I don\u2019t know, Lane, do you want to address the root one first.", "John Locke", "Go ahead on the gasoline.", "Gary Simmons", "Yes. Overall, I think we see gasoline demand in the Atlantic Basin fairly flat. And so, a lot of the question on the Atlantic Basin is really going to be what happens in Western Europe, and do you have rationalization occur in Western Europe, and that would probably be the big driver on the overall supply-demand balances in the Atlantic Basin moving forward.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America", "Would that assume, you don\u2019t have an acute exports on higher I\u2019m guessing?", "Gary Simmons", "Yes.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay. And on the pipe of diesel, do you see, in part of the Gulf Coast markets, particularly?", "Joe Gorder", "Hi Doug, look, I think that project is going to be a bit challenged. And I mean, if they\u2019re producing gasoline, it\u2019s going to have to go somewhere so we\u2019ll probably see at the market. But I would stack up the competitive position of our Gulf Coast refineries against any refinery like that.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay. All right, you don\u2019t have the sum. Thanks a lot Joe. I appreciate your time.", "Joe Gorder", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our following question comes from Brad Heffer from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Brad Heffer \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Good morning, everyone.", "Joe Gorder", "Good morning.", "Brad Heffer \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "So, going back, sort of to an earlier question, has there been any change as to the demand that you guys are seeing in export markets currently?", "Joe Gorder", "No, I would tell you from the third quarter to the fourth quarter what I would expect is that our exports will probably be up a little bit, most of that will be gasoline exports will increase into the fourth quarter, just to the exports probably fairly flat which is difficult for us. Gasoline, typically the exports are little stronger in the fourth quarter and the first quarter and follow-up when we hear the December driving season here in the U.S.", "Brad Heffer \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, got you. And then, you had a competitor last week talking about sort of a tight MIA market on the Gulf Coast. I was wondering if you guys have seen that and having difficulty to getting sort of the heavier crudes in the door?", "Joe Gorder", "Our MIA volumes for the third quarter were right at our contract levels and up about 20,000 barrels a day what we had in the second quarter.", "Brad Heffer \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our following question comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great. Thanks good morning gentlemen. A couple of questions, maybe one, if you could talk a little bit about capture rate across very strong capture rate we saw across the portfolio this quarter, and I realize the following crude prices probably increase the profitability at the bottom of the barrel.", "But outside of that, can you talk about maybe any other drivers of strong profitability and how sustainable maybe some of those might be on go-forward quarters?", "Ashley Smith", "Hi Ryan, this is Ashley Smith. Yes, we performed well we had a limited turnaround activity in the quarter, so other quarters might not be as comparable when we had more turnaround activity. But a lot of the capture rate is partially due to our investments and hydrocrackers are running well. In fact, St. Charles hydrocracker is running in a \u2013 consistingly running in excessive capacity.", "In addition, you saw some typical market stuff that\u2019s not in the indicator such as DGO as well we achieved in the quarter and that paid us well too.", "Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. So, probably some outage in non-recurring things but maybe at least underlying there some recurring things from your past investments, I guess it\u2019s in there?", "Ashley Smith", "That is \u2013 that\u2019s basically, you\u2019re always going to have some movement in items that are not in the indicator. But we also are seeing benefits from our previous investments particularly in the hydrocrackers.", "Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thanks. And then maybe one more on and I apologize that this is, I missed it over the call. On crude flows from Corpus feeds in Canada, I know you guys have moved some crude that\u2019s gone around there to the East Coast of Canada refining system. I mean, how much have you been moving and then how do you expect that they would change in 2015?", "Joe Gorder", "Yes, so we moved 124,000 barrels a day of Gulf Coast crude to Quebec, that didn\u2019t all move through Corpus. Our project at Corpus will be online and probably functional in quarter terms, for the first quarter. So, we\u2019ll start using our corporate assets in the first quarter. The volume we move was largely over third party logistics assets that we move to Quebec.", "Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And if you just look at, I mean, when you look at the 2015 dynamics both on the line 9B, eventual startup and capacity. Is that a number that you think you can grow substantially in 2015 or are there some limits there?", "Joe Gorder", "Well, when line 9 starts up, we will run less barrels from the U.S. Gulf Coast than what we ran in the third quarter and we\u2019ll supply more Quebec\u2019s flowing through line 9.", "Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. All right, I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our following question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Hi, good morning.", "Joe Gorder", "Hello Roger.", "Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Just to pick up a little bit more on sort of the CapEx for \u201815, and maybe for \u201816 with the crude topping projects in I guess Corpus and Houston. And then maybe what the decision timeframe is on that?", "And I\u2019m thinking also all right, crude softened up a little bit, and they see some slowdown eventually in U.S. production if that has any impact on your thinking? And then whether or not the recent developments on the crude exports side, the DOE or EIA\u2019s report on gasoline prices being driven by brand not by domestic prices is sort of shot across the bow for being in favor of exports \u2013 crude exports?", "Lane Riggs", "Hi Roger, this is Lane. To answer your questions about crude units, there are crudes and they are under construction, we\u2019re building on them. We\u2019ll right now, we\u2019re forecasting will be complete, mechanically complete into next year for oil and roughly at the beginning of the first quarter of \u201816, somewhere in that timeframe.", "In terms of the project basis economics, we assume that LLS is parity of brand and that\u2019s not what we recorded for those are still good projects. They aggregate around 30% in that pricing environment.", "So we still feel it\u2019s a really good project. Ultimately not backing out our intermediate purchases, we\u2019re beginning, we\u2019re long converging capacity, sort of the day, we have to get to the market to buy intermediate in West Africa and then in the North Sea. And this sort of changes our feedstock the way we\u2019re going to feed our system.", "And what was the second question?", "Joe Gorder", "Yes, Roger, could you restate your second question.", "Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Yes, it was just more along the lines of I was pointing out with the EIA having come out with that report on gasoline, whether that had any impact on these projects overall. I mean, originally these were going to be online in \u201815, so I was just trying to figure out if you were maybe the question is why are they now \u201816 instead of \u201815, or just delayed on construction or was there \u2013 you\u2019re looking at it internally and showing well, if things change maybe we don\u2019t want to go forward?", "Lane Riggs", "Now, the projects were always sort of in the fourth quarter \u201815, first quarter \u201816 and it\u2019s about mechanical completions versus oil and bay. There has not been any delay with them or not, it\u2019s about these projects and we\u2019re going forward with them. Because we\u2019re not really about trying to produce more gasoline and more diesel this is about trying to feed our system more economically right with domestic role, which were imported in release.", "Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay. And then, as you look at the fourth quarter here relative to the third quarter in terms of what we\u2019ve seen in crude differentials. How is it shaking up for you, I mean, I know we can look at the screens and make our guesses but are you seeing anything significantly different in terms of the Gulf Coast, let\u2019s call it the light-heavies here?", "Joe Gorder", "No, not anything too significant. Overall when you look at the LLS market in Mars, Mars continues to price competitive with LLS. And I think the heavies continue to price competitively with Mars.", "As you move west in the Gulf, you start to see a bigger advantage to run some of the light sweep, but that\u2019s not too different from what we saw in the third quarter.", "Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our following question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan", "Hi, good morning.", "Joe Gorder", "Good morning.", "John Locke", "Good morning, Phil.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan", "Yes, a couple of questions. First, first one is just on the cash flow for the quarter and just the \u2013 what\u2019s the working capital contribution might have been. I know there is a few sizable negatives in the first quarter for working capital. I wasn\u2019t sure if there was a reversal of the big positive over the fourth quarter of last year, just kind of where we stand on working capital in general and how to think about that in the fourth quarter?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Okay. Our change in cash for the quarter was an increase of $700 million. And of that amount about $300 million of that was attributable to working capital so we had an increase in our payables receivable in that. So that\u2019s \u2013 I mean, that\u2019s going to be a timing issue most likely.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan", "And for the fourth quarter, any thoughts on whether there is additional contribution?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Towards the end of the year, as we manage around the life of inventory levels there, things so that we could have a reduction in our working capital.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. And then, just with respect to the cash flow generation profile in general obviously, very strong and your stock is cheaper around free cash flow yield than most refiners.", "So I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about kind of impacting that valuation rather, you\u2019ve talked \u2013 obviously talked about the MLP structure as an opportunity but whether it\u2019s increasing buybacks or meaningful step-up in the dividend or something else you can do to change the game? I\u2019m just curious how you\u2019re thinking about things?", "Joe Gorder", "Phil, that\u2019s a good question. I mean, when we look at the use of cash, we\u2019ve got some very good projects. So we\u2019re going to continue with the projects that we have underway these very strong returns and they make us much more efficient.", "And we realize that there is a balance between investments for growth in returning cash to shareholders. Now, I think our actions in the third quarter and through this year really reflect its realization. And we\u2019ve had two dividend increases and we\u2019ve had increased share repurchases while continuing with the growth projects that improve our overall business.", "And to the extent that we have free cash flow going forward and to the extent that there are, tremendous capital projects to use the cash for. I think you can see us continue on this path. And we\u2019ll be comfortable with returning it to shareholders.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll turn it on.", "Operator", "Our following question comes from Mohit Bhardwaj from Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Mohit Bhardwaj \u2013 Citigroup", "Thanks for taking my question. Joe, if you could just tackle this follow-up on your comments about the landing mason. If you look at where the crude prices are right now and it seems like there is excess crude supply in the Atlantic Basin. What do you think it does for the refining business in the U.S. and how do you think production moves or these supply moves going forward?", "Joe Gorder", "Okay, I\u2019ll let Gary Simmons give you a shot at that.", "Gary Simmons", "Very difficult to state. I think the key question there, is what is the marginal cost of production in North America versus other regions in the globe, and of course we\u2019re not an upstream company. So, I don\u2019t really know how all that shakes out.", "I think the assumption you\u2019re kind of making with the question is that as crude price falls in the North American production falls with, the flat price falls. And that may happen, but I really don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not sure to be able to comment on that.", "Mohit Bhardwaj \u2013 Citigroup", "Right. So, if you look at third quarter versus fourth quarter, one other thing that you said for the third quarter was that you were utilizing the front of the refining, a lot more is sort of little bit more in utilizing the downstream, it\u2019s little less and where the VGO prices and availability of light speed crude. Or do you think that\u2019s still the case in the fourth quarter?", "Joe Gorder", "Lane.", "Lane Riggs", "I\u2019ll try to take a shot at this, this is Lane. Our signals in the third quarter were obviously max on everything. And to the extent that we\u2019re signaled around high crude rate half way to the 1,000 crude margins. And we had really good converging unit margins because VGO prices were inexpensive.", "We still see those signals going forward in the fourth quarter, they\u2019re not as strong as they were in the third quarter but they\u2019re still have signals put on our system relatively bold.", "Mohit Bhardwaj \u2013 Citigroup", "Right. And one final one from me, just on the diamond pipeline. So, just to be clear, you guys have not exercised the 50% option on the pipelines yet? And if you could also follow-up on if you look at some of your peers were talking about doing a study on cap line and you were the main consumer as far as Memphis refinery is concerned on cap line. Does diamond pipeline option also allow you to sort of if there is a reversible cap line to participate in that?", "Joe Gorder", "Rich, do you want to?", "Rich Lashway", "Yes, I\u2019ll take a crack at that. So, the diamond pipeline is progressing. It is connected it will be connected to the cap line. So, today, we\u2019re connected \u2013 Memphis is connected to the cap line pipeline. So we have dual supply source into the Memphis refinery potentially and be able to take advantage of a reversal.", "I think they\u2019re just undertaking a study as we speak, so maybe some time before that actually becomes reality.", "Joe Gorder", "As far as the option on the diamond pipeline.", "Rich Lashway", "So, yes, I\u2019m sorry, I missed that first part. So, on the option, we have not exercised the option. We have that option through early January of \u201816 to make that decision.", "Mohit Bhardwaj \u2013 Citigroup", "All right. Thank you for taking my questions.", "Joe Gorder", "Sure Mohit.", "Operator", "Our following question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi, good afternoon guys.", "Joe Gorder", "Good morning, Evan.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Joe, can you walk us through the decision to reduce 2015 CapEx sequentially from \u201814 and is that a top-down decision to raise distributable cash or a function of higher hurdle rates or the project queue, particularly in relation to midstream?", "Joe Gorder", "No, is it related to the midstream?", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "It is just in total, you ditched down sequentially, is that a desire to increase distributable cash flow or a function of how those each projects shook out in the review process?", "Joe Gorder", "No, it\u2019s the latter. As we \u2013 we started with a list of projects. And if you look at it from the refining perspective, Lane has the process that he goes through tremendous rigorous review. And I think the fact that he\u2019s got this rigorous review shows up in the timing on the methanol project, right.", "It\u2019s a big project, and we want to be sure that we\u2019ve got the capital right. So he\u2019s going through this in a very methodical way, just to be sure on target. We put together a list of prospective projects and we do this every year. And what we\u2019re doing now is we, our list of projects that we talk about are those we scrubbed at the point that we feel that there is a reasonable probability that we\u2019re going to do them.", "So, the projects we feel we could execute next year from either the refining side or the logistic side, as we\u2019ve included in the budget, we feel we\u2019re fairly committed to that 2.65 million numbers, $150 million from ethanol is kind of let\u2019s see what we get.", "But it is a kind of bottom-up, what projects do we have to take a look at and then we look at it from the top-down and say these are the ones that we want to undertake based on the return thresholds.", "There is though, a general view among this management team that we\u2019d like to try to return more cash to shareholders. And so, having a capital and having our capital at this level is something we\u2019re very comfortable with. We believe it creates that proper value between, proper balance between continued investment to grow and optimize the business and rewarding the shareholder for his loyalty to us.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "And just for clarification, I think in the opening, you stated that midstream is 50% of that growth CapEx, it releases 30% which would be sequentially down. Is it, which of the two is midstream is a function of growth?", "Joe Gorder", "No, I think if you look at \u201814 versus \u201815, we\u2019ve got significant investment for example in the rail carts in 2014. That falls off. We have it intentionally tried to reduce the investments that we\u2019re making in the midstream side of the business. Okay, what we\u2019ve got is probably timing issues here, developing the projects in the form where we\u2019re willing to put them in to the capital budget, that\u2019s all we\u2019re dealing with.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. So, mid \u2013 plus $390 million I guess its $390 million I presume if it\u2019s that 30% figure. And then, should we, is that right?", "Ashley Smith", "Hi Evan, this is Ashley. Yes, you\u2019re correct. So, we\u2019re going from \u201814, it was over 50% of our capital with the logistics and it\u2019s because of rail power is falling off, it\u2019s going to be next year, little over 30%. And you\u2019re right, it\u2019s right around $400 million in logistics.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great. So, the MLP, I believe the EBITDA exists be around $70 million-ish kind of estimate, is that reasonable?", "Ashley Smith", "It certainly keeps growing.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Right, great. All right, good luck. I look forward to your analysis of larger scope of droppable assets and good results guys.", "Joe Gorder", "Thanks a lot.", "Ashley Smith", "Thanks Evan.", "Operator", "Our following question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hi, pretty soon we\u2019re just going to call this logistics conference calls as opposed to refining conference calls.", "Joe Gorder", "We did notice that Ed.", "Gary Simmons", "If they\u2019re truly higher, we\u2019ll do it.", "Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Yes. I will be most pulled arbitrage is pretty obvious. But, so let\u2019s carry on that lane. So, diamond pipe, any sort of color on the EBITDA that that might contribute if you guys work with that plan or overall investment level?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Well, I think we\u2019ve talked about the cost being approximately $900 million, and when we look at a proper most pulling around 10 times that would give you $90 million and 50% of that would kind of back you into $45 million of EBITDA.", "Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Great. And then, another strategic, I mean, obviously I don\u2019t know, you must have seen the EPG Oil-Tanking Acquisition which was somewhat elevated multiple. And obviously assuming that there was going to be a lot of export drugs to obviously drive throughputs and drive that multiple down.", "So, I look at your logistics and your refining system in Texas, I look at what Phillip 66 has done at Vermont and the Bakken pipe project as associated with that. I look at the Permian and the Eagle Ford and still growing, and I think there has to be something to be done. So, how, am I off in terms of the landscape or while that, competitive barriers for you being able to compete as effectively?", "Joe Gorder", "I mean, there is competitive barriers to everything right, but there is no reason that we can\u2019t compete effectively with this. And as I mentioned earlier, we talked about the capital. We\u2019ve included in the capital budget project we\u2019re highly confident we\u2019re going to do. The one exception is that methanol plant, I\u2019m not saying we will or won\u2019t do it we\u2019re just still in the process of looking at it.", "But we\u2019ve got a lot of logistics projects right now that Rich Lashway and his team are in the process of developing. They\u2019re not far enough well to include in the capital budget but they would be logistics type path that would use to support the existing refining portfolio. And there\u2019s some of them that look like they are very good projects.", "Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then, I should ask a refining question. The turnarounds obviously were pretty high as you connected up a lot of the hydrocrakers and did lot of reliability work in \u201812 and \u201813, and obviously still in the second quarter in off seeds.", "Easy to see, how good your throughputs were in the third quarter. As you look out from here, I mean, do you feel that you have a more reliable refining system or is that still more work that needs to be done to get the reliability to where you need it to be? And maybe a comment on general turnaround schedules into next year?", "Lane Riggs", "Yes, this is Lane. So, our last really big liability projects we did and we\u2019re looking at systems that in the quarter and that were replacing the reactors. We went and now we\u2019re in the process of starting up the Meraux hydrocracker which should begin, sort of reconfigure in that refiner.", "We don\u2019t really have anything quite like that going forward in our capital plan. It\u2019s sort of, we\u2019re going to be in premium, doesn\u2019t really impact our throughputs per say. So, really from here going forward, we just have our round phase, our regimen of standard turnaround execution themselves.", "Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Yes, that was all things equal we should expect that sort of overall utilization next year and perhaps a year after than the last three year run-rate?", "Lane Riggs", "Yes, and we always, I mean, our number one focus on everything we do is to try, with first is safety. But right behind that is really liability. And we do never squeeze for reliability stand, is actually slowing. And we\u2019re pretty confident that we have spent the right money on the right things to maintain a higher liability rate in our system.", "Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Very clear, thanks so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Hi, good morning everybody.", "Joe Gorder", "Hi Sam.", "Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Lots have been covered, I guess, I\u2019ll stick to ethanol if refining questions are I say we do. So, the business has responded really well to lower corn prices obviously results have been getting better and better. Just strategically, do you think you can, it can tolerate any kind of stabilizing business component, a tolling agreement or something like that that might make it eligible for a different structure or is this just normal volatility in the industry with a really good corn crop this year in your mind?", "Joe Gorder", "Martin, you want to speak to the market aspect of this.", "Martin Parish", "Sure, Sam, this is Martin Parish. On the market aspect, we like where we\u2019re positioned. Production has been high as you can see inventories have only built like a million barrels in total for the year. So, we feel really good, we\u2019re positioned exports are high. We think margins going forward are going to be good, we like the business.", "Now, as far as the totaling type deal, I mean, Sam, what do you think in there, is this a question about doing what to monetize the business or?", "Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Yes, I suppose, I mean, it\u2019s been a pretty steady stream of better on better results in the segment until, you mentioned your similar parts earlier, I was just wondering if this sectors into it at all, I know that if maybe you see earnings getting more reliable or visible in the segment?", "Joe Gorder", "We like the delay at these levels forever. But I think 2012 it was, it would remind us there can be a lot of volatility in this business too. And we\u2019ve looked at this the ethanol plant portfolio and if you look at costs, there just aren\u2019t a whole bunch of them first of all.", "And it tends to trade at the same multiples as the refining assets trade at. So, there is really not a big significant incentive for whether monetization through try to create additional value. At the same time, I would say that we\u2019re very pleased with the operation of the business. Martin has done a fine job leading it he\u2019s got a very settled team.", "And the cash flow is being produced by these assets is tremendous. And we feel like having it as part of our core business. And we do believe long-term that ethanol is going to be fundamentally part of the fuel mix instead of having this businesses part of our portfolio makes sense.", "Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Okay. And then, just touching on that as a follow-up and the RFS seemed to be a little bit behind schedule on an update here. It seems like your thesis is quite out based on refining margins, that rings were kind of being pass through. Is that, do you see that as giving momentum into maybe mandate reduction or any kind of movement at all if you can get any update that would be great?", "Gary Simmons", "I don\u2019t know if we have lot of insight here. I think we feel like it\u2019s going to be after the elections here before we get the new RBO. And it\u2019s so late in the year at this stage that we don\u2019t think it will be potentially different from where we were last year.", "Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Okay, great.", "Joe Gorder", "It is pretty interesting that we\u2019re here in November we don\u2019t know what the 2014 obligation number is yet.", "Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Interesting is one word for it, yes, I guess.", "Joe Gorder", "Thank you, Pal.", "Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Okay. Well, thanks a lot guys. Have a good one.", "Joe Gorder", "Okay, you too.", "Operator", "Our following question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Hi, good morning everyone.", "Joe Gorder", "Hi, good morning Paul.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research", "You\u2019ve covered a lot of ground here with getting to the point of the ethanol MLP. I wanted to ask you a follow-up on that one. Could we just sort of be able to gather a bit here Joe, what concerns I mean, I think we were hoping for quite a significant debt down in CapEx late this year?", "And what I\u2019m listening to is that you\u2019re competing in a mature market, but you\u2019re still spending on these numbers about doubled your maintenance or stay-in business CapEx, would be remained at being obviously growth CapEx? Can\u2019t we get to a place where you are much more aggressive about cash return to shareholders as the kind of predominant aim?", "I heard good stuff about you potentially not doing any methanol project but at the same time there seems to be a potential for logistics and to step up, and I would say, to me, this is a CapEx number which is kind of flat next year with this year whereas we were hoping for something that is quite a bit lower? Thanks.", "Joe Gorder", "Okay, Paul, I know this has been your perspective. We look at the capital, okay. We got $1.4 billion or $1.5 billion that we spend on the assets to maintain them the way we want to maintain them.", "We\u2019ve got the crude unit project which have 25% plus rates of return, and they\u2019re not putting anymore juice in the market per say. They\u2019re optimization projects. We\u2019ve got the opportunity to drop at higher multiples logistics assets. We\u2019re going to continue to invest in those. If you extract the methanol plant $150 million our place holder from the $2.8 billion or $2.65 billion that is well below the $3 billion that we forecasted this year.", "And we don\u2019t arbitrarily select projects to undertake to outlook if the alternative use for the cash. And so, if we\u2019re deciding to do a capital project, I think we\u2019re very comfortable making our day in sports in sharing what the returns are going to look like on this and why it\u2019s a better alternative to us and repurchasing shares for example.", "So, I do think that this management team has reduced the capital spend, I think if we look at it going forward with the rigor we have in the process and the thresholds we\u2019re setting for acceptance of the projects, we\u2019re going to see this continue to be at this level. It may continue to decline. But I don\u2019t want to not do projects that improve the operation of the business and have good returns when they are available to us.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Yes, then I guess the plan is really what you\u2019re saying is you have to see European refineries shut down, it will also make room for some of the stuff. And thus, it\u2019s the concern we have there is too much capital going into the business overall that\u2019s kind of dependent on the competitive environment moving into favor?", "Joe Gorder", "Okay.", "Gary Simmons", "Paul, keep in mind, our projects are designed principally to reduce feedstock cost. And if we have cheaper crude, we\u2019re going to shut down that\u2019s going to force excess capacity and you have to shut down, so we will become more competitive.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Great. And just my final part of this is, what do you think a competitive return to shareholders is, you\u2019ve got a couple of percent yield. Can you just talk a little bit more about that Joe and I\u2019ll leave it there? Thanks.", "Joe Gorder", "I\u2019m sorry Paul, real quick you\u2019re talking about is VLP or are you talking about Valero Energy?", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Well, just yes, for example if I own a Valero share, how do you think, what do you think of this being a good return to the shareholder in terms of you saying that you respect full of cash return to shareholders?", "Joe Gorder", "From a cash perspective or just total?", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Yes, total side. I mean, people obviously prefer regular dividend but I understand that they look at the business makes sense, a tough commitment to discuss?", "Joe Gorder", "Okay. And I think what we would say is we have a cost of capital, we got a cost of capital there which", "We haven\u2019t set a target per say, but 10% range, 12% range and it\u2019s certainly going to be the dividend, the share repurchase aspect of it. But we recognize that we\u2019ve got a need to exceed counts of capital on our projects in our business.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Understood. Thank you very much, Joe.", "Operator", "Last question comes from Allen Good from Morningstar. Please go ahead.", "Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar", "Good morning, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be brief, it\u2019s getting here late. Suncor CEO made some comments last week about shipping medium heavy to Europe and down the U.S. Atlantic Coast and even to a Gulf Coast. Do you think there is a viable alternative long-term to get greater, heavy volumes to the Gulf Coast and could that even be a potentially a source of opportunity for Pembroke at some point?", "Joe Gorder", "Yes. So, of course for us, I think we feel like there is, better options to get Canadian heavy to the U.S. Gulf Coast and taking it to the East Coast and around. But absence of any of those opportunities moving forward, we definitely see it\u2019s an option to get additional heavy side to the Gulf. And we also see that there is an opportunity to move the Canadian barrels to Pembroke as well.", "Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar", "Great, thanks. And then, could you just give us an update on the projects you have either to weigh or sort of on a planned stages to increase competitiveness of California and get some discount crude out there and just your latest thoughts on your assets out there as well?", "Lane Riggs", "Allen, this is Lane. That would also we are still working on the Venetian rail project. Our comments her are, we\u2019re working on those, answering all the questions and we sort of expect that to be finished in December. We think permits would be issued in the first quarter.", "That\u2019s really the \u2013 in terms of the strategic capital that we have spending on the West Coast, that\u2019s pretty much it. Everything else would be very careful in our, spend on the West Coast. Because we have obviously great opportunities in our Gulf Coast and our Mid-Continent market on North Eastern capital.", "So, we\u2019re very careful, we run a very tight shift out there and that\u2019s sort of how we\u2019re managing the West Coast.", "Joe Gorder", "And then, from a strategic perspective, we think it\u2019s great to have good assets with strong management teams out there that provide us the option to take advantage of the strong market environment we have from time to time out there.", "Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar", "Great.

My name is John, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. ", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Ashley Smith, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Smith, you may begin.", "Ashley Smith", "Okay, thank you, John, and good morning and welcome to Valero Energy's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Bill Klesse, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Ciskowski, our CFO; Gene Edwards, our Chief Development Officer; Joe Gorder, our Chief Commercial Officer; Kim Bowers, EVP and General Counsel; and Jean Bernier, EVP and President of Ultramar. If you have not received our earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com.", "Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions about reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact me after the call.", "Before we get started, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future, are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that can cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Mike.", "Michael Ciskowski", "Thanks, Ashley, and thank you for joining us today. As noted in the release, we reported second quarter 2011 net income attributable to Valero's stockholders from continuing operations of $745 million or $1.30 per share. Our second quarter 2011 operating income was $1.3 billion versus operating income of $904 million in the second quarter of 2010. The second quarter refining throughput margin was $11.41 per barrel, which is an increase of $1.84 per barrel over the second quarter of '10 and our highest second quarter margin in nearly 3 years.", "The increase in throughput margins compared to the second quarter of '10 was due to higher margins for gasoline and diesel, plus wider discounts for heavy-sour crude oils on the Gulf Coast and light-sweet crude oils in the Mid-Continent. ", "One of the drivers of our year-over-year gain in throughput margin was the increase in gasoline and diesel margins. For example, the Gulf Coast gasoline margin per barrel versus LLS increased to 29% from $7.97 in the second quarter of '10 to $10.26 in the second quarter of '11. Looking at the Gulf Coast ULSD versus LLS, margins per barrel increased 16% from $9.88 in the second quarter of 2010 to $11.49 in the second quarter of 2011. So far in the third quarter, margins have moved significantly higher to average around $13 per barrel for gasoline and $16.50 per barrel for ULSD. ", "Another driver for our margin gain over last year was crude oil discounts. The Maya heavy-sour crude oil discount versus LLS increased to 21% from $12 in the second quarter of 2010 to $14.58 per barrel in the second quarter of 2011. The Maya discount has narrowed some in the third quarter with the July average down to around $12 per barrel.", "An additional benefit for Valero came from WTI-type and Eagle Ford crudes pricing at a substantial discount to LLS. The WTI discount to LLS increased more than $13 per barrel from $2.26 in the second quarter of 2010 to $15.47 in the second quarter of 2011. The discount helped our McKee, Ardmore and Three Rivers refineries where their crude oil is priced at or below WTI.  In the third quarter, the WTI discount to LLS has continued to widen with the July average of just above $16 per barrel. ", "As noted in the release, we are increasing the use of discounted Eagle Ford crude in our system. During the second quarter, we processed an average of 37,000 barrels per day of Eagle Ford, an increase of 12,000 barrels per day over the first quarter. This crude replaced expensive waterborne sweet crudes saving around $16 per barrel in the second quarter. We are continuing to look for additional ways to use more of this discounted crude. We plan to process 25,000 barrels per day of Eagle Ford crude at our Corpus Christi refinery during the third quarter and our Three Rivers refinery should have the ability to process nearly 60,000 barrels per day of Eagle Ford crude by the end of this year.", "Continuing with other items, our second quarter 2011 refinery throughput volume averaged to 2.3 million barrels per day; that was up 136,000 barrels per day from the second quarter of '10. The increase in throughput volumes was primarily due to the restart of operations at the Aruba refinery. Refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter of 2011 were $3.86 per barrel, which was higher than guidance due to the higher than expected maintenance, catalyst and chemical costs. ", "Our Retail segment reported a record high for a second quarter with $135 million of operating income, mainly attributable to stronger retail fuel margins.", "U.S. retail had $87 million of operating income in the second quarter and the Canadian retail operation earned $48 million of operating income in the second quarter, which was its highest quarter on record. ", "Our Ethanol segment earned $64 million of operating income in the second quarter, which was up $20 million from the first quarter of 2011 and up $29 million from the second quarter of last year on higher gross margins. Also in the second quarter, we achieved our highest ever quarterly production rate at 3.4 million gallons per day.", "In the second quarter, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $151 million; depreciation and amortization expense was $386 million; net interest expense was $107 million and the effective tax rate on our continuing operations in the second quarter was 37.6%. ", "Regarding cash flows in the second quarter, capital spending was $664 million, which includes $133 million of turnaround and catalyst expenditures and we paid the $29 million in dividends. Also in the second quarter, we repaid $208 million in maturing debt and spent $37 million to acquire a terminal and pipelines in eastern Kentucky.", "With respect to our balance sheet at the end of June, total debt was $7.6 billion, cash was $4.1 billion and our debt to capitalization ratio, net of cash, was 18%. ", "At the end of the second quarter, we also had approximately -- or we had $4.1 billion of additional liquidity available.", "We remain focused on our strategic priorities. In addition to making progress on our cost savings goal, we progressed on key investments at our St. Charles and Memphis refineries and our hydrocracker and hydrogen projects remain on track to complete in 2012. We also look forward to the closing on our acquisition of the Pembroke refinery and the marketing and logistics assets in the U.K. and Ireland on August 1.", "In conclusion, Valero is in great financial position with plenty of liquidity and investment-grade credit rating.", "Going forward, we have substantial potential for earnings growth with improved refining margins, the Pembroke acquisition and the expectation of significant contributions from our economic growth projects. ", "Now I'll turn it over to Ashley to cover the earnings model subjects.", "Ashley Smith", "Okay, thanks, Mike. For modeling our third quarter operations, you should expect refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: the Gulf Coast at 1.42 million to 1.46 million barrels per day: Mid-Continent at 420,000 to 430,000 barrels per day: the West Coast at 270,000 to 280,000 barrels per day: and Northeast with Qu\u00e9bec only at 200,000 to 210,000 barrels per day. ", "After we close on the Pembroke acquisition, our Northeast region will be combined with -- it will be changed to North Atlantic region and the Pembroke refinery will be combined into that region with the Qu\u00e9bec refinery. And we expect throughputs for the third quarter to average between 370, 000 and 380,000 barrels per day.  Refining cash operating expenses are expected to be around $3.80 per barrel across our system in the third quarter. ", "Regarding our ethanol operations in the third quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 3.3 million gallons per day and operating expenses should average approximately $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.03 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. ", "With respect to some of the other items for the third quarter, we expect G&A expense, excluding depreciation, to be around $175 million; net interest expense should be around $95 million; total depreciation and amortization expense should be around $390 million; and our effective tax rate should be approximately 37%. ", "We will now open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Just a quick question. I guess in Q1, there were some one-offs and there was also the hedge and you add that back and all calculation was up to just under $1 of earnings. And then in Q2, you got to $1.30 in a stronger macro environment. So I'm just wondering, how -- were you disappointed with the level of Q2 earnings? Or is Q2, do you think, a good expectation as a base to go forward given some of the volatility we've had in Q1 and Q2 in terms of EPS estimates?", "Ashley Smith", "I think we were pleased with the results. We'd always like to have higher results but if you look at our capture rates given the market environment, we captured right in line with historical averages or we beat those averages in most regions. Costs were a little higher than expected, but not too much. So all in all, I think it's a fair representation of what we can achieve in this market environment.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And then my second question is more of a question around as we get closer to the EBITDA increases that should come with the investments that you're making, particularly in some of the hydrocrackers, can you talk about whether you're going to give some of that cash back to shareholders in terms of a -- as the debt comes down and as the cash flow increases?", "William Klesse", "This is Klesse, Ed. We'll look at all of that. Right now, we want to have adequate cash to go ahead and finish these projects. We've told you in the past this year's capital spending will be, as Mike said, and it's $3 billion to $3.2 billion, we believe. And next year's probably going to be in the same range as we finish our projects. So for guidance, I tell you we're at $3.1 billion for 2012. That will let us finish our projects, and then we'll see how our cash position is affected. Obviously, we're going to close on Pembroke in the U.K. and Ireland with cash, crude oil prices up some, so our intent is to buy all that inventory. So clearly, we'll pull our cash down here in the next week, but then we expect to build it back up because we see a very good third quarter, just as you see. Where we missed consensus, which I think is your question and looking -- when you actually look at what happened, we had a lightning strike at Port Arthur, we had a couple of other things that in a way were act of God. Our mechanical reliability is improving everyday so I mean, we have these acts of God but as you go through the third quarter, July's just about done. It's going to be an excellent month for us. So we missed consensus here in the second quarter but right now, we're going to beat consensus in the third quarter.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And just to be clear in terms of the thought process around returning cash, you just want to make more progress in terms of the hydrocrackers before making such a decision?", "William Klesse", "That is absolutely correct.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI Group.", "Doug Terreson - ISI Group Inc.", "Bill, industry-wide, we've obviously had some demand destruction over the past couple of months. And on this point, I wanted to see whether or not you guys were seeing any improvement in demand for gasoline and diesel in your major markets. Is there any bounds anywhere out there?", "William Klesse", "We have not seen that. I'm going to let Joe -- Joe Gorder is going to answer you. I think [indiscernible]", "Joseph Gorder", "It's been fairly flat, and we're off a little bit on gasoline and diesel here today. We keep looking for those glimmers of hope. But I think on the gasoline side, as long as you got unemployment where it is, it's going to be very tough here, in the States, anyway, for gasoline demand to pick up. Distillate demand we're getting mixed signals. You've got some of the trucking indicators looking positive and some of them looking negative. The same is true with the rail and the marine cargoes, the Port of Los Angeles data looks a little different than the Port of Long Beach data. So we're not seeing any significant improvement, but we're not seeing things crater, either.", "Doug Terreson - ISI Group Inc.", "Sure. Okay, and on the same topic...", "William Klesse", "Let me just tell you a little more, though, we'll give you a little more here on Retail. Jean Bernier is going to tell you some about Retail for us, which will give you a good indication.", "Jean Bernier", "Okay. So on Retail, our overall demand in the second quarter is soft, it's down about 2% in the U.S. and on a same-store basis, it's down about 3.5%. However, July is looking a bit better than that, so that is an encouraging sign. And in Canada, on the Retail side, actually our volumes have been very strong, overall growing about 3% on a same-store basis between 4% and 5%. So we see different trends in different regions and different areas.", "Doug Terreson - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay, good. And also on the same topic somewhat. We're starting to see prices approach record levels for end-users in some of your important export markets in Latin America. And so I just wanted to see if Joe or somebody could give us on update on trends in export markets that you guys have exposure to? Are they still pretty strong there as well?", "Joseph Gorder", "Yes, Doug. Things look good there. I mean, our gasoline exports in the quarter were 69,000 barrels per day and our diesel exports were 143,000 barrels a day. Now the gasoline is primarily being drawn into Mexico, but we moved some to Ecuador and Chile also. On the distillates side, 70% went to Europe in the quarter and 30% to South America. And if we look out to the third quarter, those numbers are generally in that same range. Distillates might be a little higher than the second quarter, but generally in that same range. And Doug, the key for me is that we continue to see an open arm to Europe for the EN590 grade distillates. And so when I look at our distillates for the second quarter, they were down a little bit from historical numbers, but it was more related to availability of supply for us to move out than it was demand abroad. And then if you'll look out to the quarter, the third quarter and going forward, we still have Mexico demand exceeding their supply as imports grow. I think Mexico is now importing 425,000 barrels a day of gasoline and 130,000 barrels a day of diesel and both of those are up from last year. We still have supply problems with Venezuela. Petrobras is purchasing gasoline. And so looking out, things look like they're going to continue that way and so we should see continued strong demand on the Gulf Coast.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "The project is obviously kicking in next year, if I could just ask you to give us a quick update. I guess this year, we were looking at the 2 FCC revamps. Could they get completed on time, in which case should we expect some improvement, I guess, on the cost lane for the balance of this year? And related, can you just clarify whether or not you will benefit from any tax credits related to the accelerated depreciation of your capital? I guess it's up some fairly substantial numbers. In which case, would you accrue more taxes in 2012? And I have a follow-up, please.", "William Klesse", "Lane Riggs is going to tell you about the stats, and Clay Killinger will tell you about the taxes.", "Lane Riggs", "Okay. This is Lane, our SEC grade job was completed pretty much on time and on budget. It's performing quite well. We're still sort of trying to optimize it, but we've already seen a significant improvement in operations. This is on the St. Charles. In the Memphis SEC, we have the oxygen supply and so we are -- those 2 projects are complete. So we should, on a go forward basis, we should certainly see an improvement in our sort of earnings ability with both of those 2 projects.", "William Klesse", "I would add that the St. Charles, which was a conversion from a millisecond to a conventional cat, we've seen at least an 8 percentage point increase in our conversion or yield to where we get the 4- to 5-year run. At Memphis, hanging the cat cooler because there's no vacuum tower in there, allows us to go ahead and heavy up our crude slate and we'll also get a 4- to 5-year run. So these are tremendous projects for us when you look at our reliability or mechanical availability going forward, as well as our just general yield because when you get these conversion yields when you have $100 oil, you can see that it's worth a lot of money to us. Taking that slurry to a clean product. Now on the taxes.", "Clay Killinger", "Yes. Doug, this is Clay Killinger, the Corporate Controller. Most of these, not significantly all of these projects, will qualify for the bonus depreciation under the tax law. And we've computed at a 6.5% interest rate that for each $100 million of qualified capital expenditures will relate to about $5 million of net present value of benefits to the company.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "So your tax guidance for 2012 and you will start accruing that on January 1? In which case, can you give us an idea what you expect the impact to be in terms of percentage on the typical tax guidance that you guys have.", "Clay Killinger", "I have -- we haven't calculated what the number will be, but it will come into effect when those projects get completed. But when they get done, we'll update you on that.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Great. My follow-up...", "William Klesse", "Doug, on -- sorry, I just want to finish then on the hydrocrackers there. We're still looking for Port Arthur to be completed in the third quarter of '12 and St. Charles to be completed in the fourth quarter of '12. So they are big. This is -- overall, this is over a $3 billion capital project between both clients. And this environment we have today will be significant profit contributors as the numbers we've given you in the slides that we've shown.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Bill, my follow-up is really a broader kind of strategic question. You guys have got a feel-good type record of when you buy one asset, you tend to sell another kind of, I guess overall high-grade portfolio. But Pembroke kicking up here and I guess with your exit from more or less from the East Coast, at least for the lower 48, how are you feeling about the broader portfolio? And I guess specifically, I would ask how you're feeling about the West Coast as a core part of the portfolio on a go forward basis? And then I'll leave it at that.", "William Klesse", "Doug, it's a very good question. And if you think about us strategically, we continue to work on geographic diversification, execution every single day, keeping our investment grade rating. These things are important, but then you get to our portfolio and when we look at demand in the United States, the world is growing, the United States is much more sluggish and it's grown, but we will continue to work on our portfolio. And so we are looking at it again. Obviously, the West Coast has depressed cracks. I think you've noticed in our earnings tables that we actually lost money at the refinery in Qu\u00e9bec in the second quarter. And so we tend to look at all of these with the whole portfolio. These are long-term decisions, we'll analyze it in a long-term approach, but we are continuing to work on our portfolio so that we are, in fact, more competitive.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "A question for you on Pembroke. I know there was an issue recently, I believe it was a fire of some sort. And I just wanted to make sure, as of the August 1 close date, will that facility be up and running fully operational the way you had projected in your slide back when you announced the acquisition?", "S. Edwards", "Yes, this is Gene Edwards. The refineries are running fine today. There really has been a big impact on operations because of this and there's going to be some possibly rebuilding the tanks. But this occurred on the teller's watch and they're taking care of these expenses.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "Okay, great. And secondly, Joe, I know you went through the export environment looking fairly robust through the balance of the year. I was just curious if you have any, I guess, thoughts on next year. Per the IEA, it looks like we've got a quite a bit of capacity coming online globally, about 2.5 barrels a day. Are you expecting any impact on the Gulf Coast's ability to export or how that might factor into what you're seeing?", "Joseph Gorder", "Blake, I really think it's going to be this way for a long a time. It's almost getting to be a chorus here instead of verse that we've got strong export sales in Gulf Coast. I read an article this morning that Reliance is moving their barrels now to Asia. Asian demand is still strong and we expected them to come to the states at some point in time, we just haven't seen it. So you've got growth in other parts of the world which are pulling those barrels. The Gulf Coast refineries, as we've said before, are very cost competitive. And you have natural markets for those barrels and those barrels are into Mexico, Central America, South America and then over to Europe. And I just expect that this is going to be with us for some time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Gilman from Benchmark.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "I had a couple of things, if I could. Just by way of a clarification on the tax issue mentioned previously. I assume that, that bonus DD&A is not going to affect the effective rate, but rather cash tax and that you'll be providing deferred taxes. And I correct in that regard or wrong?", "Joseph Gorder", "Yes, you are. You are correct.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "Okay. Couple of other things, if I could. I noticed pretty significant increase in high asset crude runs in the quarter and was wondering is that a permanent shift and what's given rise to it?", "Joseph Gorder", "Well, this is Joe, Mark. It's the economics that are giving rise to it and you're right, we ran much higher volumes of marlum [ph] and Friday in the second quarter. We also ran more volumes of M-100. But it was all economically driven.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "Okay, with respect to the intent to increase the Eagle Ford volumes, Joe, Jean or Bill, anything entailed in doing so, other than the logistics of getting it there from a hardware catalyst or any other type modification that would have to be made?", "Joseph Gorder", "Mark, we're running now 40,000 a day down there. And we've got a turnaround scheduled in September and Lane can speak more to this if he'd like, but there's no major changes in the turnaround as a result of the turnaround, that are going to allow us to take those volumes up to 60,000 a day. So in addition to the volume we're going to run there, we're going to try to run the 25,000 that Mike mentioned with Corpus Christi and the great thing about running more of this Eagle Ford crude is we've got it priced in there at a WTI-type price and we're backing up CPC and Sahara and then more of the expensive foreign suites. So Lane, anything on the plant?", "Lane Riggs", "I just -- during the turnaround, we're going to hang some valve on the top circulating reflux of the pump ground to be able to handle it. It's a lighter crude and so it will allow us to once we get up around 60, we're still trying to determine, but we think we'll build around even more than that but essentially, we're hanging the valve and having the exchanger will allow us to do that after the turnaround.", "William Klesse", "So Mark, we'll spend somewhere in the neighborhood of $10 million around Three Rivers to do some of this that the fellows are talking about. To go above that would cost more money and, of course, we'd probably need a permit. So these are longer conversations, then. And at Corpus, it's all been to this point really trucking, pipeline construction, getting the oil to the plants. Some of you may remember, I've mentioned to you we have a project at our McKee Refinery which is the same kind of thing, just not Eagle Ford, but the issue we have at McKee is we need a permit. We would spend about $100 million to have a modest expansion there which has good economics, but the permit is probably an 18- to 24-month conversation.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "Okay. Guys, I've listened very carefully to what Mike said about the crude discounts in the Mid-Continent. But I guess from that standpoint, my thought was the capture rate in that region really doesn't seem to reflect that. Am I missing something?", "Michael Ciskowski", "I think you are, Mark but we'll be glad to walk you through.", "William Klesse", "Why don't we -- why don't you call, Mark, because I don't mind telling you guys, our most profitable refineries are McKee, Three Rivers and Ardmore. So we're capturing but I'm not sure -- what I'd like you to do maybe is to call Ashley after the call and he'll walk you through it.", "Michael Ciskowski", "Yes. And I think there's one more item that the broad public should understand is in our Mid-Continent system includes Memphis. So roughly 40% of our Mid-Continent region doesn't participate in WTI. Memphis is an LLS-base refinery. So if you assume that all that throughput is catching the WTI base margin, you made a very bad assumption.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "Okay, last one for me. Where were you in the quarter and where might you expect to be in terms of being buyer brands?", "Joseph Gorder", "Mark, we're up definitely by our grids. And we're now to the point where we're blending probably over 80% of our gasoline volumes with ethanol. So that's not the issue, but it's really the biodiesel RINS that become the challenge for us. There's just not enough biodiesel up here to blend for us to meet it with blending this year. We have plans underway to put in blending facilities for biodiesel at a handful of our racks. And we expect that by the end of 2012, we'll be blending at volume to satisfy that obligation, but it will be a build-up until that time. So we are a short grid.", "William Klesse", "It's an expense of well over $100 million. And maybe I can just leave it at that. This is a big program and Joe is telling you things we're doing to mitigate that, but for Valero, it's well over $100 million.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "Bill, is that annual or quarterly?", "William Klesse", "Annual. It's over $100 million.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "Okay, does it go up from here until you get in position to be able to achieve that blending?", "Joseph Gorder", "No. No. Unless the market for the RIN -- and frankly, Mark, it's all related to these biodiesel RINS. Those are very expensive. The market forms about $1.34 and you look at that compared to an ethanol RIN, it's $0.035. So the market for the biodiesel RINS are very high because they're just not available out there. We are going to be blending more though, as I said, and as a result, that expense should go down as we proceed forward.", "William Klesse", "Relative then to the price of wherever they're going.", "Joseph Gorder", "Right. And it's more biodiesel's blended price of the RIN should come down, too.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons.", "Jeffrey Dietert - Simmons & Company", "On the Eagle Ford volumes, as you think about some of the light-sweet crudes coming on the Eagle Ford Permian, Bakken, Cushing area, their major pipeline is coming from the Eagle Ford in the Houston Longhorn reversal into Houston, the Keystone XL Enterprise, Enbridge lines going into Houston. If production grows as fast as many of the producers believe it will, are you looking for incremental volumes? Could you use incremental light-sweet volumes in your Houston area refineries over and above what you've already talked about?", "William Klesse", "Some are going to Houston, some are going to Port Arthur, but Joe's going to answer you.", "Joseph Gorder", "Yes, I mean, Jeff, clearly, the Mid-Continent refineries are benefiting now, right? We all see that. But to the extent that we do move sweet crudes down into the Gulf, you're going to see pressure on LLS prices. And so would we like to see some of the crude end up in the Houston market where we could run it or over at Memphis? Absolutely. I don't think that we're going to see this get resolved, though, anytime soon. I don't know what your view is, but you've got so much production coming on stream up there as you describe, that I think we're going to see significant volumes continue to pour into the market, both from the regions you mentioned, the Bakken area from the Panhandle area and then Canadian barrels coming in. And it's going to be 18 months or better for the pipelines to be put in place to carry it out. So I think you're going to see continued pressure on those discounts in the Mid-Continent. One thing that's interesting, Jeff, that we saw is that Cushing tank capacity is coming on stream big time. We used to use 40 million barrels as a number of tank capacity, it's up to 62 million now and in the next 6 months, we're going to add 13 million barrels which is going to take it up to 75 million barrels a storage. So clearly, the market is getting ready for a lot more of this Mid-Continent crude to be available and to be stored.", "Jeffrey Dietert - Simmons & Company", "Joe, are you starting to see some Saudi -- attractive Saudi barrels coming into the U.S. Gulf Coast? They've talked about -- they raised production in June and they're talking about further increases in July. Are you guys seeing some of those barrels? Are they getting priced attractive enough to find their way to the Gulf Coast?", "Joseph Gorder", "We are. We're running now some pair of extra lights in the Gulf. We're also going to be bringing in more Kuwaiti barrels. The Kuwaitis have lifted their imposed reduction of contract volumes. We were operating for a period there where we had a 10% reduction in our contract volume. They notified us that they were taking that off and that we were able to take more barrels. I do think we're going to see a lot more medium-sour barrels coming into the market.", "Jeffrey Dietert - Simmons & Company", "How significant are those volumes?", "Joseph Gorder", "I understand that Saudis are going up to 10 million barrels a day of production. So that would be, what, another -- not entirely to the Gulf, but they're going to put that in the market. Jeff, I don't know how much you'll see.", "Jeffrey Dietert - Simmons & Company", "Okay. On Pembroke, you've provided some guidance on $0.25 a share of accretion on 2010 outlook. Do you happen to have an updated number based on where the forward curve is today?", "S. Edwards", "I think the forward curve -- Jeff, this is Jean again. Forward curve looks pretty similar to our forecast. Although rig prices are obviously very high right now, so there is some concern on that. But if you look at the 211 to Brent today from $13 a barrel, it's really not at all that bad. So I think -- we haven't really redone our economics since we did the acquisition, but I think it looks more or less in line.", "Jeffrey Dietert - Simmons & Company", "Okay, all right. And do you have any comments on the status or the impact of the ethanol tax credit repeal? And how that might influence Valero or the industry as a whole?", "S. Edwards", "Yes, it's Gene again. I'm not sure when it's going to get repealed. The senate was talking about July 31; said that's going to happen, but maybe it'll happen at the end of the year. We're watching it, but in reality it doesn't really have much impact on us right now. The blenders' credit is really being captured by the blender, not the ethanol producer. Just to use an example, ethanol today is right around $3 a gallon, CBOB and RBOB in New York are both $3.05, $3.10 a gallon, so there's margin to blend even if you don't have the $0.45 credit. So in fact, as the blenders who patron it, we capture a little bit of it at our retail. And our wholesale is passed on to the wholesale customers. At Retail, from our analysis, like it's more or less competed away when we have good ethanol blending margins, our overall margin at Retail doesn't seem to be affected much by that blenders' credit. So I think it's competed away the business, whether it be wholesale or retail. So net effect to Valero really is pretty much nothing.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Paul Cheng from Barclays Capital.", "Paul Cheng", "Number of questions. In Corpus Christi, do you have -- how much you can run Eagle Ford? Right now you're saying that in third quarter it's about 25,000 barrel per day. Assume that you face no major restriction in the logistics side, how much more of that you can run it up to?", "Lane Riggs", "Paul, this is Lane Riggs. We have 2 crude units there. We have our West plant crude unit which can run about 40,000 barrels a day, so that would be pretty much -- you're able to run about 40 a day of Eagle Ford from all those economic. And then our other plants is our East plant. And it's predominantly medium-sour, heavy-sour. But at the end of the day, it's all about economics. We can run Eagle Ford in that crude units, it's just a matter of it being available and the economics are right. So that's about 100,000 barrel a day, so we can run quite a bit.", "William Klesse", "The reason Lane is answering you this way is the East plant has a coker, so you tend to run the coker, but if you get enough discount, you don't run the coker.", "Paul Cheng", "This plant is your original plant, right, with the recent cracker?", "William Klesse", "The West plant has the recent cracker.", "Lane Riggs", "That's the original.", "William Klesse", "That's the original Valero plant is the West plant. The east plant is the old coastal plant.", "Paul Cheng", "Okay, all right. I see, I see, very good. Can you give me some balance sheet data in terms of working capital, long-term debt, market value of the inventory in excess of the book?", "William Klesse", "Yes. On the current assets, it's $14.7 billion; current liabilities, $10.2 billion; total long-term debt, $7.6 billion; and then our market value in excess of a LIFO on the inventory is $7.9 billion.", "Paul Cheng", "Okay. And that maybe that this -- I supposed that this maybe is for Ashley. On the Qu\u00e9bec, is there any particular reason why margin realization seems like, sequentially at least, half from the first quarter, have dropped so much comparing to the benchmark indicator?", "Ashley Smith", "Qu\u00e9bec. Yes, typically -- and if you go back and look at our capture rates versus typical indicator like a Brent 211, it falls from first quarter to second quarter. Mostly on the light end, the butane, LPGs out there, the market always gets weak because you can't blend them into the gasoline pool and you'll see it fall from 4Q and 1Q are typically a higher-capture rate. It falls in second quarter and then kind of holds and builds back up as you can start blending into back in the gasoline.", "Paul Cheng", "That seems like it's pretty substantial because the benchmark indicator seems to be flat to slightly down on it.", "Ashley Smith", "It does look substantial and it has been substantial in the past.", "Paul Cheng", "So do you think that this is still normal on the seasonal pattern?", "Ashley Smith", "That's absolutely. Go back -- we've been posting our Qu\u00e9bec-only performance for that region. We posted that to the website a few months ago, right up to the first quarter. And you can see historically how Qu\u00e9bec has done over the past 5 years and in the first quarter to second quarter, it falls anywhere from 20 to 30 percentage points on capture rate. And this is the key driver.", "Paul Cheng", "I see. And Aruba, did you guys make money in the second quarter?", "William Klesse", "No, we did not. We had margin, but we had many operating issues.", "Paul Cheng", "Bill, is it a primarily an operating issue or that the configuration just, even in today's market, this cover light, heavy defense or you still won't able be to make money?", "William Klesse", "I'm going to take the second part first. The configuration is an issue when you have $100 oil running at coking refinery, you just have to have a big discount. And that's all -- I mean, it's just as simple as that.", "Paul Cheng", "Right, so the current discount is not big enough?", "William Klesse", "The discount would've been big enough in the second quarter then if we had run better. And we had a lot of problems to start up, which basically we started a year ago, getting ready to start up has been very tough for people who've worked very hard. We've had a lot of issues in getting back to a good rate. Today, we're running revenue 200,000 barrels a day, but we've had issues getting there.", "Paul Cheng", "Okay. So do you think that now the bulk of the issues is behind you?", "William Klesse", "I think we have clearly make progress on running -- being able to run reliably, but I would tell you that the second half on the P&L, not necessarily cash flow totally but P&L, will be challenging unless we get a change in the discounts.", "Paul Cheng", "I see. And Bill, for then -- this is for Mike, for the remaining 2 spending for the hydrocracker in St. Charles and Port Arthur, how much is the remaining that you have to spend?", "Michael Ciskowski", "It's about $1.3 billion.", "Paul Cheng", "Together?", "William Klesse", "Combined. $600,000 -- $600 million, $700 million, then we have a couple of other projects around it. So I would basically tell you that it's about a $1.5 billion to finish the 2 hydrocrackers, some of the crude work that's going on around it.", "Paul Cheng", "Bill, do you have a rough number that what's the CapEx look like next year?", "William Klesse", "The capital spending next year? Yes. I'm going to say it's the same as this year, $3 billion to $3.2 billion and I think I said we'll go $3.1 billion kind is where we are sitting at this point. Now having said that, that's kind of like a ballpark number because like most companies you guys will talk to, we're in the middle of starting our budgets for next year and our planning, so...", "Paul Cheng", "Two final questions. One, Bill, historically, Valero, the strategy is that you left there large coastal refinery with a high conversion capability to win a lot of discount group, that kind of flexibility. With the last 6 or 7 months drastic change in the Mid-Continent TI spread, does it in any shape or form change your view about the criteria? Or that you think that this is just too short-term of a phenomenon there for you to really change your strategic thinking?", "William Klesse", "It's a very fair question, Paul. Obviously in today's market, it is all about location. So just -- it's a given. And to solve some of the switch and Valero's benefiting by it, we have already told you that McKee, Ardmore and Three Rivers. So for the industry then to cause the LLS, WTI types to narrow, it's really, probably an 18-month to 2-year conversation because some of the things that I think Doug mentioned earlier, or maybe it was Jeff, they're not all happening yet. So this is 18 months to 2 years away for pipelines to move this volume out of the Mid-Continent. So location, it's all about location today. However, I would still say to you that at the end of the day, it's just like we've talked about in the past, it's location, it's complexity, but it's also being able to operate. And executing, executing, executing all the time. And that's the piece that you will notice over the next, as these projects are getting done, you're going to see our executing is dramatically improving. On our mechanical availability now, we are borderline first class -- first quartile and a couple of years ago, we were third and fourth quartile. So you will see that as these data keeps coming out. But today, it's all about location. Bottom line.", "Paul Cheng", "But you do not believe that if longer -- if we need to spot the long terms of you and not changing the way how, in terms of M&A, in consideration of that criteria?", "William Klesse", "I'm not going to say not changing. I'm going to say it; a few minutes ago I said complexity matters. Where Valero's expertise is, is running high complexity refineries and that is our institutional knowledge here. However, we are looking at an expansion at the McKee refinery. We've already talked about what we're doing in South Texas. Those are projects that we would not have considered 2 years ago for sure. Would not have considered one year ago, for sure. So there is obviously some change in our approach. On the other hand, to give you the whole story, you can see our Qu\u00e9bec numbers, as Ashley said. We have a currency, currency's gone up in Canada and that makes their conversion to dollars. You can see when you look at their operating costs, it's moved up dramatically. Obviously, they're buying light sweet crude. So where we have an emphasis on in Qu\u00e9bec is going to be much more on the cost side and the products realization side because they've lost that currency buffer that they had previously. And the advantage crude oil being foreign. So clearly, this market that we're in with these differentials or spreads that we've not seen before are certainly biasing our -- certainly our strategy. But it is still about executing and complexity and being able to take these barrels and make very clean products out of them reliably every day.", "Paul Cheng", "And finally, can you tell us that, is there any major turnaround from you guys then in the second quarter -- I mean, the second half and the first half of next year?", "William Klesse", "I think Bill Bay just released our turnarounds, but we have them at Corpus Christi in October and Three Rivers in September. The Three Rivers refinery, the entire plant's down. And it's down for 3 or 4 weeks and the Corpus Christi one is\u2026", "Lane Riggs", "The East plant crude coker, for 3 weeks.", "William Klesse", "The larger crude unit, the East plant we talked about, down for 3 weeks. The crude coke. But these turnarounds that are just scheduled turnarounds. The heaviest turnarounds we had was in the first quarter.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "A couple of questions for you. A question for you on the macro, it really feeds into the prior response that you had on Arab light volumes. And frankly, it actually may highlight complexity versus location. If we look into the year-end, excess PR, you could see over 1.2 million barrels of incremental crude demand with low sulfur Libyan barrels out, it looks as though x the SPR, that would be met with primarily sour Arab light barrels. What are your views in terms of the global market setting up for heavy-sour imbalances in the back half of the year? And can clearly benefits to your system, any comments? And I have couple of questions.", "Joseph Gorder", "Evan, this is Joe. If you think about heavy-sour in general, okay, we've got a discount right now, Maya related to LLS that's around $14-a-barrel, which is a decent discount. The SPR release certainly depressed LLS briefly which compressed that Maya discount, but now it's moved back out. But if you look more broader than just Maya, you've got a market right now that sees Pemex production stabilizing at $1.4 million of exports a day, somewhere in that range. You got Columbia increasing their heavy-sour production by 140,000 barrels per day. They're up to 870 barrels now, which is significant increase over year. You've got Brazil increasing their production by about 150,000 barrels per day. We're seeing a lot more Basra in the market today. As we mentioned earlier, we've got the Saudis putting more barrels into the market, as are the Kuwaitis and then ultimately we're going to have Keystone come on and it's going to allow us to move more of these Canadian barrels into the market. On the medium-sour side, you've had somewhat reduced production in the U.S. Gulf Coast because there's been some maintenance been taking place on the Mars platform. And of course we had the spill which delayed subsequent drilling, but that will pick back up here at some point in time. So when we look at the market for sour crudes, both heavy- and medium-sours, we're pretty optimistic about these discounts.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "Right. It looks that way, in my opinion. And one -- just a question on Maya, how should we think about the K factors? I mean, do you see that being moved to offset some of the WCS impact in that pricing formula that's being impacted by Cushing inventory levels or pressured Cushing?", "Joseph Gorder", "Yes. Clearly, the biggest part of the formula is that. The K factor is what the Mexicans use to try to keep the market, the oil price at what would be a market. And certainly, when you get heavy-sour Canadian crude coming into the Gulf, it's going to put -- anytime you get more supply, you're going to have pressure on these discounts. And so we expect that that's probably going to happen. They have been very good, they're very capable, they've been very good at trying to keep the Maya price somewhat similar to a medium-sour crude alternative. And we expect they're going to try to continue to do that in the future. But again, if you have more crude supply into the market, it shouldn't pressure those discounts.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "A question on Qu\u00e9bec. I know you mentioned focusing on cost, but is there any potential solution to move Canadian discounted lights that are really getting backed out from the U.S. Mid-Continent and sands growth that may be able to move to the east and give you a TI-like discount into that market? Is that -- how do you guys think about that?", "William Klesse", "Ah no, Evan. There's really not any logistics in place. You can always route it. You can do -- you could put it, I guess, on a barge or a ship, but it's really, the logistics don't fall that way.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. But real economics don't work then?", "William Klesse", "Well, you have to get the cars. I don't know what people are telling you. Ours now are probably almost a year lead time. Certainly, you'd have to build the facility. We have a rail facility, but it works for products. And our pipeline won't be finished until the end of next year. So we're looking at all of these items, including what Ashley mentioned on the butanes, as well, and on the general operating cost side. But your specific question is -- it's a little -- it's harder than just putting it on a ship and shipping it in.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. I appreciate that entirely. On Three Rivers, I mean I know you're working with Harvest Pipeline to bring a line from Eagle Ford into the asset, but is there any magic about 60 in terms of 95 CD capacity? I mean, is there a potential to increase compression and take that number higher or is that, as you think about the asset, the right maximum amount for you?", "Lane Riggs", "This is Lane. We can -- we will see. Ultimately, we may think we can run up to 80,000 barrels a day. It's just a matter of whether it's filled out parts of the refinery properly. But you're right, the Harvest Pipeline will be there. We've put in a big truck rack. We will not be logistically limited on Eagle Ford availed in the refinery. It will all be about the economics of Eagle Ford in refinery which today, we would run as much of it as we could.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "I got you. And just lastly, briefly, on the SPR and SPR release. I know you're the single largest purchaser, like close to 7 million barrels. How did it benefit you guys? Can you explain maybe the process?", "Joseph Gorder", "Well, I mean, we certainly can run the crude and we were able to pick it up and a $5.11 discount on average to LLS. And so it's a simple math. You do the $7 million barrels times the $5 and we've had huge benefit for bringing it in.", "William Klesse", "We'll have some cost moving it around, but what we did is -- the oil fits us in many of our locations so we just decided to bid, it was a bid process. And so as Joe said, we got it for a little bit of a discount against the metric. Joe's supposed to get that discount every day.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "That's great. And maybe I just want to add one other question, I know you guys are running a lot more crudes through your program. I mean is that, does that -- but it hasn't yet impacted inventory levels. I mean, is there some correlation with running more crudes and having higher inventory levels since you kind of want to blend out so you don't beat up your units as much?", "Joseph Gorder", "I'm trying...", "William Klesse", "I would say no because we typically -- and I guess one of you guys correct me, our crude inventory number runs about 20 days, 22 days, so we're turning our inventory over 20, 22 days here in that range. So it just goes through our system. And we'll -- our supply people are always balancing our system. So moves a couple of million barrels, we have over $100 million of barrels of total inventory and moves a couple of million barrels, but the system is always trying to get optimized.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "We've beaten this topic to death today, but I'm going to ask one more question on running this inland crudes through your system. Well, just one more here. So assuming a couple of years down the road, this is, I guess, hypothetical, that Saudi's pipelines and trends come in, assuming you can get all the volumes of inland crudes you want down to the Gulf Coast, is there an upper limit of how much of these light-sweet inland crudes you can run through your entire Gulf Coast system?", "William Klesse", "All right. I'm going to answer you and say because we got into this conversation today, it all depends on the price. So today, we run different crude oils at our Houston refinery. We could put a lot of lighter crude in there. You could put lighter crude into all of our refineries. You'll underutilize your coker and then as Lane was explaining earlier because it's lighter, you'll overload your vapor handling capabilities, so that's where you'll have to stop. But it all depends on price.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "So you've got 1.6 million, 1.7 million barrels a day, something like that of capacity. I mean, theoretically, you can run a full dose of that without any sort of impacts on operations?", "William Klesse", "No, I would say, we would not be able to run that much. We would get limited out on being able to handle the vapors. But you might make more money.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Right, right. Okay.", "William Klesse", "So the way we do it, it's just like all our competitors do it, we run the LP.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Do you ever see the U.S. as being an exporter of LLS or WTI down the road?", "Joseph Gorder", "I doubt it. I mean, we're still bringing forward sweeps in.", "William Klesse", "I think we would answer this to say our opinion is going to be no better than yours, I think is the best way to say that. The U.S. is still a big importer. The U.S. imports over 9 million barrels a day of crude oil. And so it would have to be some issue with the refining capacity which you were just asking us for that to happen. But of our knowledge would not be any better than yours here.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Okay, great. I guess, one other quick question, Bill. I think last quarter, you mentioned that you thought Valero could beat the $3 EPS for the year. Is that -- do you still feel pretty good about that?", "William Klesse", "Yes, I do.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Cory Garcia from Raymond James.", "Cory Garcia - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Try to sneak one quick one in here. In regards to your sort of stay-in business maintenance capital, seeing that's been running about $1.7 billion and I believe several quarters back you guys were talking maybe $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. Bearing in mind that obviously the regulatory environment can change on a dime, I'm looking at sort of how your portfolio has changed. Are you still thinking maintenance cap could get back down toward $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion in the years ahead or are looking at more of a $1.7 billion, $1.6 billion type of level?", "William Klesse", "I think that eventually we can get to that number. And what it is, is basically, we spend DD&A. And then you always have to consider these environmental rights or other type of regulations. But yes, we can get there, but what we're doing today is we're spending in a little hire rate in that area just because we have many things going on to improve our reliability through our system. And as we're replacing bad actor pumps as we're addressing problem exchangers and that in the system, they are causing us to have a little higher capital spending. But our target would clearly be that we are going to able to do it around DD&A, with some subject to inflation there, but basically, a DD&A. And for Valero, total DD&A is about $1.5 billion. So for the refining group, it must be about $1.3 billion.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time.", "Ashley Smith", "Okay, thanks, John. And I just want to thank shareholders for listening to today's call. If you have questions, please contact the Investor Relations department.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.", "After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star and then the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, press star and then the number two on your telephone keypad. Thank you. Mr. Ashley Smith, you may begin your conference.", "Ashley Smith", "Thank you Julie Ann. Good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation\u2019s second quarter 2007 earnings conference call. With me today are Bill Klesse our Chairman and CEO, Mike Ciskowski our CFO and other members of our executive management team.", "If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at Valero.com. There are also tables attached to the earnings release that provide additional financial information on our business segment. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact investor relations after the call.", "Before we get started, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company\u2019s or managements expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provision under federal security laws. There are many factors that can cause actual results to differ from our expectations including those we\u2019ve described in our filings with the SEC. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President", "Thanks Ashley, and thank you for joining us today. As noted in the release, our second quarter earnings came in at $3.89 per share, which is the highest we\u2019ve ever achieved in any quarter.", "These earnings are a 31% improvement over the $2.98 per share we earned in the second quarter of 2006, which was our previous record. You should note that these results include the operations of the recently divested Lima, Ohio refinery, which are classified as discontinued operations in the financial tables that accompany the earnings release.", "Given the strong margin environment in the second quarter, Valero\u2019s throughput margin for continuing operations was $18.14 per barrel or 16% higher than the $15.59 per barrel earned in the second quarter of 2006. Regarding operation, mid-continent throughput levels increased over the first quarter due to the return of our McKee refinery to limited operations in mid-April at around 80,000 barrels a day. As more units were brought online, rates increased to approximately 150,000 barrels per day by the end of the quarter. We plan to run at this level until the propane de-asphalting unit is repaired, which we expect to occur late in the fourth quarter.", "Going through some of the key numbers in the second quarter; cash operating costs at the refineries were $3.87 per barrel, a $.09 per barrel increase over the first quarter was primarily due to higher energy and reliability expenses which were partially offset by an increase in throughput volume. General and administrative expenses excluding corporate depreciation were $177 million. The $32 million increase form the first quarter was mainly due to an increase in charitable contributions and charges related to the cancellation of a services agreement with New Star Energy.", "Total depreciation and amortization expense was $337 million and interest expense, net of capitalized interest was $83 million. The $25 million increase in net interest expense from the first quarter was primarily due to the financing associated with the accelerated share repurchase program or the ASR. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations was 33.8% in the second quarter, which was in line with our guidance on the last earnings call. Capital spending during the second quarter was $592 million, which includes $101 million of turnaround expenditures.", "As to our stock repurchase program, as you recall in April, we entered into an ASR with an affiliate, J.P. Morgan. That allowed us to immediately purchase 42.1 million shares of common stock for an up front payment of $3 billion. As mentioned on the last earnings call, the final price for the share\u2019s purchase would be determined based on a discount to the volume weighted average trading price during the period it took J.P. Morgan to fulfill their requirements under the ASR. J.P. Morgan recently completed their requirements, which resulted in Valero settling the contract with a cash payment to J.P. Morgan of $94.5 million. So at the end of the day, the 42.1 million shares we purchased in April cost us $3.1 billion instead of the 3 billion.", "Included in the ASR, we have utilized nearly 4 billion of the 6 billion authorizations so far this year. Over the remainder of this year, we intend to purchase an additional $2 billion of our shares in the open market. With respect to our debt position, at the end of June, our total debt stood at $6.9 billion, which compares to $4.9 billion at the end of March. We\u2019ve paid down $230 million of maturing debt in April, and we borrowed $3 billion on a bridge loan to fund the ASR program. Later in the second quarter, we repaid the bridge loan with $750 million of cash on hand, and the $2.25 billion of notes.", "We ended the quarter with a cash balance of just over $2.3 billion. Subsequent to the quarter end, we closed the sale of the Lima refinery. Proceeds after taxes, and other related expenses, are expected to be approximately $1.8 billion. As to our third quarter operations, turnaround activity is relatively light, so for modeling purposes, you should expect to see Gulf Coast refinery throughputs of approximately 1.55 million to 1.6 million barrels per day.", "Mid-continent throughputs should be around 450 thousand barrels per day, which is lower than the usual guidance for this region, due to the Lima sale. West Coast throughput should average between 280 and 290 thousand barrels per day, and our Northeast system should average in the range of 550 to 570 thousand barrels per day. Refinery cash operating expenses are expected to be slightly lower than the second quarter levels, at about $3.65 per barrel, mainly due to higher expected throughput volumes, and lower expected energy costs.", "With respect to some of the other items in the third quarter, we anticipate G&A expense to be around $160 million, which is $17 million lower than the second quarter, due to the non-recorded charges in the second quarter that I mentioned earlier. Net interest expense should be around $93 million, which is expected to increase from the second quarter, due to a full quarter effect of the ASR financing. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be around $345 million. And then, finally, for the third quarter, you should be using a 33% tax rate for your modeling purposes. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill.", "William Klesse", "Thank you Mike, and good morning. As Mike said, we had a terrific first half to the year, as strong demand continues to [supply issues] throughout the refining industry, tighten gasoline and diesel balances, and kept refining margins high. We\u2019ve seen DOE data report record gasoline demand this driving season, despite retail prices being around $3.00 per gallon. At the percentage of disposable income, gasoline purchases are still low, about 50% of the late 70\u2019s and early 1980\u2019s level.", "As to Valero\u2019s strategy, you can see that we are doing exactly what we have said we would do. With respect to our refining system, we said we would consider optimizing our refining portfolio. The Lima refinery was sold because it was not cored to our overall strategy. Going forward, we will continue to look at our portfolio of assets. Even though we have certainly had our share of operating issues and unplanned downtime, we have been investing in our plants to make the safer, more reliable, and more efficient.", "This year, our CapEx budget remains $3.5 billion. Over the next few years, we have several sizeable projects planned for our large Gulf Coast refineries, which will make those refineries more competitive and more profitable on a long-term basis. Also, as Mike said, we intend to purchase an additional $2 billion of our shares this year to complete the board-approved program. We are in a great refining environment of strong product demand, favorable discounts for low-quality feedstocks, and tight refining capacity worldwide.", "We see many of the underlying supply and demand factors in place for many more years, which makes us bullish about our future. Throughout our industry, projects are costing much more, are taking much longer to complete than originally envisioned. Some are being cancelled, many are being delayed. Of course, our business will continue to be seasonal, with plenty of volatility, as we\u2019ve seen lately. However, please note, even with the recent margin fall, on any long-term historical basis, we still have excellent [cracks].", "For Valero, our stock remains the best value in the refining sector when you look at the valuations for other complex refining outfits. This management team is committed to improving our performance and increasing our shareholder value for the long run. With that, we\u2019ll go ahead and open it to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question is from the line of Mark Flannery with Credit Suisse.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Hi, I\u2019ve got a question about the large amount of ethanol capacity coming on stream in the second half of 2007. Are you making any specific plans to try and accommodate that? Are you building out any infrastructure to convert over markets to allow you more discretionary blending? What do you think will be the impact of the new ethanol between now and the end of the year?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Hey Mark, this is Joe. You know, our forecast is that by year-end capacity will be about 560 thousand barrels a day. And really, to answer the question, from an infrastructure perspective, we\u2019re really not doing anything to accommodate it. We\u2019re blending 20-22 thousand barrels a day right now, on average, of ethanol, and frankly the infrastructure isn\u2019t in place, and many of the markets we\u2019re marketing it to accommodate it today. So we\u2019ll do it, economically, where it makes sense, and where we can do it, but otherwise we\u2019re not pushing it.", "Mark Flannery", "Great.", "William Klesse", "I want to add to that Mark. If you actually look at some of the numbers, even though ethanol price is falling significantly, if you take a vapor-pressure hit we\u2019re getting here, at least in the summertime, relative to some of the other blending components and their values, come of the discretionary blending are still not economic. People think it is because they see the price of ethanol, but when you look at our full cocktail, it\u2019s not necessarily so. So, just adding to Joe\u2019s comments for you.", "Mark Flannery", "That applies more to the summer then?", "William Klesse", "I\u2019m sorry, go ahead?", "Mark Flannery", "That applies more to the summer than the winter.", "William Klesse", "That\u2019s absolutely right, but just remember the tradeoff in the winter is in fact the vapor pressure versus butane, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve looked and seen the butane price.", "Mark Flannery", "Great.", "William Klesse", "So, all I\u2019m saying is these tradeoffs, you have to look at the whole cocktail. When you look at the price, it looks like it should work. But it\u2019s a much tighter blend than you think.", "Mark Flannery", "Okay that\u2019s very helpful, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Neil McMahon with Sanford Bernstein.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.", "Hi, I\u2019ve got a few questions. Really the first one is, given the deal of the day, so to speak, what is your overall strategy for potentially refining Canadian crude? It looks like with the Lima divestment, it is very much focused around the Gulf Coast, and sort of bypassing the whole of the Mid-continent. Maybe you could go into that in a bit of detail and I\u2019ve got a few follow ups as well. Thanks.", "William Klesse", "Well Neil, Lima refinement where it was located for us didn\u2019t really have that great a fit for the Canadian crude. Pipeline has to be built over there; we really needed integrated strategy and that\u2019s why Husky is just a much better fit for them, from the [loam to tomb]. Now for Valero though, we are very interested in runny Canadian crude. While some Canadian crude does come to the Beaumont area today to the extra pipeline, and we\u2019ve actually run some at Port Arthur refinement. Our strategy, though, is to see Canadian crude get to the US Gulf Coast. And we\u2019re talking with all these proposed pipeline projects that are trying to make that happen. And we will encourage those projects by our participation through frequent commitments to them. So that\u2019s our strategy, to do that. We want to see the Canadian crude on the Golf Coast.", "Neil McMahon", "Is there any particular reason why you\u2019ve taken that approach\u2014it\u2019s very much aligned with what you\u2019d seen Exxon Mobile to, and to be honest, what I think Shell are proposing as well. Is there any reason why you felt that that is the best move for you? I presume it reflects where your asset base is, but also is it because of the greater flexibility with sea-born access?", "William Klesse", "Neil, that would absolutely be greater flexibility. Also, when we look at building things and as you said, you probably said, more hard weather, where we at Corpus Christie, Texas City, Port Arthur, St. Charles, all having coping capacity for us to do work around those refineries is at a much lower cost, and quite frankly, the U.S. Golf Coast is much more efficient.", "Neil McMahon", "Maybe just a follow up question after your initial disposal. Are we to presume that portfolio rationalization could continue by looking at these sort of, take for example, a sort of strategy of disposing at below one hundred thousand barrel-a-day refineries and basically the ones that don\u2019t look as strategic maybe are more, might be the next one\u2014you might think about disposal, or are we done for the time being?", "William Klesse", "We are continuing to evaluate the portfolios, I\u2019ve said. You cannot put the criteria that you tried to put on them. We\u2019re looking at all these assets and quite frankly, with the margins we\u2019ve had, borrowing oil anywhere makes money. So we\u2019re just trying to be certain that we are hanging on to the assets that long term will be the strategic fit for us. But we have not said anything below one hundred thousand doesn\u2019t fit.", "Neil McMahon", "Just one quick last one from me, you\u2019ve made a great comment there in terms of how you look at your own valuation within the marketplace. I didn\u2019t know if you guys had a look at some the European refineries and their valuations, which do seem above yours and some of your competitors in the US. Any sort of ideas for why that might be the case, or are you as confused as some others are with all that?", "William Klesse", "Gene is going to answer that because he has looked at that. He runs our development function.", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Well, we\u2019ve looked a lot at the European assets and you\u2019re exactly right\u2014they traded much higher to earning or measures and our portfolio were both US assets\u2014that\u2019s the reason why we always said we\u2019d be interested in acquiring in Europe. But we can\u2019t, quite frankly, make the valuations work, so I have to have that strategy on hold until relative valuations change.", "Neil McMahon", "Great, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Doug Terreson, with Morgan Stanley.", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Good morning, guys. The oil industry operating in capital costs in Texas and refining have continued to move higher this year as you suggested in your comments. On this point, I wanted to see whether your expectations for full year capital expenditure have changed and if so, how? And second, I wanted to see how the company performed in relation to plan on the billion dollar income improvement plan during the first half of the year\u2014if you have any information in that area too?", "William Klesse", "Yes, Doug, I\u2019ll make some comments about that. On the capital program for this year, our budget is $3.5 billion and we expect to be within that budget, fairly confident about that.", "Doug Terreson", "And as to the second part of the question\u2014", "William Klesse", "Let me go ahead and start, then Rich will add in. In a billion dollars, what we have done is we\u2019re getting our tracking system in place so that we can be right on top of that. A lot of those projects require capital, and so it\u2019s skewed to the latter part of the five-year program that I said. So in the first couple of years, you\u2019ll see some efficiency things, and little benefits that we get from just general improvement and our reliability. Once we get these new coke drums in, you\u2019re going to see reliability improve significantly at St. Charles and at Port Arthur. And then in the latter part you\u2019ll see some stuff that comes in from power recovery and a couple of our caps and those type of projects. But we are getting the tracking system in place so that we can do it.", "The one thing I can tell you that we have done, is we\u2019re looking at how we do business at all of our refineries. And between our controller, Clay Killinger and [Reg]\u2014they have gone ahead and changed the business model on our yield accounting and procurement effort and we\u2019re going to bring that in\u2014it\u2019s little when you look at the scheme of things\u2014we\u2019ll save $10 million a year by bringing this into corporate. But what we\u2019re going to also get is a much great focus on procurement as you can imagine our spend is tremendous. We\u2019ll get that. And the other thing is that we\u2019re trying to get these refineries and the refinery operations to focus on the operation of the refinery, not worry about some of these ancillary things around our business. So all of that is happening. Do you want to add anything, Rich?", "Richard Marcogliese - Executive Vice President - Operations", "No, I just want to emphasize the point on the billion dollar program, that it\u2019s not a ratable 20% per year over the next five years that it\u2019s probably going to be more back end loaded, because there is a capital component on some of it, as Bill mentioned.", "Doug Terreson", "Ok, and just quickly. On St. Charles and Corpus Christie, the expansions there, those projects tracking the level you expected in timing as well?", "Richard Marcogliese", "Yes and, Doug, those are the expansions that are envisioned for St. Charles and Port Arthur, and Doug, just to recap very quickly. We are evaluating a large gas-oil hydro reactor investments for both plants. We\u2019re actually using a unified design, where we are building the exact same units at Port Arthur and St. Charles. The projects will be an access of $1 billion each. At this point we only have advanced approval from our board, to put certain [load lead] equipment on order and we will be reviewing this project with our board prior to the end of the year, for consideration of full funding.", "Doug Terreson", "Okay.", "Richard Marcogliese", "The timing of these projects\u2014these would be commissioned in the early 2010 timeframe.", "Doug Terreson", "Ok, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jeff Dietert, with Simmons.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "Good morning. Jeff Dietert with Simmons. You mentioned that your maintenance activity was going to be lighter in the back half of the year, relative to the first half of the year, and I was going to see if you could provide a little bit more detail there, and ask if you had any visibility into labor, parts, and equipment, if your consent, continuing to see cost inflation there.", "William Klesse", "Sure, Jeff, I\u2019ll make a few comments on that. First of all on the second quarter turnaround activity was pretty light. Really what we worked on was small crude unit turnaround at Paulsborough, hydro reactor in Venetia and the resin-refinery in Corpus Christie. There really isn\u2019t any major maintenance in the third quarter to speak of. We\u2019ll close out the year with some modest activity in the fourth quarter. We have a hundred thousand barrel a day crude unit in Paulsborough that will be down in October. Venetia\u2019s fluid cooker which is at thirty thousand barrel a day unit will be down in October and we\u2019ll have two cat unit outages, one in Texas City and then one at Wilmington down for turnaround in October and November respectively.", "As far as labor resources for turnarounds\u2014what I would say is that, I think, the cost inflation has plateaued. There aren\u2019t any indications of it abating, however, so I think we\u2019ve just established both a higher plateau of cost. Likewise, we do not see any real changes in productivity, you know productivity is lower by historical standards, and we don\u2019t see that situation changing. Our discussions with the major contractors still emphasize the need that we need to commit early, to lock up contractor availability in advance and it just represents continuing typed market for those types of maintenance and construction services.", " Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International ", "Two other things, that it appears OSHA has tightened up its efforts in monitoring operations and procedures and that you\u2019re also dealing with forced reductions in emissions. Could you address those two topics?", " Richard Marcogliese", "Yea, I can make a comment on the OSHA piece. You know, OSHA is out with a national emphasis program on refining for more rigorous examination of process safety management compliance. We have been tracking these developments with OSHA, and I am glad to say that in line with that, we had our first OSHA star program re-certification just completed in our Houston refinery in July. And our refinery was recommended for re-certification against OSHA\u2019s national emphasis template, so we are prepared for what OSHA is looking for, and in our first opportunity to be evaluated, we were successful.", " Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International ", "Thanks Rich", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Paul Chang with Lehman Brothers", "Paul Chang - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you. Rich, you talk about the fourth quarter turn around, can you give us the number of days on those [unit] that is going to be on the turn around?", "Richard Marcogliese", "Sure, in general, and these are rounded for simplicity. The Paulsboro crude unit is 100,000 barrel a day unit is going to be a nominal 30-day turnaround. The Benicia [fluid cooker], that\u2019s also going to be a 30-day turnaround. Texas City\u2019s CAT unit and [alkey], its about 80.000 barrel a day CAT capacity, that will be about a40 day turnaround. And in Wilmington\u2019s case, this is 55,000 barrel a day CAT cracker, its going to be a45 day turnaround. In this particular case, the duration is longer because we are going to go through a large retrofit on the associated out relations unit.", " Paul Chang - Lehman Brothers ", "Thanks a lot. Richard, how about in the first quarter 2008, any kind of insight on how that might look?", " Richard Marcogliese ", "I don\u2019t have the specifics on that at this point, but I don\u2019t anticipate it\u2019s going to be any step out quarter from a maintenance point of view at this point.", " Paul Chang - Lehman Brothers ", "So, will be normal to maybe light?", "Richard Marcogliese", "Well, let me say it, I\u2019d say that\u2019s a good characterization. Looking forward we\u2019ll have a significant increase in turnaround activity in 2009 and 2010, with a couple of large refinery turnarounds.", " Paul Chang - Lehman Brothers ", "And maybe this is either for Rich or for Mike. Any kind of rough estimate, what is the most in opportunity cause in the second quarter, relate to the planned down time, and also to the unplanned down time.", " Richard Marcogliese ", "Ok, well let me give you some general figures. If we look at all of our unbudgeted down time in the second, you know, including things such as project schedule slipping on new capital projects, you know with the wide margins we have experiences, the impact is about $590 million in the second quarter. For the first half, that number is about $850 million.", "Paul Chang - Lehman Brothers", "And Rich, those are after tax, right?", "Richard Marcogliese", "No, those are pretax.", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Pretax. And the other thing you said there is it includes where we\u2019ve had projects slip. So our big hydro current on the Gulf Coast where they slipped are included in that number.", "Paul Chang - Lehman Brothers", "Ok. Mike,", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Our earnings power that we have.", "Paul Chang - Lehman Brothers", "I see. Mike, is any offset sales, gained or lost relate to the [lima] in the in we reported.", " Richard Marcogliese ", "Nothing in the second quarter.", " Paul Chang - Lehman Brothers ", "So they are still up?", " Richard Marcogliese ", "No, all we have done is just shown on the earnings tables, where we separated the plain continuing and this continued operations.", "Paul Chang - Lehman Brothers", "Right, 187, in other words, that is the actual earnings in the quarter by Nima.", " Richard Marcogliese ", "That\u2019s correct for taxes, that\u2019s correct.", " Paul Chang - Lehman Brothers ", "Ok, a final one, just a quick one. Can you share with us what is the rut for number for Nima in the second quarter, and then realize margin?", " Richard Marcogliese ", "I can, I think throughput was roughly 158,000 barrels a day, and their operating income was $300 million in the second quarter.", " Paul Chang - Lehman Brothers ", "Ok, thank you.", " Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Arjun Murti with Goldman Sacks.", "Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you, I have two questions. First, do you have a fully diluted chair count at the end of the quarter, or whatever recent period you might have?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Yea, we do. And fully diluted, ok. For the second quarter on a fully diluted bases, weighted average for the quarter is 578, and then at the quarter end, its roughly 566.", " Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs  ", " Thank you very much. You allude to, in your press release widening, light heavy and sweet sour spreads, and the other few were narrower in the second quarter. I think Mexican production is well documented to be in decline. Do the outlook for light heavy and sweet sour, or really light heavy spreads in particular, should we assume that is dependent on OPEC actually raising their production here over the remainder of this year. And it is noted that WTI has shot up here to $78 a barrel from all these spreads are a little wider, but maybe not as wide as they were in past periods when WTI was this high.", "S. Eugene Edwards", "You know I think we get a very strange situation the second quarter with TI, right? I mean everybody looks at Maya discounts relative to TI and heavy sour discounts relative to TI, and we know that TI was just dislocated from all the other sweet crude\u2019s, because if you look at Branton LLS, you had a significant divergence from TI. So, when we look at the heavy sour discounts, and we say ok, we averaged 960 Maya discount during the second quarter, what we really would do is look at that number and adjust it to the other suite. So if you had discounts that were probably much more normal than we guess, you know, $14, $15 heavy sour discounts. And Maya itself has been a little bit more expensive compared with some of the other heavy sours also. I mean we are buying, when we are delivering Maya in at $11 off, we can get other heavy sours in at 14+ off. So, you know the light heavy spread, even though it looked off, I think it was really more related to TI than anything.", " Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs ", "That\u2019s helpful to second quarter. And do you look forward to the rest of this year? Do you think the widening is dependent on OPEC raising productions?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Well, that is a good question. I think that if they do raise production, a lot of it is going to be Saudi Arabia, which is building some of the heavier crude\u2019s, which directly puts more pressure on the heavy crude\u2019s discount.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "And remember, the Saudi crude\u2019s are basically medium sours, even though they call Saudi it is a medium sour crude, and you have seen mars start to move out a little bit, anyway.", " Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs ", "Those are great points, thank you very much.", " Operator ", "Your next question is from the line of Doug Leggate of Citigroup", " Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Thank you, morning guys. Couple of industry questions really. You mentioned on the press release, some of the issues that had arguably included margins during the quarter. and can downtime be one of them. But production, at least according to the EIA for gasoline is still up year over year. Can you give some colors as to why you think that may be, and I helpful", "S. Eugene Edwards", "I think a lot of the production being up year over year is the deported bloodstock. In a lot of our bottles its 40 and really shows that the gas link production when it is terminally blood that was ethanol, that\u2019s the way that the deal reports, and when you need blood that\u2019s de-ethanol it shows up as gas rate production, taking it to a US refinery to low and fairly black", "S. Eugene Edwards", "But with 5% utilization.", " Unidentified Company Representative", "Well I can tell you, everybody is running conversions, where you had some issues on crude, you\u2019ve been running your catch in reformers because you\u2019ve had such an attractive gas unit enlargement. So when you look at that utilization number, where they talk about crude, it can effect in our conversation of desolate production, but when you look at the gas rate, the conversion units are wrong. ", " Might have a problem, like in the Chicago area, which lead to the entire margins in the upper Midwest", " Doug Leggate - Citigroup ", "Ok, great, I guess a related question that wasn\u2019t quite my follow up, but you mentioned imports there. Imports are down quite markedly from the date for us that we picked up last week, but do you see any dynamics particularly, do you see the imports going in one particular direction over the next couple of months or are you pretty isolated from that?", " S. Eugene Edwards", "I think there were heavy turnarounds in Asia and Europe earlier in the year, which reduced the buy obviously and the other factor is Mexican demand is up on imports quite substantially versus last year. The latest numbers are around 300,000 barrels per day. Also, imports into Nigeria where oil-refining capacity is down and imports to places like Iran, Singapore and other areas that you know that are just becoming bigger importers of gas than they have been in the past. This takes barrels off the market until you get them to the United States.", "William Klesse", "Which then causes the prices to have to get higher to attract the imports.", " Doug Leggate - Citigroup ", "I guess where I\u2019m going with that is I\u2019m trying to get an idea of your thoughts longer-term. 2007 was a little more transitory because of these import issues, which arguably is why inventories are so low. Is that something that you think is repeatable or sustainable or do you think it kind of goes back to normal?", "S. Eugene Edwards ", "Well, all the things I\u2019ve mentioned are because of world economic growth. Gasoline demand increasing faster than supply, which leaves fewer barrels left to come to the United States.", " Doug Leggate - Citigroup ", "OK, my follow-up is related to the summer-winter issue. Clearly, there is a little bit of a blend premium associated with the summer blend nowadays. But when do you guys start transitioning back to winter grade? When would you expect to be fully producing winter-grade gasoline again across your system?", "S. Eugene Edwards ", "Usually around mid-September.", "William Klesse", "And it varies.", "S. Eugene Edwards ", "Northern California is September/October.", "William Klesse", "Southern California is a month later and then in our other markets it starts in mid-September as Gene said and then we go through a couple of steps so I think that by the end of October, we\u2019re making Winter gasoline in the mid-continent and East.", " Doug Leggate - Citigroup ", "Great, thanks a lot.", "William Klesse", "If you need to know exactly who gets what, Ashley can give you exact dates by now.", " Doug Leggate - Citigroup ", "I\u2019ll follow up with him. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Mark Gilman with Benchmark.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "Guys, good morning. Can you, I guess I\u2019m following up on a point that either Bill or Rich made, neither of the mild hydro pro-reactors at St. Charles or Houston came on in the second quarter?", "S. Eugene Edwards ", "No, Mark, where we are on those, the Houston unit came up towards the back part of May. So it is in service and running well. And the St. Charles unit is actually in start-up as we speak and it should be full commissioned by next week.", " Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company ", "OK, thanks. Can you give me a rough or precise idea how much physical WTI/WTS you actually ran in the second quarter both in the mid-continent and the Gulf Coast regions?", "William Klesse", "We wouldn\u2019t have run any in the Gulf Coast, Mark, WTI or WTS and we\u2019ll see if we can try to get you a number here.", "S. Eugene Edwards ", "We don\u2019t have it broken out by crude at this level. Ashley can follow-up and dig that number out of the system for you.", " Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company ", "OK, but zero in the Gulf Coast, TI and TS?", "William Klesse", "We cannot, we can\u2019t really get it there today, people are looking at a lot of things to try to move this and today you can\u2019t get it down.", " Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company ", "All right, I\u2019m assuming that there is a pretty large working capital, liquidation number in the quarter from a cash-flow standpoint Mike, is that accurate?", "Michael S. Ciskowski ", "No, no when you look at the items that have been disclosed in our earnings material, they pretty much come to the change in cash flow. A change in cash of $640 million. So we don\u2019t have a huge working capital requirement in the second quarter.", " Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company ", "OK, and just one final one; any derivative effects of any kind impacting the second quarter results?", "William Klesse", "Are you talking there about our hedging?", " Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company ", "Well, Bill, broadly derivative including hedging and anything else.", "William Klesse", "Well, we still, when we buy crude oil and stuff, we still put paper against that; it\u2019s how a business is run.

I think we\u2019ve just about hit all my questions, actually, but one that\u2019s outstanding is the way the curves have shifted. Is there any meaningful impact for you from the moves that we\u2019ve seen to backwardation in crude markets? As a follow up, any observations you could make about the fact that crude inventories, ostensibly, are quite high in the U.S., but we\u2019ve seen obviously very high prices. At the same time, gasoline inventory is not super loose by any means, but a cratering of the price there - any observations you can make on those would be great.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Well, I\u2019ll speak to gasoline. Gasoline pries are very low. They\u2019re very low on a historical basis. So the decline that we\u2019ve seen in the margins there isn\u2019t necessarily fundamentally driven. We\u2019re entering the season where we will start blending butanes back in, and so we know that will have an effect on the inventories. Nonetheless, we go into that period with inventories at very attractive levels relative to previous years.", "On the crude, the change in the market structure just means that we\u2019re not paid to carry it right, so what we\u2019ll do, what we always do, is we aggressively manage the inventory to the market structure, as we\u2019ve done on the product side.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Right, so I\u2019d expect to see inventories continuing to fall, but maybe the price, nevertheless, staying high.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Yea, I think there\u2019s no incentive to hold the inventories, so your observation there is correct. I will say, because Mark Gilman usually asks this question, on Contango versus backwardation, at least for the Mid-continent refineries, it does increase our effective crude cost into those two clients.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "There\u2019s been talk of the stocking of gasoline as well. Would you say that (inaudible) the same part of the impact that we\u2019ve seen on gasoline prices?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "I don\u2019t know if just the de-stocking is an issue, but we certainly have said to our plants, we\u2019re not holding gasoline at the refineries. Right? It\u2019s the end of the July and into August here, so we kind of keep the product moving to the market. And I would assume other companies look at it the same way.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Great, that\u2019s great, thanks. And just the final one from me, utilization was very poor in the first half. It was kind of lumpy between companies, but would you argue that perhaps there\u2019s been a secular shift towards a lower available capacity in the U.S.? Or do you think it was just a uniquely rough first half?", "William Klesse", "I\u2019ll try and answer you, and I\u2019ll ask Rich for some help here, but clearly when you look at crude, you look at the whole system. You have to treat your products, between the [dissolance], which basically we\u2019re taking all the salt around the [dissolance]. If you take a seven PPM, eight PPM at the refineries, you get crude, for gasoline we\u2019re doing the same. So anytime you have a hydrotreater problem in your refinery, you can\u2019t make spec products. And so it does cause you, if your inventories are full, or if you have opponent inventories, you have to cut back. There are no other options. But it is a more complex refining environment now with all this severe hydrotreating. You want to add anything Rich?", " Richard Marcogliese", "Well yea I would. I think there is an impact in the market associated with the productivity in the maintenance workforce; the quality of the work. Revamps are being done to existing units. We\u2019ve found that even the quality of engineering is not what it was. And I think turnaround durations, directionally, are becoming longer. And I think that\u2019s a factor as well.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "As a rule of thumb, what would you say is the impact on [percentage] utilization?", " Richard Marcogliese", "It\u2019s kind of hard to quote an exact number. We know that they\u2019re qualitative factors.", "William Klesse", "I don\u2019t think, Paul, we would give you any better number than your own. But the things we mentioned to you are the real world that we work in.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Nicky Decker with Bear Sterns.", "Nicky Decker, Bear Stearns", "Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered as well. Just one on the ARB situation as you see it. Maybe you could give us an update as to where you see as attractive to send product? Well, I mean, the ARB into the US have been largely closed here recently. Primarily our exports are related to distill and those typically go South.", "Nicky Decker, Bear Stearns", "Okay. Have you seen any change in the numbers after the Exxon refinery outage in Europe?", "Richard Marcogliese", "Well, I haven\u2019t seen any change in the numbers, in talking to the guys on the trading floor, though, they\u2019re seeing less barrels loaded to cover this direction. Okay? So they try to keep a close eye, stay in till with the market and look for what might be moving and there hasn\u2019t been length in Europe really to speak of this summer, and it\u2019s certainly not changing now.", "Nicky Decker, Bear Stearns", "Okay. If I could just ask one other, on the results. Just looking at the operating costs on the West Coast. That was really a standout in terms of the higher than expectations, and it doesn\u2019t look like its particularly related to volumes. Maybe you could talk about what\u2019s driving up those costs.", "Richard Marcogliese", "I was going to say. There are two factors associated with that. There is an energy consumption factor, which just related to lower internal plant fueling and more natural gas purchase. This is primarily associated with Venetia. And then there was also a litigation reserve that was established for a labor issue out on the West Coast that impacted the results.", "Nicky Decker, Bear Stearns", "So it sounds like part of that we should carry out into future quarters?", "Richard Marcogliese", "Well, the litigation of course is a one-time issue, and as far as the energy costs go, we make internal market calls based upon the value of propane and butanes, whether they\u2019re better served as internal plant fuel, or whether we should sell them as products. We just track the market and do the most economic thing.", "Nicky Decker, Bear Stearns", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Ann Kohler, with Caris.", "Ann Kohler - Caris & Company", "Good morning, gentlemen. A question on your growth and acquisition strategy. You kind of highlighted before that currently the valuations in Europe are a bit high. It\u2019s my understanding, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, that you\u2019ve expressed some interest in a South American refinery, and if you could just clarify if that is true, and if so, what your thought process is behind that, I guess would be some new refinery in Central America.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "We have participated with Pemex/PMI, looking at this refinery in Panama that is being proposed. So we\u2019re taking a look at it, and that\u2019s the extent what our thought is. It\u2019s an opportunity and we\u2019re looking to see what we think as we get into it.", " Ann Kohler - Caris & Company ", "And is there any sort of timing on the process for the facility?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "They have a schedule. There\u2019s a meeting in September, and it drags on. But there\u2019s\u2014if you\u2019re worried, we\u2019re not about to jump into a grassroots refinery that doesn\u2019t have more assurance as to margin, going forward. But it\u2019s an opportunity and Latin America, we already told you, we know that Mexico is importing three hundred thousand barrels a day of gasoline now. We look to Central America, South America\u2014so there are opportunities here.", " Ann Kohler - Caris & Company ", "So this is an opportunity to participate in the growth in that particular market versus using the opportunity to basically import products into the US?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Right, we wouldn\u2019t do that if the place didn\u2019t import products into the US. That is correct.", " Ann Kohler - Caris & Company ", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question is a follow up from the line of Mark Gilman with Benchmark.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "Hey, Bill. It looks to me as if some of the ULSD premiums are beginning to tighten up and shrink a bit. Perhaps in response to the industry having overdone it a little bit in terms of supply capability. Do you think there\u2019s any chance as we go toward the winner that we may see ULSD being downgraded from a value standpoint and maybe sold into the aiding oil pool?", "William Klesse", "My answer to that would be yes. But it has to do with logistics more products available. But people will tend to sell it in the command. If you look at our whole system, that by the end of this year, just to give you an example, we will be able to make ULSD in every single refinery or car diesel in every refinery except the Northeast. So, you can, and I think the industry done that. You want to add something, Gene?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "I think you\u2019re right. The East Coast is really the only place where they will make high sulphur diesel. It's done in great degree.", "William Klesse", "So we agree with your observation.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "Thanks, Bill.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. Ms. Smith, are there any closing remarks?", "Ashley Smith", "No, we will just conclude the call. Thank you very much for listening to our call.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone tothe Valero Energy third quarter 2007 earnings conference call. (OperatorInstructions) I will now turn the call over to Mr. Ashley Smith. Please goahead, sir.", "Ashley Smith", "Thank you, Dennis. Good morning and welcome to Valero EnergyCorporation\u2019s third quarter 2007 earnings conference call. With me today areBill Klesse, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Ciskowski, our CFO; Rich Marcogliese,our Chief Operating Officer; and other members of our executive managementteam.", "If you have not received the earnings release and would likea copy, you can find one on our website at Valero.com. There are also tablesattached to the earnings release which provide additional financial informationon our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing thesetables, please feel free to contact investor relations after the call.", "Before we get started, I would like to direct your attentionto the forward-looking statements disclaimer contained in the press release. Insummary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conferencecall that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s expectations for predictions ofthe future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safeharbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors whichcould cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those wedescribed in our filings with the SEC.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike.", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Thanks, Ashley and thank you for joining us today. As notedin the release, our third quarter earnings came in at $1.34 per share fromcontinuing operations and $0.75 per share from discontinued operations.Excluding the effect on diluted earnings per share related to the company\u2019s $94million settlement payment for the accelerated share repurchase program, whichwas $0.16 per share, and a $91 million pretax gain, or $0.10 per share aftertaxes resulting from the repayment of a loan by a foreign subsidiary, the thirdquarter 2007 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.40.", "You should note that the gain on the sale and the operationsof the recently divested Lima, Ohio refinery are classified as discontinued operationsin the financial tables that accompany the earnings release.", "Third quarter 2007 operating income was $1.2 billioncompared to $2.3 billion reported in the same period last year. The $1.1billion reduction in operating income was primarily due to lower throughputmargin per barrel of $9.94, which is down $3.23 per barrel versus the thirdquarter of 2006.", "The key driver of the lower margin was the higher price forlight sweet crude oils and smaller discounts for sour crude oils and other feedstocks. On average, our feed stocks were approximately $3 per barrel moreexpensive versus WTI and reduced operating income by more than $700 million ascompared to the third quarter of 2006.", "Additional factors that negatively affected operating incomeinclude substantially lower throughput margins in the West Coast region, whichreduced operating income by approximately $110 million; lower margins for manyof the company\u2019s other products, such as asphalt, lube oils, and petrochemicalfeed stocks; the impact of Hurricane Humberto on the company\u2019s Port Arthurrefinery; as well as operational issues at the company\u2019s Port Arthur, Aruba,and Ardmore refineries.", "Going through some of the key numbers for the third quarter,refinery throughput volumes averaged over to 2.8 million barrels per day, or50,000 barrels per day higher than the second quarter.", "Refinery operating expenses, excluding non-cash costs, were$3.96 per barrel. The $0.09 per barrel increase over the second quarter wasprimarily due to an unfavorable adjustment arising from sales tax accruals thatwere charged during the quarter. This was partially offset by lower energycosts and higher throughput volumes.", "General and administrative expenses, excluding corporatedepreciation, were $152 million. The $25 million decrease from the secondquarter was mainly due to additional charges incurred in the prior quarter,four charitable contributions, and the cancellation of a services agreementwith New Star Energy.", "Total depreciation and amortization expense was $343million. Interest expense net of capitalized interest was $123 million. The $40million increase in net interest expense versus the second quarter wasprimarily due to an increase in average borrowings and an increase in intereston taxes arising from the previously mentioned sales tax accruals.", "Our effective tax rate on continuing operations was 28.7% inthe third quarter, which was below the prior quarter due to the use of statetax credits and a greater-than-expected proportion of earnings from our Arubarefinery, which pays no income taxes.", "Regarding cash flows for the third quarter, capital spendingwas $619 million, which includes $108 million of turnaround expenditures. For2007, we expect our total capital spending to be around $3 billion.", "In the third quarter, we continued our stock buy-backprogram by spending $475 million to purchase approximately 7 million shares ofour common stock. So far during the fourth quarter, we have purchased over 1million shares. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $5 billion to ourstockholders through $205 million in dividends plus $4.8 billion to purchase 70million shares, which represents approximately 11% of our outstanding shares atthe end of 2006.", "To reach our $6 billion goal, we intend to purchase anadditional $1.2 billion of our shares by the end of the year.", "With respect to our debt position at the end of September,our total debt stood at $6.9 billion, which is unchanged from the end of June,and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of just over $3 billion.", "Now, as to the fourth quarter operations for your modelingpurposes, you should expect to see the Gulf Coast refinery throughput ofapproximately 1.6 million barrels per day. Mid-continent throughput should bebetween 435,000 and 445,000 barrels per day. Due to some planned maintenanceactivities, West Cost throughput should average between 240,000 and 250,000barrels per day. And then the Northeast system should average in the range of550,000 to 560,000 barrels per day. Refinery cash operating expenses areexpected to be about $3.90 per barrel.", "With respect to some of the other items for the fourthquarter, we anticipate G&A expense to be around $145 million, net interestexpense should be around $95 million, total depreciation and amortizationexpense should be around $350 million, and finally for the fourth quarter, youshould be using a 34% tax rate for your modeling purposes.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rich.", "Richard J.Marcogliese", "Thank you, Mike. Before I discuss our growth project in St.Charles, I would like to review some operating highlights from the thirdquarter.", "In July, we commissioned a 16,000 barrel per day distillate hydrotreater at our Benicia refinery and in August, a 50,000barrel per day mild hydrocracker at our St. Charles refinery. These projectswere part of our overall plan for making ultra-low sulfur diesel.", "Also, we are pleased that our Houstonand Paulsboro refineries were each recertified as VPP star sites under OSHA\u2019svoluntary protection program during the third quarter. In addition, our Ardmorerefinery was recommended for recertification on November 1st. Theserecertifications were made under OSHA\u2019s more rigorous national emphasisprogram.", "VPP Star site certification continues tobe an important part of Valero's commitment to occupational and process safety.", "Regarding operations in the fourthquarter, we have been executing several major unit turnarounds in ourrefineries. We are just completing a large crude unit turnaround in Paulsboro andare nearing completion of a catcracker turnaround in Texas City.", "On the West Coast, Benicia has its fluidcoker down for turnaround and our Wilmington refinery has its catcracker downto support a revamp project on the alkylation unit. As Mike referenced earlier,these turnarounds will impact throughput rates on the West Coast in the fourthquarter.", "Also in the fourth quarter, weanticipate the start-up of a new distillate hydrotreater in Corpus Christi inDecember. This is a 55,000 barrel per day unit and essentially completes ourULSD production plans, except for the Northeast.", "Turning to projects, we are very pleasedthat our board recently approved a major expansion project for our St. Charlesrefinery. The St. Charles hydrocracker project includes a new 50,000 barrel perday hydrocracker, a 45,000 barrel per day expansion of the crude unit, and a10,000 barrel per day expansion of the Coker.", "The project will increase dieselproduction by 49,000 barrels per day and gasoline production by 11,000 barrelsper day as part of our strategy to increase the proportion of ultra-low sulfurdiesel produced in our system. This project is expected to come online in 2010and cost $1.4 billion. This is one of the largest capital projects in Valero'shistory.", "Now I will turn it over to Bill.", "William R. Klesse", "Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everybody. In general, industrygasoline and other product margins have been low so far in the fourth quarter.The seasonal changes in supply and demand and the high crude oil prices havesqueezed gasoline margins to very low levels, thought they have improved acouple of dollars here in November.", "Diesel margins have been very good and unlike the thirdquarter, we are seeing wider discounts for medium and heavy sour crude oils thatwe process. For example, the Maya heavy sour crude oil discount to WTI inOctober averaged over $15 per barrel compared to the September. Today, it isover $16 per barrel. And the Mars medium sour crude oil discount is averagingover $11, one of the widest Mars discounts we\u2019ve ever seen. And the Saudidiscounts for the month of December have increased over $4 per barrel.", "As many of you know, we recently held our annual strategicplanning meeting with our board and our executive management team. The meeting,from our perspective, went very well and affirmed the strategy we have beenexecuting. Going forward, we will continue to upgrade the quality of ourrefining portfolio by investing in strategic growth projects at our flagshiprefineries that will make them even more competitive. A good example of this isthe project Rich just mentioned, the St. Charles hydrocracker project.", "Additionally, we continue to solve our issues or haveprojects in development that will accomplish our goals of a safer, more reliableand more efficient operation.", "Another outcome of our strategic planning meeting is that wehave decided to explore strategic alternatives for our Aruba refinery. TheAruba refinery does not make U.S. specification products, nor does it makefinished gasoline. A large capital investment is required to make thiscompetitive in the long run, thus we have decided to look at our strategicalternatives.", "Regarding our cash flow, we will continue to take a balancedapproach to investing in our key refineries, as discussed, buying back ourstock, increasing dividends, and maintaining our investment grade rating.", "Looking out into 2008, we expect another excellent refiningenvironment of strong product demand, favorable discounts for medium and heavysour crude and feed stocks, a tight refining capacity market as the worldeconomies continue to grow.", "With that, we will open it up to Q&A.", "Question-and-AnswerSession", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question will come from the line ofDoug Terreson with Morgan Stanley.", "Doug Terreson -Morgan Stanley", "Good morning, guys. Bill, you mentioned just a minute agothat -- and the press release I think suggested that you guys are activelyconsidering strategic alternatives for Aruba and I just have a couple ofquestions on that point. First, would you consider some type of joint ventureupgrading project with another company? If so, would any specific conditionsneed to be met, or are you solely considering outright divestiture.", "And the second question is how would you characterize theinterest level towards either type of strategic activity at this time, which ismore kind of a industry, general strategic question?", "William R. Klesse", "To your first question, we are sincere when we say strategicalternatives, but of course that includes a sale all the way through to someprocessing agreement, even. So we\u2019re in business here for as to maximize ourshareholder value for the long run.", "And how would I classify the environment?", "Doug Terreson -Morgan Stanley", "Well, the interest level toward strategic activity at thistime?", "William R. Klesse", "I think it\u2019s still very high. I think it\u2019s exampled by therecent announcement in California.", "Doug Terreson -Morgan Stanley", "Sure. Okay, thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Dietertwith Simmons.", "Jeff Dietert -Simmons", "Good morning. I was hoping you could give us an update onthe Port Arthur expansion and the Quebec hydrocracker. Those were projects youtalked about in early September that did not go in front of the board, butwhere do those projects stand?", "William R. Klesse", "Rich is going to go ahead and address that for you.", "Richard J.Marcogliese", "We are still very active in the development process forthose two projects. For Port Arthur, we envision an identical hydrocracker tobe installed at that refinery. Also related to that project will be theinstallation of a 45,000 barrel a day grass roots coker. Now, that project ison a different timeline from St. Charles and this largely is an outgrowth ofkind of assessing total plant workload.", "We have got a plant-wide turnaround scheduled for PortArthur in 2009, which incidentally includes the replacement of all six cokedrums on the existing coker. So taking a look at plant-wide workload betweenturnaround and construction, we\u2019ve pushed back the Port Arthur schedule about ayear and it will be more like a 2011 project compared to a 2010 project for St.Charles.", "For the Quebec refinery, we have active development underwayfor a combination project that would include about a 35,000 barrel a dayde-asphalting unit and a 50,000 barrel a day hydrocracker, which would make theQuebec operation more efficient in terms of reduced fuel oil production andmore flexible in terms of the varieties of crudes it can run, and that is alsoenvisioned as more of a 2011 project implementation schedule.", "So we are still very active in development on both.", "Jeff Dietert -Simmons", "Very good. If I could, on a second question, if you couldprovide some color, there\u2019s been a pretty severe change in the crude marketswith the market moving into backwardation. Could you talk about how that\u2019sinfluenced your crude purchases? Has it reduced your purchases, led you toreduce inventories, buy shorter haul crude? Could you provide some color on howthat\u2019s influencing your activity?", "UnidentifiedParticipant", "Sure, Jeff. This is Joe. All those things you mentioned arethings that we are certainly taking a look at. Obviously it doesn\u2019t pay tocarry crude today, so we are managing the inventories much more aggressivelyand we are keeping an eye on it. As far as the short-haul crudes go, we areabsolutely running them to the extent that we can.", "William R. Klesse", "It also obviously impacts our mid-continent, probably haschanged our crude costs into our mid-continent refineries, a couple dollars abarrel from the carry to the backward.", "Jeff Dietert -Simmons", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Arjun Murtiwith Goldman Sachs.", "Arjun Murti - GoldmanSachs", "You allude to wanting to finishing up the $6 billion stockbuy-back goal by the end of this year and that you\u2019d continue to do variouscash returns to shareholders next year. Is the timing of announcing a new stockbuy-back figured tied to whatever you decide to do with Aruba, or simplygetting to year-end and finishing up this programming, you\u2019ll take a fresh lookat where things stand for next year?", "William R. Klesse", "I would say the latter, Arjun. We will complete -- our planis to complete this program. We still have some authorization that\u2019s left thatcarries into next year, so to be technically correct here, we\u2019ll still have acouple million dollars of authorization. And we\u2019ll see how we see the world aswe get into the first quarter and then as we look to the second. But our planis to continue as we\u2019ve discussed.", "Arjun Murti - GoldmanSachs", "That\u2019s great. So you\u2019ve obviously already sold Lima. You\u2019venow announced Aruba. You\u2019ve just completed the strategic review with the board.Should we take that to mean -- should we expect there to be continuous highgrading as we get into next year and you are kind of taking it one refinery ata time, or does the conclusion of the review process mean you\u2019ve done Lima,you\u2019re going to do something with Aruba and that\u2019s it in terms of I guessselling or high-grading the existing refinery asset base?", "William R. Klesse", "Arjun, it\u2019s a continuing process and so you should assumethat as we go forward, we are constantly looking at these refinery assets. Somereally capitalized on our expertise of basically boiling and coking heavy crudeoils. Some have very unique locations and others might be worth more to otherpeople.", "Arjun Murti - GoldmanSachs", "That\u2019s great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Doug Leggatewith Citigroup.", "Doug Leggate -Citigroup", "Thank you. Good morning, everybody. A couple for me, realquick, I guess; what does the tax rate look like ex Aruba for the rest of theyear, the rest of the firm?", "William R. Klesse", "What does the CapEx --", "Doug Leggate -Citigroup", "The tax rate.", "William R. Klesse", "Tax rate, okay.", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "It would be probably about 1% or 2% higher, so instead of 34for the fourth quarter, you\u2019d like at 35% to 36%.", "Doug Leggate -Citigroup", "Okay, great. The second one for me is given what\u2019s going onin Europe right now, there seems to be some pretty incredible diesel cracks.Can you describe how you see the export opportunities over there?", "Richard J. Marcogliese", "Yeah, the arb is open, clearly, from the U.S. to Europe andwe are taking advantage of it today. I mean, we\u2019ve got cargoes that are inprocess of heading that direction.", "Doug Leggate -Citigroup", "Okay, so actively taking advantage of that -- have you got atake as to how long you expect that market to remain as strong as it is, giventhe down time you\u2019ve had on a number of venues over there?", "William R. Klesse", "I don\u2019t think we would know any better than you do. We readthe paper on the down time that\u2019s happened as well as you, so we wouldn\u2019t --the arb is open. Our business is a global business. Products move with the arband so we\u2019ll take, for our company, advantage of the arb while it stays open.", "Doug Leggate -Citigroup", "Okay. The final one from me is I wonder if you could justbring us up to date with your view on ethanol? There was a lot of discussion,obviously, about the volumetric impact, but at the same time, we are seeingsome pretty incredible discounts. When you take the tax credit into account, abig incentive there for you folks. But could you discuss the financial benefitversus the infrastructure bottlenecks as you see it in terms of whether ethanolis a threat or an opportunity for you as you move into 2008?", "William R. Klesse", "I\u2019ll give you some general comments and see if I can giveyou some numbers, but today it is advantageous to discretionary blend, evenagainst butane, so where you can, you -- where the logistics are available, theinfrastructure, you would probably be blending.", "We are blending because of the economics, as you properlystate, where we can but there is also a lack of infrastructure in many of themarkets, so we can\u2019t take advantage of that. Because with the butane when weblend it, you can ship it in the pipeline for winter spec but here with theethanol, it\u2019s got to be done all locally and so that\u2019s the constraint.", "Now, some of the numbers are compelling, as you say. Youhave any --", "Richard J.Marcogliese", "Well, we\u2019ve got prices that we\u2019re seeing -- $1.80 to $1.90 agallon for ethanol, so it clearly pays to blend it and we are blending about25,000 to 30,000 barrels a day. And we are blending it where we can.", "Doug Leggate -Citigroup", "Are you getting any octane benefit on the BOB that you areblending it with? Like, for example, an 83 versus an 87 regular?", "Richard J.Marcogliese", "The effect on the gasoline?", "William R. Klesse", "It would be true you get the octane, but unless we can sendto some of the terminals a sub-octane, then you don\u2019t get it, okay? Because wedon\u2019t have the -- we have to have the tankage and the logistics. If we areloading at the refinery, we will try to take advantage of it but logistics orinfrastructure here really restricts your ability to fully capitalize on this.But you have to get the sub-octane to the terminal.", "But you\u2019re correct; ethanol\u2019s got a great octane and so youtry to take advantage of it.", "Doug Leggate -Citigroup", "That\u2019s great, gentlemen. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Paul Sankey withDeutsche Bank.", "Paul Sankey -Deutsche Bank", "Good morning. A couple of follow-ups for me on Arubafirstly; I guess It\u2019s a bit more complicated as a sale. Do you have a bestguess for the time scale over which it will take to get something done?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, we are looking at strategic alternatives, so I\u2019m goingto tell you we are going to let the process run. It takes -- most things takemonths.", "Paul Sankey -Deutsche Bank", "Right, but possibly a bit longer than Lima?", "William R. Klesse", "I really wouldn\u2019t know.", "Paul Sankey -Deutsche Bank", "Fair enough. Are there any -- you mentioned the tax rate andthe tax impact, obviously. Are there any other major impact it\u2019s going to haveon your metrics? I\u2019m thinking of op-ex or anything else worth highlighting thatwill change post a potential sale?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Not really. The only -- on the Gulf Coast throughput postthe sale would be down roughly 200 million a day.", "William R. Klesse", "Two-hundred thousand.", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Two-hundred thousand barrels a day.", "Richard J.Marcogliese", "On op-ex, Aruba is one of our lower refineries on an op-exper barrel basis because it\u2019s a low conversion plant. There\u2019s no catcracking onAruba, for example.", "William R. Klesse", "So I guess to answer you, our operating costs in the GulfCoast would move up but if you deal in a complexity barrel, it wouldn\u2019t be thatway.", "Paul Sankey -Deutsche Bank", "Sure, I got you. Just going back to the -- another follow-upfrom me, the contango backwardation issue. I think it was an earnings impacteffectively, this quarter and I guess it will continue to be that as long as weremain in backwardation. Is that a fair statement and can you quantify how muchthe impact was?", "William R. Klesse", "It is a fair statement certainly for the mid-continentrefineries. It gets very complicated because Louisianagrade crudes tend to price the roll into them when at WTI, we have the rollvery visible. But to give you -- because it is significant. It comes up everytime we have the -- from contango to backward, it\u2019s in the -- between thesecond quarter and the third quarter, if you include our estimate for Louisianaon the roll, it\u2019s probably about a $58 million hit in our crude costs.", "Paul Sankey -Deutsche Bank", "Okay, so that was -- that\u2019s the trailing and I guess wewould expect that just to continue as long as the situation continues with the--", "William R. Klesse", "I was trying to give you a comparison but clearly you canlook at the roll and you can look where the contango was in our mid-continentvolumes and you can figure out that it raised our crude costs that much.", "But yes, those numbers I gave you were second quarter tothird quarter.", "Paul Sankey -Deutsche Bank", "I\u2019ve got you. Okay, thanks. Just a last one for me, I guessto roll up what you said about the change in the environment, you mentionedgasoline weaker, diesel better, differentials helpful. On balance, are youexpecting a better quarter this quarter than we saw in Q3 on an ongoing basis,obviously? Worse or -- you know, how are we panning out quarter to date forearnings? Thanks.", "William R. Klesse", "We usually don\u2019t give you any guidance on this but I willtell you, you can look at the industry cracks. Obviously October was a weakmonth and the cracks are strengthening. If you look at where we are today, it\u2019sgoing to be a weak fourth quarter but it is strengthening. Some of the marketsare recovering. As I said, gasoline is a couple dollars better, the Saudidiscounts are wider, the Maya, Mars is absolutely almost a record. I can\u2019tremember $11.", "So the quarter is improving. It\u2019s hard for me to tell you atthis point in time whether it\u2019s going to be better or worse than the thirdquarter, and I\u2019ll also tell you it\u2019s this time of year. Gasoline season for usis generally over, even though we have good demand still, and distillates,we\u2019re like everybody -- winter\u2019s coming.", "Paul Sankey -Deutsche Bank", "Yeah, and I guess that\u2019s the basis for you being positive on\u201908 as well, is that despite -- I mean, you seem to be saying that demand isstrong. Could you just address that one a little bit? I guess some of the DOEdata is looking a bit weak.", "William R. Klesse", "Well, the DOE data is all over the place but it\u2019s easy -- ifwe go back and look at the monthly data, gasoline is up year-to-date. However,we would not argue that the recent gasoline data is probably pretty darn flatwith last year. It\u2019s hard to articulate whether it\u2019s just prices or whetherit\u2019s housing, confidence in the economy, or whatever. But we would say it\u2019s --gasoline right now is pretty flat with last year, so your assessment iscorrect.", "However, when we look into next year, lots of changes,refining is still tight, our product is still economic -- I mean, compared towhere it was, obviously not but it is still a very viable, economic product --and the dollar weakness is also impacting all of this.", "But we are still very optimistic that the refining supplyand demand balance remains tight.", "Paul Sankey -Deutsche Bank", "I think I\u2019ve had my fair share. Thanks for that.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Paul Chengwith Lehman Brothers.", "Paul Cheng - LehmanBrothers", "Good morning, guys. I think this is for Mike or maybe forBill; I think previously that we were talking about 2008 capital spending, $4.7billion to $5 billion, and at the time I think the timelines for Port Arthurand Quebec upgrading project is 2010, so with those two projects, the delay,are we looking differently on that CapEx range?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "For 2008, we are still looking at right around $5 billion ora little bit under.", "Paul Cheng - LehmanBrothers", "So we are still at $5 billion?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Yes, Paul.", "Paul Cheng - LehmanBrothers", "And then Mike, for 2007, I think the original budget is 3.5and then later on, that turned into 3.2 and now I think, if I\u2019m not mistaken,you are talking about $3 billion. Is there any project being delayed or thatyou guys just do far more effectively?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "There is only really one project that we consciously delayedand that was the crude oil expansion at the Quebec refinery, which we rolledfrom year-end 2007 to mid 2008. Beyond that specific deferral, the capitalexpenditures are just following the normal progression of our capital projectdevelopment, and in some cases things are moving along just a little bit slowerthan we anticipated.", "William R. Klesse", "But you heard the numbers correctly, Paul. We would expectto be around this $3 billion or slightly less for 2007.", "Paul Cheng - LehmanBrothers", "I see. And I think this is for Rich; in the third quarter,we have a little bit of the operating upset in I think Port Arthur this year,some of the facility. Can you quantify that? I mean, how much is the actual andopportunity costs associated with those?", "Richard J.Marcogliese", "What we\u2019ve associated with the third quarter was about a$300 million impact, which is favorable to the second quarter but it\u2019s a bignumber nonetheless. The issues we had, just to give you a sense, we had thecatcracker outage in Ardmore in July. We had issues with the Port Arthur crudeunits also in July, which was separate from the hurricane impact that MikeCiskowski mentioned. We also difficulty with the coke handling system at our Port  Arthur refinery.", "We had crude throughput issues in our Aruba plant, whichwere related to typing and metallurgical issues, so we had a number of thingsgoing on across the system. Additionally, we also had a catalyst change on theTexas City gas oil hydrotreater. We don\u2019t generally define that as a major unitturnaround, but that also had its impact in the third quarter.", "Paul Cheng - LehmanBrothers", "Rich, since I\u2019ve got you, is there a preliminary firstquarter turnaround schedule you can share?", "Richard J.Marcogliese", "Well, I\u2019ll just mention a couple of things for first quarter\u201908. In February of next year, we plan to take the St. Charles millisecondcatcracker down for about a 21-day turnaround, and then also in Quebec, we\u2019regoing to take one of the crude units down. This is a crude unit that\u2019s going tobe revamped for the expansion project. That will come down in the March/Apriltimeframe for about 42 days. Those are the most significant.", "Paul Cheng - LehmanBrothers", "And [money] for Aruba, I believe the tax holiday is comingup for extension or expiration. Is it 2010 or 2011?", "William R. Klesse", "It is for 2010, the end of 2010.", "Paul Cheng - LehmanBrothers", "The end of 2010, so whatever is the selling price of thatproperty -- if we decide to sell, that probably we\u2019ll need to take intoconsideration.", "William R. Klesse", "Well, I think so. You got it.", "Paul Cheng - LehmanBrothers", "Okay, excellent. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Chi Chow withTristone Capital.", "Chi Chow - TristoneCapital", "Thanks. I was wondering if you could provide us with anupdate on McKee and what the status is there?", "UnidentifiedParticipant", "Sure, I can do that. Currently we are in the sameconfiguration in McKee, which is the total plant is up ex the propanede-asphalting unit. Construction continues on the revamp and rebuild of thatunit. We expect mechanical completion some time late November, early December,with start-up of the PDA either just before the end of the year or in earlyJanuary.", "Today, the plant is running at a throughput of about 140,000barrels a day with the PDA out of service.", "Chi Chow - TristoneCapital", "And are you running more sweet crude as a result now?", "UnidentifiedParticipant", "We have adjusted the crude mix at McKee to try to minimizethe [volumes] production. That is the constraint on the refinery operationbecause we are shipping fuel all out by rail, so very recently we\u2019ve made someattempts to lighten the crude slate a little.", "Chi Chow - TristoneCapital", "How big of an impact do you think McKee and also BP's Whitingplant, downtime at both those plants is having on Cushing inventories? And asthose plants get back up, do you see the backwardation easing at all and do yousee sour crude discounts narrowing going forward?", "UnidentifiedParticipant", "Chi, you know it had a significant impact back in the secondand probably the early part of the third quarter. I think we saw thedislocation of TI to the other sweet crudes as a result of that, where it wassignificantly discounted. I think that largely, that\u2019s behind us.", "As far as the effect going forward and the heavy sourdiscounts coming in, with these high prices like we are experiencing today, Ithink we are going to continue to see strong discounts. We have Maya discountstoday that are over $16. We have other heavy sours that are in the market thatare trading at $20 plus discount, so I would say that if we were to look at it,we would expect the heavy sour discounts to maintain.", "William R. Klesse", "I think the other piece you asked in there was what ouroutlook would be on the backwardation. I would say if inventories continue tokeep drawing, the backwardation is going to continue, okay? So if you areasking how we plan our business here, we are looking at these overallinventories and trying to assess where we really think they are going to go.And if they keep coming down, the front is going to stay a little tightrelative to the out months. We\u2019re going to see the backwardation continue.", "It\u2019s very difficult for us to comment, as Joe skipped aroundthere, that we can\u2019t comment on BP. At McKee though, we are running prettyclose to our crude charge. BP's situation at Whiting, we wouldn\u2019t know about.", "Chi Chow - TristoneCapital", "What type of crude do you think is sitting in Cushing rightnow, in storage? Is it primarily sour grades?", "UnidentifiedParticipant", "I don\u2019t know for certain but we would -- we know that thereis a lot of Canadian crude in Cushing today.", "William R. Klesse", "I guess we\u2019ll give you one other piece of info; we also knowasphalt markets are very weak and when you know asphalt markets are very weak,you don\u2019t want to run the WTS, and so you tend to -- so your idea or approachhere may be right, Chi, but we don\u2019t have any per se data.", "Chi Chow - TristoneCapital", "Okay, then one more question on Aruba; have you seen thereliability, in particular the power supply, improve over the years sinceyou\u2019ve had that plant?", "Richard J.Marcogliese", "Let me comment. Let me say that we have put a lot into itand we even have more investments planned, but we did have a total powerdisruption on Aruba about a month ago, which was related to a transformer andbreaker failure, which we had anticipated replacing within the next year or so,so I would say we\u2019ve put quite a bit of effort and investment into theupgrading. But the difficulty is we still have a lot of 1930s and 1940s vintageinfrastructure that is in the process of being upgraded and we\u2019re not completewith the program.", "Chi Chow - TristoneCapital", "Okay, thanks, Rich. Appreciate that.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question will come fromthe line of Mark Gilman with The Benchmark Company.", "Mark Gilman - TheBenchmark Company", "Good morning. I had a couple of things. I wanted to go backto this mid-continent effect. Bill, I think you said a $58 million impact onthe third quarter. My guess is that it was probably something closer tomultiples of that, just going from the average contango in the second to theaverage backwardation in the third. Also, if you could clarify -- it\u2019s myunderstanding that this is an effect really only during the time when youswitch from contango to backwardation and not if the market structure remainsthe same going forward.", "William R. Klesse", "I can only tell you the numbers that people give me, and thenumber I gave you is the number they gave me, okay?", "As far as to your question as to -- I guess what you areasking is when it changes, it\u2019s the impact? Well, it was contango in the secondand the contango reduced, and so I was giving you the impact of the drop in orthe reduction of the contango, of the roll.", "So as it\u2019s continued to roll and comes down to the questionthat we were asked earlier, if you compare fourth quarter to second quarter, itis going to have two times or something the number I gave you for the third tothe second. If you are comparing the fourth to the third, it\u2019s gotten worse soit is going to be to that magnitude.", "But you know this roll like I know the roll and you know thebackwardation. I\u2019m giving you the number that we calculate.", "Mark Gilman - TheBenchmark Company", "-- we\u2019re on the same page. Let me try something else, if Icould; it just appears to me that as it relates to your Texas and Gulf Coastplants in particular, that a pretty good fraction of the reliability in unplanneddowntime issues relate to power and I was wondering whether in response tothis, if you share my conclusion, whether co-gen type investments on a broaderscale would make a lot of sense.", "Richard J.Marcogliese", "I might take a crack at that. I would not characterize ourGulf Coast system as having a generalized power issue. If you went back a fewyears, there were issues of that nature in Texas City that we\u2019ve sincecorrected. Where we\u2019re having most of our reliability issues are in the PortArthur refinery, but that is primarily related to the operation of the delayedcoker.", "Now, I would also say that from a co-gen infrastructurepoint of view, Port Arthur is one of the most highly integrated plants in termsof internal power generation. And a good example of that, there was this recentpipeline fire in the Port Arthur area. It took out both 230,000 volt feeders tothe refinery. We were able to [islandize] the plant and run off power generatedfrom our relationship with Air Products to product hydrogen.", "I mean, just to summarize again, I would not say that wehave a power reliability issue in the Gulf Coast. Where we are seeing areliability issues, they are associated with the process units.", "William R. Klesse", "In Aruba, we\u2019ve made a lot of improvements but we generateall our power there. It basically starts with fuel oil to stay into the power,and so the improvements we have made have helped but power in Aruba is achallenge.", "Mark Gilman - TheBenchmark Company", "Thanks, guys. Let me try one more if I could, regardingAruba specifically; Aruba has a number of the characteristics that you wouldotherwise look at I think as being desirable in terms of both size as well ascoastal location, ability to receive VLCC type cargoes. Is there a message thatperhaps you are sending the government regarding the expiration of the taxholiday with this announcement, and therefore might this strategic alternativeassessment potentially wind up in no action at all?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, I guess potentially I would say yes, but we aresincere in looking at our strategic alternatives. I think that you are veryfamiliar with the refinery. In a high crude cost environment, when you have acoking refinery that doesn\u2019t do any upgrading, it is a different competitiveplant than a -- for instance, for us, our St. Charles refinery that does cokingand upgrades.", "Another thing, remember Aruba does not make any gasoline. Itmakes very limited ULSD, so as we do our assessment of the future, it requiresus to invest heavily in this refinery to be competitive. And so you, as aperson who recommends our stock and as the people that own our stock wouldexpect us to do, we would -- we are looking at our alternatives. So that\u2019s whatwe\u2019re doing, Mark.", "Hey, listen, on your contango question and backwardquestion, when the market contango in the mid-continent, we capture the roll,so --", "Mark Gilman - TheBenchmark Company", "I understand that. It\u2019s the loss of that and going tobackwardation where there is a significant loss, if you will --", "William R. Klesse", "That\u2019s right, so --", "Mark Gilman - TheBenchmark Company", "-- this is a number that in the third quarter looks to melike it\u2019s more like $200 million.", "William R. Klesse", "Well, we didn\u2019t calculate it that high but if you went backto the second quarter and went all the way to the fourth quarter, where youhave a dollar backward versus over a dollar contango, it\u2019s a big number. Iagree.", "Mark Gilman - TheBenchmark Company", "Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Daniel Vetterwith J.P. Morgan.", "Daniel Vetter - J.P.Morgan", "Can you comment on your progress to date towards meetingyour $1 billion operating improvement target?", "Richard J.Marcogliese", "Sure, and just to -- just to define that, we\u2019ve got a $1billion competitive gap closure objective defined over a five-year period. Wehave a rigorous reporting and stewardship process towards those objectives.", "What I would say generally first is the progress on thatkind of by design is more heavily weighted to the back end, because there aresome large capital projects that we need to implement to create some of thisgap closure.", "Examples I would use, you know, I\u2019ve described problems withthe coker in Port Arthur. We\u2019ve got a premature drum cracking issue there.We\u2019re going to replace all six coke drums in 2009. We are also going to dolikewise at our St. Charles plant and replace four coke drums there.", "So certain of the refinery reliability boost and improvementthat we are anticipating isn\u2019t really captured until 2009. Now, we do have anumber of non-capital improvement initiatives, maintenance efficiency, energyconservation, that are underway but we\u2019re really early in the program at thispoint.", "So I would say our program is on track but it is lightlyloaded on the front end and kind of heavily loaded mid to the back end.", "Daniel Vetter - J.P.Morgan", "Okay, and one more, if I may; I noticed that the estimatedcost of the St. Charles project, or I guess it\u2019s actually a handful ofprojects, is up a bit from your prior estimate. Can you comment on the -- orupdate us on the expected EBITDA contribution of that project, or the expectedreturns of that handful of projects? Thank you.", "William R. Klesse", "The capital is up from when I was in New York in September,as we finalized the project to scope for our board, so that was the number wecame up with. We are looking here to find the EBITDA number, but the projecthas a return that\u2019s in the -- slightly higher than the mid-teens and we expectit to, at this order of magnitude project, using our forecast in the future, itadds significant -- and that\u2019s an [inaudible] return -- significant shareholdervalue.", "If we can\u2019t find the EBITDA, you\u2019ll need to call AshleySmith here.", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "It was on the slide I think I used in New York. We haven\u2019t-- I\u2019ll get you an updated number for that slightly higher cost estimate now.", "Daniel Vetter - J.P.Morgan", "Okay, and the mid-teens return assumes what kind of a marginenvironment?", "William R. Klesse", "It\u2019s our strategic plan forecasting and we do our ownforecast on this and so that -- I mean, that\u2019s what it is.", "Daniel Vetter - J.P.Morgan", "Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Ari Raivetzwith Banc of America.", "Ari Raivetz - Banc ofAmerica", "Just a quick follow-up on the ethanol; you had said 25,000to 30,000 a dayof blending. I\u2019m just wondering how much of that is discretionary versus statemandated.", "William R. Klesse", "I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have a good answer for you onthat.", "Richard J.Marcogliese", "If I look at the numbers, I would tell you it looks likeprobably 12,000 or probably half of it is mandatory and the other half isdiscretionary.", "Ari Raivetz - Banc ofAmerica", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question will come fromthe line of Paul Cheng with Lehman Brothers.", "Paul Cheng - LehmanBrothers", "Just two quick follow-ups; Mike, for 2008, your CapEx is $5billion. Given the three major upgrades in Port Arthur, Quebec and St. Charles,should we assume that is roughly about in the $5 billion from 2009 to 2011also? Or that the number will be lower?", "William R. Klesse", "The 2008, we\u2019re not going to spend a lot of money on PortArthur or Quebec just because of timing, so in all our numbers, we\u2019ve said --it just really doesn\u2019t have that big an impact.", "But yes, to your question, you can look at this range ofcapital here for \u201908 and \u201909 and then \u201910 really depends on how much was spenton these jobs in \u201909, quite frankly -- \u201909 is a large turnaround year for usalso. So if I add that, it could be slightly higher than in \u201908. If you look atour turnaround scheduled extended, \u201909, as Rich said, we have Port  Arthur, we have the St. Charles,both cokers, we have the millisecond complete revamp at the end of \u201909 -- bigprojects for us.", "Paul Cheng - LehmanBrothers", "So that means \u201909 may be over five and the \u201910 and \u201911 maybe somewhat below five?", "William R. Klesse", "I think that\u2019s a fair assessment for right now.", "Paul Cheng - LehmanBrothers", "And if I looked at the presentation you have this[inaudible] back in September, quickly calculate the sustainable capital isabout in the $2.6 billion, $2.7 billion for 2008. Is that also a reasonableproxy going forward, based on your current configuration, assuming we don\u2019t doanything with Aruba?", "William R. Klesse", "I would say it\u2019s in the $2 billion-ish, so 2.2, 2.3 I thinkis fair.", "Paul Cheng - LehmanBrothers", "Okay. A final question; Mike, for 2008, is there a numberyou can share for anti-dilution, that how much stock you have to buy back in2008? I mean, is it 10 million shares, 5 million shares? What kind of a numbershould we assume?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "The number that -- I mean, a lot of that depends on theexercise of stock options and the like, but I would guesstimate about 10million to 12 million shares.", "Paul Cheng - LehmanBrothers", "Perfect. Thank you.", "Operator", "And at this time, this does conclude the Q&A session.Please continue with any closing comments.", "Ashley Smith", "I just want to thank everyone for listening to our calltoday and if you need more information, please contact our investor relationsdepartment.

There are many factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Mike.", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Ashley and thank you all for joining us today. As noted in the release, our fourth quarter earnings came in at $1.02 per share. For the full year 2007 earnings were $7.72 per share from continuing operations and $1.16 from discontinued operations.", "As discussed on the last call, the gain on the sale and the operations of the Lima, Ohio refineries are classified as discontinued operations in the financial tables that accompany the earnings release.", "Fourth quarter 2007 operating income was $884 million compared to $1.4 billion reported in the same period of 2006. The $540 million reduction in operating income was due in large part to the lower throughput margin per barrel of $9.20 which was down a $1.46 per barrel versus the fourth quarter of 2006. Margins for gasoline and many of the company's secondary products, such as asphalt, fuel oils and petrochemical feedstocks, were lower this quarter as the prices for those products did not increase in proportion to the cost of the feedstocks used to produce them.", "Fourth quarter 2007 operating income was also affected by a $123 million increase in refinery operating expenses from the fourth quarter of 06 which was driven by higher maintenance expense and energy costs.", "Going through some of the key numbers for the fourth quarter, refinery throughput volumes averaged to 2.8 million barrels per day or 38,000 barrels per day lower than the third quarter. This reduction was mostly because of maintenance activities in the fourth quarter.", "Refinery operating expenses, excluding non-cash costs, were $4.11 per barrel. The $0.50 per barrel increase over the third quarter was primarily due to increased maintenance expense and energy costs and lower throughput volumes which were partially offset by a decrease in the sales tax accrual expense arising from charges in the third quarter.", "General and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $164 million. The $12 million increase from the third quarter was primarily due to an increase in equity-based compensation expense and an increase in charitable contributions which were partially offset by a decrease in environmental reserves arising from the charge that was taken in the third quarter.", "Total depreciation and amortization expense was $358 million and interest expense net of capitalized interest was $95 million. The $28 million decrease in net interest expense versus the third quarter was primarily due to additional interest expense incurred in the prior quarter arising from the previously mentioned sales tax accruals.", "Our effective tax rate on continuing operations was 29% in the fourth quarter which was below guidance from the prior quarter due in large part to a favorable reduction in the Canadian tax rate which was implemented in mid-December.", "Regarding cash flows for the fourth quarter, capital spending was approximately $890 million which includes $180 million of turnaround expenditures. For the full year 2007 capital spending came in at $2.8 billion, including approximately $520 million for turnarounds. For 2008 our capital expenditure forecast has come down a little, and we now expect our total capital spending to be around $4.5 billion.", "In the fourth quarter, we continued our stock buyback program by spending $1 billion to purchase 15.4 million shares of our common stock. For the full year 2007 we returned more than $6 billion to our shareholders through $270 million in dividends plus $5.8 billion to purchase over 84 million shares which represents 14% of our outstanding shares at the end of 2006. So far during the first quarter of 2008, we have purchased 2.2 million shares. But we've had to be out of the market the past two weeks due to our quiet period prior to releasing fourth quarter earnings.", "With respect to our debt position at the end of December, our total debt was $6.9 billion, and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.5 billion. At the end of the year, our debt-to-cap ratio net of cash was 19.2% which is an increase of 2.5% from the end of the third quarter bringing us closer to our target ratio of 25%.", "As to first quarter operations, for modeling purposes, you should expect to see Gulf Coast refinery throughput of approximately 1.45 million to 1.5 million barrels per day.", "Gulf Coast throughputs will be affected by plant maintenance especially at our Port Arthur refinery where work on the coker drums will reduce throughputs for around three months beginning in early February and in also at Aruba due to the last week's fire near the vacuum tower that will reduce throughput for approximately three months.", "Mid-Continent throughput should be around 410,000 barrels per day. West Coast throughput should average between 240,000 and 250,000 barrels per day. The Northeast system should average in the range of 550,000 to 560,000 barrels per day.", "Refinery cash operating expenses are expected to be about $4.40 per barrel, an increase of about $0.30 per barrel from the fourth quarter due to higher maintenance expense and lower throughput.", "With respect to some of the other items for the first quarter, we anticipate G&A expense to be around $160 million. Net interest expense should be around $95 million, total depreciation and amortization expense around $360 million. And finally, for the first quarter you should be using a 34% tax rate for modeling purposes. The increase in the tax rate from the fourth quarter is due to the non-recurring deferred tax benefit in the Canadian tax rate change implemented in the fourth quarter of 2007.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Bill.", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Mike. Good morning. As Mike said our financial results were excellent in 2007. We have strong earnings and many parts of our operations contributed to the success. For example, our retail group had their best results ever with nearly $250 million in annual operating income. Our retail restructuring activities last year contributed to this success.", "We also increased our dividend by 50%, sold the Lima refinery and purchased more than 84 million shares of our stock, basically honoring our commitment to you for a $6 billion buyback. If you combine our purchases in 2006 and 2007 we have purchased nearly 120 million shares or 20% of our common stock that was outstanding at the end of 2005. We continue to return cash to the shareholder.", "With regard to optimizing our refining portfolio, we continue to look at strategic alternatives for Aruba, Memphis and Krotz Springs. Going forward we will continue to review our assets, identifying ways to optimize our operations, and increase our shareholder returns as we invest in our core refineries.", "Unfortunately, we continue to experience operating issues at our refineries, the most recent being the fire at Aruba refinery. This fire resulted from a maintenance repair effort on a control vault which resulted in a leak of a very hot vacuum tower bottles, the material when it leaked, auto-ignited resulting in the fire. This fire has shut down the refinery, and we expect to resume partial operations in about two weeks with full operations expected in about three months.", "For 2008 current industry conditions are setting the stage for a rebound in gasoline margins. We are experiencing the usual build in winter-grade gasoline inventories ahead of the industry wide maintenance that typically begins in late January. These inventories will be worked down during the first quarter maintenance period as the industry transitions into making summer-grade gasoline. It is also important to remember that it is more difficult to produce the summer-grade gasoline because of the tighter specifications in ethanol use, placing a premium on key blending components, such as alkylate and raffinates.", "We also continue to see strong diesel margins which created an incentive to maximize diesel production at the expense of gasoline. With total gasoline and diesel inventories in the U.S. and Europe less than at this time last year and with the seasonal increase in demand, we expect more favorable gasoline margins this spring and summer as reflected by the forward curve.", "However, there is no debate today that the West Coast margins have been very low causing run cuts and further optimization. For Valero, we have completed and started up our Wilmington Alky expansion that will allow us to better blend summer gasoline. As we await spring and summer demand, we have reduced operating rates at our Benicia refinery to contain inventories. Also, as this has happened, California gasoline cracks have improved from the recent lows.", "We continue to see large discounts for a heavy sour crude oils that we process. For example, the mono heavy sour crude oil discount to WTI average for December was over $14 per barrel. The MARS medium sour crude oil discount to WTI averaged over $6 a barrel and these discounts are holding up well.", "We also feel that sour crude discounts should remain wide in 2008, due to the new Gulf of Mexico medium sour crude production coming online, and because of the value of residual oils not keeping pace with crude oil prices.", "East of the Rockies, light sweet crudes like Brandt, LLS have been selling at a premium to WTI due to the strong global demand for distillates. These high crude oil prices have been pressuring margins at our non-WTI sweet crude refineries. We also expect prices for products, like petroleum coke, petrochemical feedstocks, sulphur and others to increase as they catch up with a higher price of crude oil.", "In our business, it is always about supply and demand, and we expect good refined product demand this year. If we have a recession, lower demand will likely have some adverse effect on margins, but actions by the Federal Reserving and Congress are attempting a head off a slowdown.", "As we look at several consultants' margin forecasts for the year, the forward curves for gasoline and diesel remain in line with all of these expectations and economic forecasts for the U.S. and the world continue to show economic growth. Also, note that imports of gasoline to Mexico and imports of distillate to China continue to grow.", "So, we continue to have growing global petroleum demand with most forecast in the 1.2 million to 1.6 million barrel per day range. We expect an excellent spring, summer gasoline season and a continuation of higher distillate margins.", "With that, we will open the call to questions.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Citigroup.", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Thanks. Good morning guys.", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Doug.", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Couple of questions. I guess that the first one, one-off items in the quarter, could you just kind of quantify what the total impact was of LIFO effects? And I think there was an issue in the Mid-Continent as well as relating to insurance. Mike if you could take on them?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. Yes we did have a small LIFO detriment due to some reduced inventories. So that was worth only about $20 million in our operating income. But we did have also an advance payment that we received in regard to the McKee insurance claim. That was worth about $44 million.", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "They are both pre-tax numbers Mike?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Those are pre-tax numbers. So, when you add those two together you are talking about $0.09 per share.", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Okay. So, pretty small I guess.", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Pretty small.", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Okay. The second thing is what you... you mentioned about the West Coast. You said yourself that you guys have been cutting runs. I think Desoto came and said the same thing. Do you see any evidence that maybe others that haven't made that kind of disclosure are also cutting runs to tighten up their markets?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We wouldn't know what the other people are doing.", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Okay. I guess that the final one then is you mentioned in your release about inventory management and what you expect to hop in, in terms of winter gasoline and so on. I think there has been some speculation that summer-grade gasoline is building pretty heavily. Can you just give your commentary on how you are dealing with that situation whether you are doing anything different this year than for example you did last year particularly related to blending components like alkylates and so on?", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Joe Gorder is going to answer you.", "Joe Gorder - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Supply", "Yes, I mean, Doug we are not doing anything different. I mean, we are continually focused on inventory management throughout the year, particularly both at this point in time as we get ready for the transition. But we are not doing anything different.", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Okay. That's great. That's it from me. Thanks very much.", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Doug.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson of Morgan Stanley.", "Douglas Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Congratulations on your results guys.", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Doug.", "Douglas Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Mike mentioned a reduction in capital expenditures to $4.5 billion. And so for clarification, is that an all inclusive of number? That is, does it include turnarounds and catalysts? And second, why did that projection decline? That is, was it related to efficiencies in the capital program delays or what have you? So if you could just elaborate on that, that would be helpful?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. I'll make some comments on it. Doug, this is Richard Marcogliese.", "Douglas Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Hi Rick.", "Rich Marcogliese - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "One that is an all end number on our capital outlook. And then I would say we're just seeing a general situation that as we identify projects we put together implementation timelines. And at times we find that the actual implementation, including engineering deliverables and equipment procurement is a little slower than we anticipated. But there isn't anything consciously being done to slow the expenditures. It's just the actual play out of how the projects are being developed.", "Douglas Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Okay.", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I would also add Doug last year we told you many times our capital budget was $3.5 billion. And we spent $2.8 billion. So beyond the reasons that Rich just gave you, we are very careful on how we are spending our money. And we go through the economics of our discretionary capital.", "Douglas Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Good point. And second Valero was one of the first companies to implement initiatives to enhance returns, and you can call it your key initiatives plan. The billion dollar income improvement plan that you have talked about. And so my question regards this plan and specifically progress that was made in 2007 and in the four areas that is gross margin capture energy efficiency, mechanical availability non-energy operating costs. And if you don't have the numbers nearby or where you thought you would be at this time, and have there been surprises? Then if so where?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. I can make some general comments on that. And as a background comment we had always said that of that billion dollar program it was not ratable in terms of 20% every year for the next five years. That it was going to be more back end loaded because it does relate to certain major retrofits that we have got to do to certain of our refineries. But what I would say is we did not make significant progress in 2007.", "Douglas Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Okay.", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I can point to the energy area we are through operational improvements and energy efficiency. We have got to gain of about $50 million on an annual basis, as part of the $1 billion effort. But we did not make the anticipated improvements in operational reliability. And so we can report some positive progress on energy but not in the other areas.", "Douglas Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Great, thanks a lot guys.", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you Doug.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chi Chow of Tristone Capital.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "Good morning and thanks.", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hello Chi.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "Hey Mike you mentioned the insurance payment in the mid-con. Was that a one-time event or are there more payments coming?", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well that... we are still in the process of adjusting the client. That was just an advance payment. So the total claim was again disclosed is larger obviously larger than the $44 million advance payment.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "So we will see more coming down the road. Is there any timing on when that might close your --", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I do not know. I don't have a good feel for on the timing. Some time probably in the first half of the year.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "Okay. And this is flowing through gross margin. Is that correct?", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "And why is that, it seems like that's a out of period extraordinary type items?", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Just the adjustment that we wrote through our cost of sales with BI adjustment.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "And then Bill you mentioned the situation on California. Can you give us your best explanation on what exactly has happened with buy demand fundamentals out there in the early part of January?", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well I can give you a couple of comments. But if you look at last year in the first half of the year, imports were very high into the West Coast and California's 65% - 70% on the West Coast. So imports were very high. As you got into the second half imports were really just about in line with previous years. Then they had very high price in California. And so we have actually seen a decline in gasoline demand in California. Now whether that's attributable totally to the high price or because of some of the housing issues where people don't drive the house... to build houses. We also understand that some of the light rail usage has increased where it's about. But we believe and also the Prius has made some impact in California. So when we added all we actually believed there was a decline in demand in California last year.", "Now you get to the first quarter... first couple of weeks of January and prices are still in the $3 range. People habits have changed some and of course refineries were operating pretty darn well. And remember in California there is a dramatic shift here in vapor pressure rigs as we go into February in Southern California and March in Northern California. So there is a lot of supply that is in the market in January.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "Did you see any increase in supply getting back up in the California from Kinder Morgan expanding the east line? I don't know.", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, we haven't seen that yet.", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "But I would not... I would say to you, yes as movements increased in Arizona, at least in there would be... there is always some balance in here but we are dealing with very small numbers too. But over time more supply is coming from the East and Arizona.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "Okay great. Thanks for your comments.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Dietert of Simmons & Company.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "Hey, it's Jeff Dietert. I want a follow up on Chi's question just on California. It appears that there is a big difference between winter grade... low vapor pressure margins in summer grade higher... excuse me I said that wrong. There is a big difference between winter-grade gasoline cracks and summer grade gasoline cracks. There is a lot of content going in the forward curve. It would seem to provide an incentive to produce summer-grade gasoline early and avoid winter-grade gasoline. Is that something you have already started or when do you plan to start?", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well the answer would be sure there is an incentive which you have to be able to hold it. And if you are looking at the stocks today and had five gasoline inventories that are 35 million barrels which is as high as we have seen. It's 3.9 million barrels over the last year. And I guess this is last week's data. And so it's just the ability to hold the gasoline. But yes, we would... if we have a spot, we would hold low vapor pressure, higher octane blending components. You are exactly right Jeff.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "Shifting to some of your major growth projects, could you give us an update on timing and cost estimates any changes to the Port Arthur, St. Charles and Quebec projects? I think St. Charles is the only one that's Board approved and what do you think for Board approval on Port Arthur and Quebec?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure, Jeff I will give you some specifics on it. You know as you've observed our St. Charles project was approved at $1.4 billion. We haven't identified any change in the cost outlook associated with that. That project by the way would be targeted for completion some time in 2010. We are in the final stages of development of our proposal on the Port Arthur project that will include a identical gas oil hydrocracker to the one that we have approved for St. Charles. It will also include a grassroots delayed coker which will be a clone of the project that we built in Texas city in 2003. That project is going to be in the vicinity of $2 billion. We are hopeful that we can develop that for Board review some time before the end of the first quarter, and that project would be set for 2011 implementation.", "For the Quebec refinery, we are looking at a combination of a dias [ph] faulting unit and gas oil hydrocracker for that refinery. It is much earlier in developmental phase that project to current cost assessment is below $2 billion. But I don't have a good number that I would feel comfortable when divulging at this point because we are still in the process of finalizing our cost estimates. That would be a project that if we continue to develop it at the pace that we are on it would be more of a 2012 type delivery in the field.", "Lastly, I want to mention that we are looking at a major project to make a significant move into aromatics production, benzene, toluene and xylene including going all the way into paraxylene production. This is a project that we are looking at for our St. Charles refinery. It would also be part of our strategy to comply with the so called MSAT regulations on benzene. This is the mobile source air toxics which would be an investment that we are targeting for 2011. So, those are comments I would make by way of an update.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "Very good, thanks for your comments.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Vetter of J.P. Morgan.", "Daniel Vetter - J.P. Morgan", "Good morning.", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Daniel Vetter - J.P. Morgan", "Yes I was hoping if you could comment on the implementation of the renewal fuel standard. Do you anticipate meeting the targets set forth by that standard? And how is Valero and its progress in making sure that it blends the required amounts of ethanol that fall under your... that you are responsible for?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Daniel we are very comfortable with 2007. As we look forward to 2008, I mean bottom line is we like to blend ethanol into the fuel wherever it's economic to do that. And the real issue becomes where is it viable to do that. As you know there is significant logistical constraint not only on the moving of ethanol in the markets but in converting terminals to be able to blend the ethanol. And so we are very focused on our obligation, and we want to do it where we can and we are doing everything we can try to make that happen.", "Daniel Vetter - J.P. Morgan", "Right, thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of Lehman Brothers.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Hey good morning gentlemen.", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Paul.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Mike I think this is for you. We talked about say the two one-off items or three, on inventory gain in the Canadian tax and also the insurance. Is there any meaningful trading profit, whether it's from hedging or from just purely trading during the quarter?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No there is no meaningful number there.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "There is no meaningful number okay. On the, Bill what I think that's maybe several months or maybe two or three months ago you were talking about how you are breaking down the company asset into core and non-core refining asset. There are about 10 of them just in the core. How should we look at the non-core? Does that suggest that all the non-core may ultimately may not have a pace in the company or should we look at it somewhat differently? I mean how should we view that?", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well we have on looking today for strategic alternatives for Aruba, Krotz Springs and Memphis and we are working those actively. Gene Edwards is doing that. And for the other plants such as Houston, Three Rivers, they are not necessarily core but they are integrated with our operations. For instance Houston is integrated with Texas city even though they are about 45-50 miles of arcs. We have pipelines connecting them. The same is true for Three Rivers. While I was getting at in those comments is as we go forward, any discretionary capital would be spent at the core plant in this case, Corpus Christi or Texas city. Delaware City is a key refinery for us, and we're trying very hard to improve it. The assets there have lots and lots of potential and the people are doing a good job. However, the Paulsboro refinery, we're trying to decide what the long term future is.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Okay and all those decisions will come after you finish with what you are going to do with Aruba and Memphis and Krotz Springs or that you could go concurrently?", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "No I think this is a process that we are going through as we continue to plan our business. As Rich mentioned it's entry into the aromatics business. And so the organization is only capable of doing so many things. And so we would tend to move forward with the three that I have mentioned while we are trying to figure out what our true options are on the other plants.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Bill is there any update about Aruba?", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "You mean as far as where we are?", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Yes.", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "On the fire we had?", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "No no, not the fire but in terms of the potential sales?", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well it's looking a strategic alternatives. Gene?", "Gene Edwards - Executive Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategic Planning", "Yes I can tell the work in process, we'd have to work through the issue we had last week of the fire. But we are continuing to look for opportunities there. We don't [indiscernible].", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Gene, have you guys opened the data room and invite people in already or that is still in the process?", "Gene Edwards - Executive Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategic Planning", "We have not opened the data room yet.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "You haven't opened the data room yet, any date being set?", "Gene Edwards - Executive Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategic Planning", "No.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And final one maybe this is for Gene actually maybe not. For ethanol blending I think there is a question asked before. Bill currently that... what is the percent of your gasoline blended with ethanol already? And that are you meeting because I think with the new RFS into 9 billion gallon a year gets refined, I believe that you get a quota. I don't know is that... how that works. And if you test where are you in that? Are you 90% comprised or 70% or what's that number maybe?", "Gene Edwards - Executive Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategic Planning", "Paul listen we are... as I mentioned we are in good shape in 2007. We are blending 25,000 to 30,000 barrels a day. You accommodate your obligation through probably a combination of the barrels that you are actually able to blend yourself and then the credits which you can buy in the open market. And as the market for these RIN credits is they're called it is now becoming more active. And so here again we have got a plan to try to accommodate our obligations in 2007... in 2008, and we are going to try to do it to the extent possible with blended barrels.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Can you share with us that what is your quota for 2008 on your obligation?", "Gene Edwards - Executive Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategic Planning", "While we... would you mind if we calculate that. We'll let Ash and Eric get back with you on that.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Definitely, thank you. Thank you guys.", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Paul.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.", "Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. Just a follow up regarding the strategic reviews of the various refineries. I realize you are considering a host of options but one of them would obviously be to sell the refineries. And just given the general concern that's out there about whether in recession or not and given some of the credit problems faced by many of the banks and other sources of financing, can you characterize how you think the level of interest is out there to get what would for you be adequate sales prices on any assets? Obviously the government and no one else is forcing you to see these assets but presumably you don't have to sell under what would be an inadequate price. But most of the most logical buyers do seem to be smaller companies that would require some measure of external financing that may not be as easy to come by as it would have been 6 months ago.", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I would characterize the level interest as being fairly high. There is a lot of interest from operating companies and financial players still as well.", "Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs", "So you still see that as a very viable option?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs", "That's great. You alluded to the stock buyback where you bought a couple of million shares in January. Your below your debt to cap target, is meaningful additional stock buyback dependent on receiving proceeds from any refineries sales? Or are you willing to kind of get up to or close to your debt to cap target absent actually selling refineries through stock buyback?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Arjunright now, we still have 1.1 billion of capacity on the Board approved authorization of 6 billion, and we intend to go ahead and use that up here in the near term. We also have our anti-dilution program, which will get us closer to the 25% target.", "Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs", "And then you evaluate things at that point in terms of what you may want to do subsequently?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Absolutely.", "Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs", "That's great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Neil McMahon of Sanford Bernstein.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford Bernstein", "Hi Just a few questions, the first is really looking at what you think the planned downtime for the industry in your main operating areas. Looks like over the coming months it's all seemed to have been a bit delayed in terms of planned downtime versus last year. And are you seeing as still issues in the labor market in terms of constraining the timing of the downtime from construction personnel? Then I have got a follow-up as well.", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Neil I will make a couple of comments about that. I mean we can only really speak to our own turnaround schedule and 2008 will be kind of a low work load period for us considering the next few years. We actually... significantly increased turnaround activity in 2009 and in 2010 where we have a couple of plant wide turnarounds in major cat cracker retrofits plant. So, 2008 is an off cycle year for us but I really can't comment on the rest of the industry.", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "But I can. Using an industry consultants report the first quarter this would be planned. So, last year there was a lot of on plan too but if you look at plant it is higher in the first quarter of this year on crude and planned last year. It's lower in the second quarter than planned for last year and upgrading our conversion units versus plant for last year. The plant this year is actually higher both in the first and second quarter. And I have chosen an industry survey.", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Now you also asked about cost and productivity and I would tell you that we continue to see issues in turnaround execution particularly when you have got retrofit work plant as part of the turnarounds are... most recent example of that was that on the West Coast where we implemented an alky expansion project as part of a plant turnaround. And we did see a work quality and productivity issues in that turnaround. So, I think that is still with us, as an industry.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford Bernstein", "And are you still seeing the same cost inflation trends that you saw last year or are they starting to flatten often, in terms of unit price, pieces of work that you need to do, either in turnarounds or new construction activity?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I would say on the new construction side, we continue to be observing increases in our construction estimates for the projects that we are looking at. So, I would not say that the escalation trend in the industry hasn't paid it yet and I don't personally see any plateauing. From a turnaround execution point of view, I don't see a lot of labor rate direct pressure, it is more of the ability to do the work and get it completed.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford Bernstein", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Gilman of the Benchmark Company.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Hi guys, good morning. I had a couple of things. Rich that aromatics project you are talking about, is that a standard BTX type things plus paraxylene and us moving molecules from a gasoline pool into the petrochemical pool?", "Rich Marcogliese - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes, that's a good question Mark. I mean as we are looking at our mix of projects going forward what you are seeing from us is first an emphasis on diesel production over gasoline production. These hydrocrackers that we are building will be designed such that they maximize yield of ultra-low-sulfur distillate. But then also kind of looking at the gasoline that could come along with these projects rather than just stop at the gasoline level we are trying to maximize our uplift into petrochemicals. So, in this case, we will have a... we anticipate a rather large investment in a high severity reformer and then a BTX extraction complex but then taking it all away through to paraxylene.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Okay. Can you give me a rough idea for the fourth quarter, how much SOTE and how much MARS crude you ran?", "Joe Gorder - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Supply", "Well we ran about 250,000 barrels a day of SOTE crude and... let me go to MARS... we ran about 10 a day MARS.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Very thanks Joe. I've noticed that there is some pretty pronounced changes in the fourth quarter in both the feedstock lineup for the systems as a whole as well as the product yield. On the feedstock side the other feeds are up substantially as a percentage and on the product side the other products are up significantly. Can, one of you guys Rich, Joe, Bill talk about what that was all about whether it's something that's likely to remain in place going forward?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Rich I will start. I don't think it will remain in place going forward. And if you look it at the situation of fourth quarter, we had two operating issues, we had to work around. We ended up running VGOs in lot of cases, to fill conversion units. They were around crude. So that's why your other feedstocks were up. The other yields, I mean a lot of that I think if you look at the same reason essentially that if you had some operating issues, you increased your outlook of the other products. Rich.", "Rich Marcogliese - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes Mark I can add a little more color on the subject. You asked about the SOTE runs. So we did have a large crude unit down in Paulsboro. It's the LUG still in the Paulsboro refineries, so the SOTE runs were off as a consequence of that turnaround and it was about a three week turnaround large crude unit in the LUG block.", "Also it was a general period of increased turnaround activity in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter that was very prominent on the West Coast both in Wilmington where we had cat and alky outage and the Benicia where we had the fluid coker down for a plant turnaround. Then we had a number of unplanned events which impacts some of the mix of input. We had a power outrage on Aruba in October. We have had continuing issues with coke drums in Port Arthur and then we also had a power disruption that affected our Texas City refinery in December. A lot of these impacts did reflect themselves in the amount of heavy crude that we run directly and you compensate that for that with more purchases of intermediates.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "So all of the things being equal this was a pretty anomalous set of numbers both on the yield and the feedstock side.", "Rich Marcogliese - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "I would say so.", "Joe Gorder - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Supply", "Yes I don't think you are seeing a fundamental shift here.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "One more if I could. What percentage of ULSD as a percentage of your total distilate pool?", "Joe Gorder - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Supply", "98 and we are almost completely there Mark.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Do you expect a shrinkage in ULSD premiums versus to oil to remain or is this something that in your mind has a seasonal element to it?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well I mean the differentials were wider in the beginning and we had always anticipated as we got further into the program and commission new facilities that we would see some shrinkage in those differentials. And we have most recently we commissioned the brand new distillate hydrotreater in Corpus Christi in December and most of our production is at the ULSD level.", "Gene Edwards - Executive Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategic Planning", "I think you will see something now... when you hot sulphur and you roll out to [ph] favor in the summer time you probably will see a lot of this jump during the weather. I don't think that you are... that's all we are going to see $0.20 like we had last year level.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Okay guys, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Flannery of Credit Suisse.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Hi good morning. I've got a question on CapEx and I know last year you indicated that we should be expecting multiple years of about $0.5 billion-nish of CapEx. From what you've mentioned today with some of these bigger projects I assume that's what we should still be expecting let's say beyond 2008.", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Beyond 2008 I think you should anticipate will be between $5 billion and $6 billion for 09. 09 is a high turnaround year for us too. So we are only four weeks into 2008 but since guidance year, we'll be between $5 billion and $6 billion.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Great and just switching back to the fourth quarter results and parts of this question have already been asked. But the market is obviously surprised today by how much you beat benchmark margins by and some of this is to do with the runs that you are managing on the inputs. But can you talk us through a little bit let's say where the market may have been underestimating your ability to outperform the benchmark?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I think our margin realization dipped [ph] asset towards the end of the quarter as the lower average crude prices in the last half of the December relative to the last half of November. So this did result in lower cost of sales improving our margin realization.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "So would you say you are more aggressively managing your crude inputs rate today than there would have been a year ago?", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Gorder,better not say yes to that.", "Joe Gorder - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Supply", "Mark the answer is no, absolutely no.", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We manage that aggressively everyday.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Right and do you I mean... do you think you got more opportunity in 08 than today you would have had in 07 to bring that down into margin or is the outlook roughly the same?", "Rich Marcogliese - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "I will say the biggest opportunity we have is just to run the throughput we are capable of, I mean it's just running the barrels.", "Joe Gorder - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Supply", "Yes, I agree with Rich.", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't know if you noticed but we are going to take the coker... the coker at Port Arthur is a three module six drum coker. We are going to take each module offline for about 25 days and do a complete repair on the drums from the inside out. And that's going to cut our throughput at that refinery by 100,000 barrels a day. And so I didn't get the right number here. And so what Rich just told is we have had trouble at some of our place, and if we could run these plants our reliability of our profits would even be a lot better. Because where we get is most of the time is on the very heavy sour in.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Do you have any targets that you would like to share with us sort of liability improvements or...", "Joe Gorder - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Supply", "Well reliability improvement is really rolled up in to this $1 billion improvement efforts, so it's a big component of that gap closure.", "Bill Klesse - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well I can honestly tell we fix these as we had these issues like this example of Port Arthur. We are going to fix it correctly, and we screwed around with it long enough and our team has elected to do this where we will have it repaired and now carry us then to the turnaround in 09 when we actually replace the drums. But this is an engineering design on these coke drums. It just doesn't hold up to the cycles.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Great. Okay thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ann Kohler of Caris.", "Ann Kohler - Caris & Company", "Good morning gentlemen. I am not sure whether you covered this in your earlier remarks. But could you kind of give a little bit of detail? I know you spoke about the demand in California, but what you are seeing in the rest of your retail system, sort of a same store basis for gasoline volumes, quarter, fourth quarter to fourth quarter and what you are seeing so far in the first.", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay in the U.S. resale, this is on a per store per day basis, our fuel sales were down about 5% in the fourth quarter of 07 versus fourth quarter of 06. On a total year basis, it was pretty flat comparing 07 versus '06. And then in January we were slightly down from the fourth quarter levels, but that's fairly typical to this time of year where the demand is little bit slower.", "Ann Kohler - Caris & Company", "And what you attribute to the 5% same store drop in fourth quarter to?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well I think a lot of it has to due to the increasing gasoline prices that happen here towards the end of the year and just the concerns about the economy and whether or not we are actually getting into recession or not.", "Ann Kohler - Caris & Company", "Okay great. Thank you. I appreciate that.", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from comes from the line Mark Gilman of Benchmark & Company.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Hey Mike, what region was the LIFO of benefit taken in?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It would have been across all of our regions, east of the Rockies.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "And it looks to me like there was a major working capital liquidation or drawdown in the fourth quarter. Is that accurate and do you expect it to be reversed in the first?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You're right. We did have a little inventory slowdown which resulted in about $450 million source of funds in the fourth quarter. Going forward, we will continue to monitor our inventory levels, and I don't anticipate it being reversed in a major way in the first quarter.", "Rich Marcogliese - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "No Mark, we got into levels that we are comfortable operating in at the end of the year. And it's the combination of the high cost and leads to the working capital obligation and the market structure was backward and it didn't pay to carry. So we have managed this as aggressively as we could.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Okay guys. Thank you.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time.", "Ashley Smith - Director of Investor Relations", "Okay. We will conclude the call now.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Valero Energy Corporation's First Quarter Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].", "Thank you. Mr. Smith, you may begin your conference.", "Ashley Smith - Director of Investor Relations", "Thank you, Rebecca. Good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's first quarter 2008 earnings conference call. With me today are Bill Klesse our Chairman and CEO; Mike Ciskowski, our CFO and other members of our executive management team.", "If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact Investor Relations after the call.", "Before we get started, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that states the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under Federal Securities Laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.", "Now I will turn the call over to Mike.", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Ashley and thank you for joining us today. As noted in the release, our first quarter 2008 earnings came in at $0.48 per share. The earnings include a benefit of $0.12 per share arising from the business interruption insurance recovery related to the fire at the McKee refinery in the first quarter of 2007.", "$101 million pre-tax benefit from the insurance recovery is reflected in the Mid-Continent throughput margins for the first quarter of 2008. This incident has been settled and there will be no further recovery. First quarter 2008 operating income was $472 million or $371 million excluding the previously mentioned insurance recovery. This compares to $1.7 billion reported in the same period of last year.", "The decrease in operating income was obviously due to the lower throughput margin per barrel of $8.48, which was down $3.67 per barrel versus the first quarter of 2007. The key driver of the decline was lower margins for gasoline and our other products such as asphalt, fuel oils, petroleum coke and petrochemical feedstock. These margins compressed in the first quarter as the prices for those products did not increase proportionately with the increase in crude costs.", "When comparing the first quarter of 2008 to 2007, the average margins for many of these secondary products declined between $10 and $40 per barrel, which had a negative price impact on throughput margins of around $700 million on a pre-tax basis.", "However, our throughput margins have benefited from strong margins on diesel and jet fuel and from wide differentials for the heavy and sour feedstock that we are able to run. First quarter 2008 operating income was also affected by $180 million increase in refinery operating expenses from the first quarter of 2007. This was mainly due to higher energy costs from the increase in the cost of natural gas and higher maintenance expenses including those related to the repairs to the coke drums at our Port Author refinery and the vacuum tower at our Aruba refinery.", "First quarter operating income was also affected by lower throughput volumes that averaged around 2.6 million barrels per day or 138,000 barrels per day lower than the first quarter of 2007 and nearly 200,000 barrels per day below the prior quarter. The reduction was mostly because of the previously mentioned maintenance activity.", "General and administrative expenses excluding corporate depreciation were $135 million. The $29 million decrease from the fourth quarter was mainly due to a decrease in incentive-based compensation expense. For the first quarter, total depreciation and amortization expense was $367 million. Net interest expense was $97 million and our effective tax rate on continuing operations was 34% in line with guidance from the prior quarter.", "Regarding cash flows for the quarter, capital spending was approximately $640 million, which includes $103 million of turnaround expenditures. In the first quarter, we continued our stock buyback program by spending $518 million to purchase 8.8 million shares of our common stock and we currently have approximately 3.8 billion of repurchased authorization in addition to our ongoing anti-dilution program.", "With respect to our balance sheet, at the end of March, our total debt was $6.5 billion. During the quarter, we used approximately $375 million to pay down debt. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.4 billion and a debt-to-capitalization ratio net of cash of 21.7%.", "As to second quarter operations, the following guidance assumes that no divestitures close in the second quarter. So for modeling purposes, you should expect Gulf Coast refinery throughput of approximately 1.45 million to 1.5 million barrels per day. Gulf Coast throughputs will be affected by maintenance, especially at our Port Arthur refinery where we are completing the work on coke drums and at the Aruba refinery as we are completing repairs to the vacuum tower. We expect both of these repair projects to be completed in mid-May.", "Mid-Continent throughput should be about 430,000 barrels per day. West Coast throughput should average between 275,000 and 285,000 barrels per day and the Northeast system should average in the range of 530,000 to 540,000 barrels per day.", "On operating expenses, due to the higher expected energy costs and completing the repairs at Port Arthur and Aruba refinery cash operating expenses, are expected to be about $4.70 per barrel.", "With respect to some of the other items for the second quarter, we anticipate G&A expense to be around $150 million, net interest expense should be around $80 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be around $370 million and for the second quarter, you should be using a 34% tax rate for modeling purposes.", "And finally, we are updating our guidance for our 2008 capital spending including turnarounds, which we now estimate should be around $4.2 billion versus our prior guidance of $4.5 billion. The decrease is mainly due to updates on the timing of some of our major projects.", "Now I will turn it over to Bill.", "Bill Klesse - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Thank you, Mike. Good morning. As Mike said, we entered the first quarter in great financial position, even after taking into consideration the challenging margins for gasoline and other products, plus the operating issues we experienced.", "Looking at gasoline, fundamentals have been improving as inventories have declined over the last six weeks and gasoline demand has been good. Accordingly, the average April Gulf Coast gasoline products has more than double versus March going [ph] from around $3 to $6.50 per barrel. We still expect a good summer driving season. We also continue to see strong on-road diesel cracks which have averaged close to $30 per barrel in April because of strong global demand. We believe that diesel cracks will stay excellent for the foreseeable future, given the difficulty in meeting tighter sulfur specs worldwide and strong demand worldwide.", "On the feedstock side, we continue to realize wide differentials from medium and heavy sour crude oil and other feedstock. And we expect these discounts to remain wide for the rest of year. Recently, Maya crude oil has priced around $23 below WTI and Mars crude oil has priced nearly $10 below WTI. These differentials have increased in part due to strong demand for light sweet crude oil, because of their higher plain product yields especially diesel.", "As mentioned previously that we are working closely with the potential buyer for our Aruba refinery. And we expect to complete the process in the second quarter after the repairs vacuum tower are complete. For our Memphis and Clark Springs refineries, we are currently negotiating with selective bidders. We have been very pleased by the higher level of interest these assets have generated. We have also initiated the progress to review strategic alternatives for our Ardmore refinery and we expect to conclude that process this year as well.", "In closing, I'd be the first to admit that the gasoline season hasn't been impressive. The current refined product prices are difficult for our consumers. But diesel [ph] margins are excellent. As to our performance, the issues have been isolated to basically 3 of our 17 refineries.", "Our financial results have also been negatively impacted by very poor margins for other products, which are about 20% of our refined product yields. With time, I think there will be an adjustment to the pricing of these other products.", "Concerning reliability, the Port Arthur coke drum repair we have undertaken should work. But ultimately the drums will be replaced in the first or fourth quarter of 2009 or at best, or in a best case the first quarter of 2010. The new drums should be at our side by year end.", "We realized it is hard to stay but we are improving our plans and the resultant reliability. With proceeds from the potential asset sales and from our operations, we will continue to take a balanced approach to allocating cash among gross investments at and around our coal refineries, stock buyback, dividend increases and high coupon gas repayments.", "Valero continues to be the best value in our industry because our balance sheet is strong, because we have the most geographic diversification, the most processing complexity and a highest growth margin potential and lots of self help opportunities.", "We'll now open the call up for questions.", "Ashley Smith - Director of Investor Relations", "Rebecca we are ready for Q&A.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Mark Flannery with Credit Suisse. Sir you have the floor.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. If you... I would like to talk about CapEx and if you run like a generic 321 NYMEX crack for the rest of the year, that's sort of around 11-ish right now and just assume nothing changes, do you think the... this year's $4.2 billion and next year's $5 billion worth of CapEx is appropriate or would you look to make some adjustments to that?", "Bill Klesse - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "We think it's appropriate because obviously we have some asset sales underway.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Right. So basically in the absence of asset sales you wouldn't necessarily feel so confident about that number. Is that right?", "Bill Klesse - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Well we also have a very strong balance sheet since we haven't run that case, but these projects that we are undertaking are very good for the long term and we have a lot of shareholder value.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Okay great. That's it. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Cheng with Lehman Brothers. Sir you have the floor.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Hi, good morning. Asset sale you're saying that the proceed is going to be allocated accordingly. Should we assume that the bulk of the asset sales is going for the share buyback and what if there is a shortfall in funding for your CapEx that you will use the debt to fill the gap or that not really a reasonable assumption?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I think what you are asking Paul is we will have cash flow from operations. We have the asset sales that we are working and making good progress on and will generate excess cash. I have told everyone that we intend to take out another $250 million, almost $300 million of high coupon debt this year. So we will do that. We already bought 8.8 million shares of stock. We've also disclosed that we have a plan to buy more of our shares, but you'll see us maintain a balanced approach. We'll also hold some additional liquidity because of the current market situation we see. So I think you just should soon that you are going to get what you've been getting from us.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "I see okay. Mike a point of sales of Aruba and let's assume that they close sometimes this quarter. What will be the effective tax rate going forward may look like. You said about backup into the 38% to 40%?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, I think the last numbers I saw would be about 36% if we sell Aruba.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Okay and I have to apologize that earlier that you were talking about the throughput in Mid-Continent what's the number again?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, our Mid-Continent is going to be about 430,000 barrels a day.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "And that two final questions short one; on the Mid-Con I don't know whether you guys on co-purchase are you using the P+1 method and if you do, is there any significant loss in the quarter and also that you are in this quarter you are seeing any meaningful inventory gain or loss trading or hedging gain or loss?", "Bill Klesse - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "I guess what you are asking are we using a posted price purchasing in the Mid-Continent?", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "That's correct, yes sir.", "Bill Klesse - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "No we still do our purchasing and hedging in the Mid-Continent and I'll just anticipate the question that we get for Mark, it cost us about $15 million in the quarter.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "15.", "Bill Klesse - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Becauseof the hedge but we don't do P plus purchasing, we do on. We just buy a lot of crude on market and go and exchange.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Correct. And Bill you are saying 15 or 50? I am sorry.", "Bill Klesse - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "15", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "15, okay.", "Bill Klesse - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Right and then, on the hedging there is nothing meaningful.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "And there is nothing meaningful on the inventory I'd presume?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Nothing on inventory.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Roger Read with Natixis Bleichroeder. You have the floor sir.", "Roger Read - Natexis Bleichroeder", "Good morning. Natexis Bleichroeder but I understand the difficulties. Regards to the 20% of the refine product yield that you said lower value product, with a much lower yield. Is there anything you are viewing internally to adjust to that or anything you can't do internally, should we consider that the sale or potential sales of refineries that you've highlighted will help that process or is it simply a factor of how the market needs to work its way out here?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Think of it's a general statement. The market has to work its way out. The products we are talking about are asphalt, petroleum, coke, lubricant, propylene, propane, fuel oil, resins. And if you think about petroleum coke, if we sell Aruba as planned obviously we are going to make less petroleum coke. But as a general statement these products either have not kept up with the rise in crude oil price or in the case of propane, propylene those types are compete against in a way natural gas and of course. So you wind up a little different competitive things here.", "Roger Read - Natexis Bleichroeder", "Okay, so that means nothing... basically it is what it is and we are going to have to just roll through all that nothing bottom of the yield is bottom of the yield, I guess", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, I think I mean obviously we try to minimize problems right.", "Roger Read - Natexis Bleichroeder", "Sure.", "Bill Klesse - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "So, Roger I tell you eventually its going to work its way through the system and also depends on crude oil price we have been extremely rapid rise in crude oil prices here since the beginning of the year.", "Roger Read - Natexis Bleichroeder", "Sure. One final question just on the demand side, if I look at your retail fuel volume sales year-over-year relative to the number of stationed opened, fairly flat yet we look at the fiscal numbers from the government or some of the other services that indicate down, could you kind of walk us through may be what's different between your retail, what you are seeing in your retail and what we are seeing in sort of the national numbers?", "Bill Klesse - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Well year-to-date and our retail same store this should be company operated retail, down about eight-tens of 1% so 1% but its part of it is where we are located. Obviously when a lot of our stores are in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and the company outside of this and I would assume, the economy is still a little better in those markets. So we haven't seen some of the numbers that you have heard, however nationally some of the statistics only show the gasoline is down. Just around 1% but remains to be seen.", "Roger Read - Natexis Bleichroeder", "Right, what I was trying to make a little bit of an adjustment for the number of stations, not just the flat number of it", "Unidentified Company Representative", "I gave you the same store per station I gave you as a volume per same store it's down eight tenths of percent and the store counts only three different 953 versus 950 this year.", "Roger Read - Natexis Bleichroeder", "I'm sorry, I did not have 963 as a number there, and I'm looking at the statement not the model as it was last year?", "Bill Klesse - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Well it is 950 this year", "Roger Read - Natexis Bleichroeder", "Yeah 950 down from 963 in the press release", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Okay 963 then.", "Roger Read - Natexis Bleichroeder", "Okay thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chi Chow with Tristone Capital. You have the floor sir.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "Good morning, given the wide disparity between the gasoline and diesel crash right now, how are you optimizing your production of each products as well as crude runs?", "Rich Marcogliese - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes Chi, I'll answer that. We have been tracking this situation for a number of months. We constantly update planning models and basically on a fractionation basis, we are trying to recover as much distillate blowing range of production as we possibly can. Our Cantrell [ph] program, will be put in hydro treating capacity over the last couple of years of... positions us pretty well to do that and process the additional recovery. In addition we are now looking for feedstock we can purchase of higher sulfur just a little materials what we can run through some of our.", "Beyond that we have got a number of longer range depths on the outlook top this high diesel crack environment will continue which involves things like changing catalyst formulations there on a making physical hardware improvements somewhat so", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "Are those chances longer term and is that something we are going to see potentially this year?", "Rich Marcogliese - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Well is sort of a combination of the distillation changes you can do right away. You can change head cracking severity which we have done right away, is a risk or other immediate term or longer term you can change catalyst formulation and cat cracker you can see that in the next six months if you have to make physical revisions to units that's probably more of a two year out tons a year. You know what I will say you know in terms of volume metrics in this general area, there is probably from where we were last year some 200,000 barrels a day of recoverable distiller which we could move out of the gasoline pool and we are trying to capture every bit of that.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "Thanks Rich. Are you still cutting back on FCC runs at this point.", "Rich Marcogliese - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes we still are cut back in a couple of locations and we really take a look at the marginal value of gasoline versus the marginal cost of acquiring low sulfur cavity. As a result of running lower throughput or cat cracker for the St. Charles refinery. We also took the controllable shutdown of our small cat cracker in the east plant with Corpus Christi which is a 20,000 barrel a day cat cracker.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "Thanks, can you give us some general comments on kind of the state of the diesel market now. Obviously the crack are extremely high but how much of this is supported by the export market versus what's going on with demand here domestically?", "Rich Marcogliese - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Well I think the export market is keeping diesel prices very high not only in the Europe, Latin America or strike at and other important require more diesel deals reported in the UK. So I think that's the big driver for barrels in the US and even the especially low sulfur barrels are very high for now.", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Chi we've said it before we've been pretty active in that export market also and it is still very strong.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "How are you seeing demand here domestically, it seems like things are slowing down, you see some data points on EPS and on the railcars being parked up in Montana. Are you seeing weakness here domestically though?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, we are seeing weakness in the U.S. markets but I think it is more than offset by the export market though.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "Okay, thanks to you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Anne Kohler with Caris. You have the floor ma'am.", "Anne Kohler - Caris", "Morning. I just wanted to point of clarification when are you are in New York last month, you... if I recall correctly, you indicated that you wanted to receive certain valuation for the assets that you had up for sales specifically at this point Memphis and Clark Springs and that you are unable to achieve that price you would reconsider on selling those assets, is that correct?", "Bill Klesse - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "That's correct.", "Anne Kohler - Caris", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "[Operators instructions]. Your next question comes from Mark Gilman with Benchmark. Sir you have the floor.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark", "Good morning guys, Bill I just want to express my sincere appreciation for asking and answering my primary questions but I do have others.", "Bill Klesse - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Thank you.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark", "Give us an update where your mindset is on Paulsboro noting that Ardmore has now been added to the list regarding strategic alternatives?", "Bill Klesse - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "We are still taking a good look at that and no decision has been made.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark", "Okay, could I ask you why is that it just seems in discussions like this that Three Rivers is consider a keeper?", "Bill Klesse - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Because we make benzene at Three Rivers where it does gives exposure to the petrochemical business and it also tied indirectly with our Corpus Christi complex. We have a piece of pipe we optimize between the two. We support our marketing in the San Antonio out of that facility. So if you look at the pipeline networking those owned by new star, it flows from Corpus through there as well as Rio Grande Valley to Laredo and into San Antonio. So we look at as an integrated business the same is true for Houston. We look at Houston the same way tied to such facility and we just made a completed last year the very large mild hydro cracker in Houston where we shipped products from Texas City up to the Houston market hydro treating. So we try to operate those two examples as a combined facility even though they are separated by some models.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark", "Okay, Bill, if I could one more, give us... given pricing relationships have changed a fair amount over the course of the first quarter what if any capital you are achieving regarding the ethanol gasoline spread?", "Joe Gorder - Executive Vice President Marketing and Supply", "Well, yeah I mean will, except we can't markedly out this... we've blended this market we can and that is except we can blend conventional we are doing that also with our system on the way we market, selling into this spot market its bit tough to capture that.", "Bill Klesse - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Again am sure exactly what you are asking, against its economic blend any price that we are or have accessed the facility to blend we are blending. So if that's what you are asking we are doing now there is a lot of our places either in San Antonio we can't use this because we are in 7.8 pound here but in a lot of markets current if the infrastructure there but clearly economic there are favorite volumes.", "Joe Gorder - Executive Vice President Marketing and Supply", "We are converting internal expenses now to do that all", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark", "Okay guys thanks very much, appreciate it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rohit Aggarwal with Miller Tabak [ph]. You have the floor sir.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Quick question just to follow up on the previous one. If the ethanol captures in your favor and you are getting value out of it, have you ever given thought to actually bringing one of those ethanol producers in house or are you comfortable having that logistic chain out of your operation system?", "Bill Klesse - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Well it's clearly a make versus buy and when you look at the supply chain or value chain right now all the economic rents being taken by the former and or the blender in the blender and we are capturing it where we can as we I said in the last question and I think you have to decide when do you think the rents is going to be taken by the ethanol producer and right now we don't see that at least for the foreseeable future.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Understood, just one follow-up if you may permit me. When you said make versus buy I am assuming there is some discount to be applied to making because it does take some timeframe to make an asset I guess?", "Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well I think it is the right out production costs and ethanol plants probably don't even cover the price point in our so we don't see any profit fee generator there and particularly we return on investments.", "Bill Klesse - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "I think... if you look at where all the money has been made is been made on the front end and that's why so many of the ethanol plants are struggling economically or financially. But is the make versus buy for us ... at least when we look at from the plant, to the hubs.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's Q&A session.

My name is Ashley and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Valero Energy fourth quarter 2008 conference call. All lines have been place on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star and the number one on your telephone key pad. If you would like to withdraw your question, press the pound key. Thank you.", "Mr. Smith, you may begin your conference.", "Ashley Smith - Executive Director of Investor Relation", "Thank you, Ashley. Good morning, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's fourth quarter 2008 earnings conference call. With me today are Bill Klesse our chairman and CEO, Mike Ciskowski our CFO, and other members of our executive management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like to receive a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. There are also tables attached to the earnings release that provide additional financial information on our business segment. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact investor relations after the call. ", "Before we get started, I would like to direct your attention to the forward looking statement and disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions under federal security laws. There are also many factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations including those we described in our filings with the SCC. ", "Now, I will turn the call over to Mike. ", "Mike Ciskowski - EVP and CFO", "Thanks, Ashley, and thank you for joining us today. As noted in the release, we reported fourth quarter 2008 net income of 732 million or $1.41 per share before the noncash goodwill impairment of 4 billion after taxes. Including the impairment loss, our GAAP result for the fourth quarter was a net loss of 3.3 billion or $6.36 per share. For the full year 2008 we reported net income of 2.9 billion or $5.42 per share excluding the goodwill impairment loss. Including the impairment loss, our GAAP result for 2008 was a net loss of 1.1 billion or $2.16 per share. ", "As to the noncash goodwill impairment loss, each year we perform our goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter. As you know, during the fourth quarter of 2008 there were severe destructions in the capital commodities markets that contributed to a significant decline in our stock price. As a result, Valero's equity market capitalization fell significantly below the network value of our equity. This is a key indicator that goodwill was potentially impaired. ", "In performing our goodwill impairment test each year, we estimate fair value by discounting the estimated future cash flows from our refineries. The market derived discount rates that we used in our analysis this year were very high because of the significant risk premium acquired by our relatively low stock price in the quarter, using higher discount rates results in a lower valuation. When we performed our goodwill impairment test as Christi by current accounting rules, our tests indicated that all of the goodwill was impaired. ", "Getting back to our results, fourth quarter 2008 operating income, excluding the goodwill impairment loss, was 1.2 billion versus 884 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher margins for diesel jet fuel and secondary products such as asphalt and petroleum coke as well as very good field margins in our retail segment. Also contributing to the increase in operating income was the favorable effect from the yearend LIFO increment 327 million or 214 million after taxes. ", "Some were offsetting the increase in operating income were lower gasoline margins, and lower overall refinery throughput volumes. Fourth quarter throughput volumes averaged 2.6 million barrels per day which was 173 thousand barrels lower than the fourth quarter of 2007. This was primarily due to the reduction in capacity from the sell of the Krontz Springs refinery and lower operating rates due to a lower margin environment for gasoline.", "Refinery cash operating expenses were $4.66 per barrel which was slightly higher than our guidance of $4.50 per barrel. This was mainly due to lower overall throughput values. General and administrative expenses excluding corporate appreciation were 138 million. The 31 million decrease from the third quarter and 22 million decrease from our guidance were mainly due to lower incentive based compensation expense. ", "For the fourth quarter total depreciation and amortization expense was 370 million, and interest expense net of capitalized interest was 79 million, both in line with our guidance. The effect of tax rate excluding the goodwill impairment charge was 35%. Regarding cash flows for the quarter, capital spending was 1.1 billion which includes 129 million of turnaround expenditures. For the year, capital expenditures were 3.2 billion which includes 408 billion for turnaround costs. ", "In the end of fourth quarter, we spend 181 million to purchase 8.4 million shares for our stock which takes our total spending for the year to 955 million for 23 million shares. So for the year, we reduced shares outstanding by 4% and since the end of 2005 by over 21%. We currently have approximately three and a half billion of repurchased authorizations in addition to our ongoing anti-dilution program.", "Regarding future uses of cash, our goal is to maintain financial strength. Considering the weak economic outlook, we decided to further reduce our estimates for 2009 capital expenditures and turnaround costs. We now estimate that capital will be 2.7 billion which is down 800 million from our most recent estimate. We made several changes to the capital plan to reduce the 2009 budget. ", "In addition to cutting many small to medium size discretionary projects at our refineries, we have delayed the St. Charles hydrocracker project, which pushes back the estimated completion date to the fourth quarter of 2012. Also at St. Charles, we have further reduced the scope of our aromatics project yet still plan to meet MSAT II compliance in 2011. Finally, we have delayed the Memphis [FCC] reliability project which pushes the estimated completion date to 2012. ", "With respect to our balance sheet at the end of December, our total debt was 6.5 billion. In addition to our yearend cash balance of 940 million we had nearly 5 billion of liquidity available at the end of the year. Even with the goodwill impairment loss, we are in good shape from a covenant perspective because our debt to capitalization ratio net of cash was 26.2% at year end. This was well below the bank agreement threshold of 6% and we have no coverage tied ratio covenant. ", "For turn debt, upcoming maturities are relatively low and consist of 209 million coming due in April of 2009 and only 33 million in 2010. Also in 2009, per terms of the indenture we are required in October to operative purchase a 100 million of our bonds. In summary, our company remains in solid financial shape. To maintain financial strength through a weak economy we will continue to look for ways to reduce spending on capital expenditures, operating costs, and overhead. However, we will presently continue to invest in opportunities that build long-term value for our shareholders.", "Now, I will turn it over to Ashley to cover the earnings model assumptions.", "Ashley Smith ", "Thanks, Mike. For modeling our first quarter operations, we should expect the following refinery throughput volumes. Gulf Coast should average between 1.2 to 1.25 million barrels per day. Mid-continent should average between 380 thousand to 390 thousand barrels per day. West Coast should average between 250,000 to 260,000 barrels per day. And Northeast should average in the range of 510,000 to 520,000 barrels per day. ", "Refinery cash operating expenses are expected to be about $4.80 per barrel, which is higher than the prior quarter primarily due to lower expected throughput volume. With respective towards the other items for the quarter, we anticipate G & A expense to be around 135 million. Net expense should be around 75 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be around 390 million. We estimate a 33% defective tax rate. ", "That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for questions. Feel free to gather the queue Ashley. ", "Question & Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  At this time, if you would like to ask a question please press star and the number one on your telephone key pad. Again, if you want to ask a question at this time please press star and the number one on your telephone key pad. We will pause for just a moment to compile the roster. ", "Our first question comes from Mark Flannery from Credit Suisse.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Hi, yes. With this reduced CapEx program that you have can you give us an idea of how close we are to the knuckle now?  In other words, could we go down further from here or are we getting close to the levels of must spend and a follow up about that?", "Rich Marcogliese ", "Sure, this is Rich Marcogliese, I expect to make a comment about that   Two points for the billion of the year, there is some room to go lower than that. We would say that our absolute minimum capital expenditure budget is in the neighborhood of $1.8 billion, which would capture things like turnaround expenditures which are on average about $500 million a year, and then other safety and regulatory requirements on a regulatory side which still have our program to complete the items in our EPA 114 settlement agreement. So, for the next couple of years we would say 1.8 billion represents the absolute minimum. ", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Great. My semi related follow up is, are you now taking a look at the portfolio and thinking about the long-term future for some of the less good plans?  I have heard from others in the industry that they are reviewing their problem children as it were and might be taking some permanent actions by the end of the year. Is that kind of review going on at Valero now?  ", "Bill Klesse ", "Mark, this is Klesse. It has been going on for several years. We have knocked several plants were under strategic review a year or so ago and we did sell two refineries. This is an ongoing process with us but we do not have any deadline or anything.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "What I am trying to say is if you end up not wanting them and you cannot sell them is closure or terminalization on the table?  ", "Bill Klesse ", "Well, I take what you said, if you do not want them and you cannot sell them the answer would be yes. ", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Yes, thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert with Simmons.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Co.", "Good morning. You highlighted in your earnings release the Texas City maintenance where you have all units down and running your FCCs at 70%-75% utilization, I think you are showing a lot of leadership and discipline in maintaining lower runs. Could you discuss how you think about that?  How much of it is based on economics?  I know you have sat down reformers because of poor economics versus perhaps inventories or your view of supply and demand balance in a particular region. Could you talk about how you think through and make those decisions on how much volume to run?", "Bill Klesse ", "Well we do forecasting. We look at what we think is happening in individual markets, as you suggest. We of course run our LPs just like everybody. Certainly we look at the market structure and then we make a judgment. The bottom line of your question is there is too much capability to make an estimate in this environment. If the industry does not balance supply with demand, then we will have negative margins again and as we had in December negative margins for the perceivable future, we will have negative margins. We try to balance it and we look in and at our economics when we make those decisions based on looking at the market's pull. ", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Co.", "Hopefully, the industry will show the same discipline that you have and it appears they are. Second question for Mike, cash on the balance sheet fell quite a bit this quarter. Could you talk about the decline from the end of the third quarter versus end of the fourth quarter and the impact on cash?", "Mike Ciskowski ", "Sure, Jeff. The end of the fourth quarter cash decreased by 1.8 billion. So if you look at all the various items that we provided in our earnings materials net income depreciation, goodwill, etc. that implied a change in cash to about 150 million. The big difference was the change in working capital and it really was attributable to accounts receivable and accounts payable. So at September 30th when we netted the receivables and payables we showed a payable balance of 3.3 billion. At year end the balance had fallen to one and a half billion. So that is the change of cash of 1.8. ", "Receivables as a percentage of payables did not change between the two periods but what you had was a fallen commodity price market. Te value of the floats on these payables decreases resulting in the utilization of cash. So when you look at it as a proxy for the commodity prices, WCI averaged 41 bucks in December, it was 104 in September so that is a decrease of about 60%. You take that 60% and apply it to our payable balance at the end of September and you get about a $2 billion change which is very close to the 1.8 that we had. Offsetting that a little bit was from deferred taxes. ", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Co.", "Thanks for your time.  ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Hi,. You mentioned that under the goodwill impairment test that it was really the equity value falling that by extension made the future discount rate you should apply higher. Can you share with us what that discount rate was, that you had to use?", "Mike Ciskowski ", "We increased it about 2%-3% I think, since what we have normally done. So that is what resulted.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Ok, so there was an increase in the rate from year to year of about 2%-3% but you will not share with me about the overall level?  ", "Mike Ciskowski ", "No. ", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Can you make any observations about how it compares to cost of capital and what you think your cost of capital is?", "Mike Ciskowski ", "Yes, it was probably that that is a very similar number. Our cost of capital is probably up about 3% also.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "You would not share with me your cost of capital?  ", "Mike Ciskowski ", "Well, there are all different kinds of ways to compute that. The cost of debt- the capital markets are pretty volatile. There are several different ways to do it. Generally, we have said our cost of capital is around 10% and I would think in this environment it would be a little more to there. ", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Yes, I have got you. Essentially, the trigger for the impairment was the higher discount rate. It was not any trailing measure that you would have used for margins to test the impairment?", "Mike Ciskowski ", "That is correct, Paul. ", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Ok. If I switch to a little market question here. Distillate markets remain very interesting; that has held up well. Can you talk about the usual components?  The demand side has seen some very scary DRE numbers but on the demand side but it seems the cracks still hold up better than you would have expected; might be to do with exports. Anything you can share with us?", "Gene Edwards ", "Paul, this is Gene. What we are saying on the demand side of heating obviously up front over the weather we are having strictly in January. Although the tank per station fuels demand is down as indicator box of the index on rail and trucking. That is the export from Europe continues to be-  ", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Can you hang some numbers on those various components for me?  ", "Gene Edwards ", "Specifically about export value?", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Well, for a start, heating, how much do you think that is up?  Transport, how much do you think that is down?  Any detail on exports would be great. ", "Gene Edwards ", "I do not have exact numbers on heating holders percentages. Last January was very warm though. This January has been very cold and it indicates- that number too is down about 5%. I think transportation is down around 10%, offsetting-", "Joe Gorder", "Actually one of the industry consultants said transportation is down 10%.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Great, so-", "Joe Gorder ", "Paul, this is Joe. The export market is- remains pretty strong. Last year I think we averaged somewhere around 125,000 barrels a day. It looks like that is going to continue. We are actually exporting at higher value now. The arms are still open to Western Europe and to the Med and so we see significant demand and good activity. ", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "And, Latin America? ", "Joe Gorder ", "Latin America is less of our activity right now. We are sending a lot more to Europe. ", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Interesting, one final one, which is a wild card. Do you know how much COT you produce?  ", "Joe Gorder ", "Yes, 38 million metric tons- we will get you the right number but it is somewhere around what I am saying here. ", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "38 million metric tons per-", "Joe Gorder ", "Call us back to make sure you have the right number. ", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Brilliant. Thanks. I will leave it there. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Eric Mielke with Merrill Lynch. ", "Eric Mielke - Merrill Lynch", "Hi, there. I just have a simple front up question. Just on the markers we had in the beginning of January over the last couple of the weeks. We have seen some extreme relative pricing of crudes particularly for WTI which is always the benchmark we find in margins that most people look at. Can you tell me a little bit about how you are able to capture those margins and how we should be thinking about your operations in that sort of environment?", "Bill Klesse", "You know, the high inventories are particularly [Cushing] is really exaggerated the steepness in the market, which you know is come off for a long period for the last several days and is now about three bucks. In addition to that you got OPEC cutting and it is compressing the (inaudible) discounts relative to TI because TI is so cheap. ", "Now, you know, the question is will these cuts out pace the reduction in demand and go on forward. If not we are going to see produced oil continue to go into tankage and that is going to continue to keep us in a contango market structure and it could in fact exaggerate those markets going forward. ", "That being said, as it specifically relates to us, we do capture the contango on TI barrels. It is really our domestic market. We do not capture the contango on our international barrels because international oils do not take the market structure into effect in their pricing. So when we look at our particular situation, then you really have to net the two. Right now we believe that when you do net the two that it is a push to slightly positive forms. ", "Eric Mielke - Merrill Lynch", "Ok, great, thanks. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Roger Read with Natixis Bleichroeder.", "Roger Read - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Hey, good morning. As you look at these turnarounds it seems like we are extending the length of them and certainly the depth of them, the full shut downs of the plans. What impact does that have in terms of your spending?  Is that increasing it, decreasing it?", "Bill Klesse ", "Well, I would say for the year, if that is the 2009 impact, directionally the changes that we have made have moved some turnarounds out of 2009 into 2010, so 2009 will come in lower than we originally anticipated. ", "From an execution point of view, you do not really slow down the execution because you want to be efficient in what you spend, from a maintenance point of view. I would say duration of turnarounds really do not change because it is efficient execution that we are looking for, but as in the case in Texas City, we have units that are controllably taken down, and we will do very little maintenance on those, so that is just a matter of capacity and economic management. ", "Roger Reed -Natixis Bleichroeder", "", "Simply an opportunity cost or opportunity benefit of not running in terms of what goes down on the turnarounds this time.", "Bill Klesse", "", "That is right, the evaluation that we made, because in this turnaround in Texas City we are taking down a large gas oil hydrotreater that makes sweet cat [thede] We had to evaluate should we purchase sweet cat [thede] in order to turn it into gasoline it just was not an economic proposition for us.", "Roger Reed -Natixis Bleichroeder", "", "Unrelated to my prior question but somewhat related to the prior question, as you look at the OPEC cuts that have been going on out there, have you seen beyond, as you look at the differentials, have you seen any issues with sourcing any particular type of crude, or is there plenty available as the market would tell us with the supposed crude stored out in the ocean and all that?", "Bill Klesse", "We have not had any trouble with physical supply, but we have seen the effects of the cuts in OPEC, the Saudis have cut us back, last we read about 250,000 a day of their oil, and I think in March we are going to run somewhere around 190,000. We have also been cut by the Kuwaitis by about 10%. We are backfilling those volumes with crudes like (inaudible) and Kirkuk and we are just running more Iraqi oil. ", "To answer your question on output supply, it has not been an issue, but we are sourcing it differently.", "Roger Reed -Natixis Bleichroeder", "Share repurchase, obviously some still remains on the authorization, obviously you are watching CapEx, do you think share repos continue a least to the extent to keep the share count flat this year, or is that something that we should consider more or less off the table until things look better?", "Bill Klesse", "Today the issue of course is cash and liquidity, bouncy string, so we know what our dilution would be from our (inaudible) programs, and we will look at it but I am not committing anything.", "Roger Reed - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Thank you", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Gilman with the Benchmark Company.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Good morning. Mike, Bill, can you tell us, at the 2.7 billion level, is that program sized on the basis of it being finds flow neutral on the 2009 environment that you are envisioning?", "Bill Klesse", "", "The answer would be no, it is sized because we are going to take delivery of our hydrocracker reactors at these two plants that were ordered in 2006, we are going to get them, or at least some of them, into the plants and put them on the foundation. We are going to complete that amount of work and then we are going to stop. We have a couple of other projects that we are doing the same thing, and we are getting them to a point that is a good engineering practice point, and that is what we are doing on those big jobs because we believe they are very good jobs for this company in the long run. ", "Today, as all of us, we are looking at what is going on all around us, and even though we are really strong here, we are going to keep our powder dry.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "", "Bill, I can infer from that that the budget is set on the basis of the assumption of being a slight net cash draw down or net incremental order?", "Bill Klesse", "", "We would say today, and will just deal with consensus earnings forecast that yes, when you consider dividends, capital, we have some debt repayment that Mike mentioned, looking at all of that the answer would be yes.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "", "What was the level of economically related through-put curtailments in the fourth quarter and implicit in Ashley\u2019s guidance for 1Q?", "Bill Klesse", "", "Mark, we are going to have to get that after the call. I do not have the breakdown between economic decisions versus maintenance.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "", "Let me try another, Bill you will appreciate this, one of the prior questions dealt with the contango issue in TI and the extent of capture, it would seem, at least if my recollection is correct that midcontinent there is typically a significant benefit associated with the crude roll in the contango gets anywhere near as deep as it was, yet in this period the margins midcontinent were quite a bit weaker, at least than what we thought was going to be the case. What am I missing?", "Bill Klesse", "", "We have the number for you here; 9.5 million in the fourth quarter was the bet to the complex roll.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Mark, from an operational point of view in the mid-continent we also had a cat-feed hydrotreater and cat-cracker outage in the Ardmore refinery, so that undoubtedly impacted the margins in that region. ", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "", "Thank you, do you have any update on discussions with the government in Aruba regarding the expiration of the tax holiday?", "Bill Klesse", "", "As of now the tax holiday is going to expire at the end of \u201910, so I am the one that is doing this now and I talk to the government of Aruba often.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "", "Nothing to update us on, Bill?", "Bill Klesse", "", "Nothing I can update you on.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "", "Just one or two quick ones more, regarding the goodwill impairment, can you give us any idea as to the margin outlook that was implicit in your analysis and the determination, qualitative, quantitative, however you want look at it?", "Mike Ciskowski", "We come up with a price based off of looking at historical prices through the cycle, so we have some good years and we have some bad years, but I cannot give you the exact\u2026", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "So a mid-cycle type condition, Mike?", "Mike Ciskowski", "", "I would characterize that we have good years and bad years, yes. ", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "", "The station count went up fairly significantly, as did average through-put volumes in the US, it would almost appear as if you did a retail acquisition that I either overlooked, missed, or you had not previously indicated. Did I miss something there?", "Bill Klesse", "", "We did acquire late, in fourth quarter of last year an Albertsons chain, it was about 70 sites. ", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "", "I thought that was third quarter of this year?", "Bill Klesse", "", "Whenever we did it, we acquired Albertsons and that would be why our station count is up, so if you look at the average for the quarter you have one number, and you have a different number for the average for the year. Where we are today closing the year is at 1005 stations, but it is because of the Albertsons acquisition, and we do have some sites that we are selling in that acquisition, but we are going to be around 1000 store company operated store chain.", "What is the number?", "Mike Ciskowski", "", "It is 1010.", "Bill Klesse", "", "1010 was the year end store count.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "", "Thank you guys, I appreciate the help.", "Bill Klesse", "", "Mark, I want to tell you one more thing, on Aruba, they start their election process in the end of February, early March, so I do not look for any resolution until they go through their elections. ", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "", "Thank you Bill.", "Operator", "", "(Operator instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Chi Chow with Tristone Capital.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "", "Thank you, it looks like the northeast system, the margins there have done very well the last couple of quarters, have there been any operational changes in that region that has driven those results?", "Bill Klesse", "", "I\u2019m sorry, Chi, you said the margins, in the northeast, which direction?", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "", "It looks like they have done very well in the last two quarters, so I am just wondering if there has been any operational changes that have driven that.", "Bill Klesse", "", "You are not talking about retail, you are talking about refining?", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "", "Refining, yes.", "Bill Klesse", "", "I will tell you, just as a general statement, our Quebec refinery has excellent results, and also our Paulsboro refinery has also done very well. We make lubes at Paulsboro, and they have been doing much better, so that would be the Paulsboro refinery has done better, and that would be the major thing I would say that swung for us here. Quebec, our Canadian guys had a great operation.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "", "Is it more distillate driven up in Quebec?", "Bill Klesse", "", "It is more distillate driven; remember the yield structure up there is clearly skewed towards distillates. The refinery, if you think about it, has a relatively small cracker, on a relative basis.", "Mike Ciskowski ", "", "What I would add to that is we did a crude expansion project in Quebec earlier in the year which we are actually using instead of running higher crude rates volumetrically we have changed the crude mix. We are running more discounted heavier sweet crude in Quebec and that has had a significant impact. ", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "", "What sort of crudes have you switched to up there?", "Mike Ciskowski", "", "West African, we added that into the mix.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "", "I also noted that the off-costs in the Northeast were a bit higher in the fourth quarter. Any reason for that?", "Bill Klesse", "", "I would say that relates to the crude unit turnaround that we had in Delaware City that was one factor; crude unit was down for about 35 days. In addition, the coke-gasification was down for much of the fourth quarter.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "", "You talked about some crude changes in Quebec, some of the sweet crude changes with the Middle East rates, have there been any other meaningful changes in the crude slate throughout the system other than those?", "Bill Klesse", "", "No Chi, if you just look at it, we ran more heavy sour in the quarter, but there has been no fundamental change. ", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Harry Mateer of Barclays Capital.", "Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital", "", "If the debt markets are open to you later in 2009, would you consider issuing any debt to refinance that \u201909 maturity and maybe build up some cash or are you committed to definitely paying down that maturity with cash?", "Bill Klesse", "", "We may access the debt market. We have authorization to do so and we may do that. ", "Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital", "", "Would the intention be for refinancing or refinancing and a combination of also CapEx needs?", "Bill Klesse", "", "The answer would be yes.", "Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil", "", "Good morning, my question is surrounding the cost structure, obviously we have Ashley\u2019s guidance, for 1Q a bit of an uptick, my question is as we progress throughout the year, are there any opportunities to lower costs other than the pure natural gas cost component?", "Bill Klesse", "", "You are speaking in the refineries?", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil", "", "Correct.", "Mike Ciskowsi", "", "We are conducting a review now of whether we can accelerate any cost efficiencies in the refineries. As an example, we employ about 5000 contractors per day on continuing maintenance and operation support, that number is ip over the last few years so we are brginnng to question whether we can implemtn any contractor efficincies and if we were successful in doing that of the order of 10% that would be a significant impact on cost production on the order of about $50 million per year. We are looking at that right now.", "We are also taking a look at the side of our organizations in rlations to this reduced capital expenditure profile, with the intent of trying to positin our organizations for the wrk load that we really anticipate. ", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil", "", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "", "(Operator instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "", "A number of quick questions, do you, when you are looking at Aruba, I think at one point after petrol (inaudible) that you are still looking at trying to sell it to other companies, I think one rumor is oil. At this point, should we assume that there is nothing going on that within this year do you think is going to consummate on that? If not, and assuming you do not get the tax holiday extension in 2010, without that, based on the current configuration, is this a [ripo] entity?", "Bill Klesse", "", "The first question is, we have said that Aruba is a plant that we are looking for strategiv alternatives, so it continues. Whether you can expect it or not remains to be seen, and at the end of the day it will have to do with values, I\u2019m sure. ", "Whether the plant is a viable operation after the tax holiday ends, and there are many more issues than just the tax holiday here by the way, but that remains to be seen. ", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "", "You are not 100% sure of that, because we do know that in addition to the tax holiday that labor (inaudible) and everything has been an issue over there.", "Bill Klesse", "", "You are asking me if I am 100% sure?", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "", "No, I\u2019m just saying that based on what you can see, if you believe that is a facility you would be willing, if you cannot sell it you would be willing to make additional investment to make them [viable] or do you think that you would be able to want them as it is and be okay?", "Bill Klesse", "", "I\u2019m going to ask you Paul, and you are not going to like the answer, it just depends.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "", "That is fair. Acquisition, maybe it is very far off, but if a recent opportunity comes and [oil] is pretty cheap at this point, and you guys remain despite that the situation looks pretty bad, but you guys remain one of the strongest, is that something that you guys mind, or that you think that given the uncertainty you really should not be too aggressive on that front?", "Bill Klesse", "", "We will not be too aggressive on that front, but we will look at some of these plants that are coming on the market. We are a refinery, you buy our stock because we are a refining and marketing company and this is our business and as these plants come along we are going to take a look at them, and we\u2019ll see if we get the strategic fit and the value that we say it is a good investment for our shareholders.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "", "Can we assume that you would be using your share but not the cash if you go into, or is that not necessarily a requirement?", "Bill Klesse", "", "It depends on the size of the deal, I think in this environment liquidity and blanace sheet strength are absolutely imperitive, so if we found the right kind of deal we are going to finance it the right way to keep that, and keep our investment grade rate.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "", "I think this is for Gene or maybe for Rich, the [Meyer] discount have come down quite dramatically and the only down to maybe $5 or $6 at this point. Oftentimes, you have been able to scour and find some similar quality grade with a much bigger discount, is that an opportunity you have been able to fund at this point, or when looking at that, [Meyer], its price is reasonable, and the current market conditions is this the discount that we are getting?", "Joe Gorder", "", "Paul, this is Joe. You are absolutely right, the mine discount has compressed materially, a week ago it was at parody with WTI and with the flattening of the curve and the increase in the TI pricing for us, now we have got a $5 discount today. Through that period, for the last several months we have continued to find alternative heavy sours and we are running crudes like  Kestia and Maray and Napo and M100s, which continue to price at about nine to 10 off. ", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "So you have been able to get the quality on those that is pretty similar to [Meyer]?", "Joe Gorder", "", "Yes.", "Paul Cheng -Barclays Capital", "", "Thank you", "Operator", "", "Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Mark Gilman with The Benchmark Company.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "", "Just a way of clarification, Mike, when you were talking about changes in the capital program, I think that you make some reference to the aromatics project at St. Charles, which, frankly, I thought you had shelved previously and yet you talking in terms of there being a compliance element to it. Could you clarify what you said there?", "Rich Marcogliese", "", "We have talked about that previously and we have it was with the objective of recovering aromatics and producing paraxylene to get into a new business for Valero. When we talked in the prior quarter it was the paraxylene project and we made a decision to defer. The examination that we have made in this quarter is we have taken a look at aromatics extraction as it relates to the need to comply with the MSAT II regulations, this is mobile source air toxics, it requires getting benzene down to less than 0.6% in gasoline. We had made an evaluation of whether we would install new aromatics extraction facilities in St. Charles, as was part of the original plan. We have made the decision to defer that and we will take advantage of capacity that is available in existing extractors in Corpus Christi. That is the change that we have made this quarter compared to last quarter.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "", "Thank you Rich, could you also clarify, you were going a little bit too quickly, the adjustment that has been made in the Memphis program?", "Rich Marcogliese", "", "The Memphis program has one of our cat-crackers that has the poorest reliability, we have put together an extensive revamp project for that, it was originally slated for implementation this year, we made a decision to defer it to 2010, we have now made a decision to push it out to 2012. ", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "", "The Canadian retail generated a lot less than operating profit than I would have thought, is there something else that impacted that? Maybe FIFO or inventory considerations, or exchange rate considerations, the numbers were way below anything we thought might be realistic given retail heating oil margins. ", "Rich Marcogliese", "", "We do not believe so.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "", "Nothing you can think of?", "Rich Marcogliese", "", "No, business has been good there.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Valero Energy Corporation First Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on-mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Thank you.", "I would now like to introduce Executive Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Ashley Smith. Please go ahead sir.", "Ashley Smith", "Hey thank you Celeste. Good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. With me today are Bill Klesse our Chairman and CEO; Mike Ciskowski our CFO and other members of our executive management team.", "If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached earnings release our table that provides additional financial information on our business segment. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables please feel free to contact Investor Relations after the call.", "Before we get started, I'd like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provision under Federal Securities Laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.", "Now I will turn the call over to Mike.", "Mike Ciskowski", "Thanks Ashley and thank you for joining us today. As noted in the release we reported first quarter 2009 net income of $309 million or $0.59 per share. This is a 23% increase in earnings per share over the $0.48 per share reported in the first quarter of 2008.", "When you exclude the $0.12 per share benefit from an insurance recovery at McKee in the first quarter of 2008, first quarter 2009 earnings per share is 64% higher in the same quarter of last year. First quarter 2009 operating income was $507 million versus $472 million in the first quarter of 2008 or $371 million without the previously mentioned insurance recovery. The increase in operating income was mainly due to higher refining margins on gasoline and secondary products such as fuel oil, asphalt and petroleum coke.", "For example, benchmark U.S. Gulf Coast's gasoline margins versus WTI of $8.14 per barrel were almost double before 23 per barrel in the first quarter of 2008. As a proxy for secondary products Gulf Coast margins on hi-sol (ph) for fuel oil improved 86% from $28.16 per barrel below the price of WTI in the first quarter of 2008 to $4 per barrel below WTI in the first quarter of this year.", "Lower operating expenses also contributed to the increase in operating income versus the first quarter of 2008. The $117 million decline in refining operating expenses was due primarily to lower energy costs and then the absence of operating expenses at Krotz Springs Refinery which was sold in July of 2008; Somewhat offsetting the increase in the first quarter 2009 operating income was the significant decline in our sour crude oil discounts and lower diesel and jet fuel margins.", "From the first quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2009, Maya heavy sour crude oil discounts versus WTI, decreased 73% to $4.46 per barrel and the Mars sour crude oil spreads decreased by 111% to a premium to WTI of $0.78 per barrel. Although, benchmark diesel margins in our regions averaged respectable levels in the low to mid teens per barrel in the first quarter of 2009, the decreases from the first quarter of 2008 were approximately 25% on the Gulf Coast and East Coast and in 31% on the West Coast and 44% in the Mid-Continent.", "Our first quarter throughput volumes averaged 2.5 million barrels per day which was 142,000 barrels per day below the first quarter of 2008. This was primarily due to the reduction in capacity from the sale of the Krotz Springs Refinery and then downtime of several of our other refineries.", "Refinery cash operating expenses were $4.49 per barrel, which were favorable to our guidance of $4.80 per barrel due mainly to lower than expected energy costs and higher than expected throughput volume.", "General and administrative expenses excluding corporate depreciation were a $145 million in first quarter. The $7 million increase from the fourth quarter and $2 million increase from our guidance was primarily due to higher severance costs.", "For the first quarter, total depreciation and amortization expense was $378 million below our guidance due to lower turnaround amortization expense. Interest expense net of capitalized interest was $79 million, slightly above our guidance due to the issuance of the $1 billion worth of notes in mid-March. The effective tax rate was 28%.", "Regarding cash flows for the first quarter, the capital spending was $902 million which includes a $167 million of turnaround expenditures and we paid $77 billion in dividends on our common stock. In March, we received nearly $1 billion from our bond offering in which we issued 750 million of 10 notes and 250 million of 30 year notes.", "The proceeds enabled us to pay-off 209 million of maturing debt that came due on April 1st, to fund our acquisition of the VeraSun ethanol plants and maintain our capital expenditure program.", "Regarding the ethanol plants we are excited about our acquisition of the plants from VeraSun, for total capacity of 780 million gallons per year or 50,000 barrels per day we will pay a total of $477 million which is 30% of estimated replacement cost plus approximately $78 million for working capital.", "We have closed on six of the plants and one development site and we expect to close on the last plant very soon. We consider these to be the best plants in VeraSun's system and some of the best in the industry due to their large size and advantage access to local feed stocks. This acquisition fits well with Valero's core business of manufacturing and marketing motor fuels.", "With respect to our balance sheet at the end of March, our total debt was $7.6 billion due to the timing of the bond offering, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.7 billion and we had nearly $4.7 billion of additional liquidity available. Also at the end of quarter, our debt-to-cap ratio net of cash was 27.1% which remains far below the bank agreement threshold of 60%.", "Regarding future uses of cash, we have made additional cuts to our estimate for the 2009 capital expenditures and turnaround costs considering the weak economic outlook. We now estimate capital spending will be 2.5 billion which is down 200 million from our most recent estimate. Regarding upcoming debt payments, we are required in October to offer to purchase 100 million of our bonds for the related indenture and in 2010 our maturities total only $30 million.", "In summary, we are working diligently to manage our financial health in this weak economy. Realizing that we are not immune from the effects of the recession, we are reducing operating costs, overhead costs and capital expenditures. However, we will prudently continue to invest in growth opportunities that build long-term value for our shareholders.", "Now, I'll turn it over to Ashley to cover the earnings models assumptions.", "Ashley Smith", "Thanks Mike. Okay, for modeling our second quarter operations we should expect the following refinery throughput volume. The Gulf Coast should average between 1.35 to 1.4 million barrels per day. Mid-Continent should average between 360,000 and 370,000 barrels per day. West Coast should average between 270,000 and 280,000 barrels per day and the North East should average in the range of 460,000 to 470,000 barrels per day.", "Refinery cash operating expenses are expected to be about $4.40 per barrel which is down slightly from the first quarter due to higher expected throughput volume and continued low energy cost. Regarding our ethanol operation in the second quarter we expect total throughput volume of 1.5 to 1.6 million gallons per day and operating expenses should be in the range of $0.31 to $0.33 per gallon and that includes approximately $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization expense.", "With respect to some of the other items for the second quarter, we expect general and administrative expense excluding depreciation to be around $140 million. Net interest expense should be around $100 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be around $390 million and we expect a 31% effective tax rate.", "We will now open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line, if I am pronouncing it correctly, Erik Mielke.", "Erik Mielke - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Yes Erik Mielke from Merrill Lynch. I have two questions if I may. One is I guess its time the question to ask if you can give us an update on what you're seeing on demand for brief casting I guess also for diesel in the current environment.", "And my second question relates to the commentary you had in the press release today of around different policy initiatives in D.C. If you can elaborate a little bit on what you expect to see come out of D.C. and what it might mean for your business I think particularly about cap and trade and other similar initiatives?", "Joe Gorder", "Well on gasoline demand, we realize it's weak. It's 2.5% from the same period last year which we saw, this demand is also weak, much weaker than gasoline and our own network though we've seen gasoline demand on retail operations actually increased. It's up 1% so in our markets we think it's with that (ph).", "Erik Mielke - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "What's the rate of change on the deficit side? Is it getting worse or is it starting to slowdown?", "Joe Gorder", "Well, it hasn't got any better. The story in it but of course is the export volumes and we continue to have an open arm Europe which we're taking advantage of. We're also seeing increased demand in South America. The winter's approaching there and then some of the traditional sources of supply just aren't available. So export volume is still strong, domestic volumes are weak.", "Mike Ciskowski", "I might add on our retail network. We're up 1% on gasoline but on distillate we're down about 10%. So, on an average when you weigh that we're pretty much flat for the year, of course this is the first quarter. Distillates or the diesel is only about 10% of our network sales volume. So we're flat.", "Bill Klesse", "On the Washington initiatives I think that Kim Bowers, who is our Executive Vice President and in-charge of government relations, but just keep in mind that we have and we're still auditing these numbers of about 36 million metric tones of CO2 emissions as she speaks.", "Kim Bowers", "Thanks Bill. Yes we're reviewing the Waxman Bill but there still so many details to work out that we haven't evaluated the impact. What they trying to chose credits whether they're going to be allocated or auctioned of all the details still need to be worked out with the Waxman Bill. So we're watching it very carefully, but still think and we still think that there are some unintended consequences that will result from this, pushing it's away from foreign crude oil to foreign products coming in and unfairly it's giving advantage to foreign competition over domestic competition here?", "Bill Klesse", "Obviously we think this is a bad idea. Also the devil is always in the details. Obviously, our government is looking for cash and so we'll see what happens on that. The other initiatives we've also spoken about is some of the tax consequences of eliminating LIFO just for energy companies, putting the super fund tax back in, which quite frankly we do collect from our customers I mean in reality corporations, you know we just collect taxes that we think composite (ph).", "Also the manufacturer's credit which has been identified total back eliminating that also just for energy companies; so there is a effort here at the moment to raise money from a segment of the business that is just been to be able to pass. So those are only the few other things and as you read the newspaper like we do.", "The major issue with CO2 is that the United States will in fact forced this. We'll have a department here that we'll track it, regulate it and file reports and we'll pay whatever we're told we have to pay. But in the rest of the world it would not be as rigorously enforced as it would be here. And thus it changes the global competitor situation.", "So we need to be very careful.", "Erik Mielke - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "So, the document say the introduction of carbon pricing would add I am sorry, I am not asking to confirm or deny. But say that a dollar per pound to your overall cost base. If do you do not have an equivalent cost deployed to product imports, what would that do to your business?", "Bill Klesse", "Well, I have no idea. Except that as Joe mentioned, we are -- this is a global business, its very capital intensive business. By looking at our data our operating costs just say for this conversation $5 a barrel and if you add a $1 a barrel or $2 a barrel, you can see what its doing to your cost situation for a refinery. But as far as what the sensitivity or elasticity there for is I don't know.", "Erik Mielke - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "But are you I am thinking more about the pricing dynamics. If you, if it's prior to the import then presumably it'll be passed through consumer goods because its same for everyone. And whereas if its -- if it is not implied to import then, it becomes a question of who -- where the pricing power lies?", "Bill Klesse", "You're not exactly right on freight (ph). If it comes gets into this and if it's a dollar as you just said, it would be $0.022 (ph) a gallon. So, but we'll just see what evolves; the thing that I say and I know this sounds a little bit like motherhood and apple pie, but we have good jobs in this industry. We pay a good wage; people who can work for us and own their home, educate their children and some of these initiatives and the social change agenda, will have a big impact on part of the backbone of our country with just with other of the manufacturing jobs.", "Erik Mielke - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Nothing wrong with motherhood and apple pie. Thanks for your answer.", "Bill Klesse", "Thanks Erik.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Flannery with Credit Suisse.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Thank you. Yeah I have a question on CapEx and how we should think about where the CapEx line is going. You got a another $200 million of it; should we infer from this that you are trying as best as you can to run cash neutral in 2009, in other words if things don't really kick-off over the summer, should we expect another 200 million to drop off that number as we enter the full? And am I thinking about it the wrong way?", "Bill Klesse", "No you can think of it that way. If you just look at the first call estimate, what we are trying to do is manage our business here, but we still have a very strong balance sheet. Apart of the thing we are doing all is getting our projects to a point where we can orderly stop them. For instance we have our large hydrocracker projects which our whole management team believes are good projects long-term.", "But we're getting them to appoint if we stop here as we whether this storm that we're dealing with. But, if you go through first call and do all the adds and subtracts you can see that we're pretty close to being in balance at $2.5 billion.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Right. And last quarter I think you mentioned a $1.8 billion as a minimum CapEx number. Is that still a valid number or do you think we could chop away that little bit?", "Mike Ciskowski", "We still consider that to be the minimum expenditure level over the next couple of years when you consider turnaround expenditures reliability, safety projects and environmental capital. And environmental capital in particular for the next couple of years we have a couple of regulatory obligations that we have to meet, we have to reduce benzene and gasoline its known as the MSAT II Regulation. We have carry over projects that come out of our EPA 114 agreement, then we have a large air quality project in Benicia that we are completing. So we would still say that $1.8 billion represents a minimum level for the next few years.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. Thank you very much.", "Bill Klesse", "Thanks Mark.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Natexis Bleichroeder, Inc.", "Roger Read - Natexis Bleichroeder, Inc.", "Hey good morning gentlemen.", "Bill Klesse", "Good morning Roger.", "Roger Read - Natexis Bleichroeder, Inc.", "Just wanted to follow-up on the gasoline demand you're saying in your retail. Is that a year-over-year comparison the 1% and the 10% and if it is how would it compare say what you saw in the fourth quarter to the first quarter or currently even?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Okay. It is a that's a first quarter '09 versus the first quarter '08 comparison. In the fourth quarter we had -- we were up just a little bit compared to the first quarter. Not much difference though between the two quarters.", "Roger Read - Natexis Bleichroeder, Inc.", "All right, thanks. And then following on with the CapEx question, kind of last time we had an update, the expectation was the CapEx number would be may be more spend rather than less spend. Has something changed in the last lets say 60 days that lead you to be more conservative about that or something in your expectation, 60 days that is now not as bright as you thought then?", "Bill Klesse", "The only think I would tell you is we're looking at the economy just like you are and we have a lot of people that are telling us who see a recovery here may be at the end or year and we just look at the data. We no unemployment most likely going to continue to increase from 8.5 or if some numbers are high as 10.5, so we just look at the situation, we also don't see any stimulus money doing anything. We don't see a lot of things happening so we're just being a little more conservative.", "Roger Read - Natexis Bleichroeder, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Dietert with Simmons.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Co.", "Jeff Dietert with Simmons. Good morning.", "Bill Klesse", "Good morning.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Co.", "First with stocks are up and the demand is pretty weak. Have you guys hedged some of your distillate going through the summer and if so is it significant?", "Mike Ciskowski", "We are always in these markets as I have said every time. We do a rate-ability when we buy oil, we have some forward sales in normal course of business. We have some pretty darn good treasures over there that our business for us. When it comes to strategic type decisions like significant sales or so, then and actually our entire management team gets involved and I am very involved in these things.", "We have a strong main (ph), but to your question, we are in these markets all the time, some of you know a lot of this is my background and basically we are there, we have done some forward selling, but on the other hand this is competitive, its very competitive what our positions are and so Jeff I prefer not to get into too much detail. In 10-K that would be filed in a couple of weeks, there will be some disclosures.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Co.", "Okay. Thank you. Now on the -- it seems the East Coast market has been more challenged in some of the other regions utilization rates have been much lower there and yet stocks are above average. Do you see that correcting overtime as the economy recovers or is that just a fundamentally more competitive market?", "Bill Klesse", "I think focusing on the East if I understand, we've taken our Delaware City Refinery down. We had a problem with the coker in February, and if you can think about that operation, a large fluid coker, we could not get it restarted when it came down. Thus, we wound up shutting down the entire refinery. We've had that refinery down here for the month of March and frankly for eight.", "Now, we've done the repair work on the coker actually here the turnaround. We fixed our steam system because we took some of that down, things that you never fix. We've added some other steam; we have lost the boiler due to regulatory in Delaware and so we've actually had to bring in some temporary boilers because we decided we don't have enough steam.", "So we have been doing things like this. Now the plant is scheduled to start up and we are in the process of starting back-up and thus you will see rates as based on Ashley's guidance till you hear in the second quarter. But the plant of Delaware City is starting up.", "Now having said all of that, in this environment that we're in there is too much refining capacity, too much capability to make refine products and I said this very publicly the NSG needs to maintain discipline here during this environment until the economy picks up. If the industry does not maintain discipline then these margins are going to come down and it will be a lot tougher environment.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Co.", "Thanks for your comments.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Hi good morning gentlemen. In the past you've been quite specific about merging acquisitions particularly in terms of disposal candidates, though could you talk a little about firstly, how you're viewing disposals.", "Secondly, about acquisitions as well in the current market. And I am also thinking not just about refineries but also about ethanol and also based on what you just said on the potential for any international activity either disposal or acquisition. Thanks.", "Bill Klesse", "Sure. We still are looking for strategic options for Aruba refinery and we'll continue to do that as the world continues to evolve. But as a general statement, the markets have shifted dramatically as I said, you can buy assets for a lot less money and you can build. And this is kind of what we always expected and we're back to the market here where acquisitions, the proper hardware in the right location is attractive to us.", "So to sum you detail on ethanol we've got a stake in the business, its got a critical math, it is policy in United States, we are still firm believer in sound science, but it is policy. And so all this is an extension for us, but I do not see us adding to our ethanol business through acquisitions unless it is absolutely a golden opportunity. We are also looking at little bits and pieces in what we'll call the second generation ethanol just like almost every company is.", "On international acquisitions we are very interested, now that we see some plants coming on the market we continue to look at those. If we find one that we think, one, two or three that fits our situation we are interested in making an acquisition. It's got to be the right plant, the right location and the right price. What we would like to do is broaden our geographic face, but we need to do it in the right way.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "though it feels that as couple of refineries domestically they're kind of just not running any more, I mean is it fair to say that about Delaware for instance?", "Bill Klesse", "No, that's not fair to say. We're starting the plant up.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Right. But I guess that was part of the very low throughput that you got for Q2 and...", "Bill Klesse", "Well, we've sorry Paul. We've lost one month obviously, so if you think about it, we're not starting up as to right and so that's the main reason. That refinery has a good configuration, but I am not going to deny. We've operated that refinery very poorly and we've have a major effort here to improve the operations of that.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "So, if I summarize basically, the existing if you like disposable candidate, is only Aruba and you are looking for international opportunities and you may very selectively add ethanol?", "Bill Klesse", "Yeah, I think the last thing you said is very, very selectively add ethanol. Is that what you said?", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Yeah.", "Bill Klesse", "Yeah. I would agree with that.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "And just to be clear, there's international account in Canada?", "Bill Klesse", "Oh Sure. I was thinking...", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "But I guess you think...", "Bill Klesse", "I was thinking.... I thought you were asking me more about Europe.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Yeah I know I was, but I just wanted to be quite clear. Okay, thanks a lot.", "Bill Klesse", "But to be honest with you, we already operate in Canada, so we are always interested in the current opportunity there.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Yeah, okay. Thanks. That's great.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte with J.P. Morgan.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P.M organ", "Thanks, good morning. If I could follow-up Ashley perhaps on the guidance for this quarter on ethanol. How does your current sort of wins balance and your petition to get a blender credit fit into that guidance? Can you give some update on those two things?", "Joe Gorder", "You want to ask -- I mean from let me just say from a product supply perspective, we deal with the compliance with the RFS on an ongoing basis. The acquisition of VeraSun for us is the acquisition of a standalone business and there will be opportunities I am sure for Valero to purchase ethanol from the VeraSun assets, our capacity (ph). But it is not the reason that we did the acquisition and we don't say the two being related to where you linked them in your question.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P.M organ", "Okay.", "Mike Ciskowski", "And utilization rates are just based on when we can acquire and get them up and running.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P.M organ", "Okay. Its helpful to think about it a sustainable business. Thank you for that. And then on the issue of cash management, how should we think about, how you are managing your inventory levels and can you give us an update as to how many days accrued there you are currently sitting on?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Cash management?", "Michael LaMotte - J.P.M organ", "No, I mean days accrued.", "Bill Klesse", "We still run our business in Illinois. We have about 115 million barrels of crude products and all kinds of things in our system. Our LIFO number at the end of last year was 114 million?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Yeah.", "Bill Klesse", "114 million if you look at. Obviously the markets in Calgary (ph) and so where we turn in the Mid-Continent we try very hard to take advantage of the Calgary just like you would expect us. We are not so and I have not gone out there and at least that the -- and we don't think that Calgary is quite enough.", "However, we have had earlier in the year when the carry got out to be several bucks a lot more oil on the water and the sense of trying to capture the (ph). And its been difficult because in the Mid-Continent we thought we catch it some of the international stuff gets surprisingly of trouble capturing it, but we're trying that, but as a general statement we have that, we have brought crude on the water, we're buying more crude obviously Venezuela, the Rockies and some of the other places because the Mexican borrowings are down.", "We have different numbers, we have a priced number which is actually a our price risk inventory and crude oil could be around 22, 23 days but then if you look at the supply functions its actually a different number, it tends to be slightly higher, because we buy a lot of the crude FOB. So it's hard for us to give you number except to say that we're basically around the business as we owns that. However, whereas not can go -- we are trying to get our inventories out of the refineries for instance and into the marketplace to generate the cash.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P.M organ", "That's helpful. Thank you.", "Bill Klesse", "It's a normal process for us.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P.M organ", "Yeah, yeah, okay. And normal as important I guess is sort of if I think about it year-on-year?", "Bill Klesse", "Yes, we have not like gone into a -- I mean we have a 115 million. We run our inventory situation same although we're watching it.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P.M organ", "And last one from me just on shipping rates as it relates particularly to the Arab window in Europe. How sensitive is that window to shipping rates and where do we stand within that?", "Joe Gorder", "No, it's a very sensitive point and we've had very inexpensive shipping here over the last several months. And it's started to tighten up a little bit, so it has chewed into the Arab, but the Arab remains open.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P.M organ", "So its still up. Okay.", "Bill Klesse", "The actual rates got down just a couple of pennies.", "Joe Gorder", "Yeah.", "Bill Klesse", "And so it's been as low as I've see in years and thus we've been enabled to chase the Arab when it's $0.04 or $0.05 a gallon. So that there's a buck profit in it for us a barrel to move stuff to Europe. So, but this is blowing rates that I have seen in a while, I am trying to remember when. So it does facilitate those type of trends.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P.M organ", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Gilman with the Benchmark Company.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Good morning guys.", "Bill Klesse", "Hey Mark. Good morning Mark.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Hey Bill, I assume from your prior comments and also your answer to an earlier question regarding exploiting the deep first quarter contango. That there might be some fairly significant supply trading gains embedded in the first quarter results. Can you quantify what that is?", "Bill Klesse", "Yeah, we'll certainly tell you what we're doing contango Joe.", "Mike Ciskowski", "Yeah, Mark the number if you take into consideration all of domestic barrels is $150 million for the quarter. All right, and I think Bill answered the question what we're doing on inventories here pretty clearly just a minute ago. So anything else there?", "Joe Gorder", "Well Joe that's just the domestic number I am assuming that there might be another element to that as well.", "Joe Gorder", "Mark on the international book we may catch a little bit of a contango but not much and it varies by the crude that you're buying but the one thing that we need to keep in mind for example is this, that the way that the Middle Eastern oil priced and the way that the Mexican's priced Maya, it doesn't take into consideration the market structure and so you typically don't capture the contango unless you get something physically in storage at that point in time. And you as Bill mentioned that's really not the way we run our business. So you don't get it just by virtue of the fact that you're running it.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Yeah but Joe normally wouldn't you have taken inventories down the first quarter?", "Joe Gorder", "Pardon me.", "Bill Klesse", "Taking the course down the first quarter...", "Joe Gorder", "Did we?", "Bill Klesse", "Yeah.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "No, you probably did not but....", "Joe Gorder", "They were up slightly I believe.", "Bill Klesse", "Hang on Mark, you'll then give you the right the answer here. Mike's going to give you the details.", "Joe Gorder", "They were 115.7 million barrels versus a 114 at year end. And crude was up one and products were just up a half.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Right. Then you said normal first quarter behavior for you?", "Joe Gorder", "Yeah, I don't think we did anything ordinary. I mean look we're running the system to satisfy our utilization rates too. So to the extent that they were different we'll have more would be with that than it would any kind of apply.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Okay. Let me shift gears for a second if I could. How you guys going to report the ethanol activities both operationally and financially, separate segment embedded in the regions, what are you going to do?", "Mike Ciskowski", "It would be a separate segment.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Okay. And implicit in Ashley's $0.32 per gallon operating cost second quarter guidance, what's the corn price that's embedded in that?", "Ashley Smith", "Well, there's not corn cost in that. That's just operating cost, just like in our refinery operating costs we don't repeat stock cost in that.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Okay.", "Ashley Smith", "I think it's 377.", "Mike Ciskowski", "Yeah, $0.03, that's right. That much.", "Bill Klesse", "$3.77. It's $3, just say $3.80 of those, how we're looking at it today.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Okay.", "Bill Klesse", "That order for the quarter.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Is that a hedged number Bill?", "Bill Klesse", "No, that is not. But in this business it is a lot different, we do a lot. There's a lot of forward buying, there's contract with the farmers and Gene do you want to comment?", "Gene Edwards", "Yeah. Mark we always try to keep things soft. So that where you're seeing spot price in the spot ethanol price everyday, similarly we run refining business. That mainly to trap the buying, spot are fixed priced contracts to the farmers and then you sell the back to convert it back to floating price until you run the corn.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Okay. Regarding the throughput numbers for the second quarter give me a rough idea, how much of that is maintenance, how much of that is economically oriented curtailment?", "Gene Edwards", "On the refinery?", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Yeah.", "Gene Edwards", "I don't have that with me right now.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Okay. Last one for me, can you identify where the 200 million in CapEx reduction is going to hit on a project-by-project basis?", "Bill Klesse", "We can. We have gone through this in excruciating detail, as you can imagine we're all involved. But we are deferring some projects as we've been able to move turnaround from the forth quarter into the first quarter, because we're doing this full term work at St. Charles. So there are details, I think you should just expect from us that its been this we're in somewhere around 2.5 million.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Okay guys, thanks very much.", "Bill Klesse", "Mark, I want to answer the other question when you asked the normal behavior in the first quarter. It is normal behavior on the inventory management except for the fact that we did have contango and thus in the Mid-Continent where I mentioned to the earlier question we went ahead and tried where we have tankers and things like that to capture contango. If the market had been backward dated then we would have been pushing it the other way.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Okay. The benefit of that is captured in 150 million, I think that Joe quoted.", "Bill Klesse", "Yeah, it's all in Joe's numbers. We tried to calculate what that was all worth to us.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Neil McMahon from Sanford Bernstein.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford Bernstein", "Sanford Bernstein:} Hi good morning. I got a few questions; first one really just looking at your outlook for the summer in terms of gasoline imports coming from Europe to the U.S. given the really low diesel track in Europe and one presumes a falling utilization rate of European refineries. Just wondering if you're factoring that a toll in some of your thinking of overrun summer imports.", "Bill Klesse", "I don't think that we expect anything to be different this year than last year relative to gasoline imports from Europe.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. And second one is on ethanol again and may be just more of a 50 point (ph) good question. I could see the logic why you've gone in and done this with VeraSun. Do you expect -- or oil companies to start doing this as well. Nothing that's been playing in this game already but a new entrant pass then may be some of the bigger integrated. And secondly can you see yourselves selling ethanol to however may be larger integrated companies?", "Bill Klesse", "For your first question I really don't know what the others will do. And for us as we've said with the VeraSun market was a good extension, remember we're an independent refiner and our whole businesses almost entirely motor fuels. So, to us it was a good extension. And then as far as selling, we will sell, we are going to run this separate business and so as Mike said its going to be segment recorded, we take advantage of synergies here in the office when you come to wake our management, accounting cash management the things that you would expect, but as far as the business itself, we're seller of ethanol. And I will sell to anybody that will pay our price and pays their bills.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. Just a last, hopefully quick one; just back on the gasoline demand in the U.S. and though seen that from your stores that as you said you're up 1%. Are you getting any sense of geography where that is coming through? Are you seeing primarily the demand coming back in the West, relative to the rest of countries certainly miles probably in all the things and picked up in the West relative to the Central and Eastern parts of the U.S. May be you could give us some flavor of its faulty or is it you're actually seeing has some migration of demands picking up from West three?", "Bill Klesse", "Yeah, I'll just give you just a quick observation. I mean in California vehicles miles travel kicked off. And so where obviously volumes moved up a little better in California, and that just came out the other day some report on the vehicle miles travel.", "But then in the South West here obviously in Texas, and remember we're talking where Mike spoke, he spoke that the company operated retail, which for barrel is a 100 -- is 1000 company operated stores and then the volumes stands for the first quarter at average somewhere around a 117 or 18,000 barrels a day of gasoline.", "So when you look at it that way, you would just think about the size of the business, but South West year, you tend to have better volumes here in Texas, because the weather had been pretty nice. But as far as going East or so, we don't directly market there.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford Bernstein", "All right, great. Just looking for your overview.", "Operator", "Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Hey guys, on you're earlier that you are talking about the Delaware City saying that you guys have not been running it, whereas you should be -- is that hardware issue or just the people issue?", "Bill Klesse", "Yes we had a hardware issue there. I'll let Rich speak.", "Rich Marcogliese", "Sure, Paul I think the plan has a good configuration but has one of our most complicated plans from a steam gas and utility management point of view which largely relates to the coal gas plant. We had an issue in late 2008 where we had a failure on one of two gas refining reactors which really affected the operation of that whole complex, to try to run it on one remaining gas refining reactor.", "That in turn affected the utility system in the refinery and really you can trace some of that to the problem that we had in the middle of February, where we had large steam system up set that resulted in the shutdown of the coker. So my stance of this is we have got a very complicated plant configuration, we had an issue last year, we made to repair and gotten it behind us and I think you'll see improvement going forward.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Okay. I know but I think may be I missed you, have you guys say probably be the inventory or the trading gain in the quarter is 150 million?", "Bill Klesse", "That the number that Joe gave was the calculated contango benefit.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Totally the contango benefit.", "Bill Klesse", "So that shows up eventually in our crude costs.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Right. And that 150 million is so that means that you've seen your gross profit margin that would be a mutation, and that entered Mid-Continent system or they spread to other systems also?", "Bill Klesse", "Primarily the Mid-Continent somewhere in the Gulf Coast we're running domestic barrels.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Right. And is that including any of the potential trading gain?", "Bill Klesse", "No.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "That is already included?", "Bill Klesse", "That does not include our activity where we do some spreads when you had the contango market obviously we traded some of the papers and things like that.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Right. So the 150 is the periodic to CMA adjustment or that's?", "Bill Klesse", "That's right. That's the way to look to at it Paul.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And given that the oil price actually, and the quarter above $5 higher than they stop the quarter. Do we have any inventory gain because I think that you have markdown as have some LIFO inventory markdown at the end of the year. Do we have any mark-up in the quarter?", "Mike Ciskowski", "No. It's not a material amount that goes through there...", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "It's not a material. And that Bill I know you saying that you don't want to disclose too much because of proprietary on the trading side. Can you give us a rough idea that how much have may have made in the quarter?", "Bill Klesse", "Well I'd prefer not to because its really an ongoing piece of the business for us. And we think people look at us. We're obviously still large; we're in the paper markets all the time. And we have a bunch of good guys that execute for us. But it has been a positive benefit to us and it's a positive benefit that has continued. We had some in the fourth quarter, third quarter of last year.", "I believe the paper markets are key part of the business, the way we do business today and so we're very opted in those markets.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And a little earlier that you mentioned that for M&A, you're looking for potential acquisition you would interest? You said with the right location, right facility? Can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of what you will consider as the right location and what you consider as the right kind of configuration of facility?", "Bill Klesse", "Well we're one -- we always look for an asset that's on the water. We want the ability to trade barrels. We are firm believers here that this is a global business. On the north Atlantic Basin, its -- if you just look at the Basin, Europe's long gasoline short diesel. The U.S. today is long gasoline and I can admit and say -- I could say we're a little on diesel, but once the economy does recover, we will not be long diesel.", "And so it's a natural play for us. That's why we had our hydrocracker projects at our big refineries, so that we could make more diesel, to service both the domestic market, as well as the European market. But we like the Atlantic Basin trade, you get draws in the South America, obviously Mexico continues to be an importer and Venezuela is an importer or used to be an exporter. Africa with all the issues that go on in Nigeria is a importer of gasoline.", "So you see a lot of things that say to us that having assets that can back you up in your trading business in your North Atlantic is the way to go. And there's been a lot of companies who've made a lot of money over the years by doing that strategy.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "So basically despite the market condition may have changed somewhat over the last 12 to 18 months, your overall view about what will quantify as a good location or a good asset configuration have not change, its the same?", "Bill Klesse", "No, and has not. We like assets as I said on the water; we like to have some size, we've said historically 150,000 barrels a day or more but the facts are its got - its really a location game. We want to ability to upgrade; we think that's a key part of Valero. You buy our stocks, you're buying a refinery in a capital intensive business. And we like the ability to try to work on these plans and improve them.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "And Bill, if current market condition extends for the next say one to two years, is there any of your facility if you can't sell, you think may be candidly for impairment that is your thought?", "Bill Klesse", "Well I kind of got this question on the last call and I think somebody asked me if we can't make any money and if you can't sell it what'll you do with it? And I said well and you shut it down. We're in business to make money and that's our value. But today, we don't have any clients like that. And its always a big if, like if you can change a significant changes, we'd like to thank that we're going to have an economic recovery here at least by 2010 and if that happens our business provides fuels that's still fuel economy.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Very good. Thank you.", "Bill Klesse", "This is much different than the 1980's and our view is that a lot because I understand the 80's but the big difference this time is versus then if you think about the 80's the government controls all kinds of thinks going on that had put a lot of bias into the business. This time what's really affected us is yes its new construction, but its been this integration of demand and that's been because of economics. So if the economies pick-up I think you'll see our volumes pick-up.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Very good. Thank you.", "Bill Klesse", "Thanks Paul.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chi Chow of Tristone Capital.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "Thanks. Hey Bill, just continuing on your thoughts there with Paul's question; I guess you may have answered this already but I have a broader question on your thoughts on the general independent refiner business model. I mean you talked at that front, excess global capacity that will likely get worse here in the near term. Unknown capital requirements related to carbon increasing our best mandates. Do you feel like long-term you need some sort of integration to the upstream or can you survive as the independent refiner for longer-term?", "Bill Klesse", "Well, I will say we can survive as an independent refiner. Sure, I'd like to lets not be foolish. I'd like to add more oil production, I mean if you give them but we don't, we're an independent refiner. In my particular case that made my entire career working for an independent refiner and so a lot of people listen to this call and so the facts are we can compete, but it is a tough business; we have to get our costs down, we have to be lean, mean and very, very efficient.", "We can't afford some of the luxuries that the integrated natures can have; we just can't afford them and that's why we're so focused and on executing things. We've been reorganized in many of our departments here in a very systematic approach. To give you an example, we just completed our planning and economics group did a complete reorganization and we took costs out of our system.", "And we continue to do that and we're going to continue to push it but you have to be lean, mean and very efficient and move quickly because that's the only way the business model can work in a highly competitive environment.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "Are you looking at possible JV opportunities with, with upstream players?", "Bill Klesse", "No.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "Sorry.", "Bill Klesse", "Go ahead.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "I guess, the other question I had was; it just seems like the capital requirements are coming in the few years or may be in next decade. You got a lot non-profit type capital where you need to spend specially on legislative tech items. How concerned are you on the returns, longer term in this business?", "Bill Klesse", "Well, I guess treat as very fine and fair approach. But all I would tell you that, that's how it always is. If you remember the Clean Air Act first in the 70's then in the 90's when it was amended. If you go back we have all that capital go in. Rich made the comment I am very against this scrubber that we're putting in Benicia. This scrubber itself is $450 million that has no return.", "And MSAT II which is the benzene that Rich mentioned, we will spend 530 million the way we're approaching it. We are actually going to make a benzene product out of this so there is some economics in there. But you are exactly right and I have some other examples, of these type of things that this is our business. But if look at our business model and you go back to 30 years into the refining business, we make around a cost to capital way to return.", "I know all the theories about how we destroy value and other things, but if you actually look at all the data, you can make a cost to capital way to return. You are not going to hear from Valero that the golden age of refining is around the corner again. We're down to the business as we as a management team know it and that is to slug it out. And that's what we're doing, but we will provide a good opportunity, things happen, we'll have some better years, and we'll have some years that aren't quite as good.", "Last year for Valero and everybody said it's going to be a terrible year. We made over $5 a share and over $2.5 billion of profit. The reason we reported losses, we run off $4 billion of goodwill that had no tax effects, which gave us the $2 share loss. But we had a good year this -- last year and this year, we beat our first quarter from last year, and I think gasoline is going to surprise. We have very low prices for gasoline on a relative basis and it does give you an opportunity to get around. So, our business adds value as long as we add value we're part of the society here.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "Okay. And one final question, you bring up California, they just adopted this low carbon fuel standard. Just the scrubber at Benicia get you to those requirements and how much more would think you need to put into California I means the state requirement?", "Bill Klesse", "I mean..... all right.", "Joe Gorder", "Well, just first on the scrubber, that is for an air quality requirements to reduce sulphur emission, so that it is separated apart from the low carbon fuel standard.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "Okay.", "Bill Klesse", "On low carbon fuel I think we need to look at the detail, there is a movement for low carbon fuels, but they have several provisions where they are talking about some of this land used and trying to go all the way back or taking land stay out of pasture and putting it in the corn and trying to calculate this. I think this is a far bigger issue; there is going to be a lot more politics involved. So this the doubles in the details on this.", "Kim Bowers", "And the most longer term picture is a 20-20 reduction, 10% by 20-20. there is still a lot of work to be done and evaluation to be done.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "Okay. Well great thanks for your thoughts Bill, I appreciate.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil", "Good morning gentlemen. I know I got in late in the call so I'll just ask my two questions here briefly if I could. The first one is on the tax rate it came in well below what we were expecting, I was wondering if you could provide any color on the key drivers there?", "And then secondly, essentially on the refinery utilization process, just trying to understand exactly how that is managed, just want to know if its based on a short-term rate of return process, in other words, a $9 or $10 Gulf Coast crack generates a sufficient rate of return. Does that prompt you to increase utilization or you taking more of longer term approach in trying to manage the inventory balance? Thanks.", "Mike Ciskowski", "Okay first place on the tax rate. We were lower than guidance that was due to on a proportional basis Aruba and Canada made a greater percentage of the income so, if there are lot of tax rate, obviously no tax in Aruba so we had came in lower on our tax rate.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil", "Okay.", "Mike Ciskowski", "The refining utilization?", "Joe Gorder", "Yeah I mean, we look at our utilization and on an ongoing basis and we have planning economics group which Bill mentioned earlier that run VLP model and we're continuously adjusting based on what the market does so, we look at the whole picture though. We look at utilization rates in the context of economics that the economic of course are affected by the inventory values and then cash requirements. So it all gets balanced, but bottom line is it's a dynamic eroding process that goes on all the time.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil", "Okay. Is that to suggest that maybe....", "Bill Klesse", "We could give you a little more. We do basically we've got almost like a three month look when you think about it. We do a monthly business plan, what we call an operations plan. That gets coordinated through all the groups; gets done before the end of the month. And there's got a lot of current pricing we make price calls just like you would make price call and we run our model, and we'll put a hurdle in there on margin. And depending on seasonality other factors and some judgment that hurdle rate can move around.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil", "Okay, that's great. Thanks a lot for color.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan with Citigroup.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Good afternoon.", "Bill Klesse", "Good afternoon.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "One question on the ethanol acquisitions do you expect those -- that acquisition to be accretive to earnings this year and how do you expect that to be going forward?", "Gene Edwards", "Based on current pricing, this is Gene Edwards, ethanol about a $1.66 probably it goes to corn and just under $3.80 of virtual. This plans our cash flow in positive right now. But we really think the real upside is probably 2010 when the RFS accept another 90,000 barrels a day or so, its really going to tighten its wide demand in further.", "And that's the assumption as we use when we're buying the plants. We figure that this year would probably more or less cash flow neutral fund deposited. Last venture is still down; but our plans to invest in advantage locations in the core build which allow us to be cash flow positive while other industry are still struggling.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. On a GAAP basis are you saying that it will be neutral or it will be a loss like....", "Mike Ciskowski", "I think its going to be a neutral. Neutral for us.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Got you. And then in your prepared remarks you guys talked about the narrowing sour differentials in the quarter versus last year? Can you us, what you guys expect going forward for the rest of this year, given the OPEC pricing to be in full effect?", "Joe Gorder", "Yeah, you know the factors and when we've got the OPEC cover the declining Maya productions we've got the weakness in the front WTI and we got relatively tight fuel our markets which have affected heavy sour discounts. So really I think, our view going forward to be that until demand grows, we're probably going to see discount stay in this general range.", "Nothing is expected to change unless we get demand back, which of course would then stimulate the runs, it would pull suite crude things stored, at the storage rates of the price there and then we would get a discount of that.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Fair enough. Thank you for the color. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jacques Rousseau with Back Bay Research, LLC.", "Jacques Rousseau - Back Bay Research, LLC", "Most of my questions have been answered just wanted to try one more. Have you got any idea of the gasoline demand for April at your 1000, how its comparing to last year?", "Mike Ciskowski", "I think its pretty much flat in April I believe the advantage is pretty much flat from the first quarter.", "Jacques Rousseau - Back Bay Research, LLC", "From the first quarter or from April 2008?", "Mike Ciskowski", "I was referring to the first quarter.", "Jacques Rousseau - Back Bay Research, LLC", "Do you have any color versus year ago?", "Mike Ciskowski", "I don't have that for April of 2008.", "Jacques Rousseau - Back Bay Research, LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Gilman with The Benchmark Company.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Hey guys, real quickly how much natural gas do you consume system wide?", "Unidentified Company Speaker", "We're using 400 now. It's when we back cast back into our energy consumption, its around 400,000 MMBtu per day of natural gas activity. But that includes all energy that's not just a natural gas but most of our energy, the power all that stuff is fired by natural gas as we think today. As well as hydrogen and steam its all basically driven also by natural gas.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Thanks Eric.", "Unidentified Company Speaker", "Sure.", "Operator", "Again we have no further questions. Mr. Smith, do you have any closing remarks.", "Ashley Smith", "We appreciate you shareholders listening to our call. If you have any questions call Investor Relations or check in with our website.

(Operator Instructions).  Mr. Smith, you may begin your conference.", "Ashley Smith", "Good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's third quarter 2009 earnings conference call.  With me today are Bill Klesse, our Chairman and CEO, Mike Ciskowski, our CFO, and other members of our executive management team.", "If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our Web site at valero.com.  Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments.  If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact me after the call.", "Before we get started, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimers contained in the press release.  In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities law.  There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our SEC filings.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike.", "Mike Ciskowski", "Thanks, Ashley, and thank you for joining us today.  As noted in the release we reported a third quarter 2009 net loss of $219 million or $0.39 per share, before the asset impairment pre-tax loss of $417 million.  Including the asset impairment loss, our GAAP result for the third quarter was a net loss of $489 million or $0.87 per share.", "The asset impairment loss related mainly to the permanent shutdown of the gas supplier complex at our Delaware City refinery which was part of an effort to simplify the refinery's operations, make it more cost efficient and improve its reliability.", "The third quarter 2009 operating loss was $579 million versus $1.8 billion of operating income in the third quarter of 2008.  Excluding the asset impairment loss from the third quarter of 2009, the operating loss was $162 million, which compares to operating income of $1.6 billion in the third quarter of 2008, excluding the $305 million gain on the sale of the Krotz Springs Refinery and $43 million of asset impairment losses.", "The key drivers of the decline in operating income were lower margins on diesel and jet fuel and smaller discounts on our sour crude oil and other feedstocks.  For example, looking at the benchmark Gulf Coast margins versus WTI, ultra low sulfur diesel margins decreased to 71% year-over-year.  Comparing the same periods, Maya discounts to WTI decreased 56%.  ", "Our third quarter refinery through-put volume averaged to 2.4 million barrels per day, which was in the range of our guidance, but 208,000 barrels per day below the third quarter of 2008.  This decrease in volume was mainly due to lower utilization rates across our refinery system and the planned shutdown of the Aruba refinery throughout the third quarter.", "With respect to our reported operating costs, I should mentioned that as described in note four to the earnings tables, the asset impairment loss amounts for all periods have been excluded from operating costs in determining operating costs per barrel resulting in an adjustment in the operating cost per barrel previously reported.  This should help clarify inter-period comparisons of our operating results.", "Refinery cash operating expenses in the third quarter of 2009 were $3.94 per barrel or $0.84 per barrel lower than our third quarter 2008 results due mostly to lower energy costs.  But our focus on other costs has also been successful.", "Comparing the first nine months of 2008 versus 2009, our refinery cash operating expenses were down more than $700 million.  As previously mentioned, much of this was due to lower energy and natural gas prices, but over $200 million was due to our ongoing efforts to reduce costs.", "Looking at our other business segments, I want to highlight that retail had an outstanding quarter with the highest ever operating income in a third quarter, at $111 million just beating the $107 million earned in the third quarter of 2008.", "This was due mainly to very good performance in both the U.S. and Canada and lower selling expenses.  Retail also set a record for the highest earnings for the first nine months of the year, with $232 million of operating income.", "Our ethanol segment also had an excellent third quarter, with $49 million of operating income, which is more than double the $22 million reported in the second quarter of the year.  The strong performance was due to all seven plants running nearly to capacity and capturing very good margins.  And October margins have continued to be favorable.", "General and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation were $167 million in the third quarter.  The increases of $44 million versus the second quarter and $32 million versus our guidance were primarily due to a $40 million increase in legal reserves.  ", "For the third quarter, total depreciation and amortization expense was $389 million which was in line with the second quarter and our guidance.  Net interest expense was $124 million which was higher than our guidance mainly due to the reduction in capitalized interest on project deferrals and cancellations.", "It was also higher than the expense of $82 million in the second quarter, primarily due to a reversal of accrued interest on a sales tax audit that settled in our favor last quarter and lower capitalized interest on the previously-mentioned project deferrals.", "The effective tax rate was 30% which is in line with our guidance.  As described in note 13 to our Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2009 we are awaiting the decision from the Netherlands Arbitration Institute regarding our dispute of a turnover tax on export sales that the government of Aruba enacted in 2007.", "If the decision is announced prior to the filing of the Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2009 and if the decision has a material impact on our third quarter 2009 financial results then we will update our earnings release to conform with our Form 10-Q filing.", "Regarding cash flows for the third quarter, capital spending was $521 million which includes $52 million of turnaround in catalyst expenditures.  For the year, capital spending is projected to be $2.7 billion.  ", "The increase from prior guidance is primarily due to accelerating certain projects into 2009 to take advantage of favorable tax treatment and the acceleration of some turnaround activity which I will discuss in a moment.  For 2010 we continue to expect total capital spending in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.  ", "With respect to our balance sheet at the end of September, total debt was $7.4 billion.  We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.6 billion and we had $4.5 billion of additional liquidity available, both similar to last quarter.", "At the end of the quarter, our debt-to-cap ratio, net of cash was 26.5% which is far below the credit facility covenant that requires a ratio below 60%.  As you can see, we continue to have a comfortable cash balance and plenty of liquidity.", "However, I think you all would agree given the loss we incurred this quarter and the expectation of another loss in the fourth quarter, we may need to evaluate our dividend-to-payout level.  As stated in our last dividend release, if industry conditions do not improve measurably, the dividend level will have to be re-evaluated.", "As to the refining outlook, low product margins and narrow sour crude discounts were the key drivers of our third quarter operating loss.  And although the feedstock discounts had rebounded recently, product margins have weakened so we expect overall throughput margins for the fourth quarter to be similar to what we experienced in the third quarter.", "In addition, this margin environment factored into our decision to advance the turnaround activities from the first quarter of 2010 to this quarter at our Wilmington and Delaware City refineries where both refineries will undergo essentially plant-wide shutdowns.", "As a result, we currently expect a loss in the fourth quarter at least as large as the third quarter loss excluding special items.  Also, in the fourth quarter, we expect to report approximately $35 million of special charges for severance costs related to our activities to improve profitability at the Delaware City and Paulsboro refineries.", "Our strategy in these conditions remains the same.  We are working to maintain our strong balance sheet and ample liquidity and focusing on matters within our control, our cost of structure and optimizing operations.  ", "Bill's quote in the press release clearly shows we're taking action and getting results.  We will continue our systematic approach to improving profitability.  Our efforts to make Valero more competitive means we should capture more earnings as the economy picks up, demand return and margins recover.", "And now I'll turn it over to Ashley to cover the earnings model assumptions.", "Ashley Smith", "For modeling our fourth quarter operation, you should expect our refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges, Gulf Coast at 1.15 million to 1.2 million barrels per day, Mid-Continent at 380,000 to 390,000 barrels per day, Northeast at 430,000 to 440,000 barrels per day and West Coast at 230,000 to 240,000 barrels per day. ", "Refinery cash operating expenses are expected to be around $4.50 per barrel which is higher than last quarter due mainly to lower throughput volumes combined with the effect of higher expected energy prices.", "Regarding our ethanol operations in the fourth quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 2.2 million gallons per day and operating expenses should average approximately $0.38 per gallon including $0.03 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization.  ", "With respect to some of the other items for the fourth quarter, we expect G&A expense excluding depreciation and amortization to be around $135 million.  Net interest expense should be around $110 million.  Total depreciation and amortization expense should be around $390 million, and we estimate a 30% effective tax rate.", "That concludes our prepared remarks.  [Latika], we will now open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions).  Your first question comes from Douglas Terreson \u2013 ISI Group.", "Douglas Terreson \u2013 ISI Group", "My question has to do with some of Mike's comment on costs and specifically how the operating actions that you guys have taken in the last couple of months are likely to affect the non-energy component of operating expenses in coming quarters or whether you feel we've already seen the majority of those benefits.", "And also, whether some of the asset reviews you guys have undertaken elsewhere in the system have uncovered significant opportunities on the cost side either operating or SG&A, and so just any update on the hope for cost improvement over the next couple of quarters would be appreciated.", "Mike Ciskowski", "Well, on a year-to-date basis on the resigning OpEx on the $200 million, a big piece of that was due to lower maintenance expenses which a lot of that is less contractors at our refineries.  The salaries, wages and benefits has also been reduced over our refining system by about $50 million and that's nine months.", "Professional fees and outside services has also been reduced by about $20 million, so a lot of little things like this that I think Rich and his organization are focusing on to reduce the cost at the refineries.", "Richard Marcogliese", "Yes, Doug, let me add a little more color onto that.  We've initiated a number of improvement activities and I would say bottom-line where we are today, we've probably taken $150 million a year of cost out of our system and it relates to a number of categories.  We're being a lot closer on prioritization of maintenance work and contractor resources, so we're working that aggressively.", "We're working non-capital related energy utilization improvements through stewardship and just tighter operations.  We're controlling plant overtime and we are also taking a look at our refineries where they are out of line with efficient staffing levels and we are implementing reduction programs.", "As was noted, we're taking out about 150 people from Delaware City and have plans to take out about 100 positions in Paulsboro, and those efforts are under way currently.  So though a lot of intense expense focus self-help kind of items, I think we feel good about eliminating about $150 million per year in cost.", "Douglas Terreson \u2013 ISI Group", "And just to clarify, that's over and above or that's already included in some of the gains you guys have made non-energy so far?", "Bill Klesse", "Yes, some of that was reflected in Mike's comments on [$100 billion].  But I would say the running rate today is about $150 million a year less.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Flannery \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Mark Flannery \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I've got two questions.  One, I guess a follow-up to what Doug was talking about.  Can you go through a little bit more of the specifics that you're doing at Paulsboro apart from eliminating 100 positions?  And is what you're doing there applicable to any other refineries?  In other words, should we expect to hear an announcement that this kind of program is rolling out to other plants in the future?  And then, I have a quick follow-up on ethanol.", "Rich Marcogliese", "Well, what I would say for one on the Paulsboro program in general, we benchmark all of our refineries first quartile metrics really in every category of performance.  And where we have determined that we are long we have generally implemented reductions.  ", "In the case of Paulsboro, it was one little larger reductions and that's why we've cited that specifically.  But we are doing this across the board at all of our plants.  But we do have a number of our plants that are already at Q1 levels and so any adjustments are more minor in nature.", "Bill Klesse", "We have made revisions at Wilmington refinery and we're looking at changes at our Three Rivers refinery, so we have the new Salomon benchmarking that the studies come out.  We have made significant improvements.  We didn't capture when we talked about the billion dollar program.  However, what has happened is because of our efforts, we haven't increased as much as many of our others relative to EDC.  ", "And so we've gotten about a half a billion dollars of improvements relative to our competition and now we're basically a Tier II refinery in many of these categories where I've mentioned several times in the past     we're a Tier III or IV.  So our group has been making progress on all of these.  ", "Other items we continue and have done.  We've saved $3 million on security guards.  We consolidated accounts payable.  We are consolidating and in the process of doing work in IT, our IS organization, which will save us $10 million to $15 million.  ", "We've outsourced medical claim filing which has saved us $10 million to $15 million, and we have numerous items like that in initiatives going on throughout our company here to get our costs much better aligned for a more competitive environment.", "Mark Flannery \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And maybe I could just ask on ethanol, you've made a lot of money in ethanol.  It's a relatively new business for you.  Do you have any idea of why the ethanol margins are so strong right now?  It seems a little counterintuitive to underlying demand for gasoline and the rest of it.  Do you expect this to continue through the fourth quarter or soften up?", "Gene Edwards", "Yes, we're seeing demand.  We seeing ethanol demand ramp up.  It's gotten up to about $2.20 a gallon in the East Coast right now.  I think partly it's just the stronger crude prices and gasoline leading it up.  But actually ethanol is up more than gasoline.", "When you get the blender's credit, it's still possible to blend.  We're seeing ethanol in about a little over 80% of the gasoline in the United States right now.  And then there's the RFS ramps up again next year, another \u2013 this year, I think 685,000 barrels a day and next year goes to 785,000 barrels a day.", "So I think there's just continued demand for ethanol and we still have a number of plants that are still shut down from the crisis they were in late last year when we bought the plants.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Roger Read \u2013 Natixis Bleichroeder.", "Roger Read \u2013 Natixis Bleichroeder", "Kind of following up on the ethanol question there, obviously runs full out for you in the quarter.  There's some excess capacity out there.  What do you all see as the next step for ethanol?  Do you invest more in it?  Do you just sort of sit where you are?  What are the options here?", "Gene Edwards", "Well, we're looking at some other options right now but obviously with the margins improving \u2013 a lot of those plants are even in bankruptcy.  Everybody's trying to hang on a little longer to try to ride it out, until they get the plants running again.  The other factor I failed to mention, too, is Brazilian ethanol is very tight.  It's like $2.20 a gallon.  It's above New York, so there have virtually been no imports into our market in the past few months.", "Bill Klesse", "I think if you're asking us a little more strategically, the business has worked out for us very well.  Gene's group had purchased these assets earlier in the year.  Obviously, it's worked out.  And so as we look at the business, we feel very strongly that ethanol is going to be part of the fuel mix going forward.", "And so we'll continue to look for, what I've said in the past, things that we can add on to this core business.  We have a significant stake.  We can make 50,000, 51,000 barrels a day of ethanol and I think you'll see us try to do little add-on niche plays here along with it.", "We've also announced a joint venture with Darling on biodiesel, at least a letter of intent, and we're working on that, to put in at St. Charles Refinery in New Orleans.  And so we see all these alternatives being part of the mix.  And you'll see us to continue to add to this business, but prudently.", "Roger Read \u2013 Natixis Bleichroeder", "And kind of following along there, there's a lot of talk here along the Gulf Coast of using I guess it's algae to essentially make ethanol.  Have you done anything or looked at anything significantly along that line?", "Gene Edwards", "Yes, we have partnership in a project there.  It's with Solix and we've got some money into that project.  It's small capital at this point, but it's a development project.  Algae has a lot of potential because you can grow so much per acre of land and you don't even have to have fertile land to grow it.  So I think there is a lot of potential.  But I do think it's years away as far as any commercial type application as far as big volume.", "Bill Klesse", "Yields can be very high and it can be a CO2 sink.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I had a question whether or not there's any update on potential asset sales?  You've been clear over time those assets you might be sellers of and, if buyer interest is improving, as some stories suggest?  I mean \u2013 and what do you believe will be the primary logjam in selling an asset?  I mean is it price, lack of buyer, challenging environment, all of the above?  And I have a follow-up.", "Gene Edwards", "This is Gene again.  It is a buyer's market today.  Obviously the margin's down.

Okay.  Well, you know the markets for sour crude are still in tight supply.  And I think that we've seen that OPEC compliance here of late isn't as strict as it was earlier in the year.", "We've also had a flattening of the forward curve for WTI which has brought the front end prices up a bit which have helped increase the discounts.

In the \u2013 after all this initiative on the cost reduction and shut down of some units, how long you need to take it for you to get a reasonable period of observation to decide whether those two ultimately that may need to follow the footprint of Aruba being shut down.

In Delaware we're going to have to do a turnaround in the cat cracker and that's scheduled to start about mid-month in November and run for almost 60 days.

We'll see what the sour crudes discounts \u2013because remember, we've shut the coker down but the plant tends to be close to a heavy sour refinery more heavy than just the medium sour.  So we'll look at it over the next several of months and we're also seeing what other alternatives are out there.  ", "But this takes time and it's also dependent on the crack.  As I answered Mark earlier, even in Aruba where we shut down at a gross margin level, it has moved around so that there would have been a contribution in one or two of the months.  Then in the other months it was beneficial to stay down and for the whole quarter it was beneficial to stay down.  ", "So we'll see how this develops over the next several months.  Inventories are getting better.  If you look at the distillates, if you look at gasoline inventory relative to demand, these items all are looking to us much better.

But if you think historically what shuts down a refinery, you tend to run at a neutral cash margin by adjusting your operating rate at what I'll call a sophisticated refinery.  Aruba tends to be a little different.  But in a sophisticated refinery you're balanced to an operating rate and then capital spending becomes the determinant here and if a large capital spending is required going forward that tends to push refineries into a shutdown situation or at least some form of rationalization.", "What we have at Delaware City is we've tried to run this gasifier and that has affected the entire reliability of the operation because it produces steam as well as power.  And when we've had upsets we've gotten into a steam imbalance which then causes the reliability of the refinery to be a problem.", "With low natural gas prices there's really little incentive to try to run this coke gasifier and that's why we elected to shut it down.  We made a judgment that we're going to have relatively low natural gas prices for several years and that was the decision.

Valero's invested a lot of money there over the years.  Our people are doing are doing a very fine job on reliability you'd notice that the plant runs very, very well.  But lube margins are very depressed and historically lubes have been a significant contributor to that performance.  ", "So again and I know you guys are thinking, well, we're just waiting for the economy and that's not true because we're attacking cost structure.  But at the end of the day we sell fuels we sell petrochemicals and in the case of Paulsboro we sell lubes.

Is that off the agreement already expired?", "Bill Klesse", "", "No, the agreement has not and that goes through 2017.  And but there are options around the lube operation, in other words, Valero couldn't \u2013 can make economic decisions but then under the agreement with ExxonMobil we have to provide certain services for ExxonMobil because they have their operation there across the street from a refinery so you come through the dock.", "But historically it's a 10,000 barrel a day business but it's had very good margins.  This is a Group I lube and even though there's been plants shut down Group I lube plants shut down, the facts are that the margins over the years have been just excellent.

We have looked to buy residual fuels on a wholesale level.  We've run them to capacity at our coker at Texas City.  And actually Texas City has the best coking economics because it has a lot of hydro-processing capacity.  So we're beginning to see it and we are responding to it but I would say we're still a ways away for filling up all of our coker capacity which is why at Delaware City that large fluid coker will remain down.", "Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil", "", "And Rich just to confirm, you take a longer term approach on that or a view three or four month kind of outlook before you begin to aggressively attack it, is that correct?", "Richard Marcogliese", "", "Well, I mean we review our economics on a monthly basis for kind of marginal throughput on the Coker's that are remaining in service.  Now for something like Delaware City we would take a longer view probably several months to see if we've got the market structure which would support reactivating the unit.  As Bill mentioned this is probably going to be something that we will re-evaluate in the spring.", "Gene Edwards", "And Blake just to elaborate a little bit, we're buying feeds well in advance and so you've got to be fairly certain that you've got a decent margin before you're going to go buy feeds to fill the cokers.", "Richard Marcogliese", "And I mean that is a good point on the Delaware City operation in its current configuration, we're running a lighter crude slate.  And so a decision to restart the coker we've got to plan probably a month to two months in advance to put the right heavy crudes in front of it.  So it ends up being a bigger decision.", "Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil", "That's helpful, thanks.  The only other one I had, I just wanted to get confirmation.  Bill, is it fair to say that you guys are still evaluating acquisition opportunities internationally with distillate leverage?", "Bill Klesse", "", "Absolutely, and on acquisitions we're going to continue to look both internationally as well as here in the U.S. on things that we believe would add value.

", "Mark Gilman \u2013 The Benchmark Company", "", "Can you put some specifics on that, Mike?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Well, I mean I don't have the exact number.  We're evaluating different operating plans.  Our LIFO barrels are down \u2013were down at the end of September about 4 million barrels from our LIFO base.  And so it's a complicated calculation determining what the book loss is because it depends on which products are down, but we are evaluating that at this particular time.  But it looks like we will have a decrement that will result in a loss.", "Mark Gilman \u2013 The Benchmark Company", "So that becomes part of the year-end balance sheet picture then?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Yes, that's correct.", "Mark Gilman \u2013 The Benchmark Company", "Bill, you just made a comment regarding you don't want to use reformers to generate hydrogen.  I understand what you're saying in terms of natural gas, but isn't it correct that hydrogen's basically a by-product of the reforming process?", "Bill Klesse", "Well, it is but it depends on the severity.  Today octane you just don't need octane.  If you think about ethanol, it's got such high octane the world has changed dramatically here in the need for octane.  So as you increase your severity in a reformer because you want octane you make hydrogen.  So now if you're in a situation, for instance, Delaware City, we do \u2013 we have a small hydrogen plant?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Yes.", "Bill Klesse", "We have a small hydrogen plant there but we need additional hydrogen at Delaware City so we have to run the reformers at higher severity to make hydrogen so you're exactly right, Mark.  In historical perspective hydrogen's a by-product of reforming but when you have to make hydrogen on purpose at these plants the cost numbers are phenomenal and if you think about our Quebec operation, which has no hydrogen plant and generates hydrogen from its reforming.", "At the McKee refinery there's no hydrogen plant.  You generate hydrogen from reforming and you go through.  There's a couple other situations.  You, as all our competitors \u2013 so this isn't going to be rocket science to anybody and all of the guys listening on the phone they know the same thing we know that today reforming has changed tremendously and if you're having on-purpose hydrogen it is costing you a lot when you have $80 crude oil versus $4 to $5 natural gas.", "Mark Gilman \u2013 The Benchmark Company", "", "Okay, Bill, I follow now.  Just one other one, going back to your comments regarding he 2010 capital program, are there other elements of that 2.0 to 2.5 that would be considered non-discretionary over and above the scrubber and the [MSAT]?", "Richard Marcogliese", "Sure, I meant this will be just a general comment.  Turnarounds and catalyst workload is anywhere between $500 million and $600 million on an annual basis and you don't have a lot of discretion on that.  You have some discretion on timing, but that represents what the average is.", "I think environmental capital for the reasons Bill mentioned, [MSAT2] we also have flare gas recovery.  We have got NOX control investments to do.  That is going to be of the order of about $600 million on an annual basis, on a running rate.  Safety projects will be on the order of $100 million so when we actually look at how low could this number go in the next couple of years it doesn't get much below $1.8 billion.", "Mike Ciskowski", "And Mark, I just did want to add, clarify one thing, you did talk about \u2013 we talked a little bit about the decrement and the cases that we've ran and the impact on the balance sheet, but the cases that we've ran will not result in a material change to our balance sheet as that would increase our debt-to-cap in a big way.  So it's not material from that perspective.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time.", "Ashley Smith", "", "Thank you for listening to our call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. Mr. Smith, you may begin your conference.", " ", "Ashley Smith", "Good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. With me today are Bill Klesse, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Ciskowski, our CFO; Rich Marcogliese, our COO; Gene Edwards, our Executive Vice President of Corporate Development and Strategic Planning; and Joe Gorder our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Supply as well as Kim Bowers, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel. ", "If you have not received the earnings release, and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at Valero.com. Also, attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, feel free to contact me after the call. ", "Before we get started, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we described in our filings with the SEC. ", "Now I'll turn the call over to Mike. ", "Mike Ciskowski", "Thanks, Ashley, and thank you for joining us today. As noted in the release, we reported a fourth quarter 2009 loss from the continuing operations of $155 million or $0.28 per share. This number excludes the $7 million in after-tax costs for severance and early retirement at the Paulsboro refinery and $20 million in after-tax asset impairment losses. Our GAAP results for the fourth quarter was a loss from continuing operations of $182 million or $0.32 per share. ", "I should note that the loss from discontinued operations shown in the financial tables relates to the Delaware City assets that were shut down in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, the $1.2 billion after-tax charge consists of $66 million operating loss after taxes and an asset impairment and other shutdown charges of $1.1 billion after tax. ", "The fourth quarter 2009 operating loss was $179 million, excluding the special items already noted, versus $1.3 billion of operating income in the fourth quarter of 2008, which excludes the goodwill impairment taking last year. The key drivers of the decline in operating income was smaller discounts on sour crude oil and other feed stocks combined with lower margins on diesel and jet fuel. To put the smaller discounts in perspective, Maya discounts versus WTI decreased 50% year-over-year. Comparing the same periods for benchmark gold coast margins versus WTI, the ULSD margins decreased 66% year-over-year. ", "Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was the unfavorable effect from a year-end LIFO detriment of $66 million before taxes in 2009 versus a favorable effect from a LIFO increment of $327 million before taxes in 2008. The fourth quarter refinery throughput volume averaged at 2.1 million barrels per day which is inline with our guidance since Delaware City is a 113,000 barrels per day of throughput is excluded. However, fourth quarter 2009 volumes from continuing operations were 371,000 barrels per day below the fourth quarter of 2008, mainly due to lower utilization rates across our refinery systems caused by lower demand, planned downtime for maintenance at our Wilmington and Paulsboro refineries and the continued to idle status of our lubber requirement.", "Refinery cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $4.03 per barrel or $0.16 per barrel lower than the fourth quarter 2008 results due mostly to lower energy costs, but our focus on other cost reductions has also been successful. Comparing to full year 2008 versus 2009, our refinery operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization were down $900 million. Much of this was due to lower energy and natural gas prices, but we estimate more than $215 million was due to our aggressive cost reduction efforts. ", "Looking at our other business segments, retail has continued to produce strong results with operating income in the fourth quarter of 2009 at $61 million, which is less, though, than the $163 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, mainly due to lower fuel margins in the US, which were partially offset by lower selling expenses. ", "For the full year 2009, retail earned at $293 million of operating income, making it the second best year for retail. Our ethanol segment had an excellent fourth quarter with $94 million of operating income, which is nearly, double the $49 million reported in the third quarter of 2009. The continued strong performance was due to higher margin and increased production volumes from the prior quarter. ", "Our timing with the initial acquisition could not have been better. In less than three quarters of operation, the initial seven ethanol plants have earned $165 million in operating income, and had yield an impressive returns on the $477 million purchase price. ", "General and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation were $137 million in the fourth quarter which was $30 million lower than the third quarter and in line with our guidance. ", "For the fourth quarter, total depreciation and amortization expense was $356 million, which was lower than our guidance of $390 million, mainly due to the reclassification of the Delaware City refinery in to discontinued operations. Net interest expense was $113 million, which was in line with your guidance, but down from the third quarter due to lower interest expense on several tax matters. The effective tax rate benefit on continued operations in the fourth quarter was 39.5%, which was higher than our guidance. ", "In the fourth quarter, we had a loss, which means an increase in the tax rate is a benefit. The increase in the tax rate benefit resulted from a gain on the liquidation of Aruba inventory, which is not taxed. The gain lowered our consolidated loss, but because it is non-taxed, it increased the tax rate benefit. In addition, Congress passed the law in November 2009, allowing companies to carry back 2009 losses five years instead of two years. Carrying back to five years to 2004 enabled us to reduce certain recaptured tax items, such as the section 199 manufacturing deduction, and this also resulted in additional favorable tax rate benefits. ", "Regarding cash flows for the fourth quarter, capital spending was $600 million, which includes $114 million of turnaround and catalyst expenditures. For the year, capital spending was $2.7 billion which is a sizable decrease of nearly $600 million, when compared to 2008. ", "With respect to our balance sheet at the end of December, total debt was $7.4 billion, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $825 million, and we had over $4 billion of additional liquidity available. In addition to this existing liquidity, as previously mentioned, the 2009 net operating loss for taxes can be carried back up to five years to offset previously paid taxes. This will allow Valero to claim a sizable tax refund that we expect to receive in the second quarter of 2010. ", "At the end of 2009, our debt to cap ratio net of cash was 31%, which is far below the credit facility covenant that requires a ratio below 60%. In addition, we do not have any covenants with coverage-type ratios. ", "When you look back on 2009, it was clearly a very challenging year for the refining industry and Valero. Refined product demand, shrink in the face of the deep recession, driving down margins and discounts in a very competitive environment. Given these conditions, we took action and reduced costs, we cut capital spending, and we shut down plants that were dragging down our profitability. ", "We also stepped up and made a significant investment to enter the ethanol industry by buying seven plants out of bankruptcy at 30% of replacement costs. The returns have been outstanding so far, and we recently acquired two more plants and expect to close on a third plant this quarter. ", "The consensus industry outlook shows that 2010 will be another difficult year for refining margins and discounts. However, the strategic actions we have taken should enable to be profitable in 2010, even if we have another year of low margins like 2009. But due to the poor conditions and uncertainty of our industry, a high priority of Valero will be to maintain our financial strength in 2010. As part of this effort, we reduced our capital spending budget to $2 billion, which is a $700 million reduction from 2009 spending, and we reduced our dividend rate. ", "Throughout our system, we will continue to reduce costs, optimize our operations, and upgrade our portfolio of assets to improve our competitiveness. So far in 2010, we have had a couple of positive items to announce. Last week we agreed with the government of Aruba on a framework for a stable tax structure. The agreement will become effective upon approval by the Aruba parliament and other Aruba authorities. ", "The framework once fully effective is expected to resolve all prior tax disputes with the payment of $111 million, which was previously reserved in the third quarter of 2009. The $111 million payment is fully escrowed as restricted cash, separate from our year-end cash balance of $825 million. The framework will also effectively tax income at a rate of less than 10%, with an annual minimum tax payment of $10 million beginning mid-2012. We believe this structure has the potential to enhance Valero's strategic alternatives for the refinery and provide certainty as Valero's tax (inaudible) was set to expire at the end of this year. ", "In addition, we announced last week that we are in advanced negotiations to sell the shutdown refineries and terminal operations in Delaware City. Our discussions are ongoing, so I cannot provide more details at that point, but we will keep you informed when we finalize the terms. ", "Now I'll turn it over to Ashley to cover the earnings model (inaudible).", "Ashley Smith", "Thanks Mike. Modeling our first quarter operations, you should expect refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges. The Gulf Coast should be at 1.1 million to 1.15 million barrels per day. Mid-continent should be at 360,000, to 370,000 barrels per day. The Northeast should be at 340,000 to 350,000 barrels per day, and the West Coast should be at 260,000 to 270,000 barrels per day. Refinery cash operating expenses are expected to be around $4.45 per barrel, which is higher than last quarter due mainly to lower throughput volumes combined with slightly higher expected energy catalyst and chemical costs. ", "Regarding our ethanol operations in the first quarter, we expect total throughput volume of 2.4 million gallons per day, and operating expenses should average approximately $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.03 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. With respect to some of the other items for the first quarter, we expect G&A expense excluding depreciation, to be around $135 million, net interest expense should be around $115 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense should be around $365 million. ", "Regarding our tax rate, in this margin environment, small changes in assumptions are yielding a very wide range of results for the effective tax rate, so at this point we would prefer not to provide guidance, which may not prove to be meaningful. We will now open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from Paul Cheng.", "Paul Cheng", "You indicated what's just LIFO loss in the quarter. Is there any trading profit offsetting that loss or more than offset that loss in the quarter?", "Mike Ciskowski", "", "No, in the fourth quarter, we had about a $40 million loss on our trading operations.", "Paul Cheng", "You actually have a loss in trading?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Small loss, yes.", "Paul Cheng", "Okay. In the trading loss, I presume that in the LIFO loss, you are being spread according to all different region, based on the throughput level. How about on the trading loss? Where did we see it in the result?", "Mike Ciskowski", "It's also spread the same way, Paul.", "Paul Cheng", "Okay. So, does it have a reduction to the margin?", "", "Mike Ciskowski", "That would be correct.", "Paul Cheng", "Okay. On the special item, you have an asset impairment charge of $32 million, what projects does that relate to?", "Mike Ciskowski", "$32 million. Well, primarily it's related to the Port Arthur coking project. And that's about $30 million of it.", "Paul Cheng", "Okay. Just actually, out of curiosity, with your dividend, I understand why you cut it, but why only cut it to $0.05? Why not all the way that cut it down to zero? I mean from the shareholder standpoint whether you have that $0.05 or not doesn't really matter. Why don't we just do a more clean cut? Is there any particular rationale behind?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Obviously 2009 was a challenging year for us, and 2010 looks challenging also. We felt like, though that we needed to maintain some level of dividend to attract all potential investors, but we also wanted to cut it to a level that we felt was sustainable through the trough if you will and so we came out at this $0.05 per share.", "Paul Cheng", "Okay. Mike, can you tell us that what is the current carrying cost still on your book for Aruba? If that's anything on the diversity and also in (inaudible) including both the refinery and the terminal and the storage capacity?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Yeah, the book value?", "Paul Cheng", "Yep.", "Mike Ciskowski", "Okay. The billion dollars on Aruba.", "Paul Cheng", "Aruba is $1 billion? ", "Mike Ciskowski", "Yes, it is. Okay. And then on Paulsboro, it's $1.3 billion then on Del City, about $150 million.", "Paul Cheng", "Okay. Assume that Delaware City is all just related to the storage facility and all that? Its nothing to do with he refining [Multiple Speakers]", "Mike Ciskowski", "We have a little value, scrap value, if you will for the refinery, and we have a value for platinum too.", "Paul Cheng", "I see [Multiple Speakers]. Is that the kind of information that you guys will share in terms of the storage capacity that in those three regions, those three facilities, Delaware City, Paulsboro and Aruba what is on the site?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Paul, I'll tell you what, I guess to answer the question and I won't do it directly, but we look at this, we've got to look at it from a terminal perspective, rather than from an operating refinery perspective and so I really can't tell you right now, what the working capacity would be for both of those plants as terminals.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons", "Dietert with Simmons. The way you've reported the full year '09 numbers in the back with Del City as discontinued operations, you've got $55 million of continuing operations excluding special items. So that adjust for Del City, I would assume that with your targeted operating cost, we could add some improvement from cost savings as well. You've got a full year of ethanol, and I was curious what you expect full-year volumes to be in the ethanol segment?", "Mike Ciskowski", "It's up around 2.8 million gallons per day if you kind of look at our existing seven plus our time frame for getting these new plants on track, around 2.8 million gallons per day.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons", "Okay. So there is an incremental positive influence from a full year of ethanol, cost savings. Aruba, I assume was profitable in 1Q '09 and probably not profitable thereafter. Is Aruba profitability going to be meaningfully different in 2010 from 2009? What would that adjustment look like?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Well, I tell you what we know if the show was running today, it would not be profitable. Okay? I mean, you've got a combination of factors Jeff. You have got the heavy sour discounts being where they are. You've got the kind of weak desolate cracks where they are, you know, VGO certainly comes in to play in this and VGO profits come off. So it wouldn\u2019t be profitable running today. So, I would say our plan going forward for the rest of the year until it looked like it was profitable we wouldn't have any plans to start it up.", "Ashley Smith", "I might point out, Jeff though that, in 2010 we continue to depreciate Aruba, and so that is non-cash obviously, but that's going to show up as a loss, and then we have also agreed to pay the salaries, wages, and benefits until June of the employees, and so obviously that's going to show up as expense. And so, here in the first part of the year, you will see some loss associated with Aruba.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons", "Was Aruba a net positive or net negative contributor to net income in 2009? For the full year?", "Mike Ciskowski", "For the full year they are operating income would have been about $130 million loss.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons", "Now as far as inventory at Aruba, Paulsboro and Dell City, can you summarize what inventory you're currently holding at those three plants?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "We're liquidating the inventories at Aruba and Del City, okay? And I'm not sure exactly what the numbers are there today. I think we estimated it by the end of the month for example, Del City would be done at three million barrels from a six million barrels where we were at then of the year and Aruba is going to be almost zero, Jeff. And Paulsboro, we're still operating as a going concern and so there shouldn\u2019t be any change in the inventories there.", "Ashley Smith", "And Jeff, I didn't mention that in my comments, but I mean obviously that is going to add to our liquidity sources. So we're going to get this cash from the inventory.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons", "Yeah, that's what I'm trying to make sure I capture in my expectations. Very helpful on comments. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "A bit of a strategic question, I want to ask divestitures and I understand your hesitancy to comment on Del City in negotiation, but would it be right to think that there could be a potential linkage between Delaware City as a terminal and a potential Paulsboro sale?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Well, we are working the Del City process as we described earlier, and we're also launching a separate process for Paulsboro going forward, which will probably start with the initial bids in the February timeframe\u00a0and we'll just go from there as far as the actual closing date.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Is there any political support or kind of open issues from the Delaware side that could facilitate a Delaware transaction in an effort to save jobs or of the like?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Yes, that's correct.", " Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. If I follow up on Jeff's line of question and in to your comments, this is more to your statement about assuming whether refining margins in '09, that you'll be profitable in '10. That\u2019s primarily driven on ethanol year-over-year kind of at the levels you talked about. He can assist you in the margin; give you close to over $100 million correct? And that also I think seems cost control and tax, I mean those are the three elements that support that assertion on the same year-over-year margins that is correct? ", " ", "Ashley Smith", "", "That's correct. I mean, yeah if you take 2009, in fact if you look at the reconciliation table on page five of our earnings table, we have kind of a 2009 excluding the special items at $55 million. Right now, we don\u2019t expect the LIFO implement for 2010 and so add that back after tax after you $43 million. That cost us $100 million cost reduction to our may have mentioned in the press release. After tax it's around $60 - $65 million. And then if you just gross up for full year based on like 2.8 million gallons per day, reflective to capacity, just go look at what kind of operating income margins we've achieved for 2009 well over $100 million of potential drop in 2010 and that's just using 2009 price set. ", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "The stable tax structure when executed, the clarification tax holiday and liability. I mean is that a gain item in kind of your opinion on any potential disposition to the asset? And was that\u2026", "Ashley Smith", "Having a stable tax arrangement with Aruba going forward since the refinery has shut down here, what's happening in 2010 as far as tax structure is not that important. But going forward, the agreement we have with Aruba is for 20 years. So, it absolutely makes for both Aruba and for us, gives us optionality here as we look for the proper transaction for that facility.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from Mark Gilman from Benchmark Company. ", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "What was the cost in 4Q and full year purchasing rents? And can we assume that terminal blending limitations would argue to purchase versus buying ethanol and blending it? And what do you expect the cost and volume to be in 2010 of purchase return assuming no change in government regulations. ", "Mike Ciskowski", "$11 million. Okay. Fourth quarter was $11 million. For the year it was just under $75 million. And I would say our budget for 2010 is probably $140 million. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Alexander Inkster from Sanford and Bernstein.", "Alexander Inkster - Sanford Bernstein", "Another strategic question here. I was wondering, given the strong performance of the ethanol business so far, are you planning to continue expanding that business or was it really opportunistic and you are happy with the size of the business as it is?", "Mike Ciskowski", "", "We are very pleased with the business class, we are very pleased with the ethanol business and up to the specific, what we expanded is exactly the same as we said before. We get nice [bolt on] opportunities here to buy quality assets at below what we consider below (inaudible) cost that fit in with the network we built. Yes, we'll look at acquiring and adding to more to this business. ", "Ashley Smith", "This is Ashley, I'd like to change. I do not expect us to spend a $140 million in 2010 on rent. The issue we get into is what is the price of a rent and its not that high as the number that Joe gave you for the budget as it is today. So, I would expect us to manage this and we will not spend that much money. It's very hard though for us to give you a number that really has to deal with price of rent. But the budget Joe gave you is $140 million but I do not expect us to spend that much for rent. Is there anything else, because we can't hear you? ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Doug Terreson with ISI. ", "Doug Terreson - ISI", "Most of the recent portfolio management activities and discussion for Valero have involved divestitures and closures and I realize that those are appropriate at this point in the cycle in a lot of cases but at the same time over the past couple of industry cycles in refining in today and ethanol, you guys have made a variety of acquisitions during pretty challenging industry periods, many of which led to value creation for shareholders as we all know. So my question is how do you feel about acquisitions today? That is are they even a consideration and if so, are the geographical or functional emphasis that make sense for the company and if so where are they and I am just talking about in the refining space.", "Bill Klesse", "This is Klesse. Your comment is exactly right. The difference though in this environment as we see it with alternate and renewable fuels taking gasoline market share also, with changes that are long term, we believe that the industry has to rationalize and consolidate here and this would be true both in Europe as well as North America and you are seeing examples happening right now in both places. So, having said that, we'll take one million to two million barrels a day long in both places of earning capacity. Now, at the same time we have a portfolio of refineries and we are always interested in improving our portfolio and so we can change into look at refineries that come on the market primarily we look in Europe and here in the North America. So you can see us continue to look. We're very careful. We want to be sure we are improving our portfolio, enhance shareholder value in the long run.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons", "A question for Joe, the West Coast has been soft so far in January and we're continuing to see imports of gasoline into the West Coast. Could you talk a little bit about the dynamics that are impacting the West Coast margin so far in this quarter?", "Mike Ciskowski", "", "Well, Jeff, I mean I think if you look at the margins being weak right now, as much as this is kind of a preparation for the transition from winter grade to summer grade. You look at prompt margins there might be eight plus out there right now. They are 12 in February. So, I think that\u2019s really what we're seeing. Demand isn\u2019t strong there just as its not strong anywhere else. I think what we are seeing in the marketplace is more that than anything. ", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons", "And when do you shift from winter grade to summer grade and when is the requirement and when do you actually start making that shift?", "Mike Ciskowski", "February in the south and March 1, in the north. So, LA in February and San Francisco in March. ", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons", "And it looks as though desolate between the Gulf Coast and Europe has gone negative after a number of months of being positive. Could you talk about your desolate exports out of the Gulf Coast in both Europe and Latin America?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Sure. You are right. The (inaudible) is closed today probably by about $0.02 and we have seen a reduction in our exports from the Gulf Coast to Europe. We've got some of that volume turned up, those barrels continue to move but all the spot barrels aren\u2019t. What we are seeing Jeff now, a bit more demand out of South America. I mean Peru and Chile are both taking barrels and so barrels that were previously moved into Europe are now headed south. Our export volumes will be down from where they were in December and last year. ", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons", "Okay. How significant a loss?", "Mike Ciskowski", "I would tell you if we were doing 15 to 20 a month last year, we're probably going to do 10 in January, cargos.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "It seems to me that you are more or less calling the bottom on U.S. refining here with your statements about the potential for profits in 2010 at least from your own point of view, a bottom. Going back to a couple of the regional questions we had. You pretty much lost money in every region here. How do you expect the regional dynamics of U.S. refining to play out? Are there any areas? Given that your profit view is based on a total corporate level. I was just wondering if there is any regions where you expect things to be relatively better or worse over the course of 2010? Thanks.", " ", "Gene Edwards", "Paul, this is Gene Edwards. I think when we look at, it's our world economy and everything is tied together. So I don't really see one area really doing much different than the other on a relative basis in 2009. So, the discounts are a little bit better in the mid-continent and you get a little bit better margin there but\u2026", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "I mean I guess what I was driving at is the shutdowns on the East Coast. Obviously there is different dynamics, is there a region where you've seeing more shutdowns on the East Coast. I was wondering whether you saw the potential unit for a bigger bounce on the East Coast, whether you are more focused on demand recovery on the West Coast or as you just mentioned some subtleties in the mid-con. Anything you could add about regional color would be great.", " ", "Gene Edwards", "Well the East Coast is influenced by imports. The refinery shutdown there I mean it's really just a small percentage overall demand there so usually the imports just kind of rebound the equation and we've seen East Coast raising above the Gulf at least. I remember years where the East Coast is actually negatively gulfed. So maybe there is a little improvement but I think we actually saw that all last year with the East Coast is a little bit over the Gulf too. So, imports are down, European economics are bad with (inaudible) of cracks over there. So we are seeing less imports than we saw last year, and last year, imports were down for the prior year. So that\u2019s all helped to rebalance the equation as well. But all in all, I think you know its kind of the world dynamics are kind of what determined the cracks in each region, and unless you are in a real true niche area, you kind of just rebalance in it, (inaudible) of fluctuations, but overall we have a big change from\u2026", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Yeah great Gene thanks. This might well be a follow-up question for you. Given again that you are effectively saying that we've certainly seeing the bottom of assuming the '09 margins are about as bad as things can get. Would the portfolio rationalization program be limited now just to the ones that we know about in terms of some sort of action on Aruba, falls for it [does if you] obviously handled. Do you think beyond that now, the portfolio is as the portfolio would be for Valero on the disposable rationalization front? Thanks.", "Gene Edwards", "Yeah, I think that's all we see doing right now. I think after you have the discontinued ops in the rest of our portfolio, it looks pretty good until last year, and even with low margin environment, we think we've got refineries (inaudible). We still have got a couple of other refineries that didn't do as well last year, but we have plans to improve those operations through some minor things we're doing to the turnaround of 15 [indiscernible] we're doing like in Memphis and St. Charles that we're going to put those refineries back in the block as well.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Right. When do you think you'll get a resolution on Paulsboro? I mean would you expect the Delaware City type outcome as the ultimate way of handling that?", "Gene Edwards", "", "Well we think it's a viable refinery that can be sold as it instead of a shutdown operationally Delaware City was, and we think we've got some interested parties. So we'll just add data how it plays out. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from Ann Kohler from Caris. ", "Ann Kohler - Caris", "Good morning gentlemen. Could you just give a little bit of color on what you saw in terms of same store sales in terms of volumes as well as merchandise on at your retail operations here in the U.S. as well as in Canada for the quarter?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Okay. In the US fourth quarter of 2008 versus 2009 and this is on a same store basis. Our gas was down about 4.7%. Diesel was up about 5.4% and in total it was like down, total fuel was 3.7%. On the inside sales we were up quarter-over-quarter 1.7% and that\u2019s in the U.S. In Canada, Ann, I don\u2019t have those volumes here with me. We'll have to get those to you.", "Ann Kohler - Caris", "And do you have any color regarding turnarounds for either the quarter or for the year?", "Rich Marcogliese", "Sure. This is Rich Marcogliese. We have a pretty significant turnaround activity here in the first quarter. The (inaudible), cat cracker and healthy units are down. Currently this is going to be about a 37 day outage. In February, we have a planned turnaround at the same St. Charles prudent cohort that\u2019s based upon the overall economics of running the plant. Its is going to be a plant wide shutdown. We're going to take the opportunity to make some cat cracker repairs at the same time. Following that we will take the Memphis cat cracker down in March for a 45 day turnaround. This will provide an opportunity to do a large revamp project, over $200 million on this cat cracker which actually is one of our strategic projects, should increase operating income at Memphis over $100 million a year and then finally in the first quarter we have a hydro cracker outage Corpus Christi in March for 18. Beyond first quarter, then turnaround activity will subside but then it ramps up again in the fourth quarter and the main activity there will be the (inaudible) refinery plant wise turnaround which is scheduled for November.", "Operator", "At this time there are no further question.", "Ashley Smith", "", "I just want to thank our shareholders for calling and listening to the call.

Good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation\u2019s first quarter 2010 earnings conference call. With me today are Bill Klesse, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Ciskowski our CFO; Rich Marcogliese our COO; Gene Edward ,our Executive Vice President of Corporate Development and Strategic Planning; Joe Gorder, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Supply and Kim Bowers our Executive Vice President and General Counsel.", "If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com, also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables please feel free to contact me after the call.", "Before we get started, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. in summary it says that: statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under Federal Securities Laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.", "Now I will turn the call over to Mike.", "Mike Ciskowski", "Thanks Ashley and thank you for joining us today. As noted in the release we reported a first quarter 2010 loss from continuing operations of $101 million or $0.18 per share. I should note that the $12 million aftertax loss from discontinued operations shown in the financials tables relates to the Delaware City assets that were shut down in the fourth quarter. The first quarter 2010 operating loss was $32 million versus $593 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2009. The decline in operating income was mainly due to lower margins on most of our refined products in all four of our operating regions.", "Looking at our highest volume region, Benchmark Gulf Coast, ultralow sulfur diesel margins versus WTI decreased 41% from $12.61 per barrel in the first quarter of 2009 to $7.49 per barrel in the first quarter of 2010. While Gulf Coast gasoline margins versus WTI decreased 12% from $8.14 per barrel in the first quarter of 2009 to $7.13 per barrel in the first quarter of 2010.", "The hardest hit region was the West Coast where gasoline margins versus WTI fell 45% and diesel margins versus WTI fell 38% in the first quarter of 2010 when compared to the first quarter of the last year. So far in April, margins have improved versus the first quarter in most of our regions, for example the Gulf Coast ultralow sulfur diesel margin versus WTI has increased 33% to $9.95 per barrel while the Gulf Coast gasoline margins versus WTI increased to 20% to $8.58 per barrel.", "On the West Coast, diesel margins versus WTI increased to 40% to $11.83 per barrel while the gasoline margins have remained relatively flat. Our first quarter 2010 refinery throughput volume averaged to 2.1 million barrels per day which is in line with our guidance. However compared to the first quarter of 2009, volumes were down 254,000 barrels per day mainly due to the continued idle status of the Aruba refinery.", "Our first quarter 2010 results were negatively impacted by downtime at some of our key refineries. We estimate the lost income from the first quarter downtime was just over $200 million. Refinery cash operating expenses in the first quarter of 2010 were $4.41 per barrel in line with our guidance, but were $0.41 per barrel higher than the first quarter of 2009 results due mostly to the lower throughput volumes.", "Looking at other business segments, retail had a record first quarter with operating income at $71 million which is $15 million higher than the first quarter of 2009 primarily due to higher fuel margins in both the US and Canadian operation. Our ethanol segment had $57 million of operating income in the first quarter which was our second best quarter since we entered the ethanol business.", "I should also point out that we purchased 3 additional plants in the first quarter taking our total to 10 plants with 1.1 billion gallons per year of capacity. Like our previous acquisition these are large plants located in the corn belt and we bought them at deep discounts to replacement costs. Two of the plants were idle, but we have restarted them and ten plants are now operating.", "General and administrative expenses including corporate depreciation were $97 million in the first quarter which was $40 million lower than the fourth quarter and lower than our guidance due to a favorable insurance settlement of $40 million. For the first quarter total depreciation and amortization expense was $357 million which was in line with our guidance, net interest expense was a $127 million which was higher than our guidance and the fourth quarter of 2009 due to increased interest expense related to our recent debt offered.", "The effective tax rate benefit on continuing operations in the first quarter was 32%. Regarding cash flows for the first quarter, capital spending was $611 million which includes $229 million of turnaround and catalyst expenditures and for the year our capital spending target remains at $2 billion. We received a federal income tax refund of $923 million and we spent $260 million to acquire 3 ethanol plants. The ethanol spending includes $9 million of working capital. So the total cost to acquire these plants comes to $280 million which includes a $21 million deposit that was paid in the fourth quarter of 2009.", "We also paid $28 million in dividends in the first quarter. Also during the quarter we completed a debt offering totaling $1.25 billion and subsequently called $473 million of debt. Including the premium we spent $294 million in the first quarter to regain $287 million of debt and in the second quarter we will pay $190 million to regain a $186 million. These redemptions will result to lower interest expense over the life of the note. ", "With respect to our balance sheet at the end of March total debt was $8.4 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.9 billion and we had over $4 billion of additional liquidity available. And at the end of the quarter, our debt-to-cap ratio net of cash was 31%. In summary, our financial health and liquidity remained very good despite the challenging environment we have experienced. We expect to be profitable in April and make money for the fourth quarter. Our priority is continue to reducing costs running our assets safely and reliably and maintaining our financial strength. We continue to believe that our cost savings initiative and the strategic actions that we have taken should make the company profitable in 2010 even if we were to experience a low margin environment like 2009.", "So now I will turn it over Ashley to cover the earnings model assumption.", "Ashley Smith", "", "Okay thanks Mike, for modeling our second quarter operations you should expect refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges. Gulf Coast at 1.275 million to 1.325 million barrels per day. Mid-continent at 3,80,000 to 3,90,000 barrels per day, North East at 3,30,000 to 3,40,000 barrels per day and West coast at 2,60,000 to 2,70,000 barrels per day.", "Refinery cash operating expenses are expected to be around $4.15 per barrel which is lower than last quarter due mainly to higher expected throughput volumes. Regarding our ethanol operations in the second quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 3.15 million gallons per day and operating expenses should average approximately $0.37 per gallon which includes $0.03 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization.", "With respect to some of other items in the second quarter we expect G&A expense excluding depreciation to be around $135 million. Net interest expense should be around $120 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be around $365 million. Regarding our tax rate in this margin environment, small changes and assumptions are yielding a very wide range of results from effective tax rates. So at this point we prefer not to provide guidance which may not be meaningful. We will now open call for questions Angelic.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from Doug Terreson of ISI Group.", "Doug Terreson - ISI", "", "Differentials have widened which should enhance performance for you in the coming periods. On this point, the spread for light versus (inaudible) seems to have widened more than for some of the other global heavy crude oils. So my question's twofold. What do you guys think that supports widening of the spread? Second, what, if any implication, do you think the difference in spreads between the regional heavy crude oil such as Maya can continue to trade at record levels there, but have some of the others in? Would you just spend a minute on that spread?", "Joe Gorder", "", "The heavy sour discounts improved for a couple of reasons. One we had in (inaudible), two we had fuel-length in Singapore and third we had a flat market structure. Now you have the Maya discounts looked pretty good today. We were shown about $10 a barrel when compared to WTI and that\u2019s a little bit distorted, they are actually stronger than that if you compare them to some of the foreign suite, because we got the dislocation of WTI. So we had factors that affected the discount and improved it. Now today if you look at that, the primary one that still remains is the fuel oil length.", "The Maya length is cleaned up a little bit and the market structures [didn\u2019t carry], but here again if you compare Maya to a foreign suite, it looks more attractive and it would relative to WTI.", "Now as far as the foreign barrels go, like [big] heavy, Doug we are not seeing those barrels over here anymore and you know that. If I compare Maya to some of the other heavy sours that we do look at running is right in the ballpark. Venezuelan grades, some of the Columbian grades, we are not seeing it disjointed relative to those.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Dietert with Simmons.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons", "", "Along a similar line, Rich, or Joe, could you talk about how the Maya spreads and the resid spreads are impacting your utilization of your coking units, and maybe compare 4Q last year to 1Q this year and where you are now as far as utilization of the cokers?", "Rich Marcogliese", "", "We have increased coker runs in general. If you go back to the last year we had our small coker in the Corpus Christi East plant and two drum coker I mean it was down for probably six months. Now it is running full coker at Texas City, running full Port Arthur crude rates and coker rates have gotten back to traditional maximum. So yes, we are purchasing crudes to fill coking capacity because it makes economic sense now with the differentials.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons", "", "If I remember, on the second question, the Paulsboro process, it seems like you've got bids in. Should we assume something's relatively imminent there?", "Joe Gorder", "Jeff we are working on the process still and I will tell you that we\u2019ll make our decision here in the second quarter.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Paul (inaudible) of Bank of America.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "On the northeast, it looked like the capture rate there was a little better, I guess, than we've seen historically. Can we talk just a little bit about what the absence of Del City has meant there in terms of the system? But if you can also maybe just frame it in terms of the contribution from Paulsboro. It was the only region that was profitable this quarter. So I'm curious to know how Paulsboro performed with that backdrop?", "Bill Klesse", "Well on the part about Del City I don\u2019t think we necessarily see any impact on that, to go through the heart of your question we made money in Canada and we lost money in Paulsboro.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "If I would just stay with that, there was no mention in the release about the inventory sale coming out of Del City. Can you give us some color, I'm assuming you got the revenues, was there any contribution in terms of margin from that inventory disposal?", "Mike Ciskowski", "In the North Sea or on the inventory liquidation at Del City we had hedged all those barrels, so there is P&L effect.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "A couple months back, you were quoted as talking about aiming for something like a $3.50 operating cost on the count on a cash basis. Can you just give some maybe color, some update as to whether that's the number you like or rather see as a target and what kind of timeframe and what kind of process you see towards getting there?", "Bill Klesse", "Well that clearly a number I still think it is attainable, but when you have lower operating rates in our refining system, we have to adjust for all of that. We continue to make improvements everywhere, we have goals throughout our system. I think some of you know that we took action in the fourth quarter of last year at Paulsboro reducing our operating costs there. So, we have made projects underway that are adjusting our operating costs.", "We have a target throughout the company of $100 million, but then that\u2019s really addressing mostly things that are at corporate. We also have on top of that optimization, molecule management, strategic sourcing, many other initiatives that will bring it down. But as a goal if we are operating full rate, we\u2019d like to get our cash operating costs down to $3.50 when you have natural gas in its price range. But it\u2019s hard to say give you a good number when we have reduced operating rates.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Edward Westlake of Credit Suisse.", "Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse", "I guess economic recovery is picking up, perhaps. How is that changing your thoughts around Aruba, around $2 billion of CapEx, whether you can drive CapEx lower next year or whether you see some other uses for that cash?", "Perhaps a word on whether ethanol you're done, whether further acquisitions are perhaps unlikely now, or whether you are going to carry on in something around your international thoughts at this stage in terms of international growth is there are opportunities there?", "Bill Klesse", "Yes, Valero sell fuels and clearly as the economic activity continues to increase, it will help our business. Today in distillates, we're seeing farm demand, railroad demand very strong. Trucking is lacking. On gasoline, unemployment still at the 9.7% or whatever the number is. Being very high number and the high prices are restrained on gasoline. ", "However we do see as the economy recovers, the volume's picking up. So, yes we are optimistic, here, we have better margins today. As Joe just said we have better seller discounts today, we are making money here as our releases says in April and we expect to be profitable as Mike said in the second quarter. And I\u2019ve told everyone that we expect to be profitable for the year.", "Looking at our thoughts on Aruba, we still do not have what we would call solid economics to operate Aruba. So we can tell you to look at our alternatives there. Most likely the alternatives that we tend to be looking at goal on the line of processing. We\u2019ll make that decision here as to how that plan goes forward, most likely in June.", "About ethanol, we are very pleased with our ethanol business. Gene Edwards and the team have done an excellent job getting us in that business. It's been a solid contributor for us, it\u2019s still in the profit. I think some of you know there is a huge blending margin today. Ethanol\u2019s economic and so we continue to look at opportunities in that business. We have built a strong staff here and so we feel one, that ethanol is going to be part of fuel mix in the United States and two, there is still some opportunity out there for us to continue to grow that business.", "Capital spending, our number this year, out target is about $2 billion. We complete several big projects this year, the scrubber at Venetia and the heater furnace that's associated with it is very large. We completed MSAT-2 by the end of the year so that will give us the ability to come in with a lower capital. However we do have some big turnarounds next year. But having said that, we also have a couple of projects that we are halfway through and so we are scaling those into our view.", "So if our profitability continues as I stated a few minutes ago and we have the cash. It is our intent to eventually complete our hydrocracker projects at Port Arthur and St. Charles with the timing being somewhere late 2012 at Port Arthur and somewhere in the late 2013 at St. Charles. These projects still have very good rates of return, so we are going to work on them.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Cheng of Barclays Capital.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "First, Mike, can you give me some [partnership] item. What is the working capital including cash? And long-term debt, of the $8.4 billion how much is long-term debt? What is the equity in your [partnership] and what is the market inventory in excess of the book?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Total current assets at the end of March was $11.3 billion and cash balance was $1.9 billion. Total current liabilities was $8.1 billion. ", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "What is the current liability?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Yes the total current liability is $8.1 billion and then our current maturities are $635 million. So our networking capital is right at $2 billion.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Okay so short term debt is $635 million.", "Mike Ciskowski", "That\u2019s right $635 million.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "So that means that your long-term debt is $7.8 billion?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Right. That\u2019s correct and the market value on our inventory is about $9 billion.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Okay how about your shareholder equity?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Yes about $14.5 billion.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Just wanted to make sure I understand so your working capital would be $3.2 billion including cash and everything?", "Mike Ciskowski", "That\u2019s correct, if you do not exclude the cash or the current maturities that\u2019s right.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital ", "Secondly, that money in your first quarter, is there any trading or hedging or loss? Also, do you have any outstanding position for the second quarter for any hatching or trading position currently on?", "Mike Ciskowski", "The first quarter results from our trading activities was a profit of about $5 million.", "Bill Klesse", "I have mentioned in the past that we do participate in the paper markets. We have some decisions on, but they are not significant and frankly I view them as confidential.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "So Bill, you mean that for the second quarter that as of right now the existing one is not a huge amount whatever you have outstanding?", "Mike Ciskowski", "That\u2019s correct.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Bill, I think you had mentioned that you could be interested in share of European asset. Can you give us any update? Have you further pursued that process or you still have interest or not?", "Bill Klesse", "We are still interested in looking at so many of the assets that are for sale in Western Europe. I think you know it is a whole bunch of them and so we will continue to look however but we will be very careful. It is only looking at quality asset. There will be assets that do not require a lot of capital and I assure you that we will be survivors and there will be assets that will generate a rate of return if we do anything.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Gillman of Benchmark Company.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "While I fully believe your forecast of profitability, Mike, can you give me an idea where you stand in terms of possible future carryback loss potential as of the end of last year?", "Mike Ciskowski", "I think our current forecast shows that we are going to have a taxable income this year, so we don\u2019t expect to have any carry back.", "Joe Gorder", "I will always say that there is a significant amount of potential carryback if we were to have a tax law. Because there is a new tax laws from last year that allows five-year carryback and the large portion of our over $900 million income tax receivable were from earlier years and so we still have a substantial amount if we do actually have the tax laws.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "", "Has the liquidation of the Del City inventories been fully completed?", "Mike Ciskowski", "", "We still have a little bit to go, I think about a $100 million is what my estimate is current value.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "That\u2019s left to go, Mike?", "Mike Ciskowski", "That\u2019s left to go.", "Joe Gorder", "", "Slightly over a million barrels.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "It appears as if there's an unusual seasonal pattern to the reported margins in the mid-continent division where the first quarter in virtually every year that I've looked at seems to be one of the strongest quarters. Is that something you see also, and is there any particular reason you can cite for it?", "Bill Klesse", "", "We have the contango in the market which helped to some degree on the mid-continent plant.", "Joe Gorder", "", "It has been pronounced lately than early in the first quarter ", "Bill Klesse", "Other than that I don\u2019t really see product margins, being that big premiums to the Gulf coast, just the normal arbitrage.", "Joe Gorder", "Mark, even now they are fairly flat. If you look at Gulf coast versus mid-continent the only difference really that I see is the seven pound, eight pound versus nine pound back.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "", "But nothing that tends to repeat itself from the first quarter each year that might be responsible for a much higher degree of margin capture in a first quarter period?", "Joe Gorder", "No we are not aware, we will have to go back track and look at that Mark.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "", "Bill, you've often taken an industry leadership role, not least in terms of really rallying the industry, not to overproduce, I was wondering in the context of the sale of Delaware City, why you didn't simply shutter the refinery once and for all given that the price you got was pretty low and I would have thought the potential welcome-term benefits of shutting that particular refinery would have outweighed the benefit you got from the sale?", "Bill Klesse", "", "It\u2019s a fair question, but PBF was willing to pay a price for a terminal as we were looking at it and then a shutdown refinery that was in our shareholder\u2019s interest when we looked to that versus all other options. So as we said in some of our releases that we believe we got a very fair value for this, for the state it was in, so we elected to sell to PBF. ", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "You're saying now there will be a competitor on the east coast?", "Bill Klesse", "", "I think you have to ask PBF what they are going to do with the refinery.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "When you sold, do you expect them to run as a refinery, was your expectation that it will just be a terminal.", "Bill Klesse", "", "We sold it as shutdown refinery with the terminal", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Just a more macro question if I could. It seems that one of the reasons, the strengths that we're seeing in refining margins right now is related to international demand. We noticed the problem in Chile, Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil, I think Nigeria might be importing gasoline. Could you just talk about Atlantic basin and Pacific basin and trades we are seeing in terms of exports from the US?", "Joe Gorder", "", "Paul we are seeing you know strong demands for distillates primarily from South America, but also here just recently from Europe. If you look what we did in the first quarter we exported about 80,000 barrels a day on average of distillate, but those numbers are much lower in January and increased through March. If you look at what we are estimating right now for May we are probably at 185,000 barrels a month and you cited some of the issues and we have problems in Chile. Venezuela has refinery problems. Isla is shut down. So you\u2019ve got draws in that market that are pulling significant volumes and here again, the arm to Europe is open by about a penny and a half now. And that\u2019s been a recent phenomenon and so we are moving barrels that way also.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "What do you attribute the European strengths to?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Well the refineries are still being cut back, they are not at high utilization rate still.", "Joe Gorder", "You know it\u2019s hard to get great data, but we do know that a lot of the distillate has been on the water has cleaned up and been consumed.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Just to be clear, those numbers you're talking about are Valero numbers, right?", "Joe Gorder", "Valero numbers.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "That must be a record high, right?", "Mike Ciskowski", "No actually last summer we probably did 200,000 to 220,000 barrels a day.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Of distillate?", "Mike Ciskowski ", "Yes.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "And what about gasoline side?", "Joe Gorder ", "In the first quarter we did 20 gasoline cargos which is a high for us.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank ", "How big's the cargo?", "Joe Gorder", "55,000 barrels a day.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank ", "To what extent do you think this is sustainable? Obviously, we know the demand side is coming back, but in terms of the outages, Chile obviously is going to come back in a matter of months.", "Mike Ciskowski", "Right.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Do you know what's going on in Mexico and Venezuela?", "Joe Gorder ", "In Mexico we had a lot of turnarounds. Venezuela has had refinery operating problems. Isla of course had the power outage and that took a lot of volume out of the market, I mean Isla refinery produced 85,000 barrels a day of gasoline and a 100,000 a day of diesel fuel. That\u2019s not the marketplace today and they were using that to supply other South American countries, so the US Gulf coast right now is filling the void in production there. Is it sustainable, we understand that perhaps by the end of May it will be back up operating, Chile is going to take a while I think to get their production volumes back up and then Venezuela itself I really don\u2019t know.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank ", "Final one for me there was some interesting chatter I think you referenced even today about Iran and Reliance. Is there anything you can add on what might be going on there? It seems that Reliance is seeking to send more volumes into the Atlantic basin. I don't know if you seeing this show up, any commentary on that?", "Joe Gorder ", "We haven\u2019t seen them show off. I haven\u2019t heard anything about that to be quite honest with you.", "Bill Klesse", "Everything I hear is Iran continues to be supplied and some of their old suppliers maybe reducing the volumes, but someone else steps in to fill the void and so I am not sure there\u2019s really been a lot of changes in gasoline movement in Iran.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil", "The Canadian retail margins seemed exceptionally strong in the quarter. I'm just curious if you could point out anything that was occurring during the quarter and if that's continuing to persist into 2Q?", "Bill Klesse", "The Canadian margins you should remember include (inaudible) and so when you look at the number that\u2019s the home heating business and our margin for the home heating is significantly harder than it is for fuel. So then as you go into the second quarter, third quarter, they change as your volume drops for home heating, then going back into the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s really the main difference you have as the home heat business in the winter so even though Quebec was warmer this winter than last winter there's still that seasonal effect.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil", "Okay, so we should see some drop off there?", "Bill Klesse", "Yes, on a relative basis.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil", "The second one for you Joe mentioned the dislocation on WTI, presumably stemming from the storage situation that seems to be building again over at Cushing. As I recall, I believe you guys run quite a bit of WTI through your mid-con system, and I'm just trying to see if you're recognizing a real benefit from that so far this quarter? And I think you already mentioned the contango, but obviously that's blowing out as well, I'm assuming that's providing somewhat of a benefit as well.", "Joe Gorder", "Yes, Blake we would do, I mean we will see the benefit as the contango on the domestic crudes and we do run quite a bit of TI into McKee, Ardmore.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Franklin Russo of RBC.", "Franklin Russo - RBC", "Most of my questions have been answered, but I just wanted to follow up on the capital budget. You've talked before on the $2 billion capital budget this year, about 1.85 of that is kind of this day in business capital level and that's expected to move down going forward. If you take Paulsboro and Aruba out of the equation, how low can that 1.85 go?", "Bill Klesse", "Well if you look at our DD&A, it comes up to the whole [company] at about a $1.4 billion and so our target will clearly be as the regulatory capital comes out of the mix that we could bring, get this down into the $1.4 billion of $1.5 billion area. Now that assumes we don\u2019t have anything new on the regulatory and that we finished those kind of thing. Then we have our turnarounds, reliability, investments that could clearly be done in the $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion range.", "Franklin Russo - RBC", "So $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion total for all of the categories of sustaining turnarounds and regulatory?", "Bill Klesse", "Yeah we can get it down to that. That\u2019s correct", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chi Chow of Macquarie Capital", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Capital", "Bill, you mentioned earlier that you were looking to resume the hydrocracker projects at Port Arthur and St. Charles. What's the remaining spending you have at each plant?", "Bill Klesse", "Port Arthur for the full project about $900 million and St. Charles about $600 million and when you look at the economics, on the increment, say in the first part is already done even if we took into some tax-effect into considerations or the return is still in the high 20s and if you look at the entire project which is largely driven in a way by very low natural gas prices than equate the hydrogen and then equate the liquids, the project is in high teens. So since we in a way have invested roughly 50% in these projects. At some point it would be our intent to finish it, but we are going to manage that with our available cash.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Capital", "Can you comment on your outlook then on the distillate market going forward? Assuming you have a positive outlook if you can go forward with the projects?", "Bill Klesse", "Well of course we have a positive outlook. But right now, it\u2019s trucking that\u2019s lagging. If you take the data 65% or so of US distillate demand is on road diesel. I mentioned already that the farming is strong at the moment and railroads have been strong and clearly the shipping industry is trying to be more efficient, but I am assuming that the US economy will eventually recover and that will see that going.", "Distillates in the world are going to grow between two to three times at the rate of gasoline and Joe spoke about our export capabilities. As you know these hydrocrackers are plants that have excellent capability. They also at Port Arthur rollout a very high [seeking] product to be produced. So when we look at the world, we believe we can export from the US Gulf Coast or service domestically. So yes, we're optimistic, still in the world. So yes, we're optimistic, still in the world about diesel and distillates.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Capital", "Second question on ethanol. Valero's in an interesting position of straddling the fence as one of the largest refiners and ethanol producers here in the US. Just wondering what is your stance on increasing the blending limits of ethanol above 10%?", "Bill Klesse", "I am going to speak from (inaudible). I know you guys know that I am Chairman of the [MTR] and they have a different position. We think that ethanol from Valero\u2019s perspective is going to be part of the fuel mix. Actually today it is economic even at $3.50 corn. The US farmer has demonstrated and even though people talk about the fuel the US farmer has demonstrated an ability to grow more corn, increasing yields and so we think that ethanol is viable in the fuel mix and so our position is that it should be increased. Then we will have the discussion about cars and which cars can take the fuel, but it is economic and then you also have other issues that we get involved in on this issue. National Security, things (inaudible).", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Capital", "Just from the logistics and you mentioned the liability standpoint of the older vehicles. Do you think it's really feasible to push much more in beyond 10% over the next, I don't know, five years or so?", "Bill Klesse", "Surely we do and you will have that proper labeling at the (inaudible).", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from Alexander Inkler with Sanford Bernstein.", "Alexander Inkler - Sanford Bernstein", "Just one question actually, going back to Delaware City given the strength of east coast margins in the last quarter, I'm just curious if you can give us some guidance as to whether Delaware City would have been profitable in the current environment?", "Ashley Smith", "Alex, this is Ashley. When we shut it, however our belief because of the operating costs and just the environment at that refinery, it still wouldn\u2019t have been worth running even if we could have run it.", "Joe Gorder", "", "If you look at the plant it has one of our lowest liquid volume yields which you know is an issue in this high crude price environment.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Ann Kohler of Caris & Co", "Ann Kohler - Caris & Co", "", "First on the ethanol, I know you gave a throughput expectation or production of 3.15 million gallons for the quarter. It's my understanding that you were going to be basically ramping up production of some of the plants purchased earlier so the production numbers would be higher in the second half of the year. Do you have any guidance as regards to that?", "Joe Gorder", "", "3.15 already represents the new plants at pretty much full capacity.", "Ann Kohler - Caris & Co", "And the older plants as well?", "Joe Gorder", "Yeah, they are all running at capacity or slightly above and permits all the implants right now and that\u2019s reflected in 3.15.", "Ann Kohler - Caris & Co", "", "Given the environment, I know that over the last couple of years, there are a number of plants, if you have also looked at placing on the market beyond Aruba and Paulsboro, given the current environment, I mean, are you still basically looking at that opportunity or are you going to wait for better margin environment or are you happy with your current portfolio?", "Bill Klesse", "", "We are focusing on Aruba and Paulsboro, we assume that we will close our transaction here in May, so right now that\u2019s where our focus is. However we have a portfolio plan and they are all not equally performing and that\u2019s why we had many initiatives on throughout our system here. But our focus is on the two that you mentioned.", "Ann Kohler - Caris & Co", "", "By that focus shift, some of those refineries then shift up once you get those two plants settled, those transactions completed?", "Bill Klesse", "", "Ann it wouldn\u2019t shift because we are trying to improve our portfolio as we every single day. But we will make judgments as to those assets as we go forward.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Daniel Burke of Johnson Rice.", "Daniel Burke - Johnson Rice", "", "I wonder if you could revise one of the drivers, mentioned for the light or light heavy spread, the length in the fuel market and rest of the outlook there? Can that continue or will far east turnarounds begin to cut into that length as you look into forward into Q2?", "Rich Marcogliese", "", "I think we expect it to continue, the fuel oil market is long in Singapore, it is also long now in the US gulf coast. And so I mean it could clean up with some time but in the periods that we are looking at right now we expect it to continue.", "Joe Gorder", "You look at US inventories right now, they\u2019re eight million barrels higher than last year which is a pretty sizable number and lot of it is because US demand is still very weak because of very low natural gas prices, so not much resid being consumed here.", "And we\u2019ve been importing resid at higher levels than over last year as well because of Singapore\u2019s full, Europe is long resid all the time, so the barrels have to come here because Singapore is already full. So it will take a while for the resid to clean up. I think we are going to see this continue for the next few months at least. ", "Daniel Burke - Johnson Rice", "The only other one I had as follow-up, did you have on hand the number for cash proceeds generated for most specifically the Del City inventory liquidation in the first quarter? Just want to get a look at the underlying net working capital that looks to occur in Q1.", "Bill Klesse", "Yes, $365 million was liquidation in the first quarter and then as we mentioned earlier we\u2019ve about another $100 million to go.", "Operator", "Your next question is a follow up from the line of Paul Schrader of Bank of America.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Just a couple of clarification points, please. On Aruba, looking at your operating cost guidance, are you assuming that Aruba is you still have some costs down there? What should we think about the implications for the second half of the year there?", "Mike Ciskowski", "We do have costs down there presently at Aruba, roughly about $22 million per quarter in DD&A and then in the first quarter we had about $20 million of cash operating expenses. So the total was about $38 million loss at Aruba. We did have some margin there in our marine and terminalling business.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Your guidance for the second quarter, the OpEx guidance that Ashley gave, I'm assuming that Aruba's still in there, I guess, it\u2019s until June? What happens beyond that?", "Ashley Smith", "That number would continue most likely through the third quarter.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Just going back to light heavy differentials, the Keystone pipeline fill, how do you see things playing out there when that's done in terms of how it might impact your ability to access western Canadian for example?", "Joe Gorder", "It\u2019s going to be beneficial to us to have the Keystone pipeline in place. The timing of it, they are line filling right now, the part that goes down to Steel City and then connects into Patoka and Wood River, the Cushing connection will be in early 2011 I believe and then the next segment that\u2019s going to be worked on is the segment that runs from Cushing down to the US Gulf Coast and our thoughts are that we maybe able to get volume on that before the entire bullet line is complete, at the end of \u201812 or the beginning of 2013. ", "You know in addition to the Canadian crude that will be beneficial to us longer term though we\u2019ve got the increases in the Columbian production, we\u2019ve got Brazilian heavy suite coming into the market. First we got the Canadian and then we got the medium sour production increases that we are going to see out of Iraq. So as we look at the market for the medium sours and the heavy sours going forward we tend to be fairly optimistic.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Mark Gilman of Benchmark Company.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "Can you give us an update on the Quebec FCC?", "Rich Marcogliese", "The Quebec FCC is back in service, market was down for a total of 67 days and came up on April 11.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "Okay is there tax due on the sale to PBF?", "Mike Ciskowski", "No.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "No tax on that, Mike?", "Mike Ciskowski", "It will be a very small amount. We do have a small gain on this to where the transaction is currently proposed, contemplated.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "How much mileage did you run in the first quarter and how does that compare to what you are doing now?", "Bill Klesse", "A little over 200,000 barrels a day in Maya in the first quarter and Joe for now?", "Joe Gorder", "Same about 225,000.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Paul Cheng of Barclays Capital.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Hey Bill, just want to ask a follow up on the ethanol. If the EPA less in next week give a waiver to increase the ethanol branding from 10% to 15%, but the auto industry would not give any guarantee on their vehicle to change it accordingly, will you or will Valero as a company, if the economy is there, willing to brand up to a 15% or that you would say there's too much of the legal liability and you don\u2019t want to take that chance or you will wait until the auto industry gives the guarantee before you bring that. Just trying to understand which one will be the hurdle?", "Bill Klesse", "We are well aware of the experience with MTBE, where it was authorized and there was no effective product liability. So we\u2019ll have to just wait and see what the rules look like, we will see what the autos really do and we will see, that\u2019s why I was answering Chi earlier, there is going to have to be an awful lot of labeling involved if in fact it does become or does enter the market.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "So in other words even if the EPA changed the regulation tomorrow that you guys would pick up maybe of the more cautious wait and see attitude.", "Bill Klesse", "Now that\u2019s absolutely true. We will be extremely cautious.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Smith, are there any closing remarks?", "Ashley Smith", "I just want to thank everyone for listening to today\u2019s call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Valero Energy Report Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Ashley Smith, sir, you may begin.", "Ashley Smith", "Thank you, Brandis. Good morning, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Bill Klesse, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Ciskowski, our CFO; Rich Marcogliese, our COO; Gene Edwards, our Executive Vice President of Corporate Development and Strategic Planning; Joe Gorder, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Supply; and Kim Bowers, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel.", "If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact me after the call.", "Before we get started, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we described in our filings with the SEC.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Mike.", "Michael Ciskowski", "Thanks, Ashley, and thank you for joining us today. As noted in the release, we reported a third quarter 2010 income from continuing operations of $292 million or $0.51 per share.", "Third quarter 2010 operating income was $571 million versus an operating loss of $238 million in the third quarter of 2009. The $809 million increase in operating income was mainly due to higher margins for diesel and better discounts for low-quality feedstocks, combined with higher throughput volumes compared to the third quarter of 2009.", "Diesel margins improved significantly versus last year. If you look at the benchmark, ULSD margin on the Gulf Coast, it increased from $6.97 per barrel in the third quarter of 2009 to $11.69 per barrel in the third quarter of 2010 or a 68% increase. The sour crude oil discounts also improved during the third quarter. The Maya heavy sour crude oil discounts to WTI expanded from $5.02 per barrel in the third quarter of 2009 to $8.47 in the third quarter of 2010. Another way to look at this is as a percentage of WTI, so the Maya discount increased from 7.4% of WTI in the third quarter of last year to 11.1% of WTI in the third quarter of '10, which is a 50% improvement year-over-year.", "So far in the fourth quarter, benchmark margins have remained relatively strong for this time of year. For example, the Gulf Coast ULSD margin versus WTI have increased from $5.83 per barrel in October 2009 to $12.91 per barrel in October of this year or 121%. Meanwhile, Gulf Coast gasoline margins versus WTI were strong early in the month, but have moderated recently. We are continuing to see good sour crude oil discounts with Maya discounts as a percentage of WTI holding fairly steady with the third quarter levels and are which 8% higher than October 2009 levels.", "Our third quarter 2010 refinery throughput volume averaged at 2.4 million barrels a day, which is in line with our guidance. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, volumes were up 136,000 barrels per day due to higher throughput at many of our refineries as a result of the better margin environment.", "Refinery cash operating expenses in the third quarter of 2010 were $3.76 per barrel, which is favorably below our guidance. Cash operating expenses were higher then in the second quarter, primarily due to extra maintenance expense at Aruba and the Benicia. If you exclude the $35 million in extra expense for maintenance at Aruba in the third quarter, our systemwide cash operating expenses were only $3.60 per barrel, and our Gulf Coast cash costs were only $3.36 per barrel.", "Our company-wide focus on cost reduction is continuing to yield results. Since the beginning of 2010, we have achieved approximately $140 million in pretax cost reduction through numerous initiatives and great execution by our employees. We are on pace to reduce pretax cost by a total of $185 million in 2010, and our goal for 2011 is an additional $100 million in pretax cost reduction.", "As part of our efforts to reduce costs, we remain committed to improving our operating performance. We set goals and measure our progress using Salomon ranking, which are benchmark surveys across the refining industry that cover key operating categories. Salomon rankings are by quartile, with first quartile indicating that you are performing among the top 25% in the industry. We are proud that our Refining portfolio has achieved first quartile performance in 2010 in two categories: nonenergy cash operating expenses and personnel. Although we are second quartile in the categories of reliability, maintenance expense and energy efficiency, we are making consistent progress towards first quartile performance.", "Turning back to our third quarter results. Our Non-refining business segments also performed well. Retail nearly maxed last year's record earnings with operating income at $105 million, mostly due to increase fuel volumes. Our Ethanol segment had $47 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2010, which was slightly lower than the third quarter of 2009, but up $12 million from the second quarter of this year due mainly to an increase in Ethanol margin.", "In the third quarter, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $139 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $372 million, and net interest expense was $119 million, all in line with our guidance. The effective tax rate on continued operations in the third quarter was 38%.", "With respect to our balance sheet at the end of September. Total debt was $8 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.4 billion, and we had nearly $4.2 billion of additional liquidity available. At the end of the third quarter, our debt-to-cap ratio net of cash was 27%.", "Regarding cash flows for the quarter, we paid $28 million in dividends. Capital spending was $508 million, which includes $67 million for turnaround and catalyst expenditures. For the year, our capital spending target is $2.3 billion, and for 2011, our preliminary estimate for capital spending is $2.6 billion. This includes a $502 million decrease in regulatory spending being partially offset by a $305 million increase in sustained and reliability spending on projects that should improve our operations, such as coke drum replacement at Port Arthur and FCC maintenance at our McKee refinery. In addition in 2011, we plan to increase spending for economic growth projects by $525 million.", "As illustrated in recent investor presentations that are available on our website, we have several large projects that we estimate will provide significant earnings power using a reasonable set of price assumptions. In general, these projects capitalize on our outlook for relatively high crude oil prices and low natural gas prices. For example, the Port Arthur Hydrocracker project, which should be complete near the end of 2012 should generate $485 million of estimated incremental EBITDA and yield an internal rate of return of 21% on an unlevered basis. This is just one example of several economic growth projects in which we will continue investing over the next few years.", "Portfolio optimization also remains a strategic priority, and we continue to execute on this. In the third quarter, we announced an agreement to sell the Paulsboro refinery for $360 million, consisting of $180 million in cash and a note for $180 million, plus $275 million in cash for estimated net working capital and inventories. We anticipate closing this transaction in the fourth quarter. The potential sale of the Paulsboro refinery will result in a non-cash, pretax charge of approximately $920 million, and the tax loss will be $155 million.", "Also we announced an agreement yesterday to sell our 50% interest in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline System for $330 million, which we expect to occur in the fourth quarter. When completed, the disposition will result in a book gain of $56 million and a tax gain of $235 million. This system primarily consists of two crude oil pipelines running from the deep water Gulf of Mexico to the Texas coast. We believe the sale of this non-core asset will realize hidden value for our shareholders.", "At Aruba, we are continuing our maintenance activities and plan to have the refinery ready for restart in mid-December. I should note that these activities include many important improvements to the long-term reliability of the refinery, storage terminal and the docks. And in the first quarter of 2011, the Aruba refinery will be able to supply intermediate feedstocks to our Gulf Coast refineries during the planned turnaround.", "Now I'll turn it over to Ashley to cover the earnings model assumptions.", "Ashley Smith", "Okay. Thanks, Mike. For modeling our fourth quarter operation, you should expect the refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: the Gulf Coast should be at 1.325 million to 1.375 million barrels per day, excluding Aruba; Mid-Continent should be at 410,000 to 420,000 barrels per day; the Northeast should be at 370,000 to 380,000 barrels per day, including Paulsboro; and the West Coast should be at 280,000 to 290,000 barrels per day.", "Refinery cash operating expenses are expected to be around $3.80 per barrel, including Paulsboro and the costs at Aruba.", "Regarding our Ethanol operations in the fourth quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 3.3 million gallons per day. And operating expenses should average approximately $0.33 per gallon, which includes $0.03 per gallon for non-cash COGS, such as depreciation and amortization.", "With respect to some of the other items for the fourth quarter, we expect general and administrative expense, excluding depreciation, to be around $155 million. Net interest expense should be around $118 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be around $380 million. And our effective tax rate should be approximately 40%.", "We will now open the call for questions, Brandis.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Doug Terreson [ISI Group].", "Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc.", "Today's press release plus some of your recent commentary suggest that strategic actions may change your geographical footprint, that is to enhance competitiveness for the company. And on this point, I want to see if you can provide some updated insight into your strategic thinking, including any functional or geographical criteria that you deem important when thinking about your strategic outlook?", "William Klesse", "Doug, this is Klesse. Well, what I'm going to say on this, maybe it's a little bit longer than what the question you asked. Valero, we're a refining company. You guys recommend us. Our investors invest in us. They want exposure to the segment. We refine products and commodities. We believe that we can add shareholder value to profitable growth. Expanding our footprint will help us perform more profitably, hence we optimize our system. It also will support our trading efforts in the sense of an asset-backed trading portfolio. Our focus of late is obviously Europe. And since you guys know what assets are for sale, it's obviously the U.K. But Europe is a large market. It is long gasoline, short diesel. We've said in many of our presentations that we've been exporting diesel to Europe. The U.S. is still importing gasoline. At some capacity, we'll have to shut down, but other capacity, we'll survive, and it will prosper. We have one advantage, being large, in the sense that we get to look at our portfolio and we can see the variability among assets. The quality assets that's coming to market in this round of announced assets for sale is much better than what we've seen previously in the Western Europe, U.K. markets. We still expect to see even some more assets come to market, especially as some of the majors are beginning to question the integrated business model that they followed in which you guys have already been questioning whether the integrated business model is the right model going forward. Valero is unique. We're different than all the rest of the independents and that we're very, very large. And so we think there's opportunities, and we've said this for the last several years that we keep looking. And now with the quality assets on the market, yes, we're actively looking at.", "Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc.", "And so that's Europe and not Asia, Bill. Is that the way to think about it?", "William Klesse", "Yes, it is for today. We are fully aware the growth in the world is Asia. And new refineries are going to be built in Asia because this business is going to keep growing worldwide. But we don't see the opportunity there at this point in time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Edward Westlake from Credit Suisse.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Just on the debts. I guess last quarter there, the strong results and the debt coming down, the focus was on sort of dividends and buybacks. I guess, you've announced the another $700 million of disposals. Can you give us an idea of what kind of disposal proceeds you're targeting for 2011 and how you're thinking about perhaps the dividend and buyback as that debt level comes down?", "Michael Ciskowski", "Okay. In 2011, I mean, we do have a $2.6 billion, as I talked about, in capital expenditures. I would not anticipate that, at this point in time, our dividend would be materially changed from the level that it is today as we move into 2011.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And then a follow-up just on the tax rate, actually. You talked about a 40% tax rate, if I heard you correctly, in Q4. I presume that's related to Paulsboro and book losses and taxes. Maybe just some words on the underlying tax rate that you expect going forward?", "Michael Ciskowski", "This is Mike. Our 40% guidance there that does not -- what is happening there is we really expect a loss at Aruba due to the restart costs and expenses the we have. That's a little bit larger than what we've occurred in the past. And so that's the tax effect of that very low rate, and so it is causing our overall rate to go up a little bit.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And so as you look forward and strip that out, the underlying tax rate, you would expect to be...", "Michael Ciskowski", "It would be more in the 36%, 37% range.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Obviously, a pretty strong signal on acquisitions, Bill. A couple of years ago, you issued some equity in anticipation of a deal that didn't go through. Would you anticipate you would need additional equity or you're already in good shape given that situation?", "William Klesse", "Yes, we did issue equity on an acquisition that we did think was very good, and obviously, you looked and thought it was good, too. But on this right now, we have, as Mike said, $2.4 billion of cash. We just said that we have about $700 million coming in on these asset sales assuming that they close since we expect them to close here in the fourth quarter. So it just depends on what the deals look like. But obviously, we have lots of financial resources here. But as I've said many times in the past, our investment-grade credit rating is very important to us, and we intend to keep that as well.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Could you maybe give us an idea on what your ceiling on debt-to-cap would be, Bill? Where are you comfortable going to on debt-to-cap?", "William Klesse", "Well, I'm not going to give up the investment tax, the investment credit rating. And so we will manage the entire process.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Just a little bit of color on the dynamics of what's going on in diesel right now. We're seeing some pretty interesting, I guess, relationships with the dollar with Brent on diesel. And I'm just wondering if you could give some color as to how the export market is looking right now, how the exporting dynamics are playing in and really what your prognosis is for diesel in light of a potential weak dollar as we move into 2011?", "Joseph Gorder", "All right, Doug. This is Joe. Our diesel exports have continued to be strong. In fact, all of our product exports have been strong. We've averaged around 165,000 barrels a day of diesel [ph] through the quarter. It looks like it's going to be a similar levels going into the fourth quarter. Gasoline actually picked up in the third quarter, and we're doing about 65,000 barrels a day there, and we expect that to continue also. So generally, the export markets have continued to be strong. Going forward, what do we think? Well, yes, you still got global demand for products that's growing faster than our U.S. demand. You still have some supply issue with Venezuela struggling. Mexico demand continues to exceed their supply, and so they're importing products. We're seeing more diesel [ph] now going down to Brazil, and their economy has been very strong. During the second quarter, Brazil imports reached almost 200,000 barrels a day. And then we expect that they could be importing gasoline here at some point in the future. And then you've got just these, well, temporary issues like this French strike that took place, which we don't see it having a major impact on the market. I would tell you, I think what we've seen is that it's probably supported the New York Harbor market a little bit. And then perhaps longer term, there'll be a restocking that takes place as they depleted some of their reserves. But for other than that, we just don't see much. So I mean, that's really where these export markets are, they've been very consistent, and I don't think really that's going to change.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "One quick follow-up related on CapEx. With Paulsboro gone, you guys have normally talked about, you said, $1.5 billion maintenance capital level. With the asset sales done, what's that number going to look like going forward?", "Michael Ciskowski", "Well, I think, clearly, we're in the $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion. And I've given that number to people that have asked me. If you actually got down, we finished the conversion of the St. Charles cat, and we've replaced our coke drums that we're doing at Port Arthur and then eventually at St. Charles in Wilmington. When we're done with all of that stuff, you stay in business caps and all, within the range of $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, very, very close to the company's DD&A.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "You highlighted that for this time of year, margins are very strong. I think in certain regions, they're actually at the highs that we've seen for the past 10 years. I'm assuming that you would say that the single, biggest reason for that is the export trend that you've just talked about. Could you provide us any more detail on those experts results in terms of destination? You mentioned the countries. But if you could just go over the numbers in terms of about how much is going where? And I thought it was interesting what you said, by the way, there isn't any near-term impact from Europe, the French strike. But I guess that you wouldn't expect that until they can restart importing product. Do you think if...", "Joseph Gorder", "That's right. I think they've been drawing down what they had in inventories to this point. They wouldn't be able to bring imports in anyway because the ports were closed. And if I can be generic on the volumes because, again, I think Doug asked this out of curious analysis [ph] from the last call that we'd really rather not be specific, but I can tell you right now that our exports are primarily headed to Europe, and then some lower volumes to South America. Probably, if we were to say a 75-25 split, that would be a fair assessment. And if you look, we talked about the fact that they may continue going forward. Last year at this time, we had significant amount of inventories being stored on the water. Those inventories are down today, and we are very strong here South America where they pull volumes. And winter is coming in the rest of the world. So just looking at the outlook right now, it looks like things have shaped up pretty well internationally for this growth to be strong. If you look more domestically where our demand is up from last year and we're seeing data that supports increasing activity, truck tonnage is up, rail productivity has increased, and all these serve as leading indicators for industrial growth. So I would say that we certainly think things will stay supported for the time being.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "Yes. I mean, I would have seconded you by saying that given the demand right here right now, although improving still looks very weak. It's surprising that we've got such strong Q4 margins, Q3 and Q4 margins.", "William Klesse", "Paul, we can see you're searching for this, so I'll give you a little more data. We've seen very strong German demand. The number a days of diesel looks pretty good. Inventory relative to demand, we've got a lot of turnarounds. Now this is a little data, but it's the last data I've seen. At our Long Beach, LA harbors, we're up about 25%, August-to-August. So as Joe said, we've seen some domestic demand pickup, too. Now we would expect some of that to continue, so the question becomes are these stocking for the Christmas holidays or these are actually solid economic growth? But clearly, that was up significantly in August. And then you've seen data which spills [ph] over into cars as well, but the data come out with [indiscernible] has actually increased in the United States as well. So between Germany, between the French, between some of the South American countries and some domestic activity here and then the turnarounds, diesel has continued strong. And quite frankly, gasoline cracks, they're down from where they were a couple of weeks ago, but they're still not that bad.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "Moving on to what do you think on cost. Could you say more about how important low natural gas prices are for you and your OpEx? And if you could, to whatever extent you can, split out more detail on the improved cost performance, particularly with reference to that natural gas. And I'd also be interested by how you see those as relatively more or less exposed in the low natural gas prices against any other refinery?", "William Klesse", "Well, I let these guys answer here. But in the third quarter, I think we consumed basically 22%, 20-some number here. But anyway, every dollar wound up being $0.10 a barrel, right?", "Michael Ciskowski", "Yes, it's typically, our energy cost on a quarterly basis, our total energy cost which typically ranges from low 20% to low 30-something percent of our refinery operating cost. The energy portion is [indiscernible] the NYMEX, natural gas [indiscernible] products. For each dollar change in NYMEX, it's about $35 million a quarter, $35 million to $40 million a quarter. So I don't know how you want to look at it, you can do the math yourself. But that's what I could put here.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Dietert with Simmons.", "Jeffrey Dietert - Simmons & Company", "You guys have commented on the importance of the credit rating. You're on negative watch. Could you highlight what the credit agencies are focused on and what you can do to alleviate their concerns?", "William Klesse", "Yes. I mean, I think they're just focused on the state of the industry in general and the recovery of the economy. And I think they're primarily concerned about those types of things. Specific to the company, they're not concerned about anything at this point in time. They've affirmed our ratings here recently, but they left the outlook at negative. And I think that's more of an indication of the industry.", "Jeffrey Dietert - Simmons & Company", "Are there any metrics in particular that they're focused on keeping you within?", "William Klesse", "They're more focused on the coverage ratio. They don't look like as much at the debt-to-cap, and they're more focused on the debt-to-EBITDA and the interest coverage.", "Jeffrey Dietert - Simmons & Company", "On a second topic, I was wondering if you could comment on your expectations for the Keystone Pipeline expansion from Cushing to Port Arthur? I believe that is tied with your capital investment at Port Arthur. And how you see that progressing?", "Joseph Gorder", "Yes, Jeff, this is Joe. Obviously, the issue with the pipeline has been the government permitting here. And we've seen some encouraging news here over the last week or so. The State Department, I think, has come to a conclusion that Canadian crude is really important to our national energy security. Hillary Clinton in a speech just a week or so ago made a comment that although she's not signed off on the permit for the project that she is inclined to do so. And the following day, four of the international labor unions, which are representing a significant number of workers, tell that or urging the State Department to approve the permit to Keystone. So we expect now that sometime after the elections, we're going to see that presidential permit getting executed. It might be as late as the second quarter of '11, but we expect it to happen. Now that was just about three to six players of the original plan, which have [indiscernible] being completed by the end of 2012. Now we're looking probably at quarter 2 of 2013. And just by way of an update on the status of the project, they've got 100% of the pipe into pump stations that have been purchased. 60% of the right of way for the entire project has been taken care of, and the 75% of the piece from Cushing to the Gulf Coast is in place. The labor contracts have been signed. The construction contracts are close to being awarded. And so everything is just proceeding as we would expect. Now the link from Cushing to Port Arthur, which is the one we're interested in is going to be complete about the second quarter of 2012. Now that would bring a certain volume of the heavy sour Canadian into the market for us to be able to run it at Port Arthur in advance of the completion of the overall Keystone, which again would be the second quarter of '13.", "Jeffrey Dietert - Simmons & Company", "What's the capacity that would be available to Port Arthur in the second quarter of '12 and then for the second quarter of '13 as well? How do those compare?", "Joseph Gorder", "Jeff, the capacity from Cushing to Port Arthur is somewhere around 450,000 barrels a day. Now I don't think it will run at that kind of rate because you're not going to have the supply in Cushing yet at that point in time to drive the volume. I really don't have a good answer for you short term. I would guess maybe 100,000 a day when that segment comes on that ultimately going up to that 450,000 mark.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "Any update on the potential TCEQ settlement discussions? I know some of your competitors have settle there with the EPA. And I'd love to hear Bill's views on California Prop 23.", "Kimberly Bowers", "This is Kim. But Bill came over there and annnounced with EPA last Friday. And we are still reviewing that now, but we are very actively working with TCEQ [indiscernible], and we anticipate that will happen before the end of the year. So things are moving well there, and discussions are progressing at this stage.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "And Kim, do you think recent settlement arrangements have been becoming the accurate zip code for cost? Or do you have any estimates that you could share with us there? Range?", "Kimberly Bowers", "At this stage, I don't know that we see any additional costs coming with our new costs [ph] in process. I mean, you administer deposits that is going through it, but no capital will be seen.", "William Klesse", "On AB32 and then Prop 23, of course, if I said what I really think I'd get into trouble. However, Governor Schwarzenegger and the Mayor of LA, they don't see any problems with APEC. But for those who don't know, AB32 is a cap and trade, low-carbon fuel that reduces it back to 1990 levels [indiscernible] power where 1/3 has to be renewable. It is really an anti-fossil fuel law. It was only 13  pages, but it's more seem to have very large potential impact. If we fail to win Prop 23, the cost to the consumer in California is clearly going to go up. And I guess we'll get the opportunity down the road to say, \"We told you so.\" And it will all be passed through to the consumer as the companies aren't going to able to absorb this or they're going to go out of business or makes the playing field on level with imports. Valero has 1,600 employees in California because people ask us why are we involved. We employ on average about 900 contractors permanently. We've invested this year in California about $500 million. Our investment in California is $3.8 billion. We pay taxes. We pay property taxes of $27 million, sales and use taxes of $20-some million. So obviously, we are in California as a good neighbor, and some of the [indiscernible] are extremely disappointing. The opposition has been able to characterize this issue as Texas oil companies. We've been flattered as I'm sure Tesoro is that we're now a big oil. We thought we're independent. This is about George really [ph] on dirty companies and dirty polluters, yet this is about CO2. It's not about other stuff, it's CO2. We talked about the green -- the opposition talks about the green industry, and I'll say to you what jobs? If this continues, the jobs are going to be in Nevada, Arizona and China. The building trades in Northern California have unemployment in the range of 30%. Those are real jobs for real people. I'm surprised no one really asked why the Silicon Valley and venture capitalists are throwing so much money at this. They have though been able to shift the debate away from the consumer impacts to the issues I just mentioned. People really don't understand that this is a CO2 regulation bill. It is the first law in the United States that's actually addressing this. But we'll see what happens when people vote on Tuesday. And for anybody listening to the call because we have a lot of people on this call, if you're in California, I hope you do vote. And for some of the companies that I know listening to this call, for the ones that are [indiscernible] on this issue, we appreciate your help.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "How about New York? I don't know if that's going to help you though.", "William Klesse", "No, I don't think that will help, but we get a lot of people listening to this call.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Gilman from The Benchmark Company.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "Was Paulsboro profitable in the third quarter, Mike?", "William Klesse", "I'm going to answer that. We give out data that deals by regions, and we continue to do that. Obviously, the cracks were better in the second quarter. You can look at our regional data. But historically, we don't give out this kind of data. So we realize that there were a lot of quotes made the other day, but that's not the way we do it.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "Bill, have you reached a definitive decision barring any massive changes in the environment to restart Aruba when the maintenance is completed?", "William Klesse", "Same definitive, I suppose, can be a little bit of relative term. It is our plan to start up when we finish middle to end of December or early in January. From a supply chain perspective, it works for us. We're actually short jet in our system here, the way we do our marketing. And we'll also be short cat crack charge stock or VTO [ph] in the first quarter because of our turnarounds we've got going at Port Arthur. So as long as the markets stay relative to where we are, and our perspectives stays where it is, yes, we're going to start up. And I have maintained that decision will be made as we get closer to when the maintenance is completed. We'll wound up [ph] having to complete a rebuild a player there, replace the player that slowed down or at least extended our maintenance effort.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "Bill, at a more strategic level, given your bullish diesel outlook, amongst the slate of potential growth-oriented projects, is there any consideration being given to a hydrocracker in Texas City?", "William Klesse", "It has been, not today. What we're going to do is finish the two hydrocrackers that we're half done with, and they are extremely large-capital projects. We've given a lot of data out to the market here over the last several presentations. But basically, Port Arthur, I think, is $800 million to finish and St. Charles is $600 million to finish on top of the other stuff. And we're going to check those numbers, but I think they're right. And so we are playing here [indiscernible] just to finish those projects. We've also added a couple of hydrogen plants that have excellent economics. Go ahead, Rick.", "Richard Marcogliese", "Mark, let me just say a couple of other comments. We actually installed or mount hydrocracker in our Houston refinery in 2007, which actually serves both Texas City and Houston. In addition, Texas City already has on the ground one of our largest gas/oil hydrotreaters in the system. So it actually has very good hydro processing capability today. And so that's why we don't have an investment targeted there in a way we've already made the investment for both Houston and Texas City.", "William Klesse", "Yes, we saw that in hydrocrack field in [indiscernible]. I just comment because Aruba gets a lot of conversation, so let me just go back there. And you just mentioned, this is a decent asset with good potential, good people. We've got a good harbor, great logistics. The business environment under the current Prime Minister is much better. I think they found out tourism isn't something that you can always count on. It's much better. We have -- and I'm going to say a business-friendly relationship there. And looking at some of the policies, we got a question on the flex permits earlier. But if you look at some of the policies that happened in the United States today, maybe Aruba is even more business-friendly than in the United States. So we think there is value there, and we're positioning ourselves to target Brazil.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "Mid-Continent margins were quite a bit stronger than what we were looking for. I was wondering, did the crude slate changed appreciatively, particularly are there any more WTI in that region than the case previously?", "Michael Ciskowski", "I don't think it changed appreciably, Mark. I mean, we ran as much WTI as we could.", "Joseph Gorder", "Mark, one other factor. In April this year, we completed the revamp on the Memphis cat cracker. So to the extent we had better realizations in the third quarter, we had better operating performance at the Memphis plant.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.", "Paul Cheng", "Mike, can you tell me that some balance sheet items, what is market value of your inventory in excess of LIFO? And what is the working capital, including the cash?", "Michael Ciskowski", "The market value in excess of our LIFO is $4.9 billion. Current assets, about $11.9 billion. Current liabilities, about $8.2 billion, and our net working capital there is $3.7 billion.", "Paul Cheng", "That's just including the cash, right?", "Michael Ciskowski", "Yes, it is.", "Paul Cheng", "And my understanding, [indiscernible] thinking a loss or trading gain or loss in the quarter?", "Michael Ciskowski", "We have about $16 million in profits in the quarter.", "Paul Cheng", "$16 million.", "Michael Ciskowski", "Yes, sir.", "Paul Cheng", "And this is for Rich. Rich, can you share with us what is the spring 2011 turnaround schedule may look like?", "Richard Marcogliese", "Sure. And we issued a press release on this, but let me add a little color to it. We have a very heavy turnaround workload planned for the first quarter of '11. We'll have a plant-like turnaround at the Benicia refinery, that will be in January. It would be about 36 days. We'll have a very large turnaround in Port Arthur. We'll take down a large cruise train and the coker. This turnaround will last 55 days or more, and it is basically set on the project to replace all six cokers. We also have a very large cat cracker revamp at St. Charles. This will be in the February, March time frame. It will be 55 days or longer where we are actually gutting and rebuilding about half of this, and all the second cat cracker are going to converted to more or less conventional riser FCC. We have a yard, more plant-wide turnaround in March. That would be 40 days long. And then we have a hydrocracker turnaround at McKee in March, 24 days in duration.", "Paul Cheng", "And then a final one maybe for Mike. In addition to the Cameron Highway Pipeline that you guys sold. Is there any additional pipeline asset that is sitting on your portfolio?", "Michael Ciskowski", "We have some logistics assets, but they're not material like the Cameron Highway System.", "William Klesse", "Well, the main difference with Cameron Highway is we have pipelines. We have gathering systems. We have an interest in the pipeline between McKee and El Paso. There are several assets down in the Port Arthur area. But the Cameron Highway Pipeline was not a strategic asset to us. And it was clearly worth more to an MLP. So we have a non-strategic asset worth more to the MLP and so that's why we took action.", "Paul Cheng", "And since you talked about Aruba, is there any update about the potential sales or any negotiation that you can share at this point?", "William Klesse", "There is no update. We're focusing on exactly what I answered for Mark earlier.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "Bill, you've been pretty candid about you're kind of stance on the macroenvironment. And I'm just curious, with the new CapEx budget going into next year, including some growth in spending, would you characterize that as kind of a more kind of constructive outlook on the macro? Or is that really just a function of capital being deployed on the balance sheet, which is contributing in the idea of just going ahead and pushing that forward and finishing up those projects?", "William Klesse", "No, I think next year is going to be better than this year. We still believe and I'm told all the time, we're having an economic recovery. Valero sells fuel. I think if you look at least our 2009 data, 81% of our output is gasoline, diesel and jet. So we're fuel, and so we need people back to work. We need people driving their cars and trucks moving and people flying. So we see the economic recovery happening, it's just slow. So we think our margins will be good next year. We think we'll have a better year than we've had this year. And this year, considering it's worked out reasonably well. So with that in mind, we believe that. Now on the hydrocrackers, if you look at the world, diesel fuel is growing at least 2x faster than gasoline's growing. It's already a 25 million barrel a day business in the world versus gasoline in the 22 million or 23 million barrels a day. We've mentioned that of the U.S. Gulf Coast, we believe we can export. And these hydrocrackers, well, let me add one other point, you can see that the diesel [ph] crack today is at least twice the gasoline crack. It may be almost 3x the gasoline crack in the Gulf Coast. So it's clearly advantageous to make our growth spec relatively [indiscernible] for diesel. That part said, we also believe, as Mike said in his speaker notes, that natural gas prices are going to stay low for the foreseeable future. And in a hydrocracker, you convert a natural gas to hydrogen and you put the hydrogen in a hydrocracker, we get a liquid volume gain of about 30%, 25% to 30%. So in a way, it's a gas-to-liquids operation. So we see these projects as good value-added projects for our shareholder. We already are basically halfway into them. All the equipment sitting at the site. So we think it is on our shareholders' interest to finish these. So between the economy getting better, selling fuel, diesel, thinking natural gas, we think they're the kind of projects that we think we were right on. We just weren't anticipating the collapse in 2008.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "There's been some recent announcements on the build-out of like compressed natural gas to fuel the trucking fleet with natural gas. And I'm just curious for, one, have you looked at any of that for your retail sites? And secondly, does that cause you any concern on potential [indiscernible] demand growth into the future as far as that aiding into that growth?", "William Klesse", "We have not looked at that for our retail sites. Would be a concern? It's not a concern in the near term. But we did say, I just said, we see natural gas at very low numbers relative to much, much higher oil prices, so there is an economic incentive there. But we'll have to see how that develops, and then you almost get into the fixed-base operation where trucking, it needs to come back to a place where you can refuel because to build the infrastructure in the marketplace, it's going to take no lot longer. There is an economic driver there, I'm sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chi Chow with Macquarie Capital.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "Bill, I don't mean to open the can of worms for you on this, but on Prop 23, it certainly looks like the recent polls indicate that the measure is not going to pass. So in that scenario, how does Valero respond to the cap and trade provisions and the low carbon fuel provisions of AB32? And how do you see the situation playing out in the state?", "William Klesse", "Well, I'm not going to see the price point [ph] until Tuesday night. And so unless the voters vote -- but then as to the second part, we're in business in California, it'll just continue. And we'll see what the actual regs look like, and then we'll take actions around them.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "How concerned are you? And can you meet the low carbon fuel specs as they are laid out right now going forward?", "Richard Marcogliese", "Well, I mean, to a certain extent, some of that is substitution with electric. I mean, it's more of a fuel mix question than it actually would be a refinery production.", "William Klesse", "I guess, we can't really answer you very well here. Rich gave you -- we don't have the rules or regulations or how it's all going to work. I mean, in a way, the low carbon fuels is an electric car mandate, okay. So I mean, we just have to let this play out, Chi. I guess, we're not giving you good answer because we don't have one.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "Maybe one final question on the Ethanol side. How do you view the current situation of the Ethanol subsidies and the import tariff renewals?", "Richard Marcogliese", "First of all, I guess, our Ethanol margins improved a lot from the second quarter to the third, and we even seen further improvements going to the fourth quarter. And even though corn prices are up, they're up to about $5.60 a bushel, ethanol prices, they've been even faster. It's been good demand. Ethanol is now selling above gasoline by about $0.35 a gallon. So with the $0.45 blender's credit, it's still possible to win by about $0.10 a gallon. So we're seeing our margins do quite well. The demand is up. And as far as the be E15, I don't think that's going to have any short-term impact at all because the warranty situation, and that is really good for 2007, newer cars, it's kind of a problem. Retail has offered multiple grades. So I think E10 is going to be the predominant fuel over the near term. As far as the import tariff, $6.25 a gallon, I think it's irrelevant. We're seeing no imports today. Brazilian ethanol is actually more expensive than U.S. ethanol even without the import tariff, so it's kind of a nonfactor. If anything we're seeing, this export of ethanol, may be into Canada, some into Europe because the U.S. is really the lowest ethanol prices around. So all in all, I think the business is doing good just on economic alone. The subsidy is not really a factor today, so there is blending economic, and the tariff is not a factor because of Brazilian ethanol being more expensive than U.S.", "Chi Chow - Tristone Capital", "And do you think that situation carries forward, that if, again, both of those, you mean, nonfactors?", "Richard Marcogliese", "Well, at some point, if Brazilian ethanol were to get really cheap or they expand their capacity more than their local demand. Yes, potentially, it could come here. But I don't see that happening over the near-term. Their demand keeps going up faster than their supply to us. So I don't see that changing over the near to intermediate term, long term. As far as the subsidy, most of this year, yes, ethanol is actually cheaper than gasoline. So the subsidy is really not a factor today. It allows the blender to capture some of the tax that ethanol is selling above gasoline. It goes back and forth. So I think the fact that mandate is actually higher so the ethanol plants will have to run and have to have margins to run. It always emphasize the fact that our plans, given the corn bill, we don't have drilling cost to get the corn bill market. We actually buy our corn, our actual corn caps right now is about $30.50 per bushel under the seedbox, which gives us about $0.11 under the seedbox right there. And if you look at some of these destination plants, they have to actually rail the seed from Chicago area or the Midwest to destinations. They're paying above the boxes. I feel like we have at least $0.20 a gallon margin advantage over the ethanol plant. So I think that we've got a very low cost base in our plants. We are taking advantage on location and the costs.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "Of the capital projects that you guys have out to 2013, I know you said you only have the capital remaining on the new hydrocrackers basically. But are those capital costs basically lock in? Is there any chance or any risk that those costs are going to be higher? Or I mean, is there any benefit that it could be lower?", "Richard Marcogliese", "Well, the costs are locked in on the major equipment. As Bill mentioned, before '11, major equipment is actually laying on the ground, so it's bought and paid for. We are in the process of bidding out inside the battery limit construction. What I would tell you about that is our assessment of construction market is that conditions are favorable. It's likely that they will come in at lower costs than one we originally anticipated the construction when there's a lot of demand for fuel construction services. So we are not locked in yet, but we would say that going forward, conditions are favorable relative to what we've got.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jacques Rousseau with RBC.", "Jacques Rousseau - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "Just one quick follow-up on AB32. I had seen a quote attributed to Valero of a potential cost of $177 million a year if AB32 is enacted. And obviously, as you've said, there's a lot of uncertainty at this point. But I was just curious, what type of assumptions you're thinking in terms of potential costs for carbon credits?", "Kimberly Bowers", "This is Kim. Again, it is really hard to get a meaningful estimate at this point in time. But the regulation, the cap and trade rules are not out yet, and that for us clearly has the potential for expense there. Our stationary Tier II [indiscernible] refineries, about 3.75 million tons per year. If you factor that in, you have like a $20 credit costs, that's $75 million a year right there. The carbon fee itself just to regulate us is $45 million a year. So those are the kind of numbers that we have. But other than working with normal, we have [indiscernible] emissions in our report until those, the cap and trade fuel facility [ph] issue and evaluate it. We're not in very good position to give out a meaningful estimate.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Just on the $100 million of costs. is that inclusive or exclusive of the savings you get, which you've disclosed for things like SEC revamps in Memphis and St. Charles? And then just how you're thinking about pension liabilities given that we're now in an interest rate environment. I know you've given disclosure of the sensitivity to a 25-basis-point move in interest rates.", "William Klesse", "Well, the $100 million is really broken down between in-house here at corporate and then out in the field. We're not counting the benefit from revamping the MSTC or anything. It's more in items, for instance, strategic sourcing areas...", "Richard Marcogliese", "Locally, yes, I can add a little color to that. First of all, let me precede it by saying we are Salomon-driven on our performance metrics, and we benchmark our operation. We participate in the industry surveys every two years, but we track these things on a monthly basis. We would not include project benefits in this $100 million reduction goal. It would be more toward operating cost reduction. For example, we think in the refining system, 2010 cost will come in $70 million lower than the equivalent at 2009 controllable costs. It's a combination of focused energy stewardship program to support efficiency. Personnel headcount reduction, overtime reduction, contractor reduction, more efficient use of outside services, chemicals and catalyst cost reduction, which refers to the strategic sourcing group that Bill mentioned, and then, an overall focus on plot very on the order liability. Fewer pump repairs, we deliver nation, more reliable plant operations so it's a number of things and again, value added just in the refinery system is about $70 million this year.", "William Klesse", "And we have a never rigorous program here. We let the accounting department keeps track of it for us and with that big and we do it. I know some of you guys kind of laugh a little bit on some of the items, but this is a detailed business. And we will save somewhere between $1 million to $2 million just on our printing, copying and paper costs here in this company, and we'll realize that next year. So I mean that stuff adds up. On your second question, Mike is going to answer.", "Michael Ciskowski", "On the pension, it does appear -- I mean, it depends on where interest rates are in the year obviously, but they are lower than the, what, the interest discount factor was last year. So it does appear PBO [ph] is going up at the end of this year. We have contributed $54 million so far this year, too, against to fund our DB plan. And we expect to make another $100 million contribution here by the end of the year.", "William Klesse", "We'll still be underfunded. I would remind you that we were totally funded at the end of 2007. And this management team, if I go through the end of the year, will have contributed $750 million to our pension fund over the last four years.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Gilman with The Benchmark Company.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "Did you give an indication on working capital release on the Paulsboro sale?", "Michael Ciskowski", "$275 million is our estimate at this time.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "And earnings on shops, I saw a wire story, $25 million, $30 million, is that reasonably accurate? And where does it show up in the financials?", "Michael Ciskowski", "That is reasonably accurate. It shows up in other income, interest and other income.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "On the acquisitions, I just want to ask a strategic question. Are you thinking of European or U.K. refinery as an export asset or you're actually interested in domestic retail assets as well given, obviously, the growth in that area? I'm just curious as to what exactly you got in mind?", "William Klesse", "It's both. Some of the assets we're looking at, obviously, serves the local market, and a couple of others are geared more to exports. Obviously, one of the packages has some retail assets with it. And if that's what happens, we'd be in that business. But we're refiners. We are marketers, and this fits us. And we're not marketing or having to market in the United States. If you'll remember, we market quite extensively in Eastern Canada.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "So just to be clear, those five major refineries for sale, are we talking about single-refinery deal or could you be looking at multiple assets?", "William Klesse", "Multiple assets.", "Operator", "And there are no further remarks. Do you have any closing remarks, Mr. Smith?", "Ashley Smith", "Yes. Thank you,  Brandis. I just want thank everyone for listening to today's call.

With me today are Bill Klesse, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Ciskowski, our CFO; Joe Gorder, our Chief Commercial Officer; Kim Bowers, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel and John Bernier, our Executive Vice President.", "If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact me after the call.", "Before we get started, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we described in our filings with the SEC. Now I'll turn the call over to Mike.", "Michael Ciskowski", "Thanks, Ashley, and thank you for joining us today. As noted in the release, we reported fourth quarter 2010 income from continuing operations of $180 million or $0.32 per share. This number includes a $36 million after-tax gain or $0.06 per share on the sale of our interest in the Cameron Highway oil pipeline and an after-tax loss of $80 million or $0.14 per share from the mark-to-market impact of positions related to the forward sales of refined products. Excluding those items, our results would've been $0.40 per share. ", "I should note that the loss from discontinued operations shown in the financial tables relates to the Delaware City refinery that was sold in the second quarter of 2010 and the Paulsboro refinery that was sold in the fourth quarter of 2010. The fourth quarter 2010 results from discontinued operations include a non-cash pretax charge of $980 million related to the Paulsboro refinery. ", "Fourth quarter 2010 operating income was $378 million versus an operating loss of $135 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The $513 million increase in operating income was mainly due to higher margins for diesel and gasoline, plus better discounts for low quality feedstocks, all of which contributed to a 49% increase in refinery throughput margins compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. ", "Looking at the Gulf Coast margins versus WTI, the ULSD margin more than doubled from $6.33 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $13.22 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2010. The Gulf Coast gasoline margin increased nearly 50%, from $3.90 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $5.76 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2010. ", "Looking at the feedstock discounts, the Maya heavy sour crude oil discount to WTI expanded 40% from $6.72 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $9.40 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2010. Another way to look at this is as a percentage of WTI, so the Maya discount increased from 8.8% of WTI in the fourth quarter of 2009 to 11.1% of WTI in the fourth quarter of '10, which is a 26% improvement year-over-year. ", "So far in the first quarter of 2011, benchmark margins and heavy sour feedstock discounts versus WTI have been strong for this time of year. Compared to January 2010, Gulf Coast gasoline margins are up 75%, ULSD margins are up 152% and Maya discounts on an absolute basis are up 8%. ", "I should point out that while margins and heavy sour crude discounts versus WTI have improved from this time last year, WTI has been trading in a discounted range when compared to other light sweet crudes in the medium sour. ", "Our fourth quarter 2010 refinery throughput volume averaged 2.2 million barrels per day, an increase of 205,000 barrels per day or 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Refinery cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter of '10 were $3.64 per barrel. ", "Cash operating expenses were lower than the third quarter and guidance, primarily due to a decline in energy costs. Our Retail and Ethanol segments also performed well and turned in excellent full year results. ", "U.S. retail had $19 million of operating income in the fourth quarter and $200 million for the year, making it the second-to-best year for our U.S. Retail segment. ", "Canada retail had $42 million of operating income in the fourth quarter and $146 million for the year, a record high for the Canada operation. Our combined retail operating income of $346 million for the full year 2010 is the second-highest year for our Retail segment. ", "Something I should note in Retail is that we have changed how we report our credit card transaction processing fees. To reduce the volatility in our expenses, these fees have been reclassified from operating expenses to cost of sales. This change decreases fuel margin and lowers operating expense, but does not affect the operating income. The U.S. and Canada retail operating highlights presented in our financial tables have been updated to reflect this reclassification. ", "Our Ethanol segment earned $70 million of operating income in the fourth quarter, making it the best quarter in 2010. We also achieved our highest quarterly production rate at 3.25 million gallons per day. For the year, the Ethanol segments set a record high, with operating income of $209 million. ", "Since the initial acquisition less than two years ago, our Ethanol business has generated a total of $373 million in operating income and $427 million of EBITDA, which is 56% of the plant's total purchase price. ", "In the fourth quarter, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation were $164 million. The $25 million increase in G&A expense compared to the third quarter was mainly due to a $21 million increase in environmental reserves. Fourth quarter depreciation and amortization expense was $362 million, and net interest expense was $121 million. The effective tax rate on continuing operations in the fourth quarter was 46%, which was higher than the third quarter and our guidance due to the tax depreciation change that resulted in an unexpected tax loss, which required the reversal of previously recorded tax deductions. ", "With respect to our balance sheet at the end of December, total debt was $8.3 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.3 billion, and we had nearly $4 billion of additional liquidity available. At the end of the fourth quarter, our debt-to-cap ratio, net of cash, was 25%.", "Regarding cash flows for the fourth quarter, we paid $28 million in dividends and received $877 million in cash proceeds from the sale of our interest in Cameron Highway and the Paulsboro refinery. I should also point out that we received a $160 million note from PBF for the Paulsboro refinery that is due in December of this year. ", "Also in the fourth quarter, we issued $300 million of tax-exempt bonds related to the St. Charles refinery and capital spending was $629 million, which includes $125 million of turnaround in catalyst costs. ", "For 2010, our capital spending was $2.3 billion. Within this amount, we completed two major regulatory spending programs. One was the newly installed scrubber for the cat cracker and coker Benicia, which also included energy efficient heaters for the crude and vacuum units. The other regulatory program was to reduce benzene levels in our gasoline pool for the federal MSAT II rule that began this year. ", "For 2011 spending, our preliminary estimate is $2.9 billion, which reflects our decision to accelerate the Hydrocracker projects at Port Arthur in St. Charles to more quickly capture their economic benefits. The 2011, capital spending estimate incorporates significant turnaround activity in the first quarter and the early part of the second quarter at several of our refineries. The work includes significant reliability investments for a revamp of the St. Charles cat cracker and replacement of the Port Arthur coke drums. Following these turnarounds, we expect improved plant performance. ", "Our companywide focus on cost savings continued to yield results. In 2010, we achieved $225 million in pretax cost savings, far surpassing our original goal of $100 million, and bringing our cumulative cost savings over the past four years to $619 million. ", "Our 2011 goal is an additional $100 million in pretax cost savings. These efforts provide a valuable offset to increases and other costs that are a normal part of our business. ", "In summary, we made significant progress over the last year on our strategic priorities of managing costs, maintaining our investment grade credit rating, optimizing our portfolio and advancing our economic growth projects. In 2011, our focus continues on safely operating our assets, improving reliability, capturing more cost savings and continuing to evaluate opportunities to improve the competitiveness of our portfolio. Now I'll turn it over to Ashley to cover the earnings model assumptions.", "Ashley Smith", "Thanks, Mike. For modeling our first quarter operations, you should expect the refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: The Gulf Coast at 1.31 million to 1.34 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 380,000 to 390,000 barrels per day; the Northeast at 190,000 to 200,000 barrels per day; and the West Coast at 210,000 to 220,000 barrels per day. The Gulf Coast rates include major turnaround activity at St. Charles, Port Arthur and Houston, plus it includes the effects of the recently restarted Aruba refinery that is continuing to build to planned rates. The Northeast consists only of the Qu\u00e9bec refinery and the West Coast rates include the impact of a plant-wide turnaround at our Benicia refinery. The Mid-Continent rates reflect the impact of the plant-wide turnaround at our Ardmore refinery in March. ", "Refinery cash operating expenses are expected to be around $3.85 per barrel in the first quarter. Regarding our ethanol operations in the first quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 3.3 million gallons per day and operating expenses should average approximately $0.37 per gallon, including $0.03 per gallon for non-cash costs, such as depreciation and amortization. ", "With respect to some of the other items for the first quarter, we expect G&A expense, excluding depreciation to be around $140 million. Net interest expense should be around $105 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be around $375 million. And our effective tax rate should be approximately 35%. Andrea, we will now open the call to questions. Andrea, feel free to prompt that we are opening the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  Your first question comes from Blake Fernandez [Howard Weil Incorporated].", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "You mentioned the disconnect between WTI and Brent. And I'm trying to just get a little more color on how you see that potentially benefiting the Valero system and how sustainable you see that and how that plays into the export arbitrage dynamic that's currently in place?", "Joseph Gorder", "Blake, good morning. This is Joe. Well, it is a little crazy out there, isn't it? I mean this morning, with the stats that we got, the already wide Brent WTI spread has increased a bit further. It's up at 1030 in the prompt month, so we continue to see a divergence there. If you look at what's going on, we've got high inventories of crude in Cushing, which are putting pressure on WTI, and then we've got strong demand for Brent, both from the Far East and it's pulling not only the Brent barrels, but also West African barrels. There's a high desolate yield in that crude and they've had a cold winter and so they're pulling those barrels. So there's been strength there. Now what we expect going forward a bit is that as the winter winds down, Chinese buying is going to pause for the lunar New Year and there\u2019ll be some seasonal turnarounds and so we expect the Brent prices to decline here a little bit.  However, the length in Cushing is going to continue to push WTI. Now if you look at what we're doing specifically, we\u2019re running as much WTI as we can, and we're doing that at McKee, Ardmore and then we have barrels in Three Rivers at price off at WTI. So when I looked at what we did in the quarter, there was maybe around 300,000 barrels of WTI base crude that were running. So we're running as much as we can. And other than doing that, there's not much change to our crude slate.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "My second question was on M&A.  Just want to confirm that I'm kind of looking at this correctly. I know you state you have over $3 billion of cash on hand at the end of the year. It seems to me that any kind of potential acquisition would be fairly easy to put together an accretive deal, given that, that cash is sitting there earning money market rates. Is it fair to believe that you would be using that cash balance in order to potentially put together a deal?", "William Klesse", "This is Klesse. If we did a deal, that will be true up to a certain size obviously.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Gilman.[The Benchmark Company]", "Eli Bauman", "Eli Bauman for Mark Gilman. You expect to blend ethanol up to the 15% level at 2011. And given your expectations, where do you expect REN charges to be versus 2010?", "William Klesse", "This is Klesse again. We do not expect to blend up to the 15% level until there's a much clearer picture, as to -- like the whole product identification, car warranties, and so frankly, we want some regulatory cover on that. We learned our lesson with MTBE. As to RENs, the future is our guess is as good as yours. However, today, it's still economic to blend ethanol. And that obviously impacts the value of RENs.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "A question on the CapEx. I know you gave a range -- but I believe you mentioned you expect to accelerate the spending with that $300 million being in the strategic economic growth category. If you did spend to that 29 level, does that change the estimated completion dates or move those forward for Memphis, St. Charles or if you could talk maybe a little bit more about where the acceleration might be within your projects?", "William Klesse", "It's a good question. The acceleration is basically on our hydrocrackers at Port Arthur and St. Charles. Our plan has been to complete the Port Arthur hydrocracker by the end of '12, and what we're trying to do is move it up into the mid year. And then the other piece of it is to complete the St. Charles hydrocracker by the end of 2012. We've mentioned many times that we have now approximately $600 million invested in each project and to complete the hydrocracker only at St. Charles is another $600 million and to complete the one at Port Arthur is about $800 million and then there's some other stuff that goes around it so that you add about another $200 million at each site. So that ties out to the table that Ashley has given you all, but yes, it's to accelerate those projects and have them both done by the end of '12.  It's not on the hydrogen plants we\u2019re doing at Memphis and at McKee. We've had fast track the whole time in the first quarter kind of March of next year, we should have those done and operating.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "If we think about the cash balance question at 3.3. I mean, should we expect to -- if there's no acquisition to carry that cash balance as you know, the asset market really remains open and expanding? Or when would you consider returning to shareholders or either a buyback or even other internal projects? How should we think about that, as we move through 2011?", "William Klesse", "Well, we consider that all the time, as to the best use of our cash in the sense of a long-term shareholder value. So that's always on the radar screen. We're always looking whether we should increase dividend or buy shares or invest in our assets, but we are driven on long-term and that is a key part of our strategy. But generally speaking, we are holding higher cash, as I've stated many times, and we will tend to hold a higher cash balance than we have in the past. Now all that said, obviously we've been very open that we're looking at some of these assets that are on the market, and we intend to continue to do that because we do believe we can improve our overall competitiveness. This is a refining business. We get better access to the Atlantic Basin, with assets in Western Europe, so we're doing all of the things that we have talked about in the past.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Dietert with Simmons.", "Jeffrey Dietert - Simmons & Company", "It appears that you've sold some product forward and could you talk about your forward hedging and how much volume you've hedged of gasoline or diesel or how you've approached that?", "William Klesse", "What we have sold forward is approximately 10% of our estimated 2011 volume. It's not exactly ratable through all of the quarters, as we have different expectations as to each crack spread. And what we've done is sold the crack forward, okay, it's not per se the product. Obviously, we've made the wrong call. I won't deny that. We underestimated the Brent WTI spread. I won't deny that. We had been very successful doing this. I think some of you know this. But over the last five years, we've made over $600 million in what I call discretionary trading. We are marking it to market versus using hedge accounting. That's how we elected to do this and so we have our position. So it will impact our business this year. You can figure it out. These positions were put on last year. Clearly, we've had a much colder winter, so I would say so much for global warming. But the French strikes had a larger impact. As Joe mentioned a few minutes ago, WTI continues to be suppressed. Global demand has been good and so the year is starting out great and yes, we've hedged about 10% of our crack, but everything is looking so darn good. It's wonderful. But we did miss the Brent WTI going this wide. And Joe said that we expected to come down some and we do. There are issues in the market, but the forward curve also indicates it's going to come down quite a bit as well. So that's kind of where we are and I will acknowledge that it got so darn good and we love it but we have a position on, that\u2019s not that great.", "Jeffrey Dietert - Simmons & Company", "You still get the benefit on the another 90%. Joe, on the WTI versus Gulf Coast crudes, what do you think the market reaction might be? Do you think reduction on product going up -- oil going up seaway into Cushing reduction of volume is going up cap line? You anticipate the industry will react to these differentials between WTI and the Gulf Coast and bring that back down? Or is this going to be a long-term issue?", "Joseph Gorder", "Yes. It's a very good question. I think it's going to be a longer-term issue. What we've got to do ultimately to get WTI back in parity is to have Cushing debottlenecked. And we've got length there today, and you've got more product that's going to be moving into Cushing from Canada. And so that market is going to remain long for some extended period. I think what we've got to do perhaps is quit looking at WTI as the benchmark by which to compare things because it's almost become irrelevant. If you look at the LLS relationship to Maya and Brent relationship to Maya, you maintain very much your normal relationships. It's only when you compare things to TI does it look distorted, and I'll give you an example. In 2010, the WTI, as a percentage of Maya, the discount was 11.6%. Today, it's 6.7%. But if you compare LLS to Maya, it was a 14% discount in '10. It's a 14% discount today. So what we're seeing with TI being so dislocated is cracks to some extent are being overstated. And we're looking at our business on a much broader basis because as I mentioned earlier, TI only really affects us on the three Mid-Continent refineries and we're doing everything we can to take advantage of that. But ultimately, to clean up TI, you're going to have to have Cushing debottlenecked and the crude's going to need to move out.", "William Klesse", "Jeff, I would add to that, that the industry has a way of taking out these arbs [arbitrage]. And so within the constraints of pipelining or transportation or trucking or railing, as these open up, you will see actions happen. Whether -- Seaway is obviously owned by individuals, Capline, you're going to see things begin to take away the arb, if it were to stay this high. But I would also point out that the forward curve doesn't indicate it's going to stay this soft.", "Jeffrey Dietert - Simmons & Company", "Are you trucking or railing Mid-Continent crude down into the Gulf Coast?", "William Klesse", "If it will stay over $10, you're going to see a lot of things happening.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I guess, a little bit of a strategic question going into the maintenance here in the next couple weeks or the first quarter I should say. Typically, this time of year, I guess the industry thinks about coming out of the heating season, doing the turnarounds, then coming out in maximum gasoline mode going into the driving season. But of course cracks are significantly more attractive on distillate right now than they are in gasoline. So I guess my question is how does that impact your thinking as you move into the summer driving season? I guess what's behind this is I'm wondering whether things could actually tighten up in the gasoline front, if folks stay a little bit more skewed towards maximizing distillate. Can you give us some color on how you might think about that? That\u2019d be great.", "William Klesse", "Well, I think gasoline inventories are adequate and my take on gasoline is we need to get people back to work. We need people driving. If you actually look at the demand numbers for gasoline, we had an uptick -- and I'm talking about the U.S. We had an uptick in the last couple weeks of December, but gasoline demand in and of itself is very comparable to last year. So it's going to come up a little bit, as the economy keeps improving, but we don't necessarily see gasoline and I've never represented to any of you that gasoline looks that great. Distillates look a lot better because it's being pulled so heavily from the world, and even with gasoline, there's been more export opportunities. But I think you were also asking, Doug, about turnarounds per se and yes, there's quite a few cat cracker turnarounds going on here in the first quarter but a lot of them end as you get into April. So those facilities are back in operation by then and then it's also for all of us in the industry, we schedule cranes, we schedule workforce, we schedule things like that. So even though we have very good cracks for instance, today, at least relative to WTI, the schedule implies that you just got to stick to it. And it's time for maintenance anyway.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "So I guess, is it reasonable to assume then if you look at the system-wide, and I guess it\u2019s not just a Valero question, it's an industry question. If you look at the system-wide in the U.S., we're running about 30% distillate yield right now, which is about the highest we've seen in a while. Would you expect any meaningful change in that over the next several months?", "William Klesse", "I don't think so. You obviously have economics to make diesel fuel.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Aruba, you brought it back on now obviously. Can you give us a kind of update as to how you're thinking about that facility overall? Is it strategic? Or is it really held for sale? And just some color around the operation would be great.", "William Klesse", "We are bringing it back up. We're not quite all the way, as Ashley stated in the comments. But that asset to us is a very good asset. There's a lot of advantages, excellent tax structure, excellent coking operation, excellent harbors, excellent relationship with the government, so there's a lot of potential there. But we have stated that the refinery needs investment; it needs certain types of conversion units, and what Valero would be interested in is finding a partner to work with us on that facility.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "I just wanted to expand a little bit on Doug's question on the distillate market. Bill, how are you viewing the sustainability of the global distillate market strength? And how do you reconcile that with the high inventory levels we're seeing here in the U.S.?", "William Klesse", "Well, I'll say a few things and then I'll let Joe add anything that he'd like to. Today, we are big exporter of distillates. There's a lot of draw. There's a cold winter. So seasonally, the volumes are generally moving to Europe. We've also sent some jet fuel to Canada, so things like that with the winter season here. What we have seen though, then as we move into our summer, we've had the ability to export volumes to other areas, South America and then down into the lower cone of South America. So the U.S. Gulf Coast refining industry can export and can export diesel and be competitive in the Atlantic Basin and that's what we've been able to do. We've also had gasoline that's primarily been going into the Gulf of Mexico region here export and that's been driven by some of the other refineries in the whole Caribbean, not operating, which has created an opportunity for us. And so, and you know all those places including Cura\u00e7ao, the Isla refinery, which is still shut down. So we believe that we can export. We've said this for many years and that's why we continue to drive our cost structure down on the Gulf Coast because we think we can do it, but it does move around seasonally. Structurally though, Western Europe is somewhere between 500,000 and 600,000 barrels a day short of distillates. You want to add anything?", "Joseph Gorder", "No. I mean, I think that's a great answer.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "What were your export volumes in the fourth quarter for distillates?", "Joseph Gorder", "We did slightly over 200,000 barrels a day.", "William Klesse", "And we produced around 700 in the whole system. So you can see how much we are exporting.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Mike, could you just go over that reclassification, the credit card fees again? I didn't quite catch that.", "Michael Ciskowski", "We moved the credit card fees from selling expenses up into cost of sales. So it's reducing our fuel margin a little bit and then taking out the volatility of our selling expenses.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Cory Garcia with Raymond James.", "Cory Garcia - Raymond James", "Just in sort of relation to crude sourcing, I see you guys have obviously backed off your lighter sour barrels in response to sort of the narrow differential and the blowout in WTIs you guys already referenced. But just hoping you guys will be able to provide any commentary on how you see I guess the supply trend of the sour barrels, particularly in line of what\u2019s happened in the Gulf and sort of Latin American supply. So just sort of pulling back on the lens if there's any structural thoughts, that\u2019d be helpful.", "Joseph Gorder", "Gulf production and medium sour is somewhat stabilized right now, right? We're not seeing a lot of activity that's going to increase production anytime soon. But if you look at generally production of crude in the Gulf region, you've got a pretty good situation I mean, Pemex heavy sour crude production\u2019s stabilized now. It\u2019s about 1.4 million barrels a day. Colombia\u2019s been increasing their production of heavy sour crudes. Brazil\u2019s increasing its production and then ultimately, we'll have a [indiscernible] (49:28) plan in place, which will bring the crude down from the North. So if we look short-term now on an ongoing basis, things look pretty good. Longer-term, it looks even better for the prospects for heavy sour discounts and sour crude discounts in general to remain pretty good. The medium sours would be affected if we had any kind of increase in Saudi production. And obviously, you read yesterday and so did we that there's been some conversation around the fact that they don't want the prices to get too high, which may increase production to some extent, which then of course would put additional pressure on the medium sour discounts. But we're fairly comfortable with what we're seeing right now with sour crudes.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Ashley Smith", "Andrea, if there's no other questions, we'll be glad to conclude the call.", "Operator", "There are no questions.", "Ashley Smith", "Well, thank you for listening to the call today.

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Ashley Smith, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Smith, you may begin.", "Ashley Smith", "Okay, thank you, John. And good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Bill Klesse, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Ciskowski, our CFO, Gene Edwards, our Chief Development Officer, Joe Gorder, our Chief Commercial Officer; Kim Bowers, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Jean Bernier, our Executive Vice President for Corporate Communications, Information Services and Supply Chain Management.", "If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact me after the call.", "Before we get started, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we described in our filings with the SEC.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Mike.", "Michael Ciskowski", "Thanks, Ashley, and thank you for joining us today. As noted in the release, we reported first quarter 2011 income from continuing operations of $104 million or $0.18 per share. This number includes an after-tax loss of $352 million or $0.61 per share on derivative contracts related to forward sales of refined products. These contracts were closed and realized in the first quarter of 2011. Excluding that item, our first quarter earnings would have been $0.79 per share.", "I should note that the loss from discontinued operations shown in the financial tables relates to the Delaware City refinery site and the Paulsboro refinery which were sold in 2010.", "As reported, first quarter 2011 operating income was $244 million, excluding the $542 million pretax loss related to the forward sales. First quarter 2011 operating income was $786 million versus operating income of $4 million in the first quarter of 2010.", "Since the loss on the forward sales was reported in cost of sales, our throughput margins were reduced by $2.86 per barrel across our system. Excluding this item, first quarter throughput margins were $9.91 per barrel, which is an increase of $3.93 per barrel over the first quarter 2010 margins and the highest first quarter margin since 2007. The increase in throughput margins was due to higher diesel and jet fuel margins plus wider discounts for heavy-sour crudes on the Gulf Coast and light-sweet crude in the Mid-Continent.", "I want to highlight that on Page 5 of the earnings release tables, we are showing market prices in terms of Louisiana Light Sweet (sic) [Light Louisiana Sweet] crude oils or LLS. We think LLS is a better indicator of prices for light-sweet crude oils that are waterborne and can move efficiently to key refining markets, especially on the U.S. Gulf Coast. This became important in the first quarter when WTI began to trade significantly below other light-sweet crude oils, such as LLS and Brent, due to significant growth in production and also inventories of crude oils at Cushing. ", "1 of the key drivers of our year-over-year gain in throughput margins was in diesel margins. For example, Gulf Coast ULSD margin per barrel versus LLS increased $6.76 or 99% from $6.83 in the first quarter of 2010 to $13.59 in the first quarter of 2011. Looking at the Gulf Coast gasoline versus LLS, margins per barrel fell from $6.46 in the first quarter of '10 to $3.82 in the first quarter of '11. However, in the second quarter, gasoline margins have rebounded to an April average of around $8 per barrel or $4 higher than the first quarter.", "The other key driver for our margin gain over last year was crude oil discounts. The Maya heavy-sour crude oil discounts versus LLS increased $6.11 from $9.57 in the first quarter of '10 to $15.68 per barrel in the first quarter of '11. The Maya discount has continued to widen in the second quarter with the April average up from $1.58 to $17.26 per barrel. These discounts are important in our Gulf Coast region where we have significant capacity to process heavy-sour crude oils.", "Another benefit for Valero came from WTI pricing at a discount to LLS. This discount increased over $10 per barrel from $0.67 in the first quarter 2010 to $11.08 in the first quarter of 2011. The WTI discount helped our McKee and Ardmore refineries in the Mid-Continent region where the crude oil price is priced at or below WTI. In the second quarter, the WTI discount to LLS has continued to widen from the first quarter, with the April average up around $5 to nearly $16 per barrel.", "We also benefited from crude oil discounts at our Three Rivers refinery, which is in our Gulf Coast region. This refinery recently began to process light-sweet crude oil from the Eagle Ford shale formation in South Texas. In the first quarter, we processed an average of 25,000 barrels per day of Eagle Ford crude at prices similar to WTI, which replaced expensive, waterborne sweet crudes, saving around $11 per barrel in the first quarter.", "We are rapidly working to use more of this discounted crude oil. We're now processing 30,000 barrels per day and expect to be at nearly 40,000 barrels per day in June. And by the end of this year, our Three Rivers refinery should have the ability to process almost 60,000 barrels per day of Eagle Ford crude.", "Now continuing with other items, our first quarter 2011 refinery throughput volume averaged 2.1 million barrels per day. Refinery cash operating expenses in the first quarter were $3.93 per barrel. Cash operating expenses were in line with guidance, but higher than the fourth quarter of 2010 due to the decline in throughput volume mainly caused by turnarounds.", "Our Retail segment reported a good quarter with $66 million of operating income. U.S. Retail had $19 million of operating income in the first quarter, which was even with the fourth quarter of 2010 but down from the first quarter of 2010 on lower fuel margins.", "Canada Retail had $47 million of operating income in the first quarter, which was up $5 million from the fourth quarter of 2010 and up $9 million from the first quarter of '10, mainly on stronger retail fuel margins.", "Our Ethanol segment earned $44 million of operating income in the first quarter. This was down $26 million from the fourth quarter of '10 and down $13 million from the first quarter of 2010 on lower gross margins. However, we did achieve our highest quarterly production rate at 3.3 million gallons per day in the first quarter, which was also in line with guidance.", "In the first quarter, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $130 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $365 million, and net interest expense was $117 million.", "The effective tax rate on continuing operations in the first quarter was 28%, which was lower than the fourth quarter and guidance due to favorable settlements of some tax audits. Excluding those settlements, our effective tax rate on continuing operations for Q1 was 35%.", "Regarding cash flows in the first quarter, capital spending was $737 million, which includes $299 million of turnaround and catalyst capitalist expenditures. And we paid $28 million in dividends. Also in the first quarter, we repaid $210 million in maturing debts, and we purchased the $300 million of tax-exempt bonds related to the St. Charles refinery, which we issued in the fourth quarter of 2010. By purchasing these bonds, we avoid unnecessary interest expense, and we preserve the right to reissue these low-cost bonds if needed.", "With respect to our balance sheet at the end of March, total debt was $7.8 billion, cash was $4.1 billion and our debt-to-cap ratio, net of cash, was 19.5%. At the end of the first quarter, we also had approximately $4 billion of additional liquidity available.", "We remain focused on our strategic priorities, including our 2011 target of $100 million in pretax cost savings, improving the performance of our assets and maintaining our investment-grade credit rating. We will continue to look for earnings-accretive acquisition opportunities, but we will only acquire quality assets at an attractive price like our pending Pembroke acquisition.", "In conclusion, Valero is in great financial shape, and we have significant potential for earnings growth given the strong industry conditions; the recent completion of heavy turnarounds and profit-enhancing projects at our refineries; the Pembroke acquisition that we expect to close in the third quarter; and finally, our economic growth projects, including the hydrocrackers and the hydrogen plants that are on schedule for completion in 2012.", "And now, I'll turn it over to Ashley to cover the earnings model assumptions.", "Ashley Smith", "Okay. thanks, Mike. For modeling our second quarter operations, we expect the refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.42 million to 1.47 million barrels per day, Mid-Continent at 385,000 to 395,000 barrels per day, the Northeast at 190,000 to 200,000 barrels per day and the West Coast at 265,000 to 275,000 barrels per day.", "Refinery cash operating expenses are expected to be around $3.70 per barrel in the second quarter. Regarding our ethanol operations in the second quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 3.3 million gallons per day and operating expenses should average approximately $0.36 per gallon, including $0.03 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization.", "With the respect to some of the other items for the second quarter, we expect G&A expense, excluding depreciation, to be around $140 million; net interest expense should be around $110 million; total depreciation and amortization expense should be around $370 million; and our effective tax rate should be approximately 35%.", "We will now open the call for questions, John.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ed Westlake from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "I guess just to understand Q1, my first question is, \"What's the total net income loss that you had from turnarounds in Q1?\" You mentioned the $0.20 for March. And can you confirm that all the refineries are now back up and running?", "Ashley Smith", "The total turnaround, just turnaround impact, was estimated around $470 million for the first quarter.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And all the refineries are now back up?", "Joseph Gorder", "Yes, all -- we have Port Arthur and Benicia, are back up out of turnaround, and we still have turnarounds -- we're still on progress at Ardmore and they're actually starting up as we speak. And then St. Charles will be starting up in mid-May. That's sort of a status. And after mid-May, we'll essentially be done with our heavy turnaround load.", "Ashley Smith", "And, Ed -- hey, this is Ashley again. That number, the $470 million, that's a pretax number. I just want to clarify. You had ask about net income, but that's a pretax number. It's kind of like a margin number.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay. And then, I guess, the second question is more strategic. You've got good cash on the balance sheet. You've good margins going in Q2. Obviously, you've just mentioned acquisitions, and we know all the refineries that are up for sale. But can you just give us your latest thoughts on the benefits of growth through acquisition as opposed to returning more cash back to shareholders, either via a buyback or perhaps increasing the dividend?", "William Klesse", "At this point -- this is Klesse. At this point in time, we intend to hold the cash on our balance sheet. We do think we're going to have a very good second quarter and rest of the year. Right now, we're consensus, is around $3 a share. We think we'll even be consensus for the year. But we have good projects. We need to finish our hydrocrackers, the hydrogen plants. Our capital spending will be somewhere this year between $3 million and $3.2 million. We'll see. It's all about timing. And then as we get into next year, as we finish those projects, our capital spending load could be just as high as we finish the hydrocrackers. So, right today, we're going to keep our resources. We think, at the end of the day, we will add much more shareholder value by completing all of these projects. And, Ed, you also mentioned acquisitions. Certainly today, the majors are putting some quality refining assets on the market, and we'll continue to look. But as Mike said in his notes to you that we are only looking for quality stuff that can provide real shareholder value. But today, there is opportunity. As I've said before, this management team demonstrated in the past that when we didn't see those opportunities, we bought our shares.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Thanks very much, Bill.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI.", "Doug Terreson - ISI Group Inc.", "On the refinery turnaround maintenance delays, which I think was part of Ed's question, is there any geographic segmentation of note, Ashley? Or would you call that kind of a system-wide situation in the first quarter?", "Ashley Smith", "Yes, the number in the first quarter, most of it was in the Gulf Coast, because that's where most of our turnarounds were.", "Doug Terreson - ISI Group Inc.", "Sure. Okay. And Bill, I wanted to see if you could provide us an updated view on the likely outcome and timing of the ethanol debate in Washington, if you have an updated view in specifically how the tax regime, the blending mandates, the import restrictions may change. And if you think that there are meaningful changes ahead against, in your view, the most likely implications for the market at this time.", "William Klesse", "Well, Doug, if it's okay, I'm going to let Gene answer that.", "Doug Terreson - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay.", "S. Edwards", "Yes, the blender's credit is probably the one that gets the most attention, whether that's going to be maintained or reduced. It's $0.45 a gallon today. In today's market, the ethanol producers are not really capturing it, because ethanol is selling $0.50 a gallon under gasoline right now even before the subsidy. So the blenders are really getting it. So they're actually getting the ethanol $0.50 under, cash at $0.45 blender's credit. They're actually capturing about $0.95 a gallon. We do capture that at our Retail locations, but it's a very small volume compared to the ethanol production we have. So I guess the way I would look at it, even if we didn't have the subsidy today, it wouldn't really change the economics because you still have the mandate and you have to produce some ethanol. Our plants are more competitive than those because of our corn advantage and the economies at scale that we have in our operating costs and such. So this is really not much of a factor. The Brazilian import duty, again, is kind of a nonfactor. Brazilian prices are higher than the East Coast. I think that's a similar message I had told you at the last meeting. So with high gasoline prices there, they're not in a position to be exporting. So right now, there's not a whole lot of policies that really would change our current economics.", "Doug Terreson - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay. Thanks a lot, Gene.", "William Klesse", "However, I would just add, we're in this business and the tax -- the excise tax credit is part of the business. And we look to continue to grow this business in the right opportunity. So it will be phased out over time, we're quite comfortable.", "Doug Terreson - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay. Thanks, Bill.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. I'm going to try a couple, if I may. First one is on crude charge. Obviously, there's a lot of moving parts out there in terms of where the best benefit is, but -- excuse me. Would you please give us an update on, across the system, how you're changing your emphasis on heavy discounted crudes versus the WTI fund to your domestic advantage, if you like. I appreciate the color on Three Rivers, but if you could widen that discussion across the whole system, that would be helpful.", "Joseph Gorder", "Well, Doug, it's Joe. I'll tell you, it honestly hasn't changed that much if you think about it. I mean in the Gulf Coast, we've got very strong heavy-sour discounts and improving medium-sour discounts. And so, it's to our advantage to go ahead and run those crudes to the extent we can. Obviously, our runs of heavy-sours were down in the first quarter. That was largely attributable to the turnaround activity in, most specifically, Port Arthur. But we haven't changed our view and our desire to go ahead and run heavy crudes where we can. As we mentioned before, we run as much WTI-price crude as we can in the Mid-Continent and in south Texas. And because we had the Ardmore turnaround, those volumes were down a little bit in the first quarter, also, to about 245,000 barrels a day. But our May refinery operating plan has those increasing again up to that 300,000-barrel range. And the other place that I'd mention is the West Coast. And on the West Coast, we've got, of course, the issue with AB32, the Low-Carbon Fuel Standard and the associated high-carbon-intensity crude issues. And what we've done there is adjusted the slate a little bit to avoid some of the absolute high-carbon-intensity crudes, and we're running crudes from different sources. So overall, I'd say those are the changes in the slates, but nothing material.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Joe, could I -- I would just ask you to elaborate a little bit. We've all focused, obviously, on the WTI discount to LLS or Brent or whatever benchmark you choose to use, but could you maybe just walk us through the mechanics as to how we end up with a Maya discount currently? On our numbers anyway, it's about $18 below LLS. How's that price set? And how sustainable you think that is even if WTI maybe narrows at some point.", "Joseph Gorder", "Okay, well, the price is a formula-based pricing, as you know. And 40% of it is high-sulfur fuel oil -- 3% fuel oil. And it, right now, is being very well supplied out of Europe. And in fact, high-sulfur fuel oil in Europe is at a $23 discount to Brent. So you've got a major component of the Maya formula that's weak. You have WTS as a major component of the Maya formula. It is also very weak because it's pricing off of WTI. And you got 2 sweet crude components, which make up, I think, maybe 20% of that formula. So if you look at the way it's priced today, the components themselves are what are driving those discounts to the higher levels.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "So it's not just WTI, basically?", "Joseph Gorder", "No, it's not.", "William Klesse", "But it also relates to the supply that's in the market, because the suppliers of Maya or other heavy crudes are obviously looking at the supply/demand balance. So we're seeing more crude oil come out of Colombia; the Mexican Maya production has stabilized for the moment; we're seeing more heavy oil out of Venezuela; and we're seeing heavy, although it's sweet, crude coming out of Brazil. So the balance, as you look at it, is there's ample heavy crude on the U.S. Gulf Coast, which then contributes because the formula has a k factor that could be adjusted by discretion. So it is a supply/demand situation on the Gulf Coast.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Right. Let me just try 1 final one. I'm not too optimistic on this one, but I'll give it a go anyway. So Pembroke, the Chevron refinery, there's obviously some other assets nearby that could be a pretty terrific bolt-on. Any thoughts as to how you might want to proceed on -- because I think originally you'd said more than 1 refinery in the U.K. would have interest to you. And I'll leave it there, thanks.", "William Klesse", "Well, I'm very open about the fact that, yes, we want to increase our geographic diversification here. We think we, with Chevron, have made a deal that works for both companies and that, that will be a real asset for us going forward. There are other things that are coming into market, and we'll take a look at them. But at the end of the day, I told you guys many times, Valero does not have deal heat. We are clearly looking for assets that will add long-term shareholder value. So you know what's for sale out there. We have all these confidentiality agreements. But the facts are, we will look at them, see if there's synergies and see if the value is there, ultimately giving us the return. But we will continue to look.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Bill.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on Three Rivers. It sounds like you're going to be moving up to processing Eagle Ford crude up to about 60,000 barrels a day. If I'm not mistaken, I think the capacity on that facility is about 100,000. Is 60,000 the limit or can you continue moving forward beyond that down the road?", "Joseph Gorder", "Blake, the 60,000 is the limit without capital investment down there, without any kind of significant capital investment. So I mean that's just a logical number for us to get to, and we can get there fairly quickly because it's light, because of the light end. And Lane [Lane Riggs] could speak better too what would be required to run more. But it's 60,000 a day. We don't have any significant investment.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "Okay. And then secondly, Bill, you kind of indicated that accumulating cash on the balance sheet is kind of the preferred method here going forward. And then as it relates to M&A, we've seen the equity prices kind of move higher. The implied, kind of, per-complexity-barrel valuation for the equity is fairly high compared to the M&A comps that we've seen out there recently, almost incentivizing potential issuing equity to do a deal. Would you -- would you be more open to that in this environment?", "William Klesse", "That is not our plan. We would not plan to issue equity on anything that we've been looking at.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "Okay, perfect. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Gilman from Benchmark Company.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "I had a couple of things. I wonder if you could just highlight Aruba's operational and financial contribution to the quarter, statistically.", "William Klesse", "Well, Aruba -- Good question [ph]. Aruba has been a difficult startup even though we maintained our people and did maintain the plant. I will say that it was very, very difficult. We are now running there. We've had some issues, even here during the first quarter, and as we're going into the second quarter. Now do you have the numbers, Ashley?", "Ashley Smith", "Yes.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "Bill, was it profitable?", "William Klesse", "No, it was not.", "Ashley Smith", "Yes, it was not. We pretty much -- we prefer to report by region, and -- but it was not profitable.", "William Klesse", "Yes. So we don't give out the detail of that, but we're answering your question.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "Well, what's kind of operating range do you average in the quarter, Bill or Ashley?", "William Klesse", "Yes, we could give you that.", "Ashley Smith", "Its average throughput was about 140,000 barrels per day.", "William Klesse", "Versus a 235,000 to 250,000 operating range.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "Okay. 1 for Mike, if I could. Mike, help me understand how you generated net cash of damn close to $1.3 billion. Was there a huge working capital liquidation? Was there something unusual about deferred tax? And what was the cash impact to closing out the derivatives?", "Michael Ciskowski", "Okay, the -- first off, on the working capital. We had -- if you look at our payables, receivables netted, we had about a $900 million increase in payable, which contributed to that $4 billion cash balance. We also had a small decrease in inventories that helped it there, but most of it was due to just payable increase. And then, we did close out the positions, and that was worth approximately -- I mean the $542 million. I don't have my change in margin for the quarter here, but it wouldn't have been significant.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "Was that a cash outlay on closing those positions out, Mike?", "Michael Ciskowski", "Yes, Mark.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "Okay. 1 more, if I could, with respect to the $116 million maintenance impact. Is that showing up in expense? Or is it an opportunity loss? Or is it some of both? Can you...", "Ashley Smith", "Mark, that's opportunity, that's margin opportunity.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "So, Ashley, there's no expense element?", "Ashley Smith", "Not associated with that number.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Ashley Smith", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons.", "Jeffrey Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "I was curious if you could make -- give us an update on the Keystone XL project and what you're expecting there as they work through the permitting process. And is that project at risk giving -- given the new projects that have been proposed with the Monarch pipeline by Enbridge? And this morning, Enterprise is out with a project from Cushing to the Gulf Coast as well?", "William Klesse", "Jeff, this is Klesse. Joe is going to answer you, but really, all we're answer you is what TransCanada tells us. So to get the real facts, you ought to ask them. But Joe will tell you what we know.", "Joseph Gorder", "All right. So Jeff, you do know that this thing continues to be tied up in the political arena. And just going back in history a little bit, what we're dealing with is the EPA attack on the draft Environmental Impact Statement where they said that they needed to look hard at the additional oil sands development. The less [ph] oil sands crude would help reduce the U.S.A.'s dependence on oil. Well, on October -- or excuse me, on April 15, the State Department issued the supplemental draft Environmental Impact Statement on the pipeline. And this concluded that most significant issues were uncovered and that the draft EIS conclusion for the project would have limited impact and it was reaffirmed. So there was no change as the result of the supplemental work that was done. Then this draft goes up for a 45-day comment period that ends on June 6. And the State Department has reaffirmed that they expect to make a decision by the end of 2011. So in our conversations with those involved, we believe that the pipeline is still going to happen. And that is certainly TransCanada's position and that would be our position today, too. And if it does proceed forward, the schedule we're looking at would be Cushing to Port Arthur completed in the first quarter of 2013. And then, the Hardisty to Cushing would be completed in the third quarter of 2013. And the guys have continued to work on the materials and the right-of-away. And they've got the bulk of the right-of-way in place. I believe now they've got 75% on the Cushing to Gulf Coast segment and 83% on the piece that goes across the Ogallala Aquifer in Nebraska. So the project continues to proceed and we expect that it's going to get done. Now as far as these other projects to get crude to the Gulf Coast, I mean, I saw Enterprise's announcement this morning, and you mentioned the Enbridge lines -- the difficulty, Jeff, is in getting shipper commitments on the pipelines. And certainly, the advantage that the Keystone XL has right now is that they've got a significant number of shipper commitments which have made the project viable. And I'm not saying that those other pipelines won't happen or can't happen or shouldn't happen, but they've got some work to do to get people to commit before you can invest significant amount of dollars to do a pipeline like that.", "William Klesse", "There's a lot of oil being found though, and so it is our opinion that some of these projects, whether it's TransCanada's Keystone XL, they will happen. Just to give you a little reference, the Eagle Ford crude is around 70,000 barrels a day last year. And they're saying by 2016, it will be almost 500,000 barrels a day. You've seen numbers for the Bakken, which is now lower than 400,000 a day, is going up to 1.2 million barrels a day in 1 estimate. So where people couple of years ago said the Bakken would double, they're now talking about 3x out here in the 2016, '17 period. So there's a tremendous amount of crude oil that is going to continue to make its way, not so much -- not the Eagle Ford, but the other crudes even out in the Texas Panhandle that are going their way eventually to Cushing. And thus, there has to be an outlet. And so something will be done, and it's just going to take a little bit of time where new pipe has to be laid.", "Jeffrey Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "Thanks, Bill and Jim.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jacques Rousseau from RBC.", "Jacques Rousseau - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "I just want to see if you could give us an update on the FCC project at Memphis and St. Charles, and when you think they'll start adding to earnings.", "Lane Riggs", "Well, Memphis -- this is Lane Riggs. Memphis has already -- has been a great project, and we're -- part of that with reliability part, which is gross margin, and it's already been a really good operation and its...", "William Klesse", "And I think what is Jacques's talking about is we have the gas plant. Is the gas plant operational at Memphis?", "Lane Riggs", "It is.", "William Klesse", "Okay. So the gas plant is up so we...", "Lane Riggs", "Both cryogenic recovery liquids projects are up and running. And what's the second project?", "William Klesse", "Is St. Charles MSCC converted to a riser?", "Lane Riggs", "Yes. We, as I alluded to earlier, we'll confer the progress of completing that revamp right now. We're anticipating the start-up here in mid-May. But I think the number sort of we're counting on is about $120 million annually.", "William Klesse", "And remember, this will allow us, where we were running 12 to 18 months on these -- both of these kind of crackers, we'll now get a 4- to 5-year run on each of these. And converting the St. Charles cracker from a MSCC to this riser will give us 5 to 7 percentage points of yield improvement.", "Jacques Rousseau - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "1 more question for you, please. Could you let us know what the turnaround schedule would be for the back half of the year?", "William Klesse", "We don't -- we're going to look it up for you here, but we really do not have any major turnaround in the back half, no. We're getting year-to-date.", "Lane Riggs", "This is Lane again. We have the Corpus Christi HDS unit turnaround in the third quarter. And Corpus Christi will also have a crude coker in the sort of the later third quarter. And then, we have a Three Rivers crude vacuum FCC turnaround in the fourth quarter.", "Jacques Rousseau - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Dahlman Rose.", "Sam Margolin - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC", "Thanks for taking me. I guess this is a question for Joe. A lot of people talk about the limitations of moving crude around the continental U.S., but I was sure it's more about product. We've seen some pretty chunky gasoline draws over the past couple of weeks really focused in the East Coast. From the outside looking in, it looks like a utilization issue. What kind of excess capacity is there to put more products on Colonial or maybe some more from the Mid-Con [Mid-Continent] where refining margins are little stronger to make up what looks like a gasoline production gap? It doesn't seems to be really demand-driven. It just seems like a lot of capacity is off-line, presumably because of crude pricing.", "Joseph Gorder", "You're absolutely right. And we have seen more barrels moving up the Colonial pipeline and to the extent that they'd do without the line becoming prorated. The other thing you got to remember about East Coast market, and it's what makes it so competitive, is it's the destination for so many import barrels, whether they be becoming out of Canada or Europe. It is the home for that. And so we've had refineries down up there, Sun [ph] has had some operating issues. PBF is yet to get back up to full operations. Once they do, though, I think that situation will be remedied and those margins will adjust back.", "Sam Margolin - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays Capital.", "Paul Cheng", "A number of quick question. Mike, can you tell me some bunch of items, what is the market revenue of your inventory in excess of LIFO?", "Michael Ciskowski", "Okay, it's about $8.5 billion in excess of our LIFO.", "Paul Cheng", "Okay. How about working capital including cash?", "Michael Ciskowski", "Okay, total current assets are $15 billion, and current liabilities are $10.4 billion, so about $4.6 billion networking capital.", "Paul Cheng", "Right. And what is the long-term debt?", "Michael Ciskowski", "$7.8 billion.", "Paul Cheng", "$7.8 billion, okay. And Bill, in the -- I don't know your stat weight, how you rig it, in your Retail, you have a statistic looking at the fuel volumes, gallon per day per site. It looks like you're down about 1% year-over-year. Is that apples-to-apples? Or is there a change in the number, the difference sites and what we saw is not a really good one to read? Or do you actually see a 1% drop for your Retail network? And also there, can you give us some idea how April may trend?", "Ashley Smith", "Hey, Paul, this is Ashley. On the Retail volumes, that's actually pretty comparable. Apples-to-apples was, on the gasoline side, was down a little bit. But you got to remember, in our system, it's -- we're concentrated in the Southwest and we had pretty bad weather this year versus last year. We actually saw diesel same-store volumes up over 6%, so -- and if you look at recent data points, kind of weeklies year-over-year, they're starting to -- they are positive again.", "Joseph Gorder", "Ash, if I could, I mean, Street prices are very high, too. And so the fact that the demand has hung in there the way it has is pretty impressive. And Ash is right, we did have very poor weather, particularly in the north part of Texas. If you look at our South Texas operations though, we actually had -- sales increased in the quarter. So it was more of a regional issue than a broad issue.", "Paul Cheng", "And how about in April? Are you saying that the volume is actually back up? Is it now? On a year-over-year basis, is it up positively or that it's down? I mean the master cut [ph] survey and also the DOD over the last 6 or 7 weeks seems like suggesting that we're starting to see negative growth?", "Ashley Smith", "In our system, Paul, we've seen, like last week, year-over-year, was same-store -- it was up, it was positive.", "Paul Cheng", "Okay. And then, Gene, can you talk about the April export volume and how that's comparing to the first quarter average?", "Joseph Gorder", "Exports? Yes, Paul, this is Joe. Yes, I mean, in our first quarter, exports were limited somewhat, due to supply rather than lack of demand because we had turn around in Port Arthur and St. Charles, then we had some hock issues at Corpus Christi. But the arb [ph] to Europe still is open for distillates, and we continue to see supply/demand imbalances in Mexico, Latin America and Europe. Specifically, in the first quarter, we exported 65,000 barrels a day of gasoline which went to Mexico and South America. And then, our diesel exports were 165,000 barrels a day, with 75% of that going to Europe and 25% into South America.", "Paul Cheng", "And how about in April?", "Joseph Gorder", "In April, it looks like volumes are going to be above where they were in the first quarter.", "Paul Cheng", "Perfect. And Joe, you guys have announced a small expansion in McKee. Other than that, is there any other facility, like in Ardmore, Three Rivers, that you have opportunity to expand, that could take advantage of the discount crude?", "William Klesse", "This is Klesse, Paul. We're looking at minor work around condensates and NGLs between Three Rivers and Corpus Christi only because of what I said a few minutes ago about this tremendous increase in production that is happening in the Eagle Ford area. McKee, we've announced, although permitting is going to take us a little while. We don't have a plan here at the moment to do anything at Ardmore.", "Paul Cheng", "Right. Bill, is that because the cost would be too much because you need to expand a lot of different conversion units? Or that -- I mean, because given that this town -- that is, I'm a little bit curious that's why you didn't look at Ardmore?", "William Klesse", "You're exactly right. We can do this expansion at McKee and primarily tie it to the crude units, vacuum area. We have a capacity in the cat cracking and hydrocracker areas. And you get over to our -- for instance, in Ardmore, we would have to do work in the conversion units. And because we think this spread will narrow over time, that advantage dissipates. It still will be there though. We think there's a fundamental shift that we missed, that in fact WTI is going to sell for less -- WTI equivalents are going to sell for less than the foreign Brents or LLS, just for the transportation difference, but it doesn't justify the projects.", "Paul Cheng", "Sure. 2 final questions. 1, in office [ph] St. Charles and Port Arthur, the hydrocracker, is there any other major investments currently is under consideration? And secondly, after those 2 projects are up and running, how does that impact the crude slates in those 2 refinery? Or is it only the product yield that's going to be changed?", "William Klesse", "Let me do the first part first. The hydrocrackers, in and of themselves, do not change the crude slate. However, at Port Arthur, we have and are making investments. We've built a new crude line, we're looking desalter work, so that can run this Canadian crude oil, that as Joe said earlier, we expect to come to Port Arthur. So as far as that piece of it, it doesn't change anything. Well, as far -- at least outside of our plants already. We look at other projects around our system. Certainly, when we get Pembroke, we'll take a look at what's there. But basically, when -- as we look at it today, this is the projects we're trying to compete, and we go through our planning process but we are very focused on getting all of these projects done by the end of 2012.", "Paul Cheng", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital [Macquarie Research].", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Great. Thank you. Bill, I think you mentioned in your comments that your CapEx now is $3 billion to $3.2 billion for this year. Is that correct?", "William Klesse", "Correct.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "That seems to be up from the last guidance we heard. What exactly was the change there?", "William Klesse", "It's not -- it's probably the last thing maybe that you saw, but it is what I've been saying at the recent conferences that I've spoken at. And it's really a matter of some investments around Three Rivers as Joe mentioned. We've got a small, but it's $10 million -- we're putting in a truck rack. We're doing things like that. But it's really the hydrogen plants and the acceleration of the hydrocrackers. And of course, our capital spending is going to be up from the turnarounds. Remember, we include that in there and we, frankly, have overrun our turnarounds.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then next year, 2012, do you expect the same level of CapEx?", "William Klesse", "I do today, but -- and I've indicated that, but we're like everybody. We go into the planning process pretty soon as we really articulate our number. But for guidance, I would say it's going to be in this $3 billion to $3.2 billion range.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "And that does include some of the spending in McKee? And have you identified the cost on the expansion in McKee?", "William Klesse", "Yes we have, but I'm not going to tell you. And -- but it's a very good project. But right now, we have to wait for our permit and what's going on in Texas and our people working diligently with the TCEQ and -- but we have this CO2 issue here now. But we expect the permit will be issued eventually, and we'll get this project done. But this is not -- it's a very good project, obviously, with the discounts.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Okay, great. Joe, you mentioned some gasoline exports in the first quarter. Just more broadly, is this a growing trend out of the U.S. on gasoline exports? It looks like on the monthly BOEs, it shows -- it's showing a positive trend. And what are your thoughts on that end?", "Joseph Gorder", "Chi, I believe it is. And everything would point that way. We have very efficient operations in the Gulf Coast, which make us very competitive globally. And then if you look at the market conditions, I mean you got Mexico demand exceeding their supply and it's continuing to import products. They're up to 350,000 barrels a day of gasoline and 110,000 barrels a day of diesel. Petrobras has reported record domestic gasoline consumptions, around 400,000 barrels a day in 2010. And everybody believes they're going to need imports to satisfy their demand. Venezuela and the Caribbean refineries are having lower crude runs, which means that there's fewer barrels available there to export. And then even in Europe, we got the absence of Libyan grades which are affecting overall distillates production over there, and so that's tightening things up. And then, of course, we got the Chinese demand and so on. So I do believe that we're seeing just a long-term trend here that's going to allow Gulf Coast refineries to continue to export barrels.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "So you think this is going to be sustainable for a while here.", "Joseph Gorder", "We sure do.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Are your exporting out of the West Coast, by chance?", "Joseph Gorder", "We are not.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Okay. 1 final question, maybe for Mike. Does Valero still have crude hedges in place even after closing out the product hedges? And if so, do you have both the realized and unrealized impacts in the first quarter?", "Michael Ciskowski", "No, we've -- on those forward product sales, the crude hedges that were put in place in association with those have all been closed out and the cash has moved.", "William Klesse", "Yes. Now these are our, Chi -- these we believe the crack positions that we, the forward sales, and the crack. But we have positions -- paper markets are how we buy crude oil. So we have many positions on -- that are tied to physical barrels and differentials and everything else. But on where we forward sold, and I'll tell you, it was only 10% of our production -- forward sold the distillate and gasoline crack, they are all off.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Okay, great. Thanks, Bill, appreciate it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ann Kohler from CRT Capital Group.", "Ann Kohler - CRT Capital Group LLC", "Great. Just following up on Chi's question. Do you have the ability to export from the West Coast? Or are you just basically deciding not to go ahead and do that?", "Joseph Gorder", "Limited ability to export, but also we haven't seen any demand pull out of the West Coast.", "Ann Kohler - CRT Capital Group LLC", "Okay, great. And then what if...", "William Klesse", "If you look at the cracks, you get the crack today and the gasoline out there is $30. And you look at the Gulf Coast crack -- if you actually look at the numbers, the domestic California consumption pipeline actual consumption is better than exporting.", "Ann Kohler - CRT Capital Group LLC", "Okay. And then could you just provide a little bit of additional color, if there is, regarding AB32? I know you highlighted a little bit during your remarks. But also sort of -- I know there were a number of issues that had to be resolved and whether those are being resolved or what the timing is on that.", "William Klesse", "Well, on the AB32, we've gotten -- you just want, like, a total picture here, Ann?", "Ann Kohler - CRT Capital Group LLC", "Well, 2 things. And I know that you had initially indicated that there were some minor costs that would be -- that would impact you here. But also there were larger issues that still needed to be resolved, I guess, by the California Air Resources Board in relation to the adoption of AB32. And I was wondering if there was any additional color on that or timing on that.", "William Klesse", "I'll comment, and Kim can add to it if she'd likes. We've got the bill, so we've paid -- I've disclosed somewhere in 1 of my conversations, that we would pay $5 million for the administration of development of the rules. We have received those bills from CARB, so we'll pay them. Some of the other programs, for instance, for stationary sources from our refineries, it's a little over 3 million metric tons. That fee really doesn't start to occur until about 2015 because they're giving free allowances, so we don't expect any real impact from that. And then what Joe commented on was this high-carbon-intensity crude oils, which is part of the LCFS [Low-Carbon Fuel Standard], and the facts are those rules still are being developed. And what Joe was indicating, he was anticipating those, and so we've not run some what we know will be or expect to be deemed high-carbon-intensity crude oil. But those rules are still being developed here. So it needs to wait and see. And then, on the mobile sourcing, so in other words, the burning of the gasoline or diesel fuel in your car, those rules do not take effect until 2015 as well. So here in the short run, the next couple of years, the only thing is the administrative fee we've got. There may be some minor expense depending on the free allowances for stationary. The high-carbon-intensity crude oil, we need to see what the final rules say, and that will really impact our crude selection if they follow through with it. But now, to give my commentary, I am optimistic that California is going to realize that this puts all of their refining and thus the jobs, the taxes and everything at a disadvantage to other imports. And I'm of the expectation that this high-carbon-intensity crude oil piece is actually going to get a lot more discussion before the rules actually come out.", "Ann Kohler - CRT Capital Group LLC", "Okay, great. And then, sort of a follow-on, I guess, would be looking at the EPA on the national level and their desire to look at regulating CO2. Do you have any sort of update on that or how do view that's going to play out.", "William Klesse", "Kim Bowers will answer you there.", "Kimberly Bowers", "Yes, Ann, the EPA is going forward with requiring CO2 permits now starting January 1 of this year. So, I mean, across our system, it's something we're going to have to look at every time we look at an expansion. In Texas, as Bill mentioned, it's more difficult because the state is going to be issuing permits and then we'll have to go to the EPA for separate CO2 permit. But I think we will encounter as well as everyone else in the industry, going forward with the CO2 coming from EPA.", "William Klesse", "But I know you guys like to get me going on this, but for all of you that have kids and you think about business, here we have projects that we're willing to do and we're having to wait for permits that are going to take us maybe over a year to get on CO2, that would put people to work, increase the tax base. This is a very serious issue that we have in our country.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "It's Faisel from Citi. Quick question. On the West Coast, the throughput volumes were a little bit lower than what you guys had guided to earlier. Maybe you elaborated on this in your prepared remarks today. I may have missed that.", "William Klesse", "Well, it's because the Benicia turnaround extended quite a bit. We had startup troubles after we finished the turnaround, and so we did not run the volume at Benicia.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, understood. And then, going from -- looking at your capacity numbers, you guys published in your 10-K for your refineries kind of this year versus -- or 2010 versus the previous year. It looks like there was a bit of capacity creep in those numbers, just curious what causes that kind of creep to take place.", "Michael Ciskowski", "Yes, some of it is some debottlenecking projects, some of it just re-rating because certain plants -- we've done some things coming out of turnarounds. So they're just some minor little tweaks.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "And those are permanent today?", "Michael Ciskowski", "That's correct, until we decide that something's not economic to run and it cuts capacity or some unit is no longer in good shape.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, got you. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Yes, just 1 follow-on. I'm just curious if you've rerun of any of the maths on Chevron's acquisition? And also, the $1.8 billion of EBITDA uplift from your hydrocracker investments, given that we've -- well, we'll see what happens in Libya, given the strong global demand for diesel.", "William Klesse", "I'm going to let Ashley answer you on the hydrocrackers, because I know he's must [ph], but remember a big basis there is crude oil price or, a sense, of oil price versus gas price. And we don't see any real fundamental change on that, so we still view running the hydrocrackers, the volume lift you get through the -- the liquid volume lift you get through the hydrocrackers. And then they make a lot of diesel as the right project for Valero. I'm like everybody; I wish I had them today. But I also think it'll be prudent to stop them here, a year or so ago. Ashley, do you have...", "Ashley Smith", "Yes, Ed, on our publicly available and posted presentations, the most recent one had updates. And really, this is just using deltas on forward-curve pricing. And you look at the hydrocracker projects and using a recent forward curve, they contribute about $1.3 billion of EBITDA annually.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And the total program, sorry?", "Ashley Smith", "I'm sorry, what?", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "The total program?", "Ashley Smith", "Oh, it's up to about $1.8 billion. And that's depending on change \u2013 and how the forward curve changes. But it still, I mean, it's continuing to show, using 2011 forward curve, very strong EBITDA generation.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And then Chevron refinery acquisition, presumably with it being complex and able to process heavier crudes and sour crudes and acid [acidic] crudes as opposed to Libyan, that should be advantaged and perhaps make more money on the forward curve there as well?", "Lane Riggs", "Well, it doesn't really process sour at this change [ph], but it does process some acid crudes.

Good morning, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. ", "With me today are Bill Klesse, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Ciskowski, our CFO; Gene Edwards, our Chief Development Officer; Kim Bowers, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Jean Bernier, Executive Vice President. ", "If you have not received the earnings call -- the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segment. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact me after the call.", "Before we get started, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call, that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we described in our filings with the SEC.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Mike.", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Thanks, Ashley, and thank you for joining us today. As noted in the release, we reported that third quarter 2011 net income from continuing operations of $1.2 billion or $2.11 per share, compared to $0.53 per share in the third quarter of 2010. ", "Our third quarter 2011 operating income was $2 billion versus operating income of $590 million in the third quarter of 2010. The third quarter refining throughput margins was $13.24 per barrel, which is a 63% increase over the third quarter of 2010. The increase in throughput margins over the third quarter of 2010 was due to higher margins for diesel, jet fuel and gasoline, plus wider discounts for heavy-sour crude oil, residual feedstocks and light-sweet crude oils in the Mid-Continent and in South Texas.", "In the third quarter of 2011, the Gulf Coast gasoline margins per barrel versus LLS increased 89% to $8.20 from $4.35 in the third quarter of '10. The Gulf Coast ULSD versus LLS margins per barrel increased 56% from $9.12 in the third quarter of '10 to $14.19 per barrel in the third quarter of 2011. ", "So far, in the fourth quarter, Gulf Coast margins have moved lower, averaging around $1 per barrel for gasoline at nearly $13 per barrel for ULSD. ", "The Maya heavy-sour crude oil discounts versus LLS increased to 22% from $11 in the third quarter of '10 to $13.48 per barrel in the third quarter of '11. The Maya discount has narrowed some in the fourth quarter with the average down to around $12 per barrel. These discounts are important in our Gulf Coast region where we have significant capacity to process heavy-sour crude oils.", "Another benefit for Valero came from Mid-Continent in Eagle Ford crudes pricing at a substantial discount to LLS. ", "Over the last year, the WTI discount to LLS has increased by merely $20 per barrel, from $2.58 in the third quarter of '10 to $22.47 in the third quarter of '11. The WTI discount significantly enhanced the profitability of our McKee and Ardmore refineries, both of which process WTI or cheaper crude oils. ", "The fourth quarter WTI discount to LLS has averaged around $25 per barrel, but recently, the spread has narrow in yesterday closed at less than $19 per barrel. We also continued to increase the use of the discounted Eagle Ford crude in our system. ", "During the third quarter, we processed an average of 46,000 barrels per day of Eagle Ford, primarily at Three Rivers, but also some at Corpus Christi. That is an increase of 9,000 barrels per day over the second quarter and an increase of more than 40,000 barrels per day since 2010.", "This local crude replaced more expensive imported sweet crudes saving Three Rivers and Corpus around $15 per barrel in the third quarter. ", "We also took delivery and ran discounted sweet crudes from the strategic petroleum reserve in the third quarter. Valero purchased 6.9 million barrels at a discount of over $5 per barrel to LLS providing $35 million in additional refinery throughput margin in the third quarter. ", "At our Aruba Refinery, operational improvements combined with better commodity prices resulted in Aruba generating an operating profit this quarter. ", "In the North Atlantic region, we had a smooth transition with the addition of U.K. and Ireland businesses, including the Pembroke refinery. The refinery has run well and we continue to integrate the businesses into our operations.", "On the West Coast, our throughput margins versus benchmark fracs performed well, mainly on wider crude discounts and increasingly huge of such crudes. ", "In addition, operational improvements at our West Coast refineries helped to enhance our liquid volume yields.", "One final comment on refining margins is that international demand, particularly in the developing markets, has been the key driver for growth in 2011 and helped to elevate the margins to the levels we have seen so far this year. Our cost efficient refining portfolio will continue to take advantage of both domestic and international opportunities available in the marketplace. ", "Our third quarter 2011 refinery throughput volume averaged to 2.6 million barrels per day, up 389,000 barrels per day from the third quarter of '10. The increase in throughput volumes was due to a combination of economic incentive from stronger margins, the addition of capacity from the acquisition of the Pembroke refinery on August 1 and the restart of operations at the Aruba refinery. ", "Refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter of 2011 were $3.65 per barrel, which was lower than the second quarter of 2011 and our guidance, mainly due to high throughput volumes.", "Our Ethanol segment reported record-setting quarterly earnings with a $107 million in operating income in the third quarter, which was up $60 million from the third quarter of 2010 and up $43 million from the second quarter of this year on higher gross margins. ", "Our Retail segment reported a solid third quarter with $97 million of operating income. U.S. Retail had $59 million of operating income in the quarter and the Canadian retail operation earned $38 million of operating income. ", "In the third quarter, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $161 million; depreciation and amortization expense was $390 million; net interest expense was $88 million; and the effective tax rate on continuing operations in the third quarter was 36.4%.", "Regarding cash flows in the third quarter, capital spending was $684 million, which includes $69 million of turnaround and catalyst expenditures. Also in the third quarter, we paid a $28 million in dividends and $268 million to purchase 13.5 million shares of our common stock, or 2% of outstanding shares. ", "We also spent $1.6 billion to acquire the Pembroke refinery and related to marketing assets, which included approximately $900 million for working capital and other assets.", "With respect to our balance sheet, at the end of September, total debt was $7.6 billion, cash was $2.8 billion and our debt to capitalization ratio, net of cash, was 22.4%. ", "At the end of the third quarter, we also had over $4 billion of additional liquidity available. And as referenced in the release on October 1, we acquired the Meraux Refinery and related logistics assets for $586 million in cash. This payment included approximately $260 million for a preliminary estimate of inventories and other assets. And we do expect to receive in the fourth quarter a favorable true up adjustment that will reduce our price by approximately $40 million.", "Our completed growth projects are beginning to add to our earnings power. We realized the benefits from our St. Charles FCC revamp project during the third quarter, its first full quarter of operation. These benefits included improved liquid volume yield, lower energy costs, lower catalyst costs and reliability benefits. ", "Using third quarter 2011 prices, we estimate the annualized EBITDA benefit from this project is approximately $150 million.", "Our remaining growth projects remain on budget and on time to complete in 2012 and we expect these projects to generate significant earnings and cash flow growth when started up. The hydrogen plants at Memphis and McKee should be completed by the end of 2011. Our 2 hydrocracker projects at Port Arthur and St. Charles are set to finish in the second half of 2012, along with the Montr\u00e9al products pipeline and the Diamond Green Diesel joint venture. ", "Most of the product -- projects were designed to capitalize on high crude oil and low natural gas prices while producing diesel and gasoline to meet the growing global demand.", "In summary, we had an excellent third quarter. We took the opportunity to return cash to our shareholders via stock buybacks. And last week, our Board of Directors tripled our quarterly dividend rate to $0.15 per share. These decisions are result of our strong financial performance, favorable industry conditions and a significant contribution that we expect from our major growth projects that are scheduled for completion next year.", "Regarding strategic activities, we added another quality asset to our portfolio, and then further improved our earnings power with the acquisition of the Meraux Refinery. This is a flexible high-quality asset with the distillate focus conversion capacity, including a 34,000-barrel per day hydrocracker. ", "This first quartile refinery fits well into our Gulf Coast system and has excellent potential for synergies with our nearby St. Charles refinery. ", "We have also restarted a formal process to seek strategic alternatives for our Aruba Refinery. ", "In conclusion, the significant contributions expected from our major growth projects, which are independent of the WTI priced crude discounts, selective strategic acquisitions that improve earnings power, our strong financial position and our investment grade credit rating provide an excellent combination for future earnings and cash flow growth.", "Now I'll turn it over to Ashley to cover the earnings model assumptions.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Okay, thanks, Mike. For modeling our fourth quarter operations, you should expect the refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: the Gulf coast should be somewhere between 1.52 million to 1.56 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 430,000 to 440,000 barrels per day; the West Coast at 270,000 to 280,000 barrels per day; and the North Atlantic at 440,000 to 460,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter. ", "Refining cash operating expenses are expected to be around $3.85 per barrel in the fourth quarter. Regarding our ethanol operations, we expect total throughput volumes of 3.4 million gallons per day, and operating expenses should average approximately $0.36 per gallon, including $0.04 per gallon in non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. ", "With respect to some of the other items for the fourth quarter, we expect G&A expense, excluding depreciation, to be around $175 million; net interest expense should be around $85 million; total depreciation and amortization expense to be around $390 million; and our effective tax rate should be approximately 36%.", "We'll now open the call for questions. John?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI Group.", "Doug Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Mike, you mentioned something just a second ago about -- it's about the strategic review process at Aruba entail[ph]. I may have misunderstood, but I want to say if we could get a clarification on what you said and also what you meant by that statement or that point?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Okay, we have started a process of looking for a strategic alternatives for our Aruba Refinery.", "William R. Klesse", "Yes, if I can add to this, Doug, our operations have improved a lot. Our people are doing a fine job. We have several excellent reduction -- cost reduction efforts under way. For Valero, we used it, really as we're looking at the refinery going forward as a feedstock source to our big conversion operations along in our large conversion operations along the Gulf coast. So in a way, it's a front end for us. We're looking at some reconfiguration as to where we actually do hydro-treating. But the facts are, we're still very interested in finding a partner or some relationship that allows us to process very sour, heavy crude or high-TAN crude, which the refinery can do.", "Doug Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And Bill, you've been a leader for the industry on a regulatory front over the last several years and over the past, or maybe longer than that, but over the past several months, there have been some commentary on new rules for U.S. gasoline for 2012, which I believe they're calling Tier III and resembled those in California, but for the entire United States. And so my question, do you have any insight into these new roles? Specifically, whether this movement appears to be significant? And what if any implications there might be for Valero?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, I don't know if I have any insight, but what's going on is under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, there is a certain protocol passed by and the Clean Air Act was passed by congress. And so the EPA and when it looks at ethanol being added to fuels and other -- primarily, ethanol reflected then and vapor pressure and the emissions, feels like they need to drop the sulfur to honor the commitment of the Clean Air Act and drop it to 10 ppm average, but it's under debate still. Well, the whole issue is, but the ceiling as to whether it's going to be a 30 ppm max or an 80 ppm max. Today, we have an 80 ppm max, 30 ppm average and then Tier III, you'll have different numbers. So it's all being discussed. Our industry is against it. It will raise the cost for the consumer, and we think it is an extremely marginal benefit for the -- if any benefit at all.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays Capital.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just a number of quick questions. Mike, can you give me what is the working capital, the market value of the inventory in excess of the book? And that all of the total debt, what's the long-term debt in the component?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Okay, sure. Total current assets are $15.9 billion, total current liability is $11.7 billion. Market value in excess of LIFO value is $7.1 billion. Our long-term debt and capital leases is $7.6 billion.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And that $15.9 billion current asset, I assume that's including cash, right?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Includes $2.8 billion of cash, yes.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And that, Mike, in your result, is there any trading gain or loss? And also that do you have any future hedging position?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "The trading gain in the third quarter was very minimal, it's about $3 million.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Any hedging position that for the next several months?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "No material positions.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And Bill, maybe you -- can you share with us what is the major turnaround you guys going to do in the first half of next year?", "William R. Klesse", "I'm going to let Lane Riggs answer you.", "Lane Riggs", "Paul, this is Lane Riggs. Our major turnarounds are in Wilmington, on the West Coast. It's accrued that coker net at the hydro trigger since bureaus officially have the refinery. St. Charles in February, which is the crude coker diesel hydro trigger, also low properties on SRE, so again, similar type turnaround, excluding the SEC. At the Houston, we have an SDC Alki in February. And finally, we have -- some March, we have Memphis, which is prudent diesel hydro trigger turnaround.", "William R. Klesse", "Let me add to this. The February 1 at St. Charles is a huge turnaround for us. We're going to replace the coke drums. Many of you that follow us know, we've had this coke drum issue at Port Arthur and at St. Charles, and -- which was an engineering design and what we are doing is replacing the coke drums we did at Port Arthur this year and next year, we're going to do it at St. Charles. To do this lift at St. Charles, extends this turnaround -- I think, we released it this morning and at 70 days. But it's a very large turnaround for us at St. Charles. But that will then put these issues we've had with the cokers, except for some vapor lines behind us.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Perfect. And that for Wilmington and Houston, how many days are we talking about?", "Lane Riggs", "On Wilmington, it's about 20 -- a month. And Memphis is also about a month.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Memphis is also month, and how about Houston?", "Lane Riggs", "It's 37 days.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, Houston is 37 days. Mike, will you be able to share with us how much you make in Europe for the 2 months that end the quarter?", "William R. Klesse", "Let me just finish in the turnarounds. We announced that this morning and so the release went out as to our turnarounds in the schedule.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Yes, if you're interested in looking for details on this turnarounds and the timing, you can find those on our website.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Perfect. Mike, will you be able to share with us that how much you make in Europe for the 2 months you own in the quarter?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Yes. We made a little over $53 million in the first 2 months.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And then a final one, Bill. For the M&A market, can you share with us what you are seeing? Is the pricing condition in terms of acquiring us at the pricing condition become better or become worse over the next last several months for you guys? Or what you can see out there?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, I don't know if I can speak to the pricing conditions. But there's certainly several refineries for sale. We believe we bought the 2 refineries we purchased here recently at very, very good numbers. They fit into our portfolio, strategically too. We wanted to step out some, so if we could done that. When you look at where Valero trades relative to what we purchased in these refineries, we actually paid for -- purchased them for less than what we trade. Obviously, there's quite a few assets on the market. And then just to anticipate the next question, because I can't speak to the pricing except that I've said a couple of times it's a buyers market. And it continues to be that way, it's a general statement. But in Valero's particular case, we're only interested in acquisitions that fits us strategically and that is accretive and has to be both, if it's not fitting us strategically, we're not interested. And there is no case I can think of that we would issue any equity on any situation that's out there.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And you guys already did a little bit of the share buyback in the third quarter. In terms of the cash you generate, the free cash, over the next several quarters, are you going to become more aggressive in your share buyback given how cheap the stock may be?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, I think, as you look at us, which is a general cash question, in the volatility we see in the markets today, we will hold more cash than we would have historically. And I've said that, consistently. But when you have crude oil price move $5 to $8 in about a 3-day span, we just think you have to do that today. Now, what is happening with us is obviously, we're having much better financial performance this year. We think many of the things that contributed to this year's financial performance are going to continue next year. And so we're anticipating a good year next year as well. And then we have a very high capital spending. But those strategic projects are coming to an end, and we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. So when you begin to combine our performance, our cash balances, that our strategic projects will be completed, some as -- Mike said right now, some the big hydrocrackers next year. Clearly, we have more cash available. And then, you take the next step and we've demonstrated it here just in this quarter, and going into the fourth, we expect to pay one of the highest dividends among our peer group going forward. We will buy our stock periodically, especially as we think the stock is undervalued. And we, as management, clearly, think our stock is undervalued. As a little side issue or a side comment, the reliance discussion, this rumor that was out there, one of the benefits has been to point out to the investment community, the earnings power of our portfolio and our company. So that was actually a benefit here of a rumor, but we have lots of earnings power. Our projects are coming to an end, and we think our stock is terribly undervalued.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "This is Faisel from Citi. Just back to the Aruba statement. If you can't find a strategic partner or alternative for Aruba, what's the next option after that?", "William R. Klesse", "Well \u2013 this is Klesse. We continue to improve the operation. We have several things that would reduce our costs, but it is a very good front-end of our refinery that can run very, as I said, heavies and high-TAN crudes. And so we'll continue to improve the operation. And it will be then that refinery, when we run around 200,000 barrels a day makes about 70,000 barrels a day of BGO. And we'll charge that to our hydrocrackers that come on next year. So for us, we see improving its cost structure and using it as a front-end of our refinery. There's 200,000 barrels a day of crude, vacuum coking there that completes our operations.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. I think I understand that. And then going to your Memphis and McKee hydrogen plans, I mean, as those come on line at the end of this year, what do we expect from kind of the uplift going into the first quarter of next year from those plants? What are they going to do to the performance of those 2 plants?", "William R. Klesse", "So they're completed by the end of the year and then we'll start them up in the first quarter and we have a table we'll give you and we're looking for it here. Ashley?", "Ashley M. Smith", "Yes, Faisel, it's -- depending on what's price deck you use. We've given pretty much every slide deck for the past nearly a year. We've given them -- example, economic based on different price decks. If you use 2010 pricing, it's an extra $105 million a year of EBITDA, it's when the '11 pricing includes in the 4 curves less a couple of months. It's $150 million of EBITDA and that's incremental. And it's basically because you're making your hydrogen out in natural gas instead of destroying the expensive oil to do so. So you'll see margin uplift and it will basically drop down to EBITDA.", "William R. Klesse", "And that table's been in the appendix of our handouts.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Yes, our typical slide decks, which are publicly available to everyone and have been.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, I'll take a look at that. And more on the Ethanol segment that you performed pretty well in Ethanol despite crush spreads coming down over the quarter. What caused kind of margins to go up even though crush spreads kind of came in?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Well, the crush spread isn't necessarily will tell you how to get to EBITDA because our margins are a little bit different because of distillerates [ph] and some by-products you make. We look at our average margin on an EBITDA basis to being about $0.35 a gallon over the quarter -- for the entire quarter. I think if you just look at the financial -- I mean, the markers with corn, ethanol and source rate, it would've been more like $0.30, but I think if corn prices dropped, we got a little bit of extra benefit there just on our corn position. So that we made up if you look at the some of the gallons we made and the numbers that Mike told you earlier, it is right at $0.35 a gallon.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, and is the subsidy expires at the end of this year? I mean, what do you guys expect what kind of take place with your operations go into next year?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Remember, Faisel, it's still mandated. We're blending ethanols in about 91% of the total U.S. gasoline right now. I think that's going to continue. Ethanol is trading above gasoline now for about probably the first time this year as it turns out, we're about $0.35 a gallon over gasoline. So the worst case I look at it right now is if you go back to comparing the gasoline, our current EBITDA on our plants is around $0.69 a gallon. So if we lost $0.35 of that, we'd still have a very positive margin. But like I said it's driven by a mandate so the supply demand exports have been strong into Brazil and to Europe as well, so that's supporting the price. I think it's the supply/demand says that all plants need to run right now, including some of the peripheral plants that don't have a good acorn logistics. So we think that we'll have a good margins at our plants because they're well situated on the corn supply. But right now, margins are just excellent, though.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, and last question for me as -- in theory, if Libya continues to ramp up, you guys have an outlook for the heavy light spreads going into next year?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Yes, I think they're going to continue to be somewhat similar to this year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "What I wanted to ask, what is the current authorization on the share repurchase program?", "William R. Klesse", "Okay, we have a Board approved program that is $3.46 billion of authorization.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. Secondly, I wanted to ask about Pembroke. With so much capacity on the East Coast potentially at risk of closure, I guess, my general thought is that, that could be a direct benefit to Pembroke with the transatlantic arbitrage. Am I thinking about that correctly?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Yes, I think you are. This is Gene. Obviously, the European barrels do float to the U.S. East Coast and having that capacity to shutdown is going to create opportunity. However, there is -- it's a whole Atlantic basin market in those, the marginal refineries are going to be under pressure just like they have been this year. So but it does give an advantage to well situated refineries in Europe. We think Pembroke is at that category.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, great, and the last one for you. I know the growth projects was stated that they're all on budget and on time. As I look at kind of first call estimate in 2012 and 2013, it does not really seem like the street is reflecting the incremental call of $2 a share of incremental earnings in these projects. Is there anything in the macro that you see the data puts a risk that number? I mean are we still pretty much on track for an incremental $2 a share from all of these projects?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Yes, I think the main factor is just with the crude in the $100 range for -- and the natural gas are in the $4 range. It gives these projects a good uplift because it's basically a gas to a liquids-type projects as far as the majority of the benefit. So just a crack is kind of a secondary compared to the volume lift you get from natural gas.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Douglas Leggate from Bank of America.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "A quick one fellows on Meraux. Can you just talk about exactly how you're operating that facility, how you plan to integrate it? And I guess really the -- are you trying to actually run the crude unit there or just use the upgrade units? I have a quick follow-up, please.", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Yes, this is Gene again. We're basically operating how Murphy was operating before, but we are starting to cash through some synergies, we're going to integrate it in with our feedstock supply, so we pick up some synergies there. We also -- the products, there are a lot of Murphy was using supply their Florida business, we're just using and optimizing our overall system. We find the high cetane of the diesel that's produced there of the hydrocracker, we'll find that some synergies are blending that with St. Charles diesel. Procurement side, I think we'll see some advantages on our purchasing power going forward. So in that affect we're kind of running it as is today, pretty much the way McKee did just on -- I'll take a constant synergy.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "[indiscernible] I'll just try one quick one then. Are you planning to change the feedstock at Meraux in terms of -- you've talked about Three Rivers and Eagle Ford and so on. Is there anything you can do to actually change the feedstock there? and how do you get it back?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Yes, right now, we can run medium-sour crude. It runs about 1/3 of sweet crudes, which -- well, we always try to optimize that based on where the light-sweet spreads are. We can go to sour to sweeten up even more if the economic say so. Right now, we're pretty much in this 2/3 sour, 1/3 sweet still.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Gilman from Benchmark.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "A couple of things, if I could. Hey, Mike, did you book any goodwill on the Pembroke deal?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "No, we did not.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "And the $56 to the -- excuse me, the $53 million that you quoted previously in terms of the contribution in the quarter, I assume that, that's an operating profit number?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Yes, operating income. Operating profit after DD&A.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. How much of that buyback authorization is remaining?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "The number that I gave you, the 3.46 is what's remaining. And then in addition to that, we can purchase dilution under our benefit plans.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Just one more for me, make reference to discounted West Coast crude feedstocks, San Joaquin, Canadian Light, both fuel, more specifically if you could, please.", "William R. Klesse", "Yes, it's difficult rates we run out there. It's SJV, KLM, some South American grades like Oriente, Napo, Castilla, all those things actually kept -- had better pricing versus ANS. Versus ANS is the key there, Mark.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, I know ANS is out of the market, all those other crudes seem to be in the market, so is it really discounted?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, I mean, if you compare to ANS, yes. It depends on what your benchmark is.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, just let me speak one more. Byproduct benefits in the ethanol side in terms of the grains, seems like they're very substantial, can you help, over and above what Gene had to say a few minutes ago?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Well, the sellers grain do you get about -- only about 2/3 of your corn is converted, about 1/3 of it ends up at still storage grain and that has been a pretty strong market. So I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but that's the primary byproducts you're producing.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rakesh Advani from Credit Suisse.", "Rakesh Advani - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just a quick question on Meraux, you guys have a put out in what kind of EBITDA contribution you think will come from that facility?", "Ashley M. Smith", "We have not yet, Rakesh. We have not disclosed it to historical financials.", "William R. Klesse", "So we closed October 1, so probably that's a question for the first quarter.", "Rakesh Advani - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And just for the 2 hydrocracker projects that are coming onstream next year, can you guys talk about how much disruption there'll be to tie in the 2 projects into your existing facilities? Which kind of quarters will it take place in?", "William R. Klesse", "Okay. The Port Arthur hydrocracker will be finished midyear. So we're saying third quarter would start up, then third, fourth quarter. And the St. Charles hydrocracker will be finished by year end, would start up then occurring then, and then in the first quarter.", "Rakesh Advani - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. So then like should we -- how many days would we assume for the facility to go down or to tie them in? Would it be like -- should we use fiscal over like 30 days or something like that?", "William R. Klesse", "We will not go down to tie up time in. Everything will be where ever we have tie-ins, valves are hanger [ph] at things your hot, where ever there are tie-ins. Now if you're asking how long a start-up, these are huge projects, so 2 weeks to 1 month.", "Ashley M. Smith", "That's the base operations are generally going to be unaffected, not like take your big turnaround or something. It will just -- it will be incremental.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jacques Rousseau from RBC.", "Jacques H. Rousseau - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just wanted to ask you on, if I heard correctly, the guidance for the Midwest volumes for the quarter? I believe you said 430 to 440?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "That is correct.", "Jacques H. Rousseau - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "So just curious that looked like a high number. Probably the highest quarter since you have since 2008. I guess, if you could give a little color on what's improved there?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "It's still economic infinite to run, but also the last couple of quarters have either had turnarounds or other unseen outages like Memphis had some issues in the third quarter. It probably would've been up around that level, and that was the original guidance range until Memphis had justify a bit affected the crude, I believe. It's -- otherwise, it's what we would have expected.", "Jacques H. Rousseau - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Great. So outside of the maintenance that you've talked about, this is probably a normal run rate going forward?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "That's correct.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeffrey Dietert from Simmons & Company.", "Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "I was wondering if you -- you mentioned the startup of Pembroke and gave some contributions for the quarter. Could you talk about operations there, if there's anything that's surprised you? Anything that you're dealing differently than the way you perceived Chevron from operating the plant? I think many majors focus on maximizing throughput as far -- rather than maximizing profitability. Any comparisons you can make there?", "William R. Klesse", "I think that we will put our own spin into the plant. We're profit focused. We're in this business to make money. But as far as the statement of we run different than Chevron, for instance, Chevron's a very well-run company. So I would tell you just, hey, you're going to see our spin because we intend to make money.", "Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Great. Any discussion on exports? I know when we look at the DOE statistics, both gasoline and diesel exports were a record in the most recent month. You're continuing to see gasoline and diesel exports increase what those volumes look like in 3Q and are there any constraints to your ability to export both products?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, we see the export market continuing to be very strong and Ashley is going to give you some numbers here.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Yes, in the third quarter, we were up a little bit for gasoline versus prior quarters, up around 75,000 to 80,000 barrels a day, and on diesel side, it was again up from the second quarter up to about 165,000 barrels a day of diesel exports. And the gas has been going where it has been going, pretty much south of the border to Mexico or other parts of Latin America. The diesel has been going to split between Europe and Latin America.", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Jeff, this is Gene. Obviously, those are Valero's export numbers, the industry numbers are about 900,000 barrels a day, diesel are in about 500,000 barrels a day of gasoline, if you look at the DOE numbers.", "Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Any restrictions in your ability to export more if the market demands there?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "No, like I mentioned earlier. We're finding some synergies with Meraux and St. Charles, which typically the past did not export European grade, but by putting those streams together, we're finding out we can make any EN590 or European specs, so we're looking to see what we can do there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "We put a note earlier this week just showing how tight PAD one markets are. Can you talk a bit about that from your point of view and I'm thinking Pembroke, I'm thinking Colonial, and I'm thinking any other potential you have for going off that market and the analysis we are running was before we had this analysis, so I guess it's -- I assume you'd agree that the market looks extremely tight?", "William R. Klesse", "I think, Paul, we don't understand your question. I think we missed a word that must've been missed in a sense.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So I'll just say the whole thing again?", "William R. Klesse", "Yes, say it if you like. We must've missed the word.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, it's perfect. Perfect question, honestly -- asking, I should say. Okay, so let's start again. PAD one markets we've analyzed earlier this week, look very tight, northeast distillate markets particularly. And I wondered if you generally agreed with that and to the extent they are tight and to the extent that weather is likely to increase that tightness. I was wondering how from your point of view you can address that, that I'm thinking about the colonial pipeline, I'm thinking about Pembroke and any other access you have if you like to that particular area?", "William R. Klesse", "Okay, thanks. What we missed was the PAD one.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, that was an important but I apologize.", "William R. Klesse", "It's okay. Gene?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Yes, the PAD one is tied on distillate, but if you look at the Continental Europe, it's also very tight so I think you're going to continue to see the exports from the Gulf Coast go on to Europe. And PAD one just put inventories, yes, they're existing well below their 5-year average and well below last year. So it was the refinery that's been recently shut down there, I think that market's going to be tight, which is going to require high to fairly high utilization rates throughout the weather to supply that market. So I think it's going to be a pretty strong market for distillates going forward.", "William R. Klesse", "And volume will be shipped in as well as going to Europe, but -- and then the East Coast.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, so you can ship it for -- obviously from the Gulf to the East Coast because I'm assuming that pipeline capacity is limited from moving it in the other way?", "William R. Klesse", "Yes, I am sure, Colonial will go under pro-ratio.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Right, and so they're not going to expect the guesses likely to be higher at distillates margins on the Gulf coast as well?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Yes, the whole Atlantic basin market, like I said with the Europe tied and the East Coast tied, I think there's going to be a demand from Gulf Coast barrels to go rebook those markets.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Great. On -- just on the -- so that's a buyback. Are you stressing 20 as kind of a flow blow, which you buy back stock? Or are you thinking that you\u2019re going to -- or you mentioned that the stock is undervalued and your opinion, is it just being the 20 flow recently and one that you may think about raising if you like, under which you'll buy stock?", "William R. Klesse", "I'm not really looking at it that way. It's much more opportunistic, but we did by 13.5 million shares below 20. And we manage our cash, so it's the whole balance.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, okay so we can hope for more buyback going forward regardless of the stock price being above 20.", "William R. Klesse", "Clearly, we think our stock is undervalued.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "I want to go back out to the West Coast, that was a pretty good results on realized margins given where the crack spread trend ended in this quarter. Was the improvement really just on the differentials you talked about earlier? Did you change up the crudes later at all during the quarter? And Mike, you also mentioned the liquid volume yield improvements, were there operational improvement that you undertook at the plants out there as well?", "Lane Riggs", "This is Lane. Operationally, we just came out of a term in our Benicia. So it's performance in terms of liquid volumes are improved versus prior to turnaround, but crude selection is essentially unchanged. We haven't really changed what we're running on the West Coast. It's the same crude value.", "William R. Klesse", "But we operated better.", "Lane Riggs", "Right.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Okay. California recently finalized their cap and trade rigs. Have you had the chance to take into the details and how you thinking about managing that program going forward?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, you can rest assured we've dug into it. We have a very good strategic position on the West Coast. We have very good operations. However, we think state policy, AB32, other fiscal policies, regulations, continue to adversely affect the economy. They adversely affect jobs. They have adversely affected consumer. We think all these policies seem to turn their back on the negative economic impacts. We are hopeful that the voters which consumers will eventually realize that these policies are economically ruining the state. AB32 was of 12-page bill. CARB has now spent over $100 million trying to develop regulations in 5 years. It is a going along policy. The people of California are going to pay. And as to us, we're looking at our options.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "So do I take that as meaning that your -- the long-term viability is potentially in question on operating refineries in that state?", "William R. Klesse", "We're looking at our options.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Okay. got it. Okay, great. One other question on the Eagle Ford. We've noticed recently that the markers that we track, the pricing on the Eagle Ford crude has changed dramatically in mid-October, it's moved to pricing off a Brent versus previously of WTI. Have you seen this pricing dynamic in the market? And if so, has that impacted your decisions on crude slate down there?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "This is Gene. I think if you look at Eagle Ford where prices erode at Brent if it's already on the water area where it could be delivered and compete with the foreign barrel with prices there. I think in the field, it's still pricing and the discounts. It's not at WTI, but still much less than Brent.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Chi, it's going to depend, I guess, the margin barrel that's on the water, of course, it's probably going to price like Brent at this point. But if you're in a field, or if you have a refinery on the field and you've cut deals then you get different pricing, and that's how things work.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "So you're talking about Three Rivers versus corporates then, is that the difference?", "Ashley M. Smith", "Absolutely.", "William R. Klesse", "But clearly your observation is correct. Take away capacities being built in Eagle Ford, the crude is able to -- more of it is moving to the market. We have raised our postings in order to keep it in the area, but it's still discounted relative to the other crudes. An so, it's still -- we still think Three Rivers and the volume we're going to run at Corpus are going to be very economic crudes bars. And remember, we used to run all foreign crude at Three Rivers.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Global Hunter.", "Sam Margolin - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I don't think you've ever done this before, but can you break out Memphis from the Mid-Con group or give like some maybe an assumption of what the Mid-Con realized margin was x that Memphis portion?", "Ashley M. Smith", "We haven't and we really don't plan to, Sam.", "Sam Margolin - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division", "All right. Okay. Well, in that vein, on the last quarter's call you gave some indication that you were thinking about maybe a big capital project at McKee, an expansion or something on that order. Is there any progress with that line of thought or still in the evaluative?", "William R. Klesse", "Yes, we -- Sam, we have a project. We've engineered at McKee. It's less than $100 million project, but it does let us run more oil. It's a little bit over the same lines that Ashley talked about, the Eagle Ford crude where the refinery is in the field. We're seeing more and more crude discovered and available to the McKee refinery. So we have a project that would let us do that and right now, we're anticipating doing that project. However, it takes 18 months to 24 months to get a permit. We're just about to file our permit application or have filed our permit application. So depending on how long that takes, which is 1.5 years, and then some construction period after that. But the McKee refinery sits right there in the Panhandle we're seeing more crude and this is just a little de-bottlenecking, as I said. It's less than $100 million project.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I don't think you'll going to extend the desolate tightness commentary into China beyond PAD one and Europe. My question is -- it's a follow-up on Aruba and if other than strategic partnerships on heavy-sour crude -- I mean, is it possible you could find a cheaper fuel source instead of burning, I think it's 14% of crude there? I mean is floating rig gas, FSRUs, is that -- is there anything you guys explored?", "William R. Klesse", "Yes. We are working a project in conjunction with the government of Aruba in order to bring an LNG. And that project it's been under -- we've been working on it for many months and we're down into the -- where we're getting solicitations on supply right now. And the engineering is largely done. And yes, it has a very favorable economics, both for our refinery, including reliability. And it also is very favorable to the people of Aruba because of their power costs. So exactly correct, and we are working that project. And then on top of that, a little longer-term, I believe it's Repsol is looking as spudding a well there because they believe they're going to find natural gas there as well in the water. So there's many things changing actually all over the world on the CNP side.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "That's great. That's good news. And other question if I could just lastly the line 9 reversal is announced to Umbridge Analyst Meeting. Do you expect down the road you could get a lift in Qu\u00e9bec and how do you think about that or any partnership to move crude into that market to benefit that refinery?", "William R. Klesse", "Yes. We're interested in the line 9 reversal and obviously so is Petro Canada and others. But that only takes the crude oil to Montr\u00e9al then you have to add some agreement to get it over to Portland. But yes, depends on the differentials between WTI and Brent now, in this case, but yes, we would think it would give us some advantage if we could get that crude.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Bill, I know you've covered the share repurchases, but just one final question on it. Is there a specific goal or target for the number of shares you're hoping to retire?", "William R. Klesse", "No, there is not.", "Operator", "Our last question is from Allen Good from MorningStar.", "Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I was just wondering if I can get your current thoughts on your appetite for acquisitions. Or should we take the endue increase, share repurchases and willingness to hold a high cash balance sort of similar to what you've done with acquisitions right now?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, I thought I was addressing it, but we're still -- we're a refining company. We also have a marketing operation, Ethanol business and some of the assets are available for our numbers that are attractive. So if it's strategic, if it's accretive, Valero is still interested or is going to look. The last 2 acquisitions that we have done, we purchased for less than where Valero is trading. So we think we can add value. But on the other hand, we're extremely selective and I've said there's no intent whatsoever of issuing equity.", "Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Is Europe still an area of interest or is it just sort of a broad geographic area that you're looking at?", "William R. Klesse", "Yes, Europe is still of interest. We've been very public in the fact that we now have established a position there, at least in the U.K. We have said there's a refinery nearby that Valero would be interested in. And -- but otherwise, we're not working on anything in Europe.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Okay, thanks, John. I just want to thank investors for listening to today's call. If you have any questions, please contact me or Matt in the Investor Relations department.

There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike.", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Thanks, Ashley, and thank you all for joining us today. As noted in the release, we reported fourth quarter 2011 income from continuing operations of $45 million, or $0.08 per share. This number includes an after-tax benefit of approximately $161 million, or $0.29 per share, from a year end LIFO inventory decrement.", "Our fourth quarter 2011 operating income was $167 million versus operating income of $378 million in the fourth quarter of '10. Our fourth quarter refining throughput margin was $5.46 per barrel, which is a 25% decrease compared to the fourth quarter of '10. The decrease in throughput margins compared to the fourth quarter of '10 was due to lower margins for gasoline and petrochemical feedstocks, plus reduced discounts for medium and heavy sour feedstocks such as Mars and Maya crude oils. These declines were partially offset by higher margins for diesel.", "In the fourth quarter of '11, Gulf Coast gasoline margins per barrel versus LLS decreased 185% to a negative $2.05 from a positive $2.42 in the fourth quarter of 2010. Gulf Coast ULSD margins per barrel versus LLS increased 39% from $9.88 in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $13.71 in the fourth quarter of '11. So far in the first quarter of 2012, Gulf Coast margins have moved higher, averaging over $5.50 per barrel for gasoline and about $16 per barrel for ULSD.", "The Maya heavy sour crude oil discounts versus LLS decreased 44% from $12.75 in the fourth quarter of '10 to $7.19 per barrel in the fourth quarter of '11. The Maya discount has narrowed some in the first quarter, with the average down to around $4.50 per barrel.", "The WTI crude discount versus LLS increased over $13 per barrel from $3.34 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $16.70 per barrel in the fourth quarter of '11, which helped improve throughput margins in our Mid-Continent region from the fourth quarter of '10 to the fourth quarter of '11.", "Our fourth quarter 2011 refinery throughput volume averaged to 2.7 million barrels per day, up 523,000 barrels per day from the fourth quarter of 2010. The increase in throughput volumes was mainly the addition of capacity from the acquisition of Pembroke and Meraux refineries, plus operating the Aruba Refinery, which was not in operation during the fourth quarter of 2010.", "Refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter of '11 were $3.92 per barrel, which was higher than the third quarter of 2011 and our guidance, mainly due to costs of a legal settlement, plus higher regulatory and tax expense.", "Our Ethanol segment reported its best quarter on record with $181 million of operating income, which was up $111 million from the fourth quarter of 2010 and up $74 million from the third quarter of 2011, mainly due to much higher gross margins. For the full year of 2011, our Ethanol segment reported operating income of $396 million, its best year ever. In addition, since we bought the first 2 plants in 2009 through the end of 2011, we estimate that in less than 3 years, our Ethanol business has generated cumulative pretax cash flow exceeding the purchase price and recovering our $750 million investment. As good as the fourth quarter was for Ethanol, I should point out though that Ethanol margins declined significantly in December, and it remained low so far in the first quarter.", "Our Retail segment reported fourth quarter operating income of $83 million, consisting of $48 million in U.S. and $35 million in Canada. For the full year 2011, our Retail segment reported their most profitable year ever, with $381 million in operating income, which includes a record high from our Canadian retail, with $168 million in operating income.", "In the fourth quarter, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $129 million, which was below third quarter 2011 and our guidance, mainly due to favorable legal settlements. Depreciation and amortization expense was $393 million, and net interest expense was $89 million. The effective tax rate on continuing operations in the fourth quarter was 52%, which is higher than our guidance rate of 36% due to the combination of year-end tax adjustments and low pretax income. ", "Regarding cash flows in the fourth quarter, capital spending was $899 million, which includes $128 million of turnaround and catalyst expenditures. For the full year of 2011, Valero's total capital spending, including turnaround and catalyst expenditures, was $3 billion, or $200 million below the previous guidance of $3.2 billion. Our expected capital spending for 2012 is consistent with previous guidance at around $3.4 billion.", "Also in the fourth quarter, we paid $84 million in dividends and $79 million to purchase 3.5 million shares of our common stock. We also spent $547 million to acquire the Meraux Refinery and related logistics assets, which included approximately $219 million for inventory.", "With respect to our balance sheet at the end of December, total debt was $7.7 billion, cash was $1 billion, and our debt to capitalization ratio net of cash was 29%. At the end of the fourth quarter, we also had nearly $4.5 billion of additional liquidity available.", "As to our refining operations in the fourth quarter, we completed the hydrogen plants at Memphis and McKee, which were 2 of our key economic projects. Start-up is underway at Memphis, and we are planning to start up the McKee plant in February. These projects are designed to take advantage of the large spread between natural gas and crude oil prices, which is very valuable given that natural gas is only trading at 15% to 20% of the price of oil on an energy equivalent basis.", "Our 2 hydrocracker projects at Port Arthur and St. Charles remain on budget and on time for completion in the second half of 2012. These projects were designed to capitalize on high crude oil and low natural gas prices while producing diesel and gasoline to meet growing global demand.", "And now, I'll turn the call over to Ashley to cover the earnings model assumptions.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Thanks, Mike. For modeling our first quarter operations, you should expect the refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: the Gulf Coast at 1.38 million to 1.42 million barrels per day; the Mid-Continent at 390,000 to 400,000 barrels per day; the West Coast at 220,000 to 230,000 barrels per day; and the North Atlantic at 450,000 to 460,000 barrels per day. The lower throughput volumes in our Gulf Coast and West Coast regions are due to substantial turnaround activities planned for this quarter, particularly at our St. Charles and Wilmington refinery. A listing of our planned turnaround activities was posted this morning to our website under the News Room.", "Refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter are expected to be around $4.50 per barrel, which is higher than last quarter due mainly to lower throughput volumes and some higher maintenance cost related to the turnaround activity.", "Regarding our Ethanol operations in the first quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 3.5 million gallons per day, and operating expenses should average approximately $0.34 per gallon, including $0.03 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. With respect to some of the other items for the first quarter, we expect G&A expense, excluding depreciation, to be around $160 million; net interest expense should be around $85 million; total depreciation and amortization expense should be around $400 million; and our effective tax rate should be approximately 36%.", "Okay, John, that concludes our opening statements. We will now open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI.", "Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Mike mentioned in his opening remarks that Refining margins have improved versus Q4. And on this point, I wanted to see if you could provide your view on product balances in the Atlantic basin over the immediate term, meaning while demand has not been great and capacity growth was pretty significant during the second half of '11, the next couple of quarters appear to be more promising, especially with the closures announced in recent months. And so I just wanted to see if you could provide your perspective on the demand and the supply sides of the equation for the basin in coming quarters? And also, update us on the status of Aruba, too?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Okay. Well, Doug, this is Joe. I mean, I'll speak for a minute to the gasoline piece, then somebody else can speak to Aruba. But obviously, with what's happened in the marketplace from a supply perspective, things look encouraging. You've got plant closures in the Northeast U.S., you've got the situation with Petro Plus in Europe. We have Hovensa making announcements. Isla still is running well. So from a supply perspective, products tend to be a bit tighter than they have been. If you look at U.S. gasoline demand, of course it's not particularly strong. But the real story in gasoline continues to be the export markets, where year-to-date through December, we exported 511,000 barrels a day of gasoline, which is up 175,000 from the previous year. So that continues to look good. Now will it continue? I think it probably will. You've got Latin America growing, and they continue to import. Venezuela still has issues at their domestic refineries. And then they're involved of course with Isla and Hovensa. Mexico gasoline imports were up to 405,000 barrels a day, and Petrobras continues to pool gasoline. So if you look at the gasoline markets in general, I think that we're going to continue to see very strong demand, and our export business should continue to be strong. On the distillate side again, you have just average distillate markets here in the U.S., but their exports were also very strong. The industry exported almost 850,000 barrels a day. So that continues, and the same refinery issues that are affecting gasoline are out there for diesel also. The heart [ph] to Europe, which was closed a little bit earlier this year, is now open again, and so we're seeing barrels move that way. Our exports for the quarter were 65,000 barrels a day of gasoline and slightly over 180,000 barrels a day of diesel fuel. So that continues to be good for us. So I hope that answers your question.", "William R. Klesse", "Concerning Aruba, Doug, we continue to look at our strategic alternatives, but we're in the same boat as was announced by one of our competitors operating in the Caribbean. And so we intend to have a decision here very shortly here within the first quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons & Company.", "Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "My question evolves around heavy sour discounts in Maya. You talked about Maya premiums being -- or discounts being soft in the first quarter. Lots of things influencing that. The K factor is moving around, resid inventories are low, which is propping up Maya pricing. You got Hovensa coming out of the market, and then eventually Seaway deliveries coming later in June. Could you talk about your expectation for Maya and heavy sours as we look through 2012?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Jeff, I mean, this is Joe again. I think you cited on so many of the facts that are going to affect this market. I mean, right now, the discounts are weak. And as you've said, resid is very tight. We also had the compression of the WTI-Brent spread which -- where WTS moves with. And so as that came in, as with respect of the relative prices of WTS, so 80% of the Maya formula was affected by those 2 components. And as you mentioned the K factor, we saw the Mexicans adjust the K by $1.90 a month the last 2 months, and we expect them to continue to move that going forward. So although the discounts are weak today, I think our expectation is that we'll see discounts somewhere close to last year's levels, or slightly below as the year moves on.", "Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "And secondly, you guys have been supporters of TransCanada's Keystone Pipeline, and that's experienced some government delays. Are you free to pursue whatever options are best in moving Canadian crude down to the Gulf Coast? Are you considering both TransCanada Keystone and Enbridge? Or are you focused on one or the other more intently?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Well, Jeff, we continue to be big supporters of Keystone. We think it's a great project, and we're committed to that pipeline. That being said, we have a strong appetite for heavy sour crudes in the Gulf Coast. And we're watching the other projects as they develop. Obviously, we've got Enbridge and Enterprise that have one project in place. We've got an open season now on another pipeline that would parallel the Seaway project. It runs from [indiscernible] south, the Cushing and then on down to the Gulf Coast. And we support all of these projects that would bring additional crudes into the Gulf.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I guess, on the call, signaling higher payouts and rising free cash flow, maybe just give us some color about your thoughts about shareholder distributions? And then I have a follow-up.", "William R. Klesse", "We increased our dividend last year, and we bought shares in the fourth quarter. There's a few shares that carried over into the first quarter that we purchased because of settlement dates. But clearly, we will look at increasing our dividend, buying some of our shares as we complete our projects. Now first, we're going to maintain our investment-grade rating. Then we have the Port Arthur hydrocrackers should be done at the end of the second quarter, starting up in the third. And in the fourth quarter, we'd finish the one at St. Charles. So as these projects are getting completed, we'll look at how we manage our cash. The other thing that we have said when we've spoken to you all, as we look into '13, we expect our capital spending to fall from our $3.4 billion where we are today for 2012, down into $2.5 billion to the low $2 billion for next year.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Very helpful. Just a follow-on, separate area -- but you're actually making money in the North Atlantic even as everyone else closes around you. Given that you are able to make money from the assets that you've chosen to invest in, I mean, are you tempted to add more to the European refining portfolio if you can find a sort of similar advantaged assets as Pembroke?", "William R. Klesse", "We have a very good base in the U.K. and Ireland. So with all of the noise that's going on with some of the refineries that are available, yes, we would take a look at this. We say that about everything anyhow. But if you actually look at it, we want a very strong strategic fit. It needs to be compatible in the sense of moving streams between refineries. It needs to bring marketing or at least support our trading in the Atlantic basin and then the exports that Joe spoke about. So it has to have strategic or synergy value to us in fitting into an overall system. But obviously, we read the news and we see what's going on as well. And we have a good base there that we didn't have prior to our acquisition of Chevron's business.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And my interpretation of good base, is this correct, is that you could just stick with your current assets and therefore, the bar for any further acquisitions would have to be that much higher?", "William R. Klesse", "That would be absolutely right.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I'm going to try a couple of questions also, if I may. The first one, Bill, when you talk about your strategic options for Aruba, and obviously you brought in Europe to the discussion as well, can I ask you to bring us up to date with your thoughts on the West Coast, particularly as it alludes to the free cash flow in the West Coast as opposed to the earnings, specifically if you have continued the requirements for regulatory spending? Does that remain a core area in the perhaps redesign portfolio as you move forward? And I have a follow-up, please.", "William R. Klesse", "As of today, the West Coast is a very key part of our business. So you use the word core, it is a core asset for us. We have a good position there. We have very good operations. We have had to spend a lot of money at our Benicia refinery here for environmental. And that is true. But the thing that you cannot forget on the West Coast is they're still in a recession or a depression. They have unemployment headline number of 11%, little over that, which means underemployment is probably 2x that. TARP is absolutely out of control. They do not work for the common good, and they're hurting the economy in the West Coast. But for us now, we continue to work on our cost structure, we're attacking that. The refinery operations are reducing costs in that business, and we're in a competitive position. And we're well positioned there. But the macro is the problem, and it needs to be solved.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "My follow-up is really more of a micro question on gasoline. We see how strong distillate cracks are, gasoline less so. You've announced your turnaround program which, if I'm not mistaken, looks like it's relatively heavy by historical standards. Could you maybe characterize how do you see the outlook for cleaning up gasoline inventories, the overhang that we have right now? And perhaps if you have a view as to how industry maintenance could perhaps help out over the next couple of months, that would be great. And I'll leave it there.", "William R. Klesse", "Well for us, these turnarounds have been scheduled. The one at St. Charles, Ashley said we put up our turnaround schedule on the web page. But these have been scheduled turnarounds. So St. Charles would be down for 66 days. In April, McKee goes down to do work on the cracker, which will reduce gasoline production up in the Texas Panhandle. So ours have been scheduled. Now there's no question that gasoline is sloppy, although, quite frankly, the cracks have improved significantly here just in the last couple of weeks. But part of the issue again is in North America and in Europe, we have growing but -- at least in North America -- growing but very slow economy. Europe, Western Europe, I don't know if they're technically in recession today or not. But you combine the uncertainty we have economically, we do have higher prices. We have in the U.S., this housing overhang. And remember, we sell fuels to everybody. And there's a large segment of our customer base who either is unemployed or facing economic uncertainty. So to me, we have to have people getting back to work and economic activity picking up, and we'll see demand recover. And I think we'll see higher demand this year than we had last year. And the turnarounds when we're down obviously reduced production, just as all the shutdowns that had been announced are doing. But I'm optimistic that gasoline's going to be fine this year, but we do need to get people back to work. Distillates is still doing just fine. And as Joe said, the orders [ph] open again in Europe. Economies around us are growing. And from our U.S. Gulf Coast business, we'll continue to export.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays Capital.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Mike, can I ask some balance sheet data? In terms of working capital, the long-term debt of the total debt component and inventory market value in excess of both?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Sure, Paul. Our total current assets at the end of the year was at $16 billion. Total current liabilities was $12.7 billion. So our net working capital was $3.3 billion. Our market value in excess of LIFO was about $6.8 billion. Total debt at the end of the year was $7.7 billion. And our stockholders equity was $16.4 billion.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Mike, out of the $7.7 billion in total debt, how much is long-term debt?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Pretty much almost all of that is long-term debt. We did have $250 million that was under our AR program. And included in those numbers is about $45 million of capitalized leases.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, perfect. Bill or maybe both Bill and Mike, you're talking about that raising the dividend and maybe doing a bit of the share buyback and returning cash. And next year, your budget is at $2 billion, $2.5 billion, and locking on that, that's a January, a pretty substantial sum of free cash, with your DD&A already in the $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion. How are you looking at that? I mean, historically, I think rising cash flow environment that you tends to spend more as a percentage in the share buybacks and dividend. Going forward, how do you look at it with a recent Baron [ph] article talking about the 4% yield, which for you guys at current share price is about $1 per share, do you think the volatility in your business still way too high therefore, you are trying to search for that kind of yield?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, I've said that once we get through this spending that we're doing, which we think are very good projects -- so you're asking me how do I look at this? And so we have said that we want to pay one of the highest dividends among our peer group, and that is what we're going to do. And then when I try to match it up between dividend and stock buyback, if we don't add better projects that add shareholder value, then we're going to have our dividend that's high or one of the highest of our peer group. And then we'll use the rest of our cash to maintain our investment-grade ratings. So we may buy back some of our debt or redeem it and at the same time retire some of our shares.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Bill, do you have a target ratio between in terms of the cash returned to your shareholders, say, 40, 60 between dividend and share buyback; or 30, 70 or any kind of target?", "William R. Klesse", "No, I do not. But I will go ahead and add, we as a company do not see benefits of special dividends. So we would tend to act in a more regular manner in the sense of what I just said, paying a dividend that's one of the highest of our peer group. And at the same time then, buying our shares.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "That's great. Bill, in the past, you have said you've been in discussion with Murphy on Milford Haven. Can you update us whether you are still in discussion on that? And also that you have laid out some of the criteria when you're looking at all that, wondering whether BP Texas City will fit into your criteria in general?", "William R. Klesse", "Okay. So there's always confidentiality agreements associated when we look at things. But I have said our Pembroke refinery is right across the Haven. From Milford Haven. And I have also said there would be some advantages. However, we are not talking to Murphy.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "You are not talking to Murphy now?", "William R. Klesse", "That's correct. And then as far as Texas City, we have said in the past we've looked at that. But there's a confidentiality agreement, and nothing seems to be happening.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "A couple of questions for you. One, as I understand it, the results in the quarter were negatively impacted from your long-haul crude purchases that were kind of tied to the WTI-Brent spread, which compressed. I'm just curious if there's any way to, one, quantify that? And then secondly, is there any discussions of maybe changing the way that you struck through the purchasing going forward?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Okay. Yes, Blake, we have estimated what that impact we believe was in the fourth quarter, and the number is about $200 million. And as far as like how we -- I mean, we have an estimate of the number of barrels that we had WTI exposure on. We have been transitioning away from purchasing some of our crudes and hedging away from WTI and reducing that exposure. Joe, do you want to...", "Joseph W. Gorder", "No. I mean, you're exactly right. During the quarter -- I mean, we looked at the market, we saw the spread had blown out to where it was, and we didn't think it was sustainable. And it was affected by Libyan oil being out of the market and then coming back in. And then the announcement of the Seaway reversal of course had a significant effect on it also. And so we anticipated that it would come back in, and so we started shifting as Mike said, to different basins for our hedging and acquisitions.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. But it's fair to think that, that is not really going to be prevalent in the first quarter?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Right.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then secondly, Joe, I know you already pretty much covered the export dynamics, but if you don't mind, as I understand it, Valero is increasing their export capacity this year, and I was just curious if you could give us some timing of when that occurs? And is there really incremental demand as it stands right now to actually increase the amount of exports from your system?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Yes. And that's a good question, Blake. I mean, we're working on multiple things that are going to facilitate our ability to export more effectively in the future, some logistics projects. But the 2 hydrocracker projects will be a big plus for that. I mean, we will be able to produce diesel fuels that are of a high quality and allow us to move them anywhere. And the European spec is a more stringent spec than just a generic grade, and so we'll be able to move more barrels that direction. And then it all goes to demand. So I'm telling you, we're going to have the ability to export, then it goes to demand. And with what we're seeing in our industry now with refinery closures and shutdowns and reduced run rates, I think we're going to see strong demand. Plus, you have growth in these markets, as Bill said earlier. You got growth in South America, Latin America. You have growth in Mexico. And so in addition to the supply being constrained, you're going to have higher demand. And we're going to be the beneficiaries of that. We always forget how efficient the Gulf Coast refining system is globally, but it is very efficient. And I think we can compete with anybody.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Global Hunter Securities.", "Sam Margolin - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division", "It's somewhat related to the WTI-linked long-haul barrels. It's regarding the buy/sell contract mechanics in the Gulf Coast, which presumably also had an impact in 4Q. Are there any initiatives underway or talks with producers here domestically in the Gulf about using a different kind of contract in that mechanism during the delivery lag?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Yes. I guess we would rather not tell you. Okay? I mean, it's a fair question, but we would rather not tell you specifically what we're doing relative to our crude acquisitions. I mean, I think we had a pretty good feel for the market. We made some good decisions, and I'd rather just kind of stop there.", "William R. Klesse", "But I will add, so you have some feel for it, that what you typically are doing is locking in the differentials. You can do that with WTI. You can do that with Brent. You can do it with a lot of things. And so how we manage that really becomes a company's internal decision. And that's why Joe is saying to us, it's doing our business every day, and it is a competitive world. But it's really locking in the diffs. And obviously, we had some dips locked in on Brent, right? Or we would've lost more money.", "Sam Margolin - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Well, here's one that should be less controversial. On the retail numbers, the same-store sales were flat year-over-year. It stands in pretty stark contrast to the DOE demand figures. It looks like there's some kind of error in that data set just based on the massiveness of the drop-off. Your retail numbers, is that reflective of a broader picture of better-than-expected demand? Or is that just your location and exposure and company-specific items?", "Jean Bernier", "This is Jean Bernier here. No, you are right. Our fourth quarter volume, when compared to the same quarter last year, was better in the fourth quarter than our year-to-date trend. Overall, we're up about 1.5% in the fourth quarter versus a drop of 0.5% year-to-date. And on a same-store basis, we had a similar trend. So we did better in the fourth quarter compared to last year, and some regions did better. And Texas, in particular, was a good market for us.", "Sam Margolin - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Yes, I mean, it's just noteworthy because the weekly DOE numbers have been -- were putting actually a strain on the exchange-traded commodity prices for most of the fourth quarter, and this rebound might reflect some changes in the understanding of that demand picture. So I was just curious if it was a national thing.", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Yes. Sam, you just have to remember where our stores are located. They tend to be Southwest, with most of them in Texas. And Texas has a good economy.", "William R. Klesse", "And then in Canada.", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Yes, same thing in our Canadian.", "Jean Bernier", "Yes. The Canadian volumes are a bit softer when you look at the overall volumes. But that is mainly from our heating and carte blanche segments. If you look at our retail gasoline, we were about flat to last year.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "There's quite a significant union issue. Today, I believe, is the deadline. Bill, can you talk a little bit about any potential impacts that we may have? What you expect to happen, what's happened in the past? And also, if you could widen that out from not only a Valero impact potentially but also to a wider industry impact, I'd be grateful.", "William R. Klesse", "Well, Paul, I'll first speak to Valero. We had 2 refineries that have agreements that terminate tonight. And we continue to negotiate, and I have the expectation that we will have an agreement. At Port Arthur, we have actually 5 agreements, and we tentatively have reached agreement on 4. And so really, there's just one agreement. Now we have -- we're served with notice that they -- I guess it's a notice that says they can strike or will strike if we don't have an agreement here at Port Arthur. And at Port Arthur, we intend to operate, if that's the case. Now as to other companies in the industry, I don't -- some companies were served. We've heard there were 2 companies that were notified that they could have a strike. Remember, we're part of a pattern. Valero is a member of this group that negotiates. Shell has the lead and is negotiating the pattern. So we'll see what happens today, but we expect that we're going to have an agreement. So we'll see what happens.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And I think Memphis is the other affected refinery for you guys?", "William R. Klesse", "Memphis for us is an agreement that expires tonight. At Memphis, we have negotiated with the union an orderly shutdown. And so if they decided to strike, we will shut down at Memphis.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "But on balance, you expect an agreement?", "William R. Klesse", "Yes, we expect an agreement. We're a great company to work for.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, I knew that, Bill. I knew that. But it's worth repeating.", "William R. Klesse", "Maybe there's a job for you here.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, I might need one if Wall Street keeps going the way it's going. So the other question I have is on ethanol. I mean, there's been a significant change between Q4 and Q1 in Washington. I wondered if you could just -- I know that you had a record quarter. I believe things are pretty poor right now. And if you could just talk to the way ethanol has shifted and whether we're now in a secular change actually because of what happened in Washington on the credits and stuff?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Yes, Paul, this is Gene. Our margins in the fourth quarter averaged about $0.56 a gallon on an EBITDA basis, which is the strongest quarter we ever had obviously. And the year, averaged about $0.35 a gallon. Since then, the margins have come off. Right now, in January, we're somewhere between breakeven to $0.05 a gallon. Pretty weak. Remember last year at this time, we were pretty weak as well. I think I'll let you know what's happening. We lost the blenders' credit, but I don't think that itself has had much to do with the margins because ethanol today is up $0.60 a gallon under gasoline in the East Coast. So it's still a big margin for blenders to blend regardless of whether the credit is there or not. I think what's going on is just supply/demand. Demand in kind of the fall was around 850,000 barrels a day, plus we were exporting 100,000, 120,000 barrels a day. So you add those together, you needed the supply. And supply ramped up from 900,000 barrels a day to about 950,000 barrels. So it's a very tight market. And what happened in December, January, just a seasonal reduction in gasoline demand, has reduced ethanol blending down to around 750,000, 760,000 barrels a day. And everybody's still running those 940,000 barrels a day. So we've been building inventories. The exports haven't been enough to consume all that with the seasonal drop-off in demand. So going forward, I think what's going to happen, these poor margins we're seeing -- remember these that are even in our plants located in the corn belt. Plants that are outside of the corn belt are negative cash flow right now. So we'll see productions fall off. At the same time, remember the mandate this year is 860,000 barrels a day. So we're blending below the mandate. People are probably using credits right now to blend -- to solve the difference. But at some point, in the near term, we're going to ask the ethanol blending move higher to average 860,000 barrels a day for the year. We factor in exports, which have been strong into Brazil, Canada and Europe, I think they're going to stay in this 100,000, 120,000 barrel a day range. I think the markets are going to get -- just going to tighten back up, and we're just going through a soft period right now.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I see the time's okay now. So I'm going to throw in a third, and it might be a little bit of a question I should know the answer to. But I believe the Gulf margins right now are pretty much an all-time record for January. And we've talked about weak gasoline demand. Obviously, we know the export story. But could you just make any observations you've got on just what's driving that strength? It does seem very impressive.", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Well, one thing -- it's Gene again. One thing we're seeing on gasoline, the exports have gone up over 600,000 barrels a day. Joe mentioned the number earlier, 500,000. That was for the year. Just on a weekly basis, the numbers continue to look quite good. We talked about Hovensa shutting down and the Petrol Plus issues and some of the East Coast refinery shut down. I think all of those things just kind of tightened up the projections for a stronger spring.", "William R. Klesse", "And let me add, we don't see the issue per se on supply in the sense that supply is in reasonably good balance for this time of year. It's been a demand conversation. And we're like a lot of people, we see the economy starting to recover. So we think that demand will be better as we get into the summer. And as Gene said, when you think about how the supply side has been affected here, that actually we see good margins as we go into summer.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Great. And then just to finalize on that, is there anything strange or unusual about the capture that you're achieving with current margins? Is there anything we should be aware of as we work through Q1?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "I would say no.", "William R. Klesse", "Our answer is no. There should be nothing that we're [ph] aware.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "A follow-up on the Atlantic basin. I mean, I see the clear benefits on supply for Pembroke from Atlantic basin tightness and closures. Yet, where do you see the volume limitations on Colonial product into the East Coast? And do you see a potential to move more product out of the Gulf Coast into the East Coast? Clearly, you'd think Aruba [ph] would be a lot tighter this summer into that market, x Hovensa events and the 2 other assets that shuttered in November?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "At Colonial, we'll see it prorated, right? I mean, it's going to stay full all the time. A lot of barrels are moving out of the Gulf to Florida. They can also move around to the East Coast. It always becomes, from our perspective, an arbitrage opportunity. Where can you supply the East Coast demand that we have most efficiently? Is it out of the Gulf, or is it out of Qu\u00e9bec or is it out of Pembroke? And so that's the way we would view this. But as far as the Atlantic basin goes -- I mean, there's just volume coming off from a refining perspective, as we've talked about now everywhere. And it's just making it a much more attractive market for the refiner that can move effectively. We look at our supply opportunities, they're significant. And the issue in trying to determine the ultimate -- that bet that you're looking at, comes down to shipping oftentimes. And foreign flag vessels moving from Quebec and from Pembroke into the New York harbor are advantaged.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Right. And what's the kind of barge arbitrage out of the Gulf Coast? Is that the widest of those 3, obviously Pembroke and Montr\u00e9al being easier?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I mean, does the arbitrage have to be the widest in order to justify barging product from the Gulf Coast around Florida into the East Coast? Or is that...", "Joseph W. Gorder", "No, not always. Not always. It comes down to just being sure that you're efficient in the supply. And there are factors within the refinery that will affect your decision to move one way or the other, okay, in addition to the barge. But generally, we are trying to optimize the margin.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And I have a follow-up question really to differentials. And I guess, first with Maya. I mean, I guess we're constructive on that spread. I mean, what is your ability or what's the spread that -- and since Valero deflects away from Maya and into LLS's, LLS is trading under Brent, and you have a lot of issues, there's a lot of different differentials there. Curious what that price was, or if you were incented in the 4Q to shift away from Maya runs? And then conversely, to the West Coast where crudes are relatively bid into Asian refining start-up capacity, kind of the converse of the Atlantic basin, are you seeing most crude options pricing in the same direction of ANS, which is a tricky marker to follow?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Well, this is Gene. Let me turn the Gulf Coast first. I think what we're seeing with Maya prices and where they are today, we're more advantaged on medium sour crudes as opposed to Maya. So we're shifting some there. Also, the LLS is cheaper, much cheaper than foreign sweet. So some of our refineries like Houston can run those sweet -- would lighten up our barrel, our crude side a little bit there. I think the Maya will widen back out. There is competition, more Venezuelan crude coming on. There's still lots of barrels coming out of Columbia. So I think you'll reach more of an equilibrium, so we don't want to just completely go off of Maya and the crudes. But short-term, we just have the ability to flex a little bit. As far as the West Coast, Joe, do you...", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Well, I mean, I don't think that ANS is behaving any differently than the other crudes out there.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. So it's reasonably indicative of kind of what should be realized?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Yes. I mean, really, you go to -- the only crude that's out of step with the rest of the market is WTI. I mean, LLS, frankly, no. We're starting to see it move away from Brent, and you'll see that number. I mean, I guess LLS is $1.62 below Dated Brent today, which is a change from where it was last year. But it's weakening. And it's weakening because you're seeing more sweet barrels pushed into the Gulf Coast. And it goes to the thesis that I think Bill and Gene have shared with you guys in the past, that ultimately, domestic sweet crude pushing to the Gulf Coast is going to put pressure on LLS margin. It'll put pressure on foreign sweet pricing. And ultimately, you could see foreign sweet crudes completely backed out of the market. It'll be a benefit to the Gulf Coast refiners. I mean, we've run sweet crude at Meraux. We run sweet crude in Houston, as Gene said. And if you back the foreign sweets out of the Gulf, you're going to benefit Pembroke and Qu\u00e9bec also as those prices come down.", "William R. Klesse", "So that's probably for a 4-year or 5-year conversation. But we would say, in the U.S. Gulf Coast, on what we see on the production and the capability to move the oil to the Gulf Coast, that the industry may push out all the sweet crude imports into the Gulf Coast, not the East Coast.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "But would you think that would change your diet of Maya, I guess is what I'm saying, especially if Maya was supported on resid tightness?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, I think Gene told you today, we're better off running a medium sours out of our plants than the heavy sours. So what that tells you is you're not going to build new coking today. And in some coker, there's not probably a lot of fun.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "If I could slip in one last one if I could. I know you mentioned supporting other various pipelines. I mean, are you seeking nominations on Seaway, I mean, to commit to a potentially advantaged crude source?", "William R. Klesse", "I think on that one, we probably -- we will decline to answer, except go back to what Joe said earlier. We want the heavy crude to the Gulf Coast. And so we're very public on Keystone, but he also said that we're, in a way, talking to all of these companies.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Gilman from Benchmark Company.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "A couple of quick ones, if I could. Aruba, cash positive in the fourth quarter?", "William R. Klesse", "Absolutely no.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "That was at a negative? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it.", "William R. Klesse", "Yes -- no, we're not cash positive. We're not.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Could you update us a little bit on the Eagle Ford crude takes at Corpus and Three Rivers in the fourth quarter and where you expect to be in the first?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Yes, Mark. This is Joe. We ran about 60 in the quarter. We're running 80 today. And we expect by the end of the second quarter, we'll be running 100.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "Joe, how does that split up between the 2 plants?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "I mean, the bulk of it and certainly in the fourth quarter, I would tell you, 55 of the 60 went to Three Rivers. I think we're going to -- and I don't have it specifically, Mark, but I think we're going to be running 30 of the 80 in Corpus today. And then about that same range in the first quarter.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. The 100 that you mentioned at end of first quarter or second?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "It'll be during the second quarter.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Any specific plans in place for diesel yield enhancement at Pembroke?", "Lane Riggs", "Mark, this is Lane. We're currently looking at different ways to reoptimize their FCC catalyst and trying to get to a more distillate selective for riser conditions with catalysts. And obviously, we're looking at their distillations, make sure the right molecule is in the right place. We don't have a project per se right now lined up to increase their diesel production up.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. I'm a little bit confused as to what Mike's $200 million number represented in discussing the long-haul crude. Is that pretax, after-tax? Does that encompass what I believe would've been a very negative crude oil impact in the mid-con? And if you could identify roughly what that might have been in the fourth quarter, I'd appreciate it.", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Okay. What that does represent, it's a pretax number. And in the volumes, I don't think I can disclose due to...", "William R. Klesse", "It's a pretax number, and it is -- the question was that we answered on the long-haul crudes, which basically are the crudes that we had exposed to WTI as we set our differentials and locked those crudes in. That is $200 million. Now the other piece you're asking is yes, this negatively impacted our performance when it went from $25 to $10 at Mckee and Ardmore for sure. And we still made money at those refineries, but now we have a $10 diff instead of a $25 diff. And so with the volumes we run at those plants, the difference between in a way $25 down to $10 is about another $200 million. But we were still profitable at those refineries. Obviously, there's a $10 advantage.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. That $200 million, Bill, that you just mentioned, that's also a pretax number I assume?", "William R. Klesse", "Yes. We're giving you everything, Mark, in operating profit.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Just one more real quick one because I got to jump, the decision to participate in both cellulosic ethanol as well as biodiesel, it sounds to me as if you're willing to put a reasonable amount of money on the table here.", "William R. Klesse", "If I can answer you, Mark, we think that in the United States, we are going to have the continuation of the mandates to use it. So we have this renewable volume obligation. And when you look at it, is a large number for us. And even though we manage these in the sense of profit centers, when you look at the overall company, we want to control some of our destinies. Now even if we have a new Congress or whatever, we still think those mandates are going to continue. So the answer is last year, for rents, we spent, how much?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "$155.", "William R. Klesse", "$155 million for rent. Does that include the diesel rents?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Yes.", "William R. Klesse", "So that our total. We spent $155 million buying rents. Our estimate for this year is nearly 2x that for rents when you count diesel and cellulosic and regular. So yes, your answer is right. We think it's part of the fuel mix. And we have a good project on biodiesel, or renewable diesel. We have a good partner. So we're going to run that like a refining project. And the Ken Ross project that's been announced with wood we think is a good opportunity to get our toe in.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "So back on the crude hedging loss in the fourth quarter, I'm assuming that you had also a pretty sizable hedging gain then in the first quarter to the third quarter of last year. Mike, could you quantify what those gains might've been?", "William R. Klesse", "So your question is because we're -- I'm asking you -- because we're buying crude, that we set the differentials against WTI then we benefited just like every other Mid-Continent refiner on that. Is that your question?", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Yes, yes. I'm assuming that you use NYMEX TI contracts to hedge long-haul. So when the spread blew out from $3 to $28 in the first 3 quarters, I'm assuming there was a hedging gain in the first 3 quarters then.", "William R. Klesse", "All right. So there was. So we're going to answer you for the long haul barrels, okay. Mike?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Okay, yes. That should be -- I mean, that number is estimated to be a little bit over $700 million benefit.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "And Mike, do you have that broken out by quarter?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "I do. It's roughly about $250 million in the first quarter; $210 million, second; $250 million, third.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Okay, great. And on all these contracts, is there a particular region that's hitting? Is it all in the Gulf Coast? Or is it spread out between West Coast and Gulf?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "I mean, our volume is so skewed to the Gulf. That's where you're going to have the biggest effect.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "And then, Mike, in 2012 here, your debt maturities, do you just have the one 6 7/8% notes coming due?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Right. Well, that's correct. We have $750 million that comes due in April. And then if you look at our balance sheet when you see it, it'll show $250 million of current maturities associated with our AR program. But that renews annually, and we anticipate renewing that.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Right. Okay, then in the fourth quarter, do you have -- what sort of working capital impact did you have on free cash flow?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Actually, we had about -- it's about a $700 million requirement, cash requirement associated with working capital. So what makes that up is our receivables, payables net increase. That was about a little over $300 million. We had an increase in our income tax receivable of about $200 million. And then we also had some prepayments on crude. It's more of a timing deal from January to December. And that was another roughly $200 million.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Okay. Do these items reverse out here in the first quarter?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "I'm not exactly sure the timing on the income tax receivable. I mean, on the payables, the receivables payables net, I'm not -- that should reverse over time, yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Cory Garcia from Raymond James.", "Cory J. Garcia - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "One quick question out of me, sort of switching up the export angle a bit. Are you guys sending any gasoline or diesel off California coast? And maybe quickly, your views on the West Coast export trend?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "We are not. And my views on the export trend, you got a view on West Coast?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, we think that there eventually could be an opportunity there. We need to have that capability. That's one reason we're working our cost structure so that we can compete. And that would be into the West Coast of South America. Might have a freight advantage of not going through the Panama Canal. And also, there's action going on, on refining capacity in Hawaii, as you know. But we haven't done anything as of yet, but we're looking at this type of optionality because we believe a key part for all refiners in the United States is having the ability to export.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Harry Mateer from Barclays Capital.", "Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just a quick one. Given the rate of spending this year, you do have a $750 million maturity coming up in April. Can you just tell us what your plans are with respect to that?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, as of right now, we will go ahead and redeem that. But we're actually looking at how our cash flow goes for the next month or 2 from operations. And our projects look like they're on budget and on time. And so we'll make a decision here in February, latter part of February, on how we're going to address that, whether we're just going to redeem it, or whether we'll need to issue something. That's a foreign item for us, so we'll go back to our board and explain to our board how we're going to do it.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Okay.

Ciskowski", "Thanks, Ashley, and thank you for joining us today. As noted in the release, we reported a first quarter 2012 loss from continuing operations of $432 million or $0.78 per share, which includes a non-cash asset impairment loss of $605 million after taxes or $1.09 per share, mainly related to the Aruba Refinery. Additional information about this loss is disclosed in the earnings release financial tables under Note D.", "Our first quarter 2012 operating loss was $244 million versus operating income of $244 million in the first quarter of 2011. Excluding the items mentioned in our earnings release, first quarter 2012 operating income was $367 million versus operating income of $786 million in the first quarter of 2011. The decline in operating income was primarily due to lower throughput margins in Refining, lower growth margins in Ethanol and lower fuel margins in Retail. Our first quarter Refining throughput margin was $7.71 per barrel, which is a 22% decrease versus the first quarter of 2011 margin of $9.91 per barrel. The decrease in throughput margin was mainly due to lower discounts on crude oils and feedstocks and lower margins for other products such as petrochemical feedstocks and petroleum coke, despite the higher margins for gasoline and diesel. In the first quarter of 2012, Gulf Coast gasoline margins per barrel versus LLS increased 72% to $6.56 from $3.82 in the first quarter of '11. Gulf Coast ULSD margins per barrel versus LLS remained very good and increased slightly from 13.59 in the first quarter of '11 to 13.68 in the first quarter of \u201812. The Maya heavy sour crude oil discounts versus LLS decreased 37% from $15.68 per barrel in the first quarter of 2011 to $9.89 per barrel in the first quarter of 2012. Our first quarter 2012 refinery throughput volume averaged 2.6 million barrels per day. That was up 449,000 barrels per day from the first quarter of '11. The increase in throughput volumes was mainly due to the addition of capacity from the acquisition of the Pembroke and Meraux refineries. Refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter of 2012 were $4.15 per barrel, which was higher than our fourth quarter 2011 due to lower throughput volumes and higher maintenance expense, but it was lower than our guidance of $4.50 per barrel mainly due to higher throughput volumes and lower energy costs than we expected. ", "Our Ethanol segment reported $9 million of operating income, which was down $35 million from the first quarter of 2011, mainly due to lower gross margins as ethanol prices were pressured by excess industry supply. Even with lower margins, the Ethanol segment operated well and achieved 2 quarterly records, the highest average production rate at 3.48 million gallons per day and the lowest cash operating expense per gallon at $0.28.", "Our Retail segment reported first quarter 2012 operating income of $40 million, consisting of $11 million in the U.S. and $29 million in Canada, which was down from the first quarter of 2011, mainly due to lower fuel margins. In the first quarter, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $164 million, which was in line with guidance but above fourth quarter 2011, mainly due to legal settlements that favorably impacted the fourth quarter of 2011 results. Depreciation and amortization expense was $384 million; net interest expense, $99 million; and the effective tax rate in the first quarter was a negative 28%, but adjusting for the Aruba impairment, the effective tax rate was 37%. ", "Regarding cash flows in the first quarter, capital spending was $884 million, which includes $158 million of turnaround and catalyst expenditures. Our expected capital spending for the full year 2012 is consistent with our previous guidance at around $3.5 billion. ", "Also in the first quarter, we returned $189 million in cash to our shareholders as we paid $83 million in dividends and spent $106 million to purchase 4.5 million shares of our common stock.", "With respect to our balance sheet at the end of March, total debt was $7.6 billion, cash was $1.6 billion and our debt-to-cap ratio net of cash was 27.4%. At the end of the first quarter, we also had over $4.6 billion of additional liquidity available.", "We made several notable improvements to our refining system in the first quarter. We started our hydrogen plants at Memphis and McKee, which benefit from high oil and low natural gas prices and were 2 of our key economic projects. In addition, we completed large turnarounds at our Wilmington and Memphis refineries, and we began a very large turnaround at our St. Charles refinery, which we just completed last week. Included at St. Charles was a project that replaced coke drums to improve reliability.", "Regarding key capital projects in progress, our 2 hydrocracker projects at Port Arthur and St. Charles remain on budget and on time for completion in the second half of this year. These projects were designed to capitalize on high crude oil and low natural gas prices, while producing diesel and gasoline to meet the growing global demand. We look forward to completing these projects and enjoying the expected benefits to cash flow.", "So now I'll turn it over to Ashley to cover the earnings model assumptions.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Okay, thanks, Mike. For modeling our second quarter operation, you should expect the refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.44 million to 1.48 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 380,000 to 400,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 275,000 to 285,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 440,000 to 460,000 barrels per day. Refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter are expected to be around $3.85 per barrel, which is lower than the first quarter due to higher plan throughput volumes and expected lower maintenance costs. ", "Regarding our ethanol operations in the second quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 3.5 million gallons per day, and operating expenses should average approximately $0.32 per gallon, including $0.03 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization expense.", "With respect to some of the other items for the second quarter, we expect G&A expense excluding depreciation to be around $170 million, and net interest expense should be around $70 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter should be around $385 million, with the reduction in Aruba depreciation and amortization expense mostly offset by additional expense from new equipment entering service. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter should be approximately 36%.", "Okay, John, that concludes our opening remarks. We'll now open the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I got a couple of quick ones hopefully. My first one is really on the crude charge. We've obviously seen another, I guess, extended or relatively extended period of very attractive TI and, I guess, inland discounts relative to waterborne crude. I'm just curious about -- I imagine you\u2019re trying to optimize your runs and if you could just give us an idea just to how, if any, changes that you're making or have made in terms of trying to gain greater exposure to those spreads? And I've got a couple of quick follow-ups, please.", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Okay, Doug, this is Joe. Listen, obviously, we are. We're trying to run as much of the light-sweet domestic crudes that we can. If I look at our crude slate in general, from last quarter, we did run more light-sweet crude, and we also ran more medium-sour crude, and we basically backed out resid. So we continue to look for opportunities to optimize the overall slate. Now when we think in terms of what are we doing in the Gulf Coast here and what do we think the market's going to look like, I mean, the Brent to LLS spread -- or LLS to WTI spread could be anywhere from $5 to $25 over the next year. We just -- none of us really have any idea as to what that's going to be. We do believe, though, however, that longer-term, that's going to come in to $3 to $4. And I think this view would be supported by the fact that Seaway's pipeline tariff is in that range or slightly below that. Now we know that domestic production of light-sweet crude is continuing to grow and is going to continue to do so over the next several years, and a lot of these crudes are making their way to the Gulf Coast via the pipelines, whether it be Seaway or Longhorn reversal, the Seaway expansion, the Keystone southern leg and so on. So these crude prices, the discounts are going to continue to come in. And in this system, what we're doing is looking for every opportunity to run more light-sweet domestic crude. We currently run about 200 a day, and we think that we can take that up by perhaps another 200, based on some projects that we're looking at. So that's our plan, and that's what I got for you.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "My follow-up is kind of related, actually, because you guys periodically have dabbled with hedging, and I'm just curious if you have that view of that spreads are potentially coming in over time. I'm just curious if you're tempted to try and walk in some of those spreads currently in order to make whatever adjustments you would plan to do near-term?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Doug, I guess this isn't directly the answer to your question, but we have -- and I think everybody knows that we've shifted our hedging. The parity point of crude pricing has shifted away from the Mid-Continent to the U.S. Gulf Coast, and so we\u2019ve shifted our feedstock hedging from a WTI-related basis to a Brent-related basis. And the true WTI barrels that we run in McKee and Ardmore, we're hedging with WTI. Everything else has been shifted to a Brent basis. That had a negative impact on us in the first quarter. But as we head into the second quarter, we're getting it back, and with our long-term view that these spreads are going to come in, we believe that we're properly positioned. Plus just philosophically, it makes sense to use the paper, that the crude that you're running is pricing off of is the risk management tool. And so -- and then your question goes broader to our hedging program. I mean, we do -- or our trading program. We do things from time to time, Doug, but nothing material.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Mike, can you give me a number of the balance sheet item in terms of working capital, long-term debt, market value of your inventory in excess of LIFO [ph]?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Okay. Paul, the total current assets are $15.8 billion. Total current liabilities, $13.1 billion. Our cash is $1.6 billion as I'd mentioned in my notes, and then our current maturities are $1.1 billion.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "The cash is already included in the $15.8 billion you gave, right?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "That's correct. Okay, market value of our inventory is $14.2 billion, and value in excess of LIFO is $8.7 billion. Total debt, which includes...", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Long-term debt?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Yes. $7.6 billion, and stockholders equity, $16 billion.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "$16 billion, your stockholders equity, perfect. Bill, wondering, did we -- looking in Pembroke, did you make money in the first quarter?", "William R. Klesse", "What I'm going to do going forward here is because we don't break out these refineries, we deal by system, so we're not going to give you any, going forward, how we're doing on the particular plant. So this would be kind of the last time. So at Meraux, we've had a very tough start; however, we've had a turnaround, several turnarounds. We had high crude costs come through, and so now as we get started here into the second quarter, we think Meraux is going to fit very well. You ask about Pembroke. Pembroke has largely been breakeven at the refinery. Marketing has been a little better, but basically, I'd just say to you, it's been a breakeven. Where we're working there is on cost and structure. Their costs are much higher than the way Valero will run these businesses going forward. And just to give you an idea, in April, Pembroke is very profitable. But -- so basically, we haven't made any money on either of these plants or the acquisitions, but we still think they fit very nicely for us, and we've made a lot of changes in 6 months.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Bill, in Pembroke, or that I mean, your overall experience in Europe, does it in any shape or form that have changed your view whether you want to further expand into the European market?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, it wouldn't be related to our experience at Pembroke. We look at assets that come on the market because we\u2019re very -- I guess I should add, we\u2019re very satisfied with the Chevron acquisition. We just had to make some changes in the way Valero does business. And we had Joe Gorder over there, and he's made a lot of changes, and now, we're sending Eric Fisher over to run the business, and we'll be implementing these changes over the next year. So our experience and how it fits into our system, overall, and for the long term, we\u2019re very satisfied. Now you ask about expansion in Europe, well, we\u2019re very concerned about the financial crisis in the sense that's going on in Europe. We're concerned about, frankly, the very, very large refining overhang in Europe. And so, as we see these plants coming on the market, we're just going to be very, very cautious. It really has to fit into our system going forward.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Bill, do you have the number you can share in terms of the same-store sales in the first quarter and also so far in April in your network?", "William R. Klesse", "Yes. So now we're to the U.S. Retail, we'll give you the Canada as well, and Gary Arthur is here who runs our Retail, so...", "Gary Arthur", "So, yes. The same-store gasoline was up 2.5% for the first quarter versus a year ago. We continue to benefit from the strength of the Texas market where we have about 600 of our 1,000 company-operated stores. So Texas continues to be very, very strong. We're a little bit weaker in the West, and I think that's a reflection of both the economic climate not being quite as strong and competitive pressures that we see in that market.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "How about in April so far?", "Gary Arthur", "April so far, we're about where we were in March, about even with March, and on a same-store basis on gasoline, we're down about 7/10 of 1%. When you adjust for the fact that we have 5 Sundays in the month of April this year versus last year, Sundays being our slowest day of sales, so when we adjust for that, to get a true comparison, we're down slightly.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And then when you say in the first quarter up 2.5% in benefit, correct me, from the Texas strong market. If we would strip out Texas, then what does your overall same-store sales look like?", "Gary Arthur", "If we stripped out Texas, I would tell you, we would be down slightly.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So less than 1%?", "Gary Arthur", "Yes, I would say less than 1%.", "William R. Klesse", "But that reflects California, Colorado\u2026", "Gary Arthur", "Arizona.", "William R. Klesse", "And Arizona, which\u2026", "Gary Arthur", "Wyoming. Those 4 markets.", "William R. Klesse", "But Arizona is down significantly, and so has been Colorado, right?", "Gary Arthur", "That's right.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Bill, final question. It looked like that in many of the shale oil plays, the liquid production coming out of your NGL and condensate, and black oil may be actually less than 50%?", "William R. Klesse", "Paul, I missed a couple of words. Oh, shale\u2026", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I'm saying that in many of the new shale oil plays, whether it's in Eagle Ford or even in the Permian Basin and all that, the new liquid production increase looks like it's going to be NGL and condensate, and maybe less than half is black oil. So do you see that as an opportunity for you to bring more of the condensate in your system or that you build some condensate splitters to take advantage of, potentially, an oversupply of condensate?", "William R. Klesse", "So you have a lot of questions there. In the Eagle Ford, the quality of the oil has actually been better than what was originally expected, that being it's a little heavier. So it's better quality oil. So we are running -- Joe told you, but we're running 100,000 barrels a day, and another month or 2, we\u2019ll be even higher between Three Rivers, Corpus Christi and Houston. We are actually taking some to Houston. So that's been the higher quality. Some of the other basins, we're not really connected to, so it's been kind of an academic question so far. And obviously, the stuff in the Panhandle, Ardmore, has all been good quality oil. So now to condensate, yes, we would agree with all the chemical companies, from NGLs to condensates, that we see this -- and how you divide them sometimes gets a little hazy there. But we see a significant increase in ethanes, propanes, butanes, all these, geez even the C6's. So, yes, we see that coming to market. That's why I think somebody told me the other day, there is 9 ethylene plants announced, and this is the resurgence of the petrochemical industry in the United States. And we at Valero are looking for ways that we can participate where we bring real value to the conversation. So we continue to look at our options. But yes, your general statement is absolutely true. There is a significant increase in NGLs and condensates.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "It\u2019s Faisel from Citi. On the Memphis refinery, I know you guys have access to the Capline pipeline system. What's your ability as a major customer on that pipeline to influence its reversal?", "William R. Klesse", "We would probably have no influence at all. We're not an owner. It's Plains and Marathon and BP. Is that right?", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes.", "William R. Klesse", "Plains, Marathon, BP. And they're the owners of the pipeline, and they own the pipeline.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. Understood. Can you give us an idea how your Eagle Ford crude is pricing into your refinery systems today?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Yes. It\u2019s pricing off of LLS minus the discount.", "William R. Klesse", "And we have a posting, and it's posted there, which you could look up, but I think it's LLS minus $6.  But it's a posting, so it's readily available to anybody.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons.", "Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the hydrocracker integrations at Port Arthur and St. Charles. And what's required with those plants, how does that impact the operations, the facility as you tie those hydrocrackers in?", "William R. Klesse", "So Lane Riggs that runs Refining is with us, and Lane is going to answer you.", "Lane Riggs", "So in terms of -- we anticipate starting up Port Arthur as mentioned earlier, in the second half, and then we'll finish mechanical completion on St. Charles right at year-end. We have start-up teams on the ground already, working to get these things started up over the licensors and our own internal refinery experts, and we have a pretty good strategy in terms of trying to acquire feed -- getting the feedstock for them, and so we're working through all that.", "Joseph W. Gorder", "And then I guess on the product side, we've got, Jeff, we\u2019ve got this stuff in place to move the barrels out. I mean, we're -- at Port Arthur, we\u2019re looking forward to having the high-quality, high-cetane diesels that we've put out in the market and export. And then at St. Charles, we\u2019ve got the export capabilities, plus we're doing Parkway Pipeline project, which will allow us to move barrels out of that market up to Collins and then into Plantation or Colonial.", "William R. Klesse", "So Jeff let me go back and add a little more to Lane. So -- but the process we're checking, so it's mechanically complete, and then we have to check out these -- check it out here, and that's going to take us 3, 4 weeks. Then we have to do some pre-treating. Then you have to load the catalysts. So when you actually look at this thing, even though we've been training our people here for a year, actually, from mechanical completion to the point of starting up here is really going to take us between 60 and 90 days. So that if you actually look at this, where I've told some of you guys we could get this done in 6 weeks to 8 weeks, it's really going to take us a little longer than that because of some of the catalysts. Remember, these are high-pressure units running at 2,200 pounds. So we really won't see the benefit of the unit at Port Arthur until the fourth quarter in the P&L, and the same would be true at St. Charles. It'll probably spill to very late in the first quarter or actually see the full benefit in the second quarter.", "Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Gotcha. Very helpful. And does the integration impact the throughput into the crude unit?", "Lane Riggs", "Jeff, this is Lane again. No, we did all the tie-ins and all that tie-in work on previous turnarounds, so we don't anticipate a throughput on the rest of the refinery to start these up.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "I hopped on a tad late, so I apologize if you covered this, but I had a question regarding the opportunity cost of the downtime in the first quarter. Obviously, a very heavy turnaround period, and that weighs on your efficiency and capture rates. I'm curious if you can give us an idea of what your kind of normalized earnings may have looked like had you not had that downtime.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Blake, our estimate for first quarter impact was about $170 million.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "$170 million. And that's pre- or post-tax, Ashley?", "Ashley M. Smith", "That's pretax.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then I guess, I get somewhat related to that, obviously, as we move to kind of a more normalized run rate and, hopefully, cash flow improves, the buyback run rate in the first quarter is about $100 million. Should we think that, that run rate kind of improves heading into 2Q with, hopefully, improved cash flow?", "William R. Klesse", "I would not make that assumption. It is tied to the free cash flow. I have said that we will look at our dividend again in July as we completed the Port Arthur hydrocracker. We also have $750 million of debt that matures here in April.", "Ashley M. Smith", "We've already paid.", "William R. Klesse", "We already paid. We also actually called $107 million of tax exempt debt that was economic to call, and that gets paid, right here, first of May.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Right, it's later this week.", "William R. Klesse", "Later this week. So we are also working the interest rate arbitrage that you have on our debt. So there's things that we're doing with our cash. But our intent, Blake, is to return cash to the shareholders as we\u2019ve said and have one of the highest yields among our peer group, and we continue to do that, and we think our equity is still very inexpensive.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rakesh Advani from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Rakesh Advani - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I know you guys had highlighted that you're seeing a pretty strong export environment. I just kind of wanted your views on how long do you think that would -- is going to last for and what the impact of Motiva will be on it.", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Well, I'll tell you, you said it, and it's true. I mean, the export markets are very strong right now. I mean, diesel growth and demand abroad is very high. We\u2019re seeing diesel exports, not perhaps at the highest levels they've ever been, but certainly, very near that. And for the quarter, we exported 170,000 barrels a day of diesel. The bulk of that went to Europe. The rest of it went to Latin America. On the gasoline side, we're also seeing strong demand there. And again, gasoline exports are at very high levels historically. And for the quarter, we exported 80,000 barrels a day of gasoline, most of which went to Mexico and Latin America. If you look at the factors that are affecting the export market going forward, I mean, they're not factors that can readily change. I mean, Chile is importing as much, if not more, distillates as they ever have, and their demand continues to grow. So far this year, they're importing 83,000 barrels a day. Mexico's diesel imports were 105,000 barrels a day, and their Refining capacity just doesn't meet their internal demand for products. If you look at what's happening on the gasoline side, you've got Venezuela with capacity off-line. We've got Hovensa shut down, so that production is out of the market, Mexico gasoline imports have averaged 392,000 barrels per day. That's up 5% over the previous year, and Petrobras is importing significant volumes of gasoline and diesel. So all of these are based on solid economic activity and lack of supply. And so these aren't things that readily get addressed. Now how will Motiva affect this? Well, obviously, anytime you're going to put more product into the market, you're going to offset other product unless there's growth in the market. And so, who would be at risk in this case? It would be the marginal caps [ph]. It would be the marginal refiners, and that's not us.", "William R. Klesse", "I think I would add to this that Joe mentioned Hovensa is down. We've shut Aruba down. Aruba made distillate. It did not make gasoline. Marcus Hook is down. Trainer is down, but I guess it's coming back. So if you look at just the basics in the U.S. supply, even though some is East Coast, some is Gulf Coast, really Motiva is just kind of filling in a void that these refineries have left. So I think, initially, there'll be some logistics as people try to jockey things around. Some will go in the pipelines because Colonial has done an expansion. Plantation has some room. And some will get exported, but on the other hand, there's been refineries taken off-line, and just remember that Cura\u00e7ao is limping along. And obviously, the Venezuelans are really no longer in the export market.", "Rakesh Advani - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And just one final one. I know on your slides that you put on your presentation you've talked about the Brent to LLS inversion. You've kind of given the range, I guess, maybe between 2014 and '15 where you could see an inversion based on 2011 imports of light to medium sweet crude. I guess the recent data from the EIA is showing that imports of that kind of crude is only averaging about 510,000 a day. Do you think this would kind of alter your view on maybe it happening even sooner than expected?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, I think it's a very fair question. Remember on our slide, there is a little bit of a dilemma of where you make the cut between some of the lights and the mediums. So if you're looking at our slide, let's just stick with our numbers and -- because we probably have some medium crude in there. But basically, the U.S. is going to push out of the Gulf Coast the light-sweet crude. Now it is happening quickly. Eagle Ford production is increasing dramatically, and that is getting to the Coast. Some of the other crudes, Enterprise says they're going to start up -- Enterprise, Enbridge will start up Seaway here in May, right? In May, don't forget you have Magellan on Longhorn, so you have all these things that are going to happen in the next year. So all that crude is coming. The big piece of that, though, I will remind you and our assumptions is that BP at Whiting where BP\u2019s heavy-up [ph] project, and so that's a big, sort of like 200,000 barrels a day of the volume that basically gets pushed back into Cushing. So we still think it's a '14, '15, but your question is correct. It makes a little difference where you're cutting the lights and the mediums.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Dahlman Rose.", "Sam Margolin - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division", "You mentioned Seaway. I was curious if you have any guidance for Seaway barrels that you might be buying for 2Q or later than that? I guess it\u2019s starting up, as you mentioned, within the next couple of weeks here.", "William R. Klesse", "Well, we're not a shipper on Seaway. It will just be availability of barrels on the Gulf Coast.", "Sam Margolin - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And for those, that would be, they'd already be repriced at LLS once they get there?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, I guess. It just depends on how many of them there are.", "Sam Margolin - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division", "All right. Lastly, this is more of a macro question. There's been a lot of sort of outside-of-industry interest in refining assets. Presumably, it's just a reaction to simple coastal cracks expanding. It seems like the benefits of this capacity rationalization that we saw lead to events that sort of offset those benefits down the road when you get restarts. Are you concerned about the levels of light-sweet cracks here on the coast as we get restarts and sort of private equity or outside buyers chasing the market?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, we believe there's still too much refining capacity in the U.S., as well as certainly, Western Europe. So the Atlantic Basin has too much refining capacity. So how does the industry balance it? It balances by reducing operating rate. And so, as these plants, certainly as Trainer appears that it's going to come back into the market, it's going to put some refined product back in there, and that will affect the operating rates. But the industry is slowly rationalizing capacity. It just does. Some things die hard.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI Group.", "Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Can we just summarize your comments on U.S. gasoline and diesel demand to say that it appears from your -- and I know this isn\u2019t perfect -- functional and geographical perspective that we may be gravitating towards maybe minus 1% to 0% growth year-to-date? Is that kind of consistent with what you were saying earlier?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, certainly, it's down. Gene is going to give you his comments.", "S. Eugene Edwards", "This is Gene. If you look at the monthly data or the weekly data that\u2019s come out, it looks like gasoline demand has been off about 4% year to date. But something interesting, the DOE just published the February monthlies, which is all the revised data. And I think they we're missing exports last year on gasoline. They were understating them. This year, they've been overstating them. Also some discrepancies on naphtha, whether it's a blend stock or a chemical feedstock and how that gets categorized. So when they published the February data, they actually revised gasoline demand up by 300,000 barrels a day, which put it basically flat to last year. So this was February. In January, we had a similar thing going on. We won't really have the March data until a month from now, but it looks like gasoline demand is a lot flatter than last year than what the all the other data has been showing so far. [indiscernible] distillate, it got revised up. The month -- the weekly data showed it's about flat to last year. The monthly data says it's up about 2% versus last year.", "Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And Gene, that's consistent with what you guys are seeing in your markets?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Exactly.", "Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And also Bill, you mentioned a minute ago about the resurgence in the petrochemical industry, something along those lines, and so you mentioned you might be interested in participating in the value chain. And so to the degree you're interested, could you comment on what you mean by that? And does that include grassroots petrochemicals?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, I don't know if it includes grassroots in the sense of businesses where we don't participate. I mean, you need to bring some value to this conversation. But we make benzene, toluene, xylene and we make a lot of propylene today. I'm sure we do something else. Is there anything else we make? But we're big in propylene here. So we've looked at mixed xylenes. Obviously, these condensates, actually I think, will replace some oil long-term into gasoline. So there's a lot of that type of thing, and we're looking at how do we take advantage of this because if you think strategically about Valero, we largely make fuel, and 80% of our output is fuel, and it doesn't necessarily all have to come from oil.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just a follow-up to an earlier comment that you are running about 200,000 a day of I think it was WTI-linked is perhaps how you described it, and you had several projects underway to double that. Firstly, what's the timeframe on those projects? And I guess the big question here is how much more light-sweet U.S. crude you believe you can run on a longer-term basis and how much that would cost?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, let me answer you then, and Joe can add to this. What -- at Three Rivers, Corpus Christi, we\u2019re approaching about all we can run without getting some -- without a permit option and a project. And that number is going to be a hundred and do you guys have [indiscernible] Ashley?", "Ashley M. Smith", "About 140,000, yes. 130,000.", "William R. Klesse", "Including Houston or no?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "No. That would not\u2026", "William R. Klesse", "110,000 at Corpus and at Three Rivers, and then we're doing 30,000 or so at Houston. Then we have numerous pre flash options and things that allow us 30,000 here, 40,000 there, at some of our other plants, which we can do because it loads up our light engine. Beyond that, we are still basically a heavy complex coking refiner. And we still believe, strategically, that the Keystone Pipeline is going to be built. It's going to be built on Obama's time scale, which is first quarter of '13. We think that there will be approval if he wins election and that the pipeline will get done here by the end of '14 or early '15 and that heavy crude oil will come to the U.S. Gulf Coast. So -- but Valero still brings value in being able to operate these coking-type refineries. And it'll all be driven economically with our LPs, which will squeeze in as much of the light crude if it's priced properly.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Bill, that list got me 200,000 of existing. Where's the extra 200,000 coming from?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "If we take a look at what we can do, you can swing Houston to run 100% light-sweet. Now this is all assuming that the economics makes sense for us to do this. You can run more light-sweet crude in Texas City, and we could run light-sweet crude in Port Arthur.", "William R. Klesse", "Okay. So I'll give you some numbers because obviously we do all this work. We could run about 85,000 at Houston, 40,000 at Texas City, 40,000 at Port Arthur, 20,000 at St. Charles and 50,000 or so at Meraux and so, we can do those kind of things so...", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Is that with no extra spending that you could get there?", "William R. Klesse", "There is some spending but minor, very minor.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then if there was -- sorry to just press the subject a bit, but it's very interesting and a very big story as far as we're concerned...", "William R. Klesse", "Well, it's because every company you will talk to is going to try to do what I'm speaking.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes. And what do you think -- what would be the next leg if you wanted to -- let's say, for example, Keystone was not approved or it was uncertain for another 3 years, 4 years, whatever? Would you -- what would you do then?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, what we would be forced to do is look at being able to run more light-sweet -- light and medium crudes in some our refineries, because it would all be dependent on what the diff is for the heavy sour.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes. What -- so to take the second part of that first, what is the discount? I mean, does -- I think there's an approximate number to think about for how much discount or premium of heavy oil, whatever it is that would cause you just to say, okay, all light-sweet from here?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, we think that between in a SUN coker, between 10% to 12% of the price, you can run a SUN coker and make money. And if you would drop down, if you get down to 8%, 7%, if you still have $100 oil here, you're running out of economics on the coker. You think so, Gene?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Probably so. A lot of it depends on where the medium sours are too.  Today, medium sours are running between $5.50, $6 discounts to LLS, so we are still seeing good margins to run the medium sours in those sort of refineries versus sweet. And then they'd look at the medium sours, it's going to be a switch between that and the heavy sours so that\u2019s about a $6 spread as well between those 2.", "William R. Klesse", "And so this is what Gene's getting into more detail is this is what happens every single day here. We have a whole department that runs these models for us, and it would just be -- if we don't have the discounts out there for heavy sour, we're optimizing the system all the time. Remember, we're buying our oil every day.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "But what I'm wondering, Bill, is at what point would you actually start investing to up your light. I mean, obviously, I guess you wouldn't do that until you were sure Keystone was not going to happen.", "William R. Klesse", "Well, we would -- we might do some pre flashing. But the issue you went into, quite frankly, is you load up your gas plant and your light end capability. And so those projects certainly become bigger. And then we have to be honest. In the world where we live in today, it is extremely difficult to get these permits as long as we have to do CO2. In Texas, it's terrible, and Kim's here, and she's telling that even in Louisiana and other states, it's extremely difficult now.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And that's because you get more CO2 with a light-sweet crude?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, because we may have more heaters, you got more process, so if we trip -- yes, go ahead, speak", "Kimberly S. Bowers", "Right, so if we trip them into the tailor [ph] and roll the CO2, now we have to cover CO2 in our permits, whether you're in Texas or any place else for -- if we hit that major level so...", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. Is there any sense of what level is? Sorry to keep pressing on this, but it's kind of crucial.", "Kimberly S. Bowers", "No. I think it's 75,000 or 100,000. I mean, if the tailoring rolls, it's a threshold that's higher than it would normally be to trip it, but still, almost any significant project will trip it.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "That's really interesting...", "William R. Klesse", "But that now makes -- us and everybody else has to get a permit that addresses the CO2.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "But I think, as just a final point, you don't expect the crude export ban to be lifted, right?", "William R. Klesse", "We do not.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Is there a specific reason for that, Bill, or is it a general kind of opposition to raise -- what would effectively raise crude price in the U.S, I guess?", "William R. Klesse", "It's just we just have felt that, that's going to be very difficult to have happen. But I wouldn't say we're giving you a scientific or any better answer here than you would have yourself.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just maybe some follow-up on this broader Gulf Coast impact from U.S. production growth. I mean, just beyond maxing out light runs in your system, which clearly isn\u2019t optimal -- at current differentials isn\u2019t optimal for many of your refineries you just detailed. But before any major Canadian solution is available, as a next step, I mean, can you talk through the -- an increased kind of blending opportunity here with the overload of lights to kind of blend into some of these medium crudes to press those discounts or re-create those. Is that -- I mean do you -- how do you see blending playing out when you have, essentially, a system in the Gulf of Mexico and you could debate the time based upon what you think production growth date is, where you're going to back out at least one type of crude at some point that you can debate the timeframe. But over the next couple of years, how does blending kind of play into that?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, it's a very good question. Now we aren't blending or anything at a terminal, so this is all at refineries. Now we are, at St. Charles and at Corpus Christi, putting in facilities that will let us run a broader selection of crudes, and then we will blend them for the process unit, because we'd like to show the process unit a relatively steady diet here of crude. So we actually have -- 2 of our plants have projects underway right now. One is tankage. One is a lot of pipe, to allow us to blend crudes for the unit, which would let us run a broader spectrum of crude. And we're looking at the same type of projects for the other plants as well. So we're doing it at the refineries, and it lets us then optimize that crude cost.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Does the blending raise the potential ceiling of a light-sweet diet that's ultimately kind of blended into something else before it's run versus what you stated?", "William R. Klesse", "Yes. We would optimize -- this is a little bit of -- you're asking something here, so we're going to give you -- this is how we view it, all right?", "Lane Riggs", "This is Lane Riggs. So the numbers you heard from Bill earlier in terms of the amount of light sweet crudes into each one of the refineries is pretty much the number on a blended basis into these refineries up to sort of a light ends constraint or a crude tower shell capacity constraint making -- backing out medium sour or light-sweet in that refinery.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. So there\u2019s not an incremental back-out of any kind of medium barrel -- if the price allowed it without a front-end investment?", "Lane Riggs", "We would. We look at the relative value of these domestic sweets or any sweets for that matter versus the medium sour, and we increment up to a constraint on the refinery, and that's so -- the numbers that Bill had given you earlier is roughly our constraint to a light end constraint or a shell capacity. Probably backing out depending on the refinery whether it could be medium sour or sweet.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. Understood. A different question on Keystone South. I didn't know if you've had this in your comments, but then would you have to nominate in that line to maintain a position in the Keystone XL, the transnational line?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "No. They're reserving the space in the South segment for those that nominated space on the -- as part of the bullet line.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Right. But if you ultimately wanted -- if you didn't take Keystone South capacity, would that negatively impact your ability for your nominations when the line is ultimately...", "Joseph W. Gorder", "From Hardisty. No, it would not affect our commitments from Hardisty South. We have our space. The committed shippers on the northern segment will have their space all the way down. Now when I ship from Cushing South, then we need to nominate incremental space. In other words, we've got our space all the way from Hardisty to the Gulf. But if we just say we want to move Mid-Continent barrels from Cushing South in addition, we would need to nominate.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Understood. And then maybe lastly, do you have any closure cost estimate on the Aruba Refinery, what that...", "William R. Klesse", "As of today, we've just suspended operations. So we are working all our options and still continue to work our options. And so, it's a different situation than some of the other numbers that you've seen in the marketplace. But ours would be less than $100 million, but the facts are that's not what -- we're working really some options here that will be good for our shareholders.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. Wow. Maybe you could sell to Delta.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Arjun Murti from Goldman Sachs.", "Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Sorry to go back to this, but just so I'm understanding the light sweet ability in the Gulf Coast, you can do 200,000 today. To do another 200,000 requires some modest amount of investment and then to go beyond that, you have the issues with the permits and more meaningful CapEx? Am I understanding that correctly?", "William R. Klesse", "That's correct.", "Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Any quantification on how much minimal investment is and the timeframe to do it?", "Lane Riggs", "Not much. Like Bill said, we would -- to do more than we have the capacity today, we'll have to put some pre flash towers in some of our heavy sour locations because the shell capacity of those towers really were designed to run a heavier diet. So it'd be tough...", "William R. Klesse", "No, I don't think we have a good number for you.", "Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then separately, you talked about ongoing portfolio optimization. You've obviously taken the action at Aruba and the East Coast plants. Where does the California fit in terms of how you see it as part of your system? Clearly -- or presumably not as bleak of an outlook as the East Coast. Do you see any light at the end of the tunnel there or any other actions you can take to improve your California outlook?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, Arjun, we are taking action. Our costs at Benicia are too high, and we've been addressing that to get our per barrel cost down and we continue to work that. But the California market is a big market, and we still have 11% unemployment in California, so they have many, many economic issues in the state. The thing that is struggling to us is that their policies, primarily from CARB, are extremely anti-business, and the consumer really does not understand how much his prices are going to go up, which is what CARB wants so that they get the conservation. So you asked a proper question. We\u2019re trying to optimize our portfolio so that we can compete long-term, and we're trying to evaluate all of these issues and what our real potential is on the West Coast.", "Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Would separating it from Valero make sense? And is that a consideration for you?", "William R. Klesse", "I hadn't thought of -- you mean like separate it into a freestanding business?", "Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, Valero California, whatever you want to call it. Separate company, spun out from Valero Corp.", "William R. Klesse", "We have not looked at that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Sorry to circle back on the light sweet issue one more time. So if you put in these flash towers with minimal CapEx, does that change your crude flexibility at all going forward? In other words, can you swing back to the heavier barrel, if need be, if prices are correct?", "William R. Klesse", "Yes, we can. You guys are asking us things that we have not engineered here. So we're off in a thing here -- the conversation is probably 4 years out. But yes, if we -- if that's what happens. But I want to emphasize what we do every day and, frankly, what all our competitors do every day is they're running their LPs, and they play -- they go to a crude mix that they believe is optimal for that facility. And what we're doing right now is we're building some tankage at St. Charles, we're doing work at Corpus Christi, that allows us to blend crudes, give us more flexibility here so that we can run and buy some other crudes that are priced economically.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "When they're available?", "William R. Klesse", "When they're available. But as this volume continues to increase, we, as everybody, will wind up being able to run more of this light and medium crude oils. Because we will do things around our plants to let us do it, because we do believe that LLS is going to sell at a discount to Brent, and that's the main point that will drive you that way.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Right. Mike, a couple of quick items. What's the remaining CapEx on the hydrocrackers as of the end of the first quarter? And did I hear you right that the debt maturity in April, you paid that off?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Yes, we paid off the debt maturity, the $750 million. The remaining capital on the hydrocrackers, it's about -- Port Arthur, we look like we have about $300 million left and on St. Charles about $500 million left.", "William R. Klesse", "Just so you know, there's a couple other little projects around there that are finishing as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just a follow-up. In our discussion around the incremental amount of light-sweet crude you could run in the Gulf Coast, where does Memphis fit into all this? I mean, clearly, I think that's consuming LLS benchmark crudes. So what kind of crude slate is that consuming? And how would that benefit from an LLS discount versus Brent?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, it will benefit in the sense that -- what product prices are. But your observation is correct. Memphis runs an LLS plus because Capline flows north. So this goes all the way back to a question earlier that someone asked about Capline going south. Also, some crudes can come into the refinery by water as well, but the plant runs LLS plus. It does have a very strong local market though. It has -- I guess it's -- the largest rack in our system are very close, and we have a big customer for turbine fuel, and so we operate in more of a regional capacity at the Memphis plant.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And on the hydrogen plant investments that came online I believe you said in the first quarter here, you gave us some guidance in your slide presentations of around $100 million in EBITDA was your base case, and I think using 2011 prices, you said about $176 million using LLS, but I assume that was based on last year's natural gas prices. So I was trying to figure out what the lower gas price for this year means in terms of potential uplift for that investment.", "William R. Klesse", "The guys are looking it up. Remember, at McKee, we had the catcracker down. We're still running some oil there, but we have a big turnaround going on. So the McKee hydrogen plant has not run to capacity yet. We\u2019ve got the numbers here.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Faisel, this is Ashley. For every dollar change in the price of natural gas per MMBtu, it adds about $6.5 million a year in EBITDA, and based on the '11 pricing, we're effectively using $4 natural gas. So you could easily -- on your call, whatever your call on natural gas is, it looks like at least $1 lower, could be more.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from Harry Mateer from Barclays.", "Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "A quick one from me. Mike, can you just confirm the April maturity? Did you pay that down with cash on hand? Or did you use the bank facility or the AR line?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "We have dipped into our AR line a little bit while we paid off this maturity. But we started the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash.", "Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. So what -- it would help maybe you can -- what's the pro forma debt number, I guess, we should be using?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "I guess...", "William R. Klesse", "We're probably going to go ahead and issue some tax exempt bonds that we have the ability to do. So if you want a good number, I'm going to say to you 7 1 or 7 2.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Okay, thank you, John. And I just wanted to thank the investors for listening to this call. If you have any questions, please contact the Investor Relations department. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

My name is Trish, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ashley Smith. Ashley, please go ahead.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Okay. Thank you, Trish, and good morning, and welcome to our earnings call. With me today are Bill Klesse, our Chairman and CEO;  Mike Ciskowski, our CFO; Joe Gorder, Chief Operating Officer; Kim Bowers, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of our senior management team. If you have not received an earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com.", "Also, attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact me after the call.", "Before we get started, I'd like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we described in our filings with the SEC.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Mike.", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Thanks, Ashley, and thank you for joining us today.", "As noted in the release, we reported a second quarter 2012 earnings of $831 million or $1.50 per share. In addition, our Board of Directors has authorized company management to pursue a separation of our retail business from the remainder of the company. We believe a separation of our retail business by way of a tax-efficient distribution to our shareholders will create operational flexibility within the businesses and unlock value for our shareholders.", "As independent companies, both retail and the remaining business will be better positioned to focus on their industry-specific strategies. We expect to have more details in the coming months.", "I should also note that our Board of Directors recently approved an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.15 per share to $0.175 per share, the highest level in company history.", "Returning to our second quarter results. Operating income was $1.4 billion versus operating income of $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2011. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher throughput margins in the U.S. Mid-Continent, the U.S. West Coast and the North Atlantic refining regions, combined with higher throughput at our refineries and higher margins in our U.S. retail business.", "These improvements were somewhat offset by lower refinery margins on the Gulf Coast and lower ethanol margins.", "Our second quarter refining throughput margin was $10.63 per barrel, which is a slight decrease versus the second quarter of 2011, the margin being $11.41 per barrel.", "The decrease in refining throughput margin was mainly due to lower discounts on crude oils and feedstocks, lower margins for gasoline in the Gulf Coast and lower margins for other products such as petrochemical feedstocks. However, we did see higher margins for diesel in all of our regions, except the West Coast, and higher gasoline margins in the Mid-Continent, the West Coast and the North Atlantic regions.", "Our second quarter 2012 refining throughput volume averaged 2.7 million barrels per day, up 342,000 barrels per day from the second quarter of 2011. The increase in throughput volumes was mainly due to the addition of capacity from the acquisition of the Pembroke and Meraux refineries.", "Refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter of 2012 were $3.59 per barrel, which was lower than our first quarter 2012 and our guidance due to higher throughput volumes and lower maintenance expense.", "Our Pembroke and Meraux refineries showed significant improvement during the second quarter, combining to contribute over $130 million in operating income. The increase in performance of these refineries is a result of operational improvements we have been diligently implementing since the acquisitions.", "For example, at Pembroke, we have improved the feedstock selection, reformulated the SEC catalyst and optimized the product slate and blending. Examples at Meraux include improvements in the ROSE unit operations and in refining optimization.", "Subsequent to the second quarter, we had an unfortunate event in late July at the Meraux refinery when a power outage during storms brought the plant down, a fire occurred when restarting the crude unit. No one was injured, but all units at the refinery are currently shut down. Repairs are in progress and we estimate the refinery will resume operations at normal rates by the end of August. In the meantime, certain units may be restarted while repairs continue. The impact on throughputs for the third quarter will be reflected in guidance that Ashley will provide in a few minutes.", "The export market remains solid as our Gulf Coast refineries continue to benefit from low cost of natural gas and increasing access to discounted domestic crude oil.", "We believe these competitive advantages enable Valero and other U.S. Gulf Coast refiners to profitably take market share from less competitive Atlantic Basin refiners, particularly in Europe and the U.S. East Coast.", "Our retail business had a great second quarter and reported its highest ever quarterly operating income of $172 million, consisting of $134 million in the U.S. and $38 million in Canada. Our retail business continued to perform exceptionally well.", "The Ethanol segment reported $5 million of operating income, which was down $59 million from the second quarter of 2011, mainly due to lower gross margins as ethanol prices were pressured by excess industry supplies.", "With Ethanol margins under further pressure in the third quarter due to rising corn prices, we recently stopped production at the Albion and Linden plants and have trimmed utilization at the other plants.", "In the second quarter, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $171 million, which was in line with our guidance. Depreciation and amortization expense was $386 million. Net interest expense was $74 million and the effective tax rate in the second quarter was 35%.", "Regarding cash flows in the second quarter, capital spending was $800 million, which includes $106 million of turnaround and catalyst expenditures. Our expected capital spending for the full year of 2012 is around $3.6 billion, an increase from prior guidance, mainly due to acceleration of certain projects originally scheduled to be completed in 2013. We expect 2013 capital spending will be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.", "Also in the second quarter, we returned $124 million in cash to shareholders as we paid $83 million in dividends and we spent $41 million to purchase 1.8 million shares of our common stock. In addition, we used $862 million to pay down debt and received $300 million from the reissuance of tax exempt bonds.", "With respect to our balance sheet at the end of June, total debt was $7 billion, cash was $1.3 billion and our debt-to-cap ratio net of cash was 25.7%. At the end of the second quarter, we also had nearly $4.7 billion of additional liquidity available. And in July, we renewed and increased the size of our accounts receivable sales facility to $1.5 billion, providing an additional liquidity of $500 million.", "We continue to make progress on our key growth projects. Our Port Arthur hydrocracker project is on track to be mechanically complete during the third quarter of 2012 and is expected to achieve full operation during the fourth quarter of 2012.", "The St. Charles hydrocracker project is expected to reach mechanical completion by the end of the year, with full operation in the second quarter of 2013.", "Through our recent actions to increase the dividend and the potential separation of our retail business, it is clear that we are working to maximize shareholder value. We look forward to the improvement in our free cash flow from the planned decline in our capital spending, the expected contribution from our growth projects and the favorable industry trends that continued to accrue to our assets.", "So now I'm going to turn it over to Ashley to cover the earnings model portions.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Great. Thanks, Mike. In modeling our third quarter operations, you should expect the refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.43 million to 1.47 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 430,000 to 440,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 265,000 to 275,000 barrels per day; and the North Atlantic at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day.", "Refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter are expected to be around $3.85 per barrel. Regarding our ethanol operations in the third quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 3 million gallons per day and operating expenses should average approximately $0.36 per gallon, including the $0.04 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization.", "With respect to some of the other items for the third quarter, we expect G&A expense, excluding depreciation, to be around $175 million, and net interest expense should be around $70 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense in the third quarter should be around $395 million. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter should be approximately 37%.", "Trish, that concludes our opening remarks. We will now open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Douglas Leggate from Bank of America.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So fellows, the -- my question, I guess, is on the step-up that you're expecting on free cash flow. Your dividend, even with the increases, is -- if I'm not mistaken, is somewhere around $400 million a year. It's fairly -- it's still fairly small. So I guess I'm trying to understand what is the priority for the use of cash? And then answering that should give us an idea of what you think the right debt-to-cap level is for the -- for this portfolio at this point.", "William R. Klesse", "Doug, this is Klesse. Our use of cash, as we're generating more cash and next year, we clearly expect to be generating more cash, is first, we're going to maintain our investment-grade credit rating. Second, we're going to hold a little more cash than historically as we have it just because of the volatility in our business. You watch the screens, you know how much things move, so we just think we need to hold some more cash. And then we've been very clear, we're going to return additional cash to the shareholder. And having said that, on the last 1.5 years, we've paid off about $1.5 billion of debt. And next year, we have $460 million or so of debt that becomes due, and our plan will be to pay that off as well. So I think we're demonstrating of returning cash to the shareholders with the previous things I just said. And you asked, well, what is the proper or our target debt to cap, and I'm just going to tell you, we're going to maintain the investment credit -- investment-grade credit rating and maybe our debt to cap just goes a little lower. And today, it's 25%, I think.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "The -- several quick question. Mike, can you tell me what's the working capital and also the inventory in excess of the book?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Yes. The working capital, total current assets are $14 billion, total current liabilities is $10.8 billion and then our inventory above the book value is $6.5 billion.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Do you have a number you can share, what is in your retail business, the taxable base?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Yes, we do. The tax basis in our retail at June 30 was approximately $900 million to $950 million.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So that means that from a tax efficiency standpoint, the offer, if anyone want to buy it, they need to be really high in order for you to feel comfortable because it's going to be a huge tax buy?", "William R. Klesse", "I think you have -- this is Klesse. First off, we need to establish, we have about $500 million of EBITDA from this business and Mike can walk you through that. You have to consider some overheads. And we have the split between Canada and the U.S., so we have certain tax issues in each jurisdiction. That's why we're very carefully saying we're going to work a tax-efficient distribution. However, and I know on this phone call, we have a refining analyst, but if you'll look at the freestanding retail companies, certainly Couche-Tard and Casey's, you'll see that their multiple is up around 10, and today our EBITDA multiple is around 3.7 or a little less than 4. So if we -- and let's stop and look at our retail business. We're very well run, we're excellent financial performers, they've had very good returns, we're extremely well located, with nearly 2/3 of the units access, in the U.S. And in Canada, we have an excellent market share in Qu\u00e9bec. We own a lot of units. They're not leased. And if you look at our data, which we'll provide, you'll see that many of our units are owned. So the whole business is an extremely solid business. So then it's your job to, okay, what is the correct EBITDA ratio for this business, and I'll tell you, we're up there with the very best, if we're not the best. And so the number becomes large. So that's why we've been very clear about tax efficient's been, however, all options are on the table.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Sure. Bill, is ethanol going to stay with Valero or is it going to go to the retail?", "William R. Klesse", "Ethanol stays with Valero. We're really a wholesale provider, a plant operator producing ethanol. Retailer is the marketing business.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Paul, it's Ashley. Just 2 things. First of all, if you want any more of the balance sheet items, that's now on Page 5 of our earnings release tables.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, great. And 2 final one. One, that is an interesting development. Someone put the refinery into a variable MLP. I don't know if you guys have looked at that and whether that this is something fundamental. Do you think that you're really against it or that you think that it could be interesting? And then finally that, acquisition is -- how important is that a part of your strategy for the next 1 or 2 years?", "William R. Klesse", "Okay. So on the variable MLP, of course, we've looked at it. We watched what happened to one of the other refining companies, and we're open to increasing long-term shareholder value. On the other hand, having said that, we saw how this traded and we don't really think, and I don't know what it is today, that a 19% yield is really providing the value to the shareholders. So in the sense of values all around, what the assets worth and then the return. So I think it remains to be seen whether that's really something that's in our shareholders' interests. And then on acquisition, we look at assets that are in the market. But today, there's really nothing happening. And we have confidentiality agreements, obviously.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Kessler from Tudor, Pickering.", "Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions. One is just quick and that is, do you have an estimated repair cost for Meraux? And then a more conceptual question, and forgive me for this being of a conceptual nature, but Bill, if we entered into a scenario where the Gulf Coast coking margins came under pressure and that is the spread between, say, LLS and Maya came down to a minimum level, how low could that go and still have cokers operate on the Gulf Coast, whether in your own portfolio or others? And really, where I'm going with that is, trying to reconcile with you that LLS comes under pressure, which I think you all may subscribe to. And also a view that I think you have that the coking margins are maintained at a level that continue to support continued coking utilization rates.", "William R. Klesse", "So Robert, on the repair costs of Meraux, about $10 million. We're going to start some of the units up here in the next week or so, but the full plan won't be up, like Mike said, until probably the end of the month. And then -- so coking margins, I've given in the sense into a sunk coker, I believe that you can get somewhere down in 8% to 9% -- somewhere not much lower than 8%, I think, you agree? And know a sunk coker. But then what we've done in the past and some of the people on the call will remember, as other companies did, when coking margins came under pressure several years ago, we started to produce more fuel oil [ph]. It was more economic to make fuel oil [ph] and cut back on coking. And so I'm sure that if such a situation happened, you would see us start to spare cokers, just like our competitors would, putting as much light into the units as we can and optimizing it daily, but it's sunk coker. I've been very clear in my opinion that after [indiscernible] of this plan, you're not going to see grassroots coking built on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Something's going to happen to dramatically change. And yes, we do subscribe to the fact that we do believe LLS is going to sell us the Brent and we're saying, I guess, that pretty well next year, you're going to push out all the light sweet crude out of the U.S. Gulf Coast.", "Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "It seems like as long as you're still pulling in some imports, it gets that Brent support for relative parity and maybe you have sort of a gap down once you push out that last barrel. Is that the right way to think of it as sort of binomial rather than a ratable price degradation?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, I see your point. So you still have some light sweet imports into the East Coast, but on the Gulf Coast, I think it will just be mediums and heavies, and it's where you draw the line. And I think you're still going to see the freight advantage, at least, of $2 or $3 versus Brent. And -- but that's why this whole conversation is the reason that Valero is very supportive of bringing Canadian heavy sour crude oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Then I think it'll price where you can still put it into a SUN coke.", "Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "And just so I understand your number, you said 8%. I'm assuming that's a rate of return on a SUN cost and a coker. What spread do you assume to get that return?", "William R. Klesse", "Oh, it would be 8% of the price of oil. I was trying to put it in terms -- because it moves around on us and it does -- it is dependent because of the liquid volume loss as to the absolute price of oil. So yes, 8%, I'm saying of the price of -- $100, you need at least -- be at least at $92, I guess. Now it's into a sunk coker, and you're not making much money there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I guess, just to hit on the retail a little bit. I mean it seems like as an industry overall, the thought always seems to be, be vertically integrated. Can you address maybe a little of how this spinoff would affect that aspect of the business for you?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, this is the company-operated retail that we're talking about in the United States. And in Canada, it's our company-operated retail, but we have a little different business model in Canada. We actually manage the street price even where we have our agents. But also in this segment, includes our home heat business that's in Canada and our cardlock business. But we have, on top of that, a wholesale marketing business. So this, if you add this up, it's 1,027 units in the States and 775 units in Canada. But in addition to that, we have 4,000 branded Valero outlets, and we will still run a branded, wholesale business. So if you think of Valero then after the spin of our retail company or separation, whatever transpires, Valero's really going be a refining and wholesale marketing company with some petrochemical feedstock production, ethanol production, power generation, hydrogen and associated logistics, so we're just a manufacturing company with a wholesale marketing business. So we're still vertically integrated. We just don't have in the States, about 120,000 barrels a day of our production that's actually going through the hose. And then we're not going to be selling twinkies and beer and cigarettes. We're going to leave that to the retail group.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Well, there's a lot to be said for twinkies, beer and cigarettes, I'm sure.", "William R. Klesse", "There is, quite frankly.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "A separate question, I guess. If you get some proceeds from the EBITDA of the -- from the retail spinoff and also as your free cash expense from your CapEx reduction and also the EPS uplifts, is there any debt that it makes sense that you should bring in early, I'm thinking about restrictive covenants or just that you feel you could reprice at a low rate?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "No, there's not really any debt that we have that would make sense to try to prepay it or bring it in early or call it.", "William R. Klesse", "Yes, and we actually did a little of this last year, where we cooked the stuff that was -- some of the debt that was economic for us to take off the market, we did.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "All right. And then the Gulf Coast margins, I mean, obviously, globally you make the point that product inventories are low. It's just surprising, given the weak economy, that margins are so strong. I mean any thoughts as to the sustainability of the margins?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, we do think they're sustainable in this sense. Now they move seasonally and every other factor that I spoke about and volatility in our business. But our business, whether it's Valero or any of our competitor, anybody in the refining business, exports are a key part of the future for the U.S. refining industry, and there is -- from the U.S. Gulf Coast and we're very competitive. You have personnel that has terrific skill sets and very productive. And then we have low-cost natural gas and we're going to have a crude advantage, that's beginning to materialize significantly. So there's no question if you're a Mid-Continent refiner, you're making a lot of money and that's good and we benefit from that at a couple of our plants. But we believe that you can compete in the world market and certainly in the Atlantic Basin even by coming out of the U.S. Gulf Coast. And so -- but exports are a key part of it and they're allowing our whole industry to operate at a higher operating rate. Domestic demand, as you properly stated, is not very strong command and that reflects a very slow economy, even though it's growing and very high unemployment. Companies like Valero, over 80% of our output is fuels. And if people aren't working, you just aren't consuming the fuels.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And then a final question, just my impression is that you have a high degree of turnaround costs and activity in the first half of this year. Do you expect that 2013 will be a sort of a lighter turnaround schedule as a result, as you look forward in your plans?", "William R. Klesse", "We did have high turnaround this year. This is Lane Riggs. He's going to answer you.", "Lane Riggs", "Yes, I would say next year, we had a big refiner -- we had a large refiner turnaround at Qu\u00e9bec in the first quarter of next year and we have some other -- we have a big turnaround -- we had a recently large turnaround at Corpus Christi City also in the first quarter. So it stays roughly about the same size in the first quarter of next year versus this past first quarter --", "William R. Klesse", "So for us in turnaround and catalyst, in seems to be running about 500 million...", "Lane Riggs", "Million. That's right.", "William R. Klesse", "And that's -- it moves up and down a little bit around there, but around 500 million a year. And catalysts costs have come down some this year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Can you guys give us an update on Aruba? I believe you guys have an offer there and any associated inventory levels you have there that you've either liquidated or holding onto for the sale of the asset?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, in Aruba, the only inventory, really, out there now is for our other businesses, where we're taking advantage of [indiscernible]. So we don't have any inventory per se associated with the refinery, except that we do provide fuel oil to the utility and we also provide gasoline and diesel to the island, so -- which is part of our marketing distribution effort there. But basically, we have no inventory there that's in support of refining per se. And then as far as Aruba, we're still working the transaction. We did disclose most of the information in -- I guess it was last quarter's 10-Q.", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "In the 10-Q, yes.", "William R. Klesse", "And we're still working the transaction and the government of Aruba is extremely supportive. And we'll see how it turns out.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. Then on St. Charles, with the hydrocracker, I believe that the hydrocracker was supposed to be up and running in the fourth quarter, if I remember from some of your previous sort of presentations. But it looks like now it's going to be in the second quarter of 2013. Am I reading that wrong?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, you're not reading anything wrong. I have said the St. Charles hydrocracker would be finished by the end of the year, and we'd get it up in the first quarter. But now we are going to say it's the second quarter, we'll get it up. So to be -- this would be my schedule, and to be honest, some of my people will say that this was my schedule, not theirs. But I would tell you, we have slipped a month or 2 on both projects. However, these are big projects for Valero, each $1.5 billion plus there's some other stuff around it. Our people are doing a terrific job. If you can imagine the miles of cabling, this is what we're really finishing up at Port Arthur, is miles of cabling, and people are doing terrific. And we just are going to be a month or 2 later.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from a Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Just a few quick ones for you on the retail spin. Bill, you mentioned your intention to maintain investment-grade credit rating. I'm just wondering if the credit rating agencies have [indiscernible] on the spin yet? Secondly, on the retail, is it a strategic situation where the retailer was being starved of capital and as a standalone, maybe they undertake some additional capital projects or higher growth? And then finally, from a CapEx standpoint, the $2 billion to $2.5 billion next year, could you tell us what the breakout is associated with retail on that?", "William R. Klesse", "Okay. So on the debt, I'll just answer you. No, we have not talked to the rating agencies, but we will because our investment-grade rating, as I said, is very important to us. And we think, we're a very large player in this business, buying today over 2 million barrels a day of crude. We think that's important for our suppliers to know that we're investment-grade. On the second question -- I'm sorry, what was it, Blake?", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Just to remind you, the second question was basically from a strategic standpoint, as a standalone, I guess, was the retail somewhat being starved of capital or are they now allowed to maybe pursue higher growth options?", "William R. Klesse", "There is no question that we had a capital budget raise really in the U.S. of about $80 million, and in Canada, it was around $30 million. We have all the detail that they have both of those businesses have thrown off cash to the parent. And so clearly, as standalone businesses, they will be able to execute a strategy that the management feels is appropriate.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, great. And the third was on the CapEx. If you could just provide a breakout of next year, $2 billion to $2.5 billion, what portion was associated with retail, please?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Typically, retail spends about $130 million in CapEx for the whole segment, so that would be U.S. and Canada.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons & Company.", "Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "My question is associated with product exports. I was hoping you could talk about what you exported on gasoline and diesel in the second quarter and really, what your capability of exporting is. Is there substantial ability to export more than what you're already exporting and potential for any capital projects that might expand that capability?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Sure. Jeff, this is Joe. Jeff, in the second quarter, we exported about 165,000 barrels a day of diesel, primarily to Latin America and Europe, with really the bulk of it going to Europe. And the reason that, that number moves around, really, from month to month has more to do with the economics of the [indiscernible] than our ability to do it. We saw diesel strength adhere domestically, we kept it at home. When the arms [ph] to Europe or to Latin America, we go ahead and put it on the water and move it out. Gasoline exports in the quarter were 75,000 barrels a day. The bulk of that goes to Mexico, and then also into Latin America. And we're seeing continued strong demand for both as we go forward. And there's a host of reasons not much has changed in the market which would lead us to believe that those exports weren't going to be there going forward. As far as capacity, we would estimate that our capacities for gasoline are 250,000 barrels a day, give or take. And on the diesel, 275,000 to 300,000 barrels a day. And we continue to look at logistics projects. The team has been very active in assuring that we were going to have continued access to export markets and the logistics wouldn't be an issue. And there's some projects that have been identified, but nothing significant.", "William R. Klesse", "So it's a global market business and what happens is the exports tend to pull from domestic supplies. So it's only when pricing is actually better than the domestic market that we tend to export, and it's all driven on economics. And then the fellows here are telling me that to Roger's question earlier, where we -- I said 120,000 barrels a day in the U.S., but remember, our plan is that this will be a branded job for us and we'll still supply from the refining group to the retail group. I thought it was obvious, but the guys here are saying it's not. So we'll still sell from refining to a freestanding retail business.", "Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Joe, is Valero participating in West Coast product exports as well?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "No, we're not. Jeff, I mean, the barrels that we move -- no, we're not.", "Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Okay. If I could slide in another question, I was curious about the Port Arthur and St. Charles startups, and is there an impact on existing operator -- operations at Port Arthur and St. Charles or what's exactly involved in this 8-week start-up process? Could you help me with that?", "Lane Riggs", "Jeff, this is Lane. So once our project group hands it over, it's a 6- to 8-week project that just sort of started up. It really doesn't -- the size is just stacking up and have all the technical people we need to oversee the startup. It doesn't really affect the rest of our operations. But sort of a breakdown of the 6- to 8-weeks, the first part of it a leak check and do some other things just to sort of get the unit ready, and that could be 2 to 4 weeks. Then we got to load the catalyst. There's 2 million pounds of catalyst we got to load in this thing. After that -- and then after that we have to prepare and condition the catalyst, which can take about 2 weeks, so that's really all the things that we have to do to get ready to put oil in.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Cory Garcia from Raymond James.", "Cory J. Garcia - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "I just have, I guess, a quick question with regard to Meraux. Obviously, recognizing that the current focus is going to be bringing that online, back online safely, following the incident, but just want to maybe get a little better understanding on the potential integration between that plant and St. Charles. I know that was sort of a talking point when you guys purchased the refinery. Aside from any sort of feedstock and product optimization between the 2, are there any other sort of hardware or larger integration efforts that you guys are currently working on?", "William R. Klesse", "Yes, there is. At Meraux, what we intend to do is install another reactor and we will convert some of the process units so that we can make more distillate. So if you look at Valero's system, today, we make 33%, 34% distillate. Obviously, the margins are in distillate. Distillate is growing in the world much more rapidly than gasoline. And with our 2 big hydrocrackers that get finished this year, we'll be up to 39%, 40% distillate yield. Actually, one of the highest in the industry in the U.S. And then we have this project we're working on, Meraux, which will take us another 1.5 years to 2 years to complete. Installing this reactor, that will allow us there to make a much higher distillate yield. And so you will see that refinery produce distillates as opposed to gasoline in the long run. And then we'll integrate the gas oils between the 2 facilities. We have an [indiscernible] plant there that we might have some integration opportunities with all the butanes we're seeing coming into the market. So there's a lot of opportunity on the U.S. Gulf Coast for all of our plants to work together and we optimize it as a system as best we can.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Dahlman Rose.", "Sam Margolin - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "I just had a -- could you give us a quick update on Eagle Ford volumes and to Three Rivers and maybe even elsewhere now that some infrastructure gets built out down there?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Sure. In the second quarter, we ran just over 140,000 barrels a day of Eagle Ford crude. Of course the bulk of that was at Three rivers, and then down at Corpus Christi. One of the interesting things is, is that we're running a lot more Bakken now. We're running about 130,000 barrels a day at Bakken, and a lot of that is going out into the Memphis refinery.", "Sam Margolin - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. Yes, I did notice that Midwest margins were higher year-over-year. I assumed there was something going on in Memphis with the crude slate, so that's helpful. Secondly, this is a bit of a longer question, but there's been some acceleration of discussion of RFS mandates in the media. Assuming that the government is going to be pretty slow on this or resistant, is it your understanding maybe from intelligence that you have on the ethanol distribution side that the industry is in possession of a surplus of credits and the gasoline market can effectively tighten as blending reduces, even without changes in the mandates in the near term here?", "William R. Klesse", "Okay, I'm not sure we're going to know that, RINs are at $0.04, so that doesn't necessarily imply that there's an excess of RINs. I'm going to say -- but I know this is an issue for everybody on the call. Yes, we're in the ethanol business, but there's 8000 barrels a day of ethanol going into the gasoline pool. So by the mandate, you took market share from refiners and gave it to farmers. Now -- but to eliminate that is extremely difficult, and we've had almost $8 corn, I think, a couple of years ago. But remember, ethanol has high octane. Under the EPA rules, we get a 1-pound waiver. So we have tankage, system limitations, CARBOBs, RBOB, CBOB, this is a far more complicated conversation than having the hog farmers in Washington asking for a release.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Evan Calio.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I apologize if I missed it. I jumped in a little late. Any timing estimate on the retail spinoff and how you think about appropriate leverage on that asset coming out? And then I have an additional question.", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Yes. We are still evaluating the leverage and how much leverage to place on that. I mean it'll be comparable to the other C store companies in that segment. As far as timing, around 6 months, we could probably do the spinoff. We've got a lot of work to do yet with our SEC filing and we need a private letter ruling, so let's just say around 6 months.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "That's great. And then another question. I know you've had an additional quarter to kind -- to think about it and even witness a temporary widening on Brent LLS spread and any new thoughts as your engineers have spent maybe another quarter analyzing an ability to either run or make any investment to shift your slate a little bit to the lighter side?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, we're -- so on the U.S. Gulf Coast, where we tend to be a heavier refiner, now Three Rivers is relatively light, Houston is light, Memphis runs are basically Gulf Coast light barrels. So really, for us Texas City, Port Arthur, St. Charles, and even Meraux, we are looking at obviously being able or having the capability to run a higher percentage of lighter oils. And our people are working on these, and -- but the issue in our business is if it's deemed that we need a permit, permitting is very long now. And if it has to have a CO2 permit, it's even longer. So -- but we are working on all this, I'm sure just like every one of our competitors.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I think you covered a lot of the questions I had, particularly on ethanol. I was going to ask, but obviously you slightly covered that. I'm still not quite clear how you see the market playing out here if we don't have enough RINs. And then the shortage of ethanol, could we -- can you simplify the answer on that one?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, right now, there is not a shortage of ethanol. But plants are cutting back. We, as Mike said, have shut down 2 plants, we've cut back the others. We're probably running at 50%. If you look at the numbers, it was about 19 million barrels of ethanol. It's dropping rapidly. So you want to know how I think it plays out? So this is how I think it plays out: I think ethanol price is going to go higher here relative to gasoline. And because obviously, today, we're losing money in ethanol.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Sure, but then you have to meet the mandate. I guess the question is are you going to meet the mandate? Well, not you, but I mean, the industry.", "William R. Klesse", "That is a valid question. About 93% or so of all the gasoline sold in the country has ethanol in it and we're going to hit the blind wall here, gasoline volume is down, RINs are at $0.04. I don't know if I can answer you.", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Yes, well, and Paul, there's one thing that you can take into consideration. We carry forward 20% of the RINs from last year to this year, so I don't think that we're looking at an issue this year. But in the out years, as the obligations continue to go up, it is going to be a challenge and RINs are going to be more expensive.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, that's helpful. The -- on -- forgive me if you've kind of feel like you've covered this. But on M&A, particularly I'm thinking about BP saying Texas City and Carson [indiscernible] available for sale and people are interested, do you have anything to add on that?", "William R. Klesse", "I really don't. I've said in the past that we have looked at it and we have a confidentiality agreement, but the thing is still on the market.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Bill, I want to go back to this topic on the global distillate export market. I know there's been outright refinery shutdowns in the Atlantic Basin on the less competitive plants. But it looks like -- on our analysis, it looks like there's potentially 8 new hydrocrackers, including your 2, set to come online in the Atlantic Basin over the next 12 months. Can you comment on -- and by the way, that's about 400,000 barrels a day of capacity from what we see, can you comment on what you see the potential impact on supply/demand balance on the distillate market in the Basin going forward here?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, I think there are hydrocrackers coming on, as you say, so there's no disagreement there. Some of those are in the Med. I think the Med is different than Northwest Europe, so I do think that there's a difference. I look long-term, and I see a lot of pressure in the Mediterranean for making money in Refining. But in the Atlantic Basin, we still have growth, Mexico, Colombia, Brazil. You saw, I know you know, Chi, that the sugarcane harvest is bad in Brazil, so they are going to wind up importing more gasoline. And I know you asked about distillate, but we believe that we will still competitively be able to go into these markets. Whether Mexico builds the Tula refinery, I think, is a very open question, especially with a new government. The numbers they're talking now about 10 billion or 12 billion for this refinery. You've also seen -- and we're not participating today but we have in the past, actually shift some ULSD to Australia, and you've seen where the Australians are shutting down quite a few refineries. So I think it all comes down to the arms, [ph] as Joe mentioned earlier and the economics in the U.S.-produced stuff is going to be in -- on a cost basis, very, very competitive. Whether we can squeeze it into the market, we think we'll be able to. But you're clearly right that there are hydrocrackers being built. Everybody sees this distillate growth. We just happened to be in a good spot here. I wish I had the hydrocrackers today, right?", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "That's right. Can you expand a little bit on the difference between the Northwest Europe market and  Med, what is the critical difference there between the 2?", "William R. Klesse", "Because I think some of this -- longer term, you're going to see supply come from the Middle East into the Med. And demand, obviously, if you -- I know you look at all this stuff, look at the Italian demand and some of the Greek demand numbers are -- so I mean they're just very, very long refining. So you have a very long refining situation on top of some competition coming from the Middle East.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Yes, it just seems a bit concerning with Europe, the situation there with demand, China slowing down. And does it really get down to Latin America, South America just staying strong for this export market to kind of keep going here?", "William R. Klesse", "In this -- so I would like to hope that Europe does eventually recover, but I can't argue that it might. So I would say it does come down. And when Joe spoke, our gasoline exports go to Latin America and about half of our distillate exports go to Latin America.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "And in Australia, are you sending out of the Gulf Coast?", "William R. Klesse", "That was a couple of years ago, and we did send some out of Gulf Coast.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "And one final question. It looks like, looking at your stats, that your Gulf Coast light sweet crude run has actually got up to 240,000 barrels a day this quarter. I think last quarter you said your -- the capacity was around 200,000 a day. Are you finding ways, obviously, to get more of that crude into your system?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "No, but we're finding ways. Our capacity, we actually had -- we said that's what we were running. The 200,000 was not our capacity last quarter. That's actually what we were running. But we're going to continue to close that gap. And this is based on economic availability and then economics. If the discount's large enough, then you can get enough of it. You'll -- it'll make sense versus some marginal medium sour, but these are the economics that we're working with and we'll just continue to increase that.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "So what is your capacity then in the Gulf Coast right now on the light sweets?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Yes, 0.5 million barrels a day.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Does that -- includes Memphis, though, right?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "That would include Memphis.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Harry Mateer from Barclays.", "Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Two questions. First, you answered a few questions on investment-grade ratings. I was just wondering if you could put a slightly finer point on it. And specifically whether your current ratings or what's important to you, mid-BBB or is it just investment grade so you guys might be willing to go down the low BBB as part of this retail separation? And then the second question, what's the priority for you in terms of considering the retail separation, is it maximizing the amount of cash you take out of the business or is that less of a focus given Valero's liquidity disposition?", "William R. Klesse", "Okay. So on the first question, we don't see any reason at all why there would be any concern about our rating, but we want to be investment-grade. I'm just going to leave it at that. And then -- and we'll work with the rating agencies if they have any issue. But I gave some other data points for how much we paid off here [ph], our coverage ratios and everything looked very, very good. And then on the -- on the second question, it was...", "Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Cash priorities.", "William R. Klesse", "Yes, the priorities are kind of -- in this spin sale, we want to do a tax-efficient spin. We are working on shareholder value, as you would expect us, so we want to maximize our shareholder value. And so it's a point of being tax-efficient and generating shareholder value.", "Operator", "Our next question is a follow-up from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I think I actually got cut off earlier, Bill, I apologize for -- I was talking to myself there for a couple of minutes. Nothing unusual there. So my couple of follows-ups were basically, can you walk us through the timing of the -- or how you would expect to take the cash tax benefit of the mechanical completion credit that you'll get for the 2 projects? And then I do have a follow-up before I get cut off again.", "William R. Klesse", "Okay. On the timing of those benefits, we're estimating the benefit of $650 million to $700 million. The timing would be spread out over the next 4 to 5 quarters, and a lot of that depends on, obviously, the profitability of the company over the next 1.5 years. So I'm just going to say, probably over the next 4 quarters, we'll receive all that benefit.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So starting in third of 2012?", "William R. Klesse", "That's correct.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. And my final one, then, is I wanted to go back to Robert's question about LLS discounts, potentially versus Brent. In terms of your optionality of being able to run medium and heavy and sour crude in the Gulf, how would you expect, if you, let's say, you did increase your LLS runs, or your light sweet crude runs, domestically more than perhaps your coker limitations would dictate, how would you expect the pricing of medium and heavy sour to move? And what I'm kind of getting at is that our thinking is if LLS moves, that probably benefits your medium and heavy feedstock as well. I'm just trying to get some color as to whether that's the right way to think about this or not.", "Joseph W. Gorder", "No, Doug, I do think that's the right way to look at it. Certainly, the medium sours will be tightly linked to the light sweet prices. Heavy sours, I think, are going to be competing with medium sours for space in the refinery. And so as we get more supply into the Gulf, I think what we're going to see is kind of a downward pressure on the entire complex. And Bill mentioned what the discounts needed to be on heavy sour crudes relative to light sweet crudes. You need at least 8%, so you're going to see those have to price in if they want to move into the system.", "William R. Klesse", "I would add that, so what happens then is LLS is discounting the Brent, then you're going to have these other crudes discounting and that this -- but it's on the world market, which is pricing against Brent, so the freight becomes the factor. And we know that some Venezuelan crude and Mexican crudes have been moving to China and other places and Venezuelan crudes moved to China, so you wind up with a freight being the flywheel in there, and of course, available tankers. But -- so there'll be a limit for how wide that spread goes then relative to freight. And that's why, I think, we see LLS at a couple of bucks, which is really the freight that tends to be the driver here.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So Bill, theoretically, that couple of bucks would translate -- and I'm not trying to be too simplistic here, but to your entire Gulf Coast fleet, is that the right way to think about it?", "William R. Klesse", "Yes, I think that is right, and that's why we say the U.S. refining industry, it's not necessarily Valero, is in a very competitive situation in the world. And that's why going back to several of the other questions, we believe that the U.S. refining industry can be competitive in the export markets when we face the domestic demand that is challenging. So it applies to Valero, but it's applying to our industry.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just 2 quick follow-up. One, Bill, when you're looking at your retail network in July month-to-date, what is your same-store gasoline sales? Secondly, that what is your total WTI link crude that you run in the second quarter?", "William R. Klesse", "Okay, so let's do the crude link first, Ashley, WTI link crude, how much we run in the second quarter?", "Ashley M. Smith", "In the second quarter, it's still right around 250.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "But I mean you also running Bakken, in Memphis, right, so it seems like you say you run about 140. So shouldn't that now be more like in the 350 to 400 then?", "William R. Klesse", "No, no, because the Bakken crudes that we run at Memphis actually comes from St. James.", "Ashley M. Smith", "It's priced like LLS.", "William R. Klesse", "It is out of discount, the LLS and the deals that Joe's people have done, but it -- we don't have the receipt facility so it tends to go to St. James and come back up Capline. That's the answer to that. Now Gary Arthur's here and your question was in July same-store volume?", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "That's correct.", "Gary Arthur", "We're down just a little bit under 3% same-store on gasoline.", "William R. Klesse", "That's in the U.S.", "Operator", "And we have no further questions in queue. At this time, I'll turn it back to you.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Okay. Thanks, Trish.

I will now turn the call over to Ashley Smith. You may begin.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Hey, thank you, Christine. And good morning, welcome to our earnings call. With me today are Bill Klesse, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Ciskowski, our CFO; Gene Edwards, our Chief Development Officer; Kim Bowers, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel and several other members of our senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, feel free to contact me after the call.", "Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we described in our filings with the SEC.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Thanks, Ashley, and thank you for joining us today. As noted in the release, we reported third quarter 2012 earnings of $674 million or $1.21 per share. This includes an after-tax noncash asset impairment loss of $341 million or $0.62 per share and after-tax severance expense of $41 million or $0.07 per share, primarily related to the Aruba Refinery as described in the earnings release financial tables under Notes D and E. Excluding these 2 items, third quarter earnings were $1.1 billion or $1.90 per share.", "Operating income was $1.3 billion versus operating income of $2 billion in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding the previously mentioned items, third quarter 2012 operating income was $1.7 billion.", "The decrease in operating income was mainly due to lower refining margins in the U.S. Gulf Coast, West Coast and Mid-Continent regions. A decline in retail and ethanol margins also contributed to the decrease in operating income. These declines were somewhat offset by significantly higher refining margins in the North Atlantic region.", "Our third quarter refining throughput margin was $3.12 per barrel, which is a slight decrease versus third quarter 2011 of $13.24 per barrel. The decrease in refining throughput margin was mainly due to lower discounts on crude oils and feedstocks and lower margins for other products, such as petrochemical feedstocks and propane. However, we saw higher margins for gasoline and diesel in all of our regions, and diesel had the highest margins among our major products.", "Our third quarter 2012 refining throughput volume averaged 2.6 million barrels per day. That was up 8,000 barrels per day from the third quarter of 2011. The increase in throughput volumes was mainly due to the acquisitions of the Pembroke and Meraux refineries in 2011, which was nearly offset by the lack of throughput at Aruba, hurricane-related downtime and slowdowns at our St. Charles, Memphis and Meraux refineries and unplanned downtime at our Meraux refinery, as a result of the crude unit fire in July. The Meraux refinery restarted its crude unit in mid-October.", "Excluding the Aruba severance expense, refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter of 2012 were $3.72 per barrel, which was higher than the second quarter of 2012 mainly due to higher energy costs and increased maintenance expense. Operating expense though was lower than guidance due to lower than anticipated cost for catalysts than energy.", "Our retail business reported quarterly operating income of $41 million, which includes a $12 million noncash asset impairment loss, as described in Note E to the financial tables. Retail operating income was $17 million in the U.S. and $24 million in Canada. The rising crude price environment squeezed retail fuel margins in both regions. Fuel volumes declined slightly compared to third quarter 2011 as weak gasoline demand impacted sales.", "Our plan to separate our retail business and unlock value for our shareholders is moving forward. In October, we submitted our request to the IRS for a private letter ruling on a tax-efficient distribution of our retail business to our shareholders. Later this quarter, we expect to file a registration statement with the SEC. Given the timing of these events, we expect to complete the retail separation late in the first quarter or early second quarter of 2013.", "Our Ethanol segment reported a $73 million operating loss in the quarter, which was down $180 million from the third quarter of 2011, mainly due to much lower gross margins as high corn prices and excess ethanol inventories squeezed the margins to very low levels. As a result of the low margins, we reduced our ethanol production to average 2.4 million gallons per day in the third quarter of 2012, a decline of nearly 900,000 gallons per day compared to the third quarter of 2011.", "The end of third quarter, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $174 million, which was in line with our guidance. Depreciation and amortization expense was $402 million, and net interest expense was $70 million. The effective tax rate in the third quarter was 46%, but excluding the asset impairment losses and the Aruba severance expense, the tax rate was 35%.", "Regarding cash flows in the third quarter, capital spending was $784 million, which includes a $75 million of turnaround and catalyst expenditures. We reduced our capital spending guidance for the full year 2012 to approximately 3. -- $3.5 billion versus prior year -- or prior guidance of around $3.6 billion. We expect 2013 capital spending to be $2.5 billion, and that includes approximately $200 million for our retail segment. Also in the third quarter, we paid $97 million in cash dividends to our shareholders.", "With respect to our balance sheet at the end of September, total debt was $7 billion, cash was $2.5 billion and our debt-to-cap ratio net of cash was 20.6%. At the end of the third quarter, we also had nearly $5.7 billion of additional liquidity available.", "Our key growth projects continue to move closer to startup. This week, we expect to begin commissioning activities at our Port Arthur hydrocracker project, and this unit should be operational in December. The St. Charles hydrocracker project remains on schedule to be fully operational in the second quarter of 2013.", "On the macro side, we believe that Valero and other U.S. Gulf Coast refiners have several competitive advantages versus other Atlantic Basin refiners, including low-cost natural gas, increasing access to discounted domestic crude oil and larger, more complex and reliable refineries. These competitive advantages have enabled us to profitably take market share from less competitive Atlantic Basin refiners. This is exemplified by the high utilization rates in PADD 3 refiners and continued solid export demand for U.S. Gulf Coast products.", "Now, I'll turn it over to Ashley to cover the earnings model assumptions.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Okay. Thanks, Mike. For modeling our fourth quarter operations, you should expect the refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: the Gulf Coast at 1.45 million to 1.5 million barrels per day, Mid-Continent at 440,000 to 450,000 barrels per day, West Coast at 275,000 to 285,000 barrels per day and North Atlantic at 320,000 to 330,000 barrels per day, which is lower than third quarter due to a plant-wide turnaround at the Pembroke refinery during most of October. Refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter are expected to be around $3.85 per barrel.", "Regarding our ethanol operations in the fourth quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 2.5 million gallons per day, and operating expenses should average approximately $0.40 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs, such as depreciation and amortization.", "Also, we expect G&A expense, excluding depreciation to be around $190 million, and net interest expense should be around $70 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense in the fourth quarter should be around $405 million, and our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter should be approximately 36%.", "Okay, Christine. That concludes our opening remarks. We'll now open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley.", "Manav Gupta - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "This is Manav for Evan today. I had just a couple of quick questions. One was on the West Coast refining margins. They were -- they came in slightly below the indicated margins. Just trying to understand what happened there.", "Ashley M. Smith", "We really didn't have margin guidance, so not sure what to reconcile for you. Maybe we should -- we can talk about it offline with a little more clarity on what you want us to reconcile to.", "Manav Gupta - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I'm just trying to understand, because sequentially they were slightly lower, but the gasoline prices were higher in that region. So I'm trying to understand what happened there.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Yes.", "William R. Klesse", "As one would be that the branded prices as well as unbranded -- and you would be looking at the spot market prices. So as some of the markets were moving and a lot of that occurred in October, but it did occur some in September, that our average for gasoline products would be less than the spot market, than what we actually saw.", "Ashley M. Smith", "That's a contributing factor. Also some of our feedstock costs, we run a lot of EGO [ph] out there, even ANS. Some of those prices relative to benchmarks may not have kept up, so margins were impacted there, but there's no one key driver.", "Manav Gupta - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And just...", "William R. Klesse", "This is really by guess that it was somewhat on the 70-30 split. So that would raise our gas oil cost, as gasoline point of sale.", "Manav Gupta - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And one more quick question. In the first quarter of next year, you have pipelines connecting the Permian Basin down to the Gulf Coast, whether it's Permian Express or reversal of Longhorn, so how would your refineries benefit from that?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Well, these are WTI -- this is Gene Edwards. These are WTI-type crudes, sweet crudes and those pipelines come into the Houston area, so we can run those crudes in our Houston refinery along with the Guilford crude or any other crudes that -- such as [ph] sweet crudes in that area. We can also run some of that in our Texas City refinery as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert of Simmons.", "Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "You guys provided some capital spending guidance for 2012 a little bit lower, 2013 maybe a little bit higher than previously discussed. Could you talk about opportunities for growth CapEx and maybe the major buckets that you see opportunity, infrastructure, flexibility to use more light crudes and anything else that you might see on the growth CapEx front?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, Ashley is looking for some numbers, Jeff. But the guidance that we've given you for '13 has always been $2 billion to $2.5 billion. And so as far as I'm concerned, we're still within our guidance. We've also pointed out that retail spending in that number is about $188 million, I think we rounded to $200 million. So as far as I'm concerned, we're still within our guidance. Now some -- clearly and I've said this, our St. Charles project is what we'd lost about 2 to 3 months from our original schedule. So based on what I gave maybe on the last call, we're on time with that. But from the original schedule, we're behind. So we have some carryover into '13 from that project, and that's largely -- there's $100 million reduction for this year sliding into next year. But basically, I consider us still within our range. And Ashley has some numbers for you.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Yes Jeff, so next year it looks like we'll spend between $950 million and $1 billion on strategic projects. It's distributed across several areas, several segments, but mostly it's in refining. In those strategic buckets, there's some crude expansions and a bit, some flexibility projects. As Bill mentioned, McKee and Port Arthur, Houston, just small spending across several of those, looking at projects that might allow us to get some more throughput through those hydrocrackers, the new ones at St. Charles and Port Arthur, plus Meraux. And there's other various logistics and biodiesel and retail and pipelines of terminals, things like that.", "Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Secondly, in shifting Aruba towards a terminal, what do you see profitability looking like as a terminal in 2013? And how does that compare to the cost in Aruba in 2012? How do we think about year-on-year change?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, we lost, over the last several quarters, somewhere in the $8 million to $10 million a month in Aruba. And this year we lost over the last year or 2, in the order of, on average around $100 million, $120 million. One year was higher than the other. So we don't usually give that kind of info out, but we've had a loss in Aruba. And we believe that a terminal operation will be a good project for us there. We're still fixing some tanks, fixing the dock, things that we're doing and have been doing. But we expect the business, it'll test out for us in '13. With all the volatility we see in the markets, the forward curve, once it gets into contango in certain products, there's just a lot opportunity to start. And Aruba has very deep water. You can pull a d [ph] right into the docks, so we think it's a good project.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Robert Kessler of TPH.", "Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "I had 2 questions for you. One is with the near elimination of light crude imports in the Gulf Coast, it begs a question in my mind. And that is ultimately, do you see the capability of loading some Gulf Coast-located light crude on a ship and moving it up to Quebec City and ultimately processing it there? I know it probably wouldn't work at today's spreads, but what sort of logistics might be involved? And what spread, let's say, between LLS and Brent or whatever benchmark you think is appropriate, might you need to make that happen? And then the other question is just if you would, remind me what your thoughts are on buybacks and when you might see a material program there?", "William R. Klesse", "On the first question on Quebec, some crude has already moved from the Gulf Coast to Canada, some out of Corpus Christi as well. That's actually where some of the economics work better. Freight cost average is maybe $2 a barrel or a little less, so it's all economic-driven compared as long as you have your license to export into Canada and some has already moved. And this is something that Valero will do, too, as other companies are looking at. We can run in Quebec somewhere in the 85% to 90% of our charge. There could all be basic -- basically light, sweet crude. And today, that's the -- even though it's a Canadian refinery, it runs imported oil, Algerian, CPC, North Sea, West Africa, it runs all those kind of crudes today. So for us, as we look at it, as the crude continues to cover the Gulf Coast, and we're quite convinced that the original premise we had a year or so ago is actually going to happen, there's going to be lots of light, sweet crude on the U.S. Gulf Coast, it's going to be looking for a home.", "Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "I think some people forget that refinery way up there might have seen the benefit from this, and thanks for that information. Can you tell me, do you  guys have any kind of market analysis on what you think the Eastern Coast of Canada, the refineries on the Eastern side of Canada could ultimately take as far as Gulf Coast based light crude?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, there's 4 refineries up there, and some run some medium sours as well, Irvin [ph], but really you need to kind of look that up. We would have an opinion, but we know better what we can do. And just to be totally -- so that you understand the whole situation. We expect to take wider crude oil, Syncrude and other crudes from the West as well, moving it into Montr\u00e9al and then getting it up to the Quebec refineries. So the feedstock slate for our Quebec refinery is going to change.", "Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Understood. And then buybacks?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, I've said all along that we think our stock, and actually, it's the whole refining industry but us in particular, we're undervalued when you sell it at 4x EBITDA. We have these projects coming on that I think separate us from the pack, so that when you -- our 2 hydrocrackers by the second quarter of next year will be major contributors. They are absolutely the right project for the right time. And so we think our stock is undervalued. But if I go to a ranking of -- and this is, I believe, absolutely consistent with what we said in the past, it's always safety and reliability first. We're improving our reliability around the system, and we continue to spend money to do that. Investment-grade rating is absolutely key. We have adequate cash to fund this business. As Mike said in his notes, we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of cash. We have lots of liquidity, as he also said. We're going to fund our projects through completion here. The Diamond Green Diesel project spills over, and frankly, we will expand both our hydrocrackers pretty much right out of the chute here as we get our permits. We continue to look for excellent investment opportunities. To be honest, some of our shareholders want to see the cash, and some of our shareholders want us to invest in good projects. So we continue to look for that. But we match that up against the comment I started with that our shares are undervalued. So that when we get to returning our cash to the shareholder, we've raised our dividends several times. And I have said that we want to have a yield that's among the highest in our peer group. And we have purchased our stock, we didn't purchase any stock in the third quarter as we've got our retail separation underway here, and we were building some liquidity. But we bought -- last year, we bought 17 million shares and this year, we've already bought 6 million shares. So we've actually demonstrated that as well. And so I think that's pretty well, I think we've been very consistent as to what we were doing.", "Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Just a quick follow-up. Anything that precludes you from buying back stock between now and the time of the retail spin?", "William R. Klesse", "No, there is nothing that does.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I've got 2 or 3 quick ones, hopefully. We haven't really seen weight -- weight-heavy differentials in quite a while. We seem to be seeing them right now. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the market that caused that? And on the same token, if you look at your runs, it looks like you upped your heavy runs this quarter and also your light runs. So a little bit, maybe some color around how those 2 things are interacting. And I've got a couple of quick follow-ups, please.", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Doug, this is Gene again. I think what's driving light heavy [indiscernible] has gotten a little bit weaker compared to where we had been. So with this running about $16 discount to Brent, so you've seen all the crudes follow that, including the Maya and the heavy sours. Probably more importantly, the medium sours. Those have been running in the $7 to $8 range discount to Brent over the last month or so, which is good. And WTF [ph] is also cheaper. So you throw all those in there, it's just given us better discounts on medium and heavy sour crudes.", "Kristin Button - Moody's Corporation, Research Division", "So are you meaning for a change in your slate, Gene, to adjust to that?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Well, we're always optimized, and we run economics every day cargo by cargo, whether we -- sweets or TTT [ph]. LLS is trading about even to Brent. And remember that Brent is before transportation, so LLS is a big discount to Borden [ph] sweets. So we're always optimizing our slate every day because we have a lot flexibility in the system. And so we're just -- like I said, we're taking advantage of all.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great stuff. So my follow-ups are really 2 strategic questions. Let me group them together and see how best you can, and I just want you to be able to answer them. The first one is, I think though in the past, you've talked backwards and forwards about whether California was actually a core region for you going forward given the regulatory spending. There was a little bit of charter in the market a few weeks back that maybe there was some movement in that regard. I wonder if you could comment on that. And on the same vein, Mike and I had the opportunity to talk a little bit about what was going on in the summertime over the MLPs that were being listed in the form of refining, mainly northern tier. Now we've seen that thing wash out with a fairly substantial multiple uplift for refinery, which I think was a little different than it was though in the summer. So I'm wondering how that might have changed your view around, for example, Ardmore, McKee, some of the high cash-flowing assets and whether that's something you might want to consider down the road? And I'll leave it at those 2, please.", "William R. Klesse", "Well, Doug, on California, I have said that we continue to look at our options. We work for the shareholder, and we think that the regulatory environment in California is not constructive to the California economy. It's not constructive to the working person, and it's not constructive to our industry. Whether it's AB32 or whatever regulations we're faced with, but in AB32 particularly, the academics and the extremeness have hijacked the process. And they've made -- they're coming up with regulations that are totally not workable. So we look at our options, and we continue to look at our options. But on the other hand, we do not comment on rumors. On MLPs, our organization is really working on the retail separation. We would still consolidate. See, there is some financial theory here in that we borrow -- borrowing costs are very low. We're not in need of any cash, and so there is a discussion about this from the company that says any funds at the lowest cost. However, in acquisitions, it's clear that the MLP is an excellent acquisitions vehicle, the market clearly likes that approach. And we have some pipelines and turmoils that we can contribute to an MLP. So our strategy is to finish our retail separation, and then as I think Mike probably told you and we've said in the past, that we're going to look for MLP. The third part of your question is on the refining. And clearly, NTI has traded better here, because initially, it did not trade that well. But it is these type of assets, as you know, and as the others on the call know, their high cash flow is, in fact, tied to the WTI, LLS or Brent spread. I mean refining is all about location today. And if you're in the right location, your cash flows are huge. But there is a forward curve or a forward expectation. And so you get into a conversation of what you could actually realize doing that today. We think that would not necessarily result in an advantage to our shareholders.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Could I push you a little bit on the pipeline and terminals, because obviously, new start, kind of, I guess, as all the legacy stuff, what is the appetite and what is the potential scale in terms of current EBITDA that you would associate with those pipelines and terminals because I was under the impression you did not have a whole heck of a lot left.", "William R. Klesse", "Well, we can -- we would have somewhere between $50 million and $100 million of EBITDA just dealing straight, like just taking terminals and pipelines. And remember, we are partners with Kinder Morgan on the Parkway pipeline. We have our big pipeline project in Canada, which is just about finished here, and again, ready to start up. So we have assets in our system. But also, we have package and other things that are being dropped in MLPs as well. So we would have -- it would be a small MLP, but it wouldn't be any smaller, I guess, than a couple of the others out there. And we would have the opportunity to drop other assets as we go through the future. So we'll look at it. We've said we were going to look at it, but our focus today is really on the retail separation, because we do believe that adds significant shareholder value. And I might add, we don't think the stock -- our stock reflects that value.", "Operator", "The next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "A number of quick questions. Actually, can you remind me the retail spin of your ethanol facility is going to be included, or it's going to stay with the Valero?", "Ashley M. Smith", "Ethanol segment is going to stay with Valero. That's not part of their planned asset.", "William R. Klesse", "The retail spin in the United States -- the retail separation in the United States is the company-operated stores. It's 1,025. And it's the 775 stores, 250 of which we own, and the rest where we control the price or manage the price at the pump in Canada. That is the business that we are separating, including home heating and car block in Canada.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, perfect. Secondly, if I look at the number, next year CapEx is 2.5. And I think Ashley said that strategic, there's probably 90 [ph] to a billion, and 200 is for retail. So that means that the remaining sustaining capital is about 1.3 for the refining and the ethanol together. Is that a reasonable proxy as ongoing sustaining capital, or that next year's particularly high or particularly low?", "William R. Klesse", "I've given out in the past with our business, and I would say DD&A runs for us about 1.4 billion. It's going to change a little bit with the hydrocrackers, obviously. It will go up probably 100 million. So then we have retail come out. I think the sustaining capital is really in the 1 5, 1 6, and that's the number that I've given to people. 1 5, 1 6, 1 7 in all the past. Next year, we're finishing some projects, it might be a little lower next year. Turnarounds catalysts are $600 million a year for us. So I think this 1 5 to 1 7, the numbers we've given in the past, are the right numbers.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Bill, the 1 5 to 1 7, is that including retail or not including retail?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, sustaining capital, it would include retail in my conversation...", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So the retail sustaining is probably 150, 200 right?", "William R. Klesse", "It's very small for retail as sustaining capital. It's very small. So I think my range of this 1 5 to 1 7 is a good range for you guys to think of us as sustaining capital for the refining pipeline terminal business that we have.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Very good. Mike, on the North Atlantic, the sequential margin, up about $5 from the second quarter. If I look at the benchmark indicator, whether it's in Europe or in the Northeast market, does not go up by $5. So the question is that, is there any one-off benefit in the North Atlantic we should take into consideration? Or that you think is, really they're running well and is more like a normal run rate that we can base on going forward?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Okay. In the North Atlantic, I think the marketing operations performed fairly well during this period, which would have given it a little bit of margin above that.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. I see. Mike, on -- in the past, as you guys mentioned that you have unplanned downtime, both with [indiscernible] and on penalties in Meraux. You have any kind of cost estimate, opportunity cost estimate related to this downtime in the quarter?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, the lost revenue for Meraux, which some spilt into October, but was $53 million. And then it took us about $16 million for the repair.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "$16 million?", "William R. Klesse", "$16 million for the repair. Now, we did a lot of reliability work while the unit was down. But the lost opportunity was...", "Ashley M. Smith", "$53 million for the crude and then another $13 million just for the hurricane impact.", "William R. Klesse", "So between the 2, 66 between the 2 events just for Meraux.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just from Meraux. How about the Isla [ph] impact on the other facility?", "Ashley M. Smith", "It's -- St. Charles was shut down, and it was about a $34 million impact on gross margin.", "William R. Klesse", "From the hurricane.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Yes, from the hurricane.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And can you guys share with us some, maybe market data about the retail in your only retail network that the gasoline same-store sales in October, how's that looked? And also that -- how's the export so far in October comparing to the third quarter?", "William R. Klesse", "So on this retail store sales in the October, how did they look compared to September?", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "No, comparing to the year ago October on a same store year-over-year.", "S. Eugene Edwards", "We're running flat.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Running flat?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "To last year.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "How about export?", "William R. Klesse", "Okay. Now export back to the refining group, exports right now are back up from the third quarter level for diesel. And now in the third quarter, exports were down as the harbors closed for part of the time. On gasoline, they've been about -- they were running at 75,000 barrel a day range.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And for the hydrocracker, Bill, you had delay, as you say that on maybe 2 or 3 months, is that result in any change in your overall cost estimate, or it's pretty much still about the same?", "William R. Klesse", "No, it has changed our cost estimate. And again, these are numbers -- they're not changed, I think, from when I've seen -- saw you. But at our Port Arthur, we still expect to underrun that project. But at St. Charles, we are overrunning the project. And so on total, they're on budget, when you add them both together, very close to being on budget. But clearly, the delay at St. Charles is costing us additional money. Now, all I say to you is for Valero -- I know Exxon and these guys do big projects. For Valero, these are huge projects for us, and our people are managing these pretty darn gone well. But we're just a few months behind.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Two final questions. One, do have any committed to the Enbridge Line 9 reversal to ship barrel, so that you can take it from there, from Montr\u00e9al up into Quebec City?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, the answer is yes, we do, assuming they can get their permits to reverse the pipeline into Montr\u00e9al, and this was why I added that to the other question earlier. But we have a commitment to ship on that line along with Suncor.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Bill, can you share with us how big is that commitment?", "William R. Klesse", "Petro Canada.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Final one. On the hydrocracker, I guess that with the dividend growth, the next dividend increase or reconsideration by the board, do we need to wait until the hydrocracker, both of them come on stream or that even after Port Arthur will come on stream, you will feel more confident about your cash flow and would be able to relook at your regular dividend, given I think a lot of your loan accounts perhaps that may be more in kind [indiscernible] back of a dividend than the share buyback.", "William R. Klesse", "Right now on the dividend, management will have a recommendation either to hold it or stay the same but it is a board item. It will go through our forecast with our board. Our hydrocrackers, honest, they're not up and running yet but those are, as you properly stated, are significant. And so this will be a board discussion.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Is that discussion going to be, say, have to wait until after both of them come on stream or even after one of them come on stream that we'll have that discussion already?", "William R. Klesse", "Paul, I respect your question. I understand what you're asking, but I'm going to answer you that you're not going to be satisfied. And what I'm going to say is we as management will have a recommendation for our board, and we will discuss that it the board meeting. We want a dividend that we can sustain, and we also want a dividend that's going to yield, as I said, the highest among our peers. And we'll look at that as well as my other comment where we think our stock is undervalued. So I am just going to say to you that it's a board item and it will be discussed.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "I had 2 questions for you. One was on the Retail. If I understood correctly, you were previously evaluating either a spin or a sale. It sounds like if I'm reading correctly, you've eliminated the sale option and now just simply pursuing the spin, is that correct?", "William R. Klesse", "That is not correct. We are pursuing a separation, but our board has only authorized us to do the analysis around this. I know we used the words that things are moving forward, but we do not even have board approval for a separation. We have board approval to look at this, and we all realize that there's a shareholder value accretion that we've spoken about. But we are going through here to make sure that we maximize shareholder value and at the same time, treat the business and our people correctly as well.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Got it. Okay. And then the second was on M&A. I guess it's kind of a twofold question. One, obviously, Murphy seems to be a little bit more aggressive in exiting the R&M business, and it's always been, I guess, envisioned that Valero is a natural buyer of Milford Haven. Just curious if you have any thoughts there. And then secondly, just from a broader M&A standpoint, now that Texas City is off the market and Alliance [ph] has been removed, it seems like most of the major assets have been kind of plucked off at this point. I'm just curious, Valero, you've been historically fairly active on the acquisition front, is it fair to think that we kind of move away from that and more just to a free cash flow generator?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, there's a lot of issues there, Blake. As far as specific assets, whether it's Murphy, Milford Haven or other things that are in the market, we tend to look at these acquisitions, are they going to integrate with our system? That's why we like the Meraux, as it integrated with St. Charles and frankly, our other the Gulf Coast plants. We're of the mind in the U.S. that demand is not going to grow certainly for gasoline. Maybe there's some bounce if people get back to work but long term, gasoline is not growing. Diesel will have some growth, but it still hasn't recovered from the great recession, and it will be years before it does. So whatever we tend to look at, we're looking at in a way the Atlantic Basin and being able to be a stronger competitor in the export business. So all the things that we look at, we want to be able to say at the end of the day that we've been able to integrate this and actually are lowering the cost from the womb to the tomb. So we continue to look, and at least our experience here would be that other assets will come to the market because the refining industry is going to continue to consolidate the United States and Western Europe. There's just no doubt in my mind about that. So we'll continue to look. So I would not say that we're not an active player, but we are after things that make us more competitive as we have to deal in the export market.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just to, I guess, follow up a little bit on the export and maybe talk a little bit about global capacity you see on the horizon in '13. If I understood correctly 75,000 barrels a day of gasoline in Q3, I didn't catch the distillate number, but what do you see is the capability to grow that in '13? And then, what are you going to be pushing against in terms of identified global growth that you may be pushing back, could impact margins, et cetera?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, our exports in the third quarter were about 118,000 on diesel just so you have -- 118,000 barrels a day. That was actually down from where we've been averaging, which is somewhere just on average 175,000 barrels a day. Now, and our industry then has been exporting 1 million barrels a day of diesel. And somewhere in the 400,000 to 500,000 barrels -- 300,000 to 500,000 barrels a day of gasoline. So Valero is somewhere in the range of 20% or so of the export business in that range. Now there is capacity that comes into the market. Refining capacity is being built. Also the world demand is going up. We still expect for next year because you were talking about '13, that the world will increase, we think maybe 1 to 1.2 million barrels a day of consumption, so it can absorb some of this additional capacity. The U.S. is the most economic place here, low natural gas costs, some discounts or at least parity with world prices for sweet crude, and then we also have very fine operating people. So we think we can compete in the business and the business grows. It doesn't change my statement though that I've made in the past, and that is Western Europe is long refining for sure. And without exports, the United States is long refining for sure. So things will continue to rationalize in those markets going forward, but we think we can compete, one as a company and two as an industry. And the markets continue to grow. The third thing I would add to that conversation is all the Brazilian refineries that you read so much about, they're late and they're costing them a lot more. One is getting done here but the others are -- they're going to spend a huge amount of money if they actually proceed with them. The Venezuelan refineries are in disarray. And certainly, the debate continues as to what Mexico does, and the facts are the Mexican economies grow and the Brazilian economies are growing. So for companies like us located on the Gulf Coast, we think we can get into these markets and be doggone competitive. And Europe continues to be systemically short diesel on an annual basis.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So as a follow-up to that, where do you think your export volumes can go next year? I mean obviously you have the hydrocrackers coming online, which are going to grow volumes for you. Nobody I think believes the U.S. is going to be in a robust growth mode next year. So I mean, the exports are very much the outlet. Where are you in terms of actual keyside capacity and ability to roll this out?", "William R. Klesse", "That's a general -- and that's very fair question. It's a general statement because Motivo [ph] will eventually be back as well. And so Europe will basically take somewhere around half of our diesel exports, and the rest of the diesel exports are going to the Caribbean and other places. On gasoline, primarily Mexico, Colombia, Brazil and you may see a cargo or 2 go over to West Africa. Our Quebec refinery, just as a little side note, has been able to export diesel into New York Harbor. So -- but clearly, it's the same places as they continue to grow. Reaching out further, they would all be ad hoc. But remember, the Gulf Coast market is extremely liquid market.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Absolutely. Okay. And then my last question for you, on ethanol, obviously, a really tough quarter. Looking at the volumes you ran in the third quarter and what you're indicating as reasonable volumes for the fourth quarter, what changes, if anything, versus the fairly significant loss we saw in the third quarter as we look at the fourth? I mean, if volumes are going to be slightly higher, is that an indication that there's a little bit better margin story here than what we've been seeing?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "This is Gene again. We've got good margins in probably 5 of our plants. We have 2 plants that are basically down. We're keeping the enzymes active, so we'll start up a couple of days a month on those, but there's 2 of them down and there's 3 plants that are cut back. So we're running 2.4, 2.5 million gallons a day of capacity of about 3.6. So we're running probably about right at 2/3 utilization. So we see margins improve. We had a big loss in third quarter. We're about breakeven on an EBITDA basis now with the plants on a consolidated basis, but it's still not nearly as good as it was last year in the fourth quarter. And inventories are still basically at 17.3 million barrels, which are up about 1.5 million barrels from last year. So until we work that off, I don't see that we're going to get a big pop in margins. But we did draw about 204,000 barrels a day last week. So if we keep drawing at that pace, in a month or 2, we can claim some of this off, so it just depends on the demand. Imports have been the big factor. You don't have a lot of imports from Brazil recently. They've announced they're going to go from 20% of their gasoline pool to 25%. I think we'll see some of those imports slow down a little bit and then plus they're at the end of their harvest season for sugar. So I think that should diminish. So I think the market will continue to clean itself up. It's just taking longer than it normally has.", "William R. Klesse", "And for us, corn prices have stabilized where they were moving around so much. They've kind of stabilized here at the $7.40 a bushel area.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And just a little follow-up on that. How quickly can you react within your ethanol plants to those market conditions changing? Are you as agile as in refining is literally a daily basis change or, any help along those lines on your flexibility?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Yes, it's pretty quick. If the margin were to improve next week, we can source more corn. The plants that are running obviously just seems to start increasing right away. And then the other 2 plants that have been down, we have been doing these monthly refreshes to keep the enzymes active, so you can get them started up on a short notice. We'll probably decide, going into the winter though you notice when you get colder weather there, do we -- if the plant is down, that's a big problem with a lot of water in the system, so we'll probably have to make a decision in the next month or so where we're going to try to start up here in the winter or just leave those 2 plants down throughout the rest of the winter. We'll be watching the market closely on that.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Rakesh Advani of Credit Suisse.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "It's Ed Westlake actually. So you mentioned an interesting number, which is $2 to get crude from, I guess, the Gulf up to your Canadian facilities. That seems low for a Jones Act ship. Is there something funny going on? And maybe talk to how much crude you could move with the existing shipping that's available on that route. And then I have a follow-on question.", "William R. Klesse", "Well, Ed, I'm surprised with you on the Jones Act ship. Canada is not the United States. It's still part of the British Commonwealth though.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Right. Yes, indeed. And my wife is Canadian, so I should know that. So effectively you use just regular shipping, and that's why it's so cheap. Do you -- would you have a number if you had to ship crude up to -- do you think if the industry had to ship crude up to the East Coast?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, sure it would be -- it's 3x. So it's very, very... Go ahead, Gene.", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Well, Phillips has announced something. It was in the press that they're shipping their barrels up to their neighbor refinery and I think they got a deal of $4.50 a barrel or so.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Right. That's helpful. And then the follow-on question is around sort of the advantage position you have even in the Gulf, I think around 900,000 barrels a day capacity in Texas. Obviously, with the Eagle Ford and the Permian growing quickly, those refineries are kind of in the line of fire of that crude growth whereas it probably cost a little bit more and then maybe some bottlenecks to get crude over to the Louisiana refineries. Do you have any sort of numbers for us that could help in terms of quantifying how much of a dollar a barrel advantage you have in West Texas?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, I would say to you, Ed, Gene and I will try to answer you. It's probably $1. Once you put it on the ship, you got to load it, you have all these costs to get on a ship. So if you assume sweet crude oil, say, from Corpus Christi to Meraux, I would say you'd have at least $1 dollar advantage at Corpus.", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Yes, I think it's $1 or $2. And furthermore, Houston and Corpus are probably going to be a similar parity. And what's going to clear the Houston to St. James market is going to be the SOHO line, which is going to be their quoted [indiscernible], $2 a barrel on that. So I think you got at least $1 a barrel to Houston, and probably 2 barrels -- $2 for Corpus Christi kind of the memo. And then as you get up to McKee, obviously the numbers get even more discounted because of the -- you've got to clear the seaway pipeline tariff, or the long-haul reversal or these type of tariffs too, and is an advantage for McKee and our board.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Yes, so generally, you'd say that West Texas is about $2 discount to LLS in Louisiana and then so maybe some additional advantages for being initial off takers for some of the crude providers from the Permian and Eagle Ford?", "William R. Klesse", "Now we want to be clear on this. Once you get  it to the water, Gene was speaking, if you have crude in West Texas, you have that tariff to get it to Houston or Cushing and then Cushing to Houston. So then that tariff on these pipelines being built. I thought we were answering your question as moving it on the Gulf Coast. You have it already in Eagle Ford and Corpus Christi or you have a crude in Houston. And those are the numbers Gene was giving you. If you're talking about Midland or Cushing, you have to incur that tariff as well.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Yes, I know. I was just talking about moving stuff along the Gulf, so it's been very helpful.", "S. Eugene Edwards", "A follow-up to that is we're talking to our crude traders about that, taking crude from Corpus to Louisiana by U.S. flag is about the $2 a barrel, is about the same as foreign flags into Canada at $2 barrel. Kind of amazing.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Doug Terreson of ISI.", "Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Bill, the delivered cost advantage for U.S. exporters is pretty clear, but just to clarify something you said a minute ago, did you say that your exports were a little weaker recently? And if I heard that correctly, were there regional markets that were taking less product and why or was it something else?", "William R. Klesse", "In the third quarter, our distillate exports were down from second and down from what we expect in the fourth. And that had to do with the arb, it had to do with inventories. There was just a lot of reasons.", "S. Eugene Edwards", "There's also the hurricane outage on the Gulf Coast.", "William R. Klesse", "And Gene is right, we had the hurricane on the Gulf Coast as well. So that -- and that's actually -- and what happened is the domestic markets were very strong so the arb wasn't open. And we run on economics.", "Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "High-quality problem. And then also, in California, you've been very consistent over the years with your views on the regulatory regime. And when you make your strategic assessment on your positions out there, is it the compliance cost for the new standards in '13 or '15 that represent the greatest concern or is it something more broad? And either way, is there an order of magnitude that you can give us as it relates to the cost structure that would be likely related to regulations in California?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, it's an excellent question. Actually, this AB32 -- so the cap and trade program that's starting now and the low carbon fuels that tend to restrict which types of crude you can run, these programs are all starting. So the basic issue on low profitability in the West Coast has actually been crude sourcing, so do people have an advantage crude source. And secondly, we still have over 10% unemployment now in California. California is 2/3 of the pack. So when you start to look at this, demand is down, and there's too much refining capacity. So you see this, Doug, and as the others on the call see, when there's an operating issue in California, the market quickly balances and margins improve. And then when everybody's back and running, we all tend to run down to cash cost. And that's what as you would imagine, that's what happens, but my concern and the concern of Valero, and our management team here is longer term, the policies that are going -- being discussed, the way they're talking about implementing them is bad, as I said earlier, for people, for business and certainly for our industry. So that's a longer term decision [ph]. The shorter term is really just basic supply and demand and a very sluggish economy in the West Coast.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Faisel Khan of Citigroup.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just a quick question on the Eastern, the Northeast market, you saw a pretty wide basis differential in the Northeast this last quarter. And I'm just trying to think around exactly how much product you guys are pushing into the Northeast? You talked about the arb kind of closing, but I wonder if you can elaborate a little bit more in terms of how much gasoline you were pushing into the Northeast to take advantage of that and wide basis differential that we saw?", "William R. Klesse", "I don't think we would have that number. Remember, we tend to sell in the Gulf Coast markets and into the Southeast. And then Canada services it's local market and it's been able, as I said a few minutes ago, to put some barrels into New York Harbor. But we're not per se pushing anything domestically into the East Coast. Now from Pembroke, we export to the U.S. East Coast. And I don't think I know that number.", "S. Eugene Edwards", "The only thing I'd add, we do sell to those people that ship on Colonial pipeline and maybe are taking our barrels to the East Coast, and then it's after we've already relinquished control.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. Understood. You're selling the barrels to the Gulf Coast and somebody else is moving those barrels farther north and take advantage of that differential to some degree?", "William R. Klesse", "They have pipelines based on pipelines, so I guess that's right. Now we would have gotten advantage of it for Pembroke.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Bill, on the hydrocrackers, when will be the first quarter for each hydrocracker of complete uptime, if you will? When do we now expect them to be running at full operations?", "William R. Klesse", "Okay, Port Arthur, the full quarter will be the first quarter of '13.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So that will be a full quarter?", "William R. Klesse", "Full quarter. We expect to be up in December. And at St. Charles, to answer your question, the first full quarter might be the third quarter. But we expect to be up in April, okay? But I'm answering your question, full quarter, it will be the third quarter of St. Charles.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Right. And then...", "William R. Klesse", "Now if things go a little better, we could have the second quarter, but as I've said and I don't know when you joined the call, these are very large projects for us, and we're getting them done and we're getting them done safely.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes. And you've been pretty clear with the guidance on what they'll make based on some fairly conservative assumptions. Could you just remind me what those would be if the guidance still remains the same? What your expectation for let's say the quarterly or annual earnings would be for each unit for each project? And then if you could also roll that forward if possible into what it would be making in the current environment, that would be great.", "William R. Klesse", "Actually, we may have some numbers. But we've been typically have been giving you guidance, we give you all the assumptions in our appendix of our presentations, but it's about $1 billion worth of EBITDA. And we gave you all the assumptions. And you can see it when we have a case, I think it was $1.2 billion. We had another one, and I don't know what it would be today, but it's $1 billion of EBITDA. And we think they're going to contribute over $1 dollar share to earnings. Remember, it's natural gas, the hydrogen to distillates primarily, and we have a good distillate cracker as well.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Obviously the main thing is just to get them running.", "William R. Klesse", "That we all agree, and we're going to do it in a very orderly manner.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Surely. Forgive me, do you increase your CapEx guidance for next year? I know it's sort of a Mickey Mouse question, but could you just confirm what's on the CapEx numbers? I don't have full access to information yet.", "William R. Klesse", "Paul, we did, in my opinion, as we got the question earlier, we did not increase our guidance. I've said all along $2 billion to $2.5 billion. What we're doing here is saying we're at $2.5 billion. In that $2.5 billion is $188 million that has to do with retail. Assuming that we proceed with the separation of Retail, and Mike we're saying if that all happens, it's a second quarter event, late first quarter, early second quarter, then that amount of the capital would come down pro rata here for spending.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, and then you've kicked off -- I was listening of course, so you've kicked around some numbers as for what we could assume -- I know it's early but for 2014, assuming that you're going to basically pursue a strategy now more oriented towards capital limitation and more towards cash return to shareholders.", "William R. Klesse", "Well, I would say that in 2013, we've given you the guidance, and it's been consistent with what we've been saying here for the last 6 months. We've said that we want to have a dividend yield that's among the highest with our peer group. But I'm not giving any guidance for 2014.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. Just an observation that Sandy I think is going to have a pretty significant demand impact. As you can imagine, there's no traffic lights right now on Manhattan, which obviously conjures up a nightmarish image but at the same time there's so few cars around that is actually more or less safe to drive, but I guess again you made some observations on your best guess of what the impact will be, right?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, I don't think we would know any more than you. You're very astute at this. Obviously, the refineries either shut down or reduce significantly. But the facts are demand is going to be way off as well. And so I don't think we can -- we would have any better insight at this point than you do. But obviously, demand is off as well as the refineries. I will say this, at least reading some of the commentary and this is good for people and everything, that some of the refineries did not incur any damage.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, I mean, what I would think is that because of the PADD 1 is essentially import-dependent from other places that the demand impact is more important than the supply impact, which doesn't seem that bad.", "William R. Klesse", "That's correct. And Paul reminds me, for all of you on the call here with this Hurricane Sandy, we thank you all for calling in, and we hope you didn't incur any damage or your loved ones or families. Hope everything is okay as you get your power back and everything else that goes with you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Chi Chow of Macquarie Capital.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Back on the Retail separation. Bill, in the event of a spinoff to shareholders, does Valero intend to retain any interest in that new Retail entity?", "William R. Klesse", "We are working all options as you would expect us to. If we did, it would be in the financing vein. But we are, today, looking at cases of complete separation, but we have financing options.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Okay. I guess there's some chatter from the credit agencies when you made the announcement on possible changes to the ratings for Valero. With the separation of Retail, are you concerned about that at all? Have you had further discussions with the agencies? Can you talk a little bit about that?", "William R. Klesse", "Sure. Yes, one of the agencies did have some concern. And as we get our case solidified here, we'll go in and visit with them and show them our numbers. And we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of cash, and so I think we're very strong financially. Our net debt to cap is 20%. But we're going to go in and we'll show them our numbers and we'll have the discussion that you would expect us to have.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Okay. In the event of any changes, does that change your position on buybacks going forward?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, I don't know the answer to the first question, but we think our stock is undervalued. But I've also consistently, and Mike has said this as well and Ashley, we believe with our size and the way we deal with our suppliers that having an investment-grade debt rating is extremely important to our business.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Right. Okay. And then on your comments on the growth CapEx, you mentioned you've got some projects looking at increasing crude throughput capacity. Do have any details on the specific plans and incremental capacity you're contemplating?", "William R. Klesse", "No. But as you would -- these would only be in situations where we're out of balance with feedstocks. So that we -- for instance in Corpus Christi, when you look at our capacity relative to our crude -- conversion capacity relative to our crude capacity, it's out of balance. And yet now we're in a world where there's a lot more crude oil production coming at us locally that's advantaged. Instead of buying imported feedstocks we need to be looking at generating our own feedstocks. So we have quite a study going on, for instance, at Corpus Christi and our Houston Refinery, where at the Houston Refinery we have a very large cat cracker and yet, we don't have a lot of crude capacity. So these are the things that tie to our whole strategy statement that I spoke about earlier where we look at things that continue to, in the essence, lower our overall cost to produce from the womb to the tomb. And those are the kind things we're looking at. Now at McKee, we've talked about it for about 2 years, we're getting closer to getting some of these permits, but we've said we wanted to expand McKee, and that's been out there. I think you guys are tired of hearing me talk about it. But as soon as -- we have -- we've broken the project into 2 pieces. There's a energy project but there is a crude expansion piece. And we do not have the permit for the crude expansion piece, and it's turned into perpetuity.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Harry Mateer of Barclays.", "Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "It sounds like you think your financial leverage is at an appropriate level, so do you see scope for further debt reduction? And I guess related to that, how should we be thinking about the, I guess, $480 million of maturities in the first half of next year? Is that -- are you thinking that's a use of cash or more like it would be refinanced?", "William R. Klesse", "No, we -- our plan today would be to take out the $480 million. Mike? $180 million in January, $300 million in June, July. And our plan today is to take it out. That will take our debt down -- our long-term debt down to $6.5 billion to date. And yes, we'll be very strong financially, but that is our plan for that specific model. Then you asked general debt. We do not have any other debt that we find economic to call or to redeem. And then in 2014, we only have $200 million of debt that is due. So in our particular case, we do not have debt that would go out and retire economically. We do $480 million and '14, we do the $200 million, but that's where we are.", "Operator", "And our next question is a follow-up from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Sorry, guys, for the follow-up. It's a very quick one, Bill. I wanted to come back to AB32. I know it's a bit of a thorn on your side. But in the event that you have to incur meaningful capital expenditure, at what point would you have to start implementing those projects? In other words, how early before 2020 does this actually become an issue for spending? Now if you could quantify it, that would really be appreciated.", "William R. Klesse", "Okay. I'm going to answer you, Doug, that we are all whispering here. There's no capital per se. Now part of the regulation is 1/3 of your power cost is going to come from renewables and -- in 2020. And our cost in California today for power is $0.12 per kilowatt, and that's like 3x the cost at McKee. And as you go to these renewables, and this would be at Wilmington, so L.A., as you go toward this direction, our power cost will increase more because renewables are not economic. And so we have some options to generate our own power and are looking at that project. But as a philosophy, right now, Valero is very reluctant to spend any capital in California. The other piece of this, to give you the whole 9 yards, we generate hydrogen at our Benicia Refinery, and the facts are we could build another hydrogen plant there, that would be $200 million to $300 million and would reduce our carbon footprint. But again, I would say those are out in the future year because quite frankly, these rules aren't even set yet. And at least some people in California are at least -- are now starting to talk about the financial impact this is going to have in the state on everybody. So I think some of it remains to be seen but generally speaking, there are no capital. There are expenditures if you have to start paying for tailpipe, carbon and certainly our stationary source. And I don't mind saying, I think the last number we have, our California stationary source is like 3.7 million metric tons a year. So you can start figuring out those kind of numbers as well. And all it's going to do is we're going to pass it through.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time. So I'll now turn the call back over to Ashley Smith.", "William R. Klesse", "So let me just say to everybody, good to know that a lot of you on the East Coast have issues, so thank you for making an effort to join our call. And as I said earlier, we hope that you have not incurred too much damage to your home or any of your friends or your loved ones.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Yes. Thanks, Bill. Yes, we wish all you guys in the Northeast a safe and speedy recovery, back to your normal situation. And thank you for listening to the call. If you have any questions or follow-up, just call the IR department. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

My name is Trish, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Ashley Smith. Please go ahead.", "Ashley Smith", "Thank you, Trish, and good morning and welcome to our earnings conference call today. With me are Bill Klesse, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Ciskowski, our CFO; Joe Gorder, President and COO; Gene Edwards, our Chief Development Officer; Kim Bowers, President of Retail and several other members of our senior management team.", "If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also, attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact me after the call.", "Before we get started, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the Company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.", "Okay, so as noted in the release, we reported fourth quarter 2012 earnings up $1 billion, or $1.82 per share. This includes a non-cash asset impairment loss of $37 million after taxes, or $0.06 per share, which is primarily related to permanently canceled capital projects at certain of our refineries. This is our highest forward curve quarter earnings per share since 2005.", "For the full-year 2012, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $2.1 billion, or $3.75 per share. Included in these results were non-cash asset impairment losses of $983 million after taxes, or $1.77 per share, and severance expense of $41 million after taxes, or $0.07 per share mainly related to the shutdown and impairment of the Aruba refinery.", "Operating income was $1.6 billion versus operating income of $167 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in operating income was mainly due to higher refining margins in each of our refining regions; partially offsetting the operating income was a significant decline in ethanol margins.", "Our fourth quarter refining throughput margin was $12.27 per barrel, which is a large increase versus a fourth quarter of 2011 margin, which was $5.46 per barrel. The increase in refining throughput margin was mainly due to wider discounts on medium sour, heavy sour, and domestic light crude oils.", "For example, comparing the fourth quarter of 2011 to the fourth quarter of 2012, the Brent less Mars medium sour discounts improved by nearly $3 per barrel, Brent less Maya heavy sour discount improved by over $11 per barrel, and the Brent less WTI domestic light discount improved by nearly $7 per barrel.", "Our fourth quarter 2012 refining throughput volume averaged $2.64 million barrels per day, down 73,000 barrels per day from the fourth quarter of 2011 mainly due to the lack of throughput volume at the Aruba refinery, which was shutdown in the first quarter of 2012.", "Refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2012 were $3.73 per barrel, which was in line with the third quarter of 2012, slightly below our guidance due mainly to lower than expected energy costs.", "Before I cover retail and ethanol, I\u2019d like to highlight several other items in our refining operations. First, we had a smooth and successful start-up in December of our new hydrocracker at Port Arthur, which was our largest project in company history. Since mid-December, the unit has been operating at approximately 50,000 barrels per day and has performed well.", "Last week, we conducted performance test with the technology provider and we have begun rate test that should enable us to operate the unit at or near the permitted maximum rate of approximately 57,000 barrels per day.", "We are continuing to work on new hydrocracker project at our St. Charles Refinery. We expect to complete that unit and begin operations in the second quarter of 2013. Both of these hydrocrackers were designed to take advantage of the current environment of strong diesel margins and cheap natural gas. Also, in the fourth quarter, we completed and started up our products pipeline that runs from Quebec Refinery to Montr\u00e9al.", "Our retail business reported fourth quarter 2012 operating income of $95 million, consisting of $78 million in the U.S. and $17 million in Canada, where we took a $9 million non-cash asset impairment loss per retail stores in Canada. For the year, our retail business generated $348 million of operating income, making it our second best year in history and nearly as high as last year\u2019s record setting level of $381 million.", "Retail fuel volumes in both regions declined slightly compared to fourth quarter 2011 as weak gasoline demand impacted sales. U.S. retail merchandise sales were higher than on flat merchandise margins in the fourth quarter of 2012 versus the fourth quarter of 2011. Canada retail merchandise sales and margins were down slightly in the fourth quarter of 2012 versus the fourth quarter of 2011.", "Our plan to separate our retail business and unlock value for our shareholders is progressing. Earlier this month, CST Brands, Inc. formally known as Corner Store Holdings, Inc. filed an amended registration statement with the SEC. In summary, our plan is to distribute 80% of the shares in CST Brands to Valero shareholders and Valero will receive approximately $1.1 billion in cash and incur a tax liability of approximately $300 million primarily in Canada. We expect to liquidate the remaining 20% of CST Brands outstanding shares within 18 months of the distribution. Regarding timing, we expect the retail distribution will occur in the second quarter of 2013, but that assumes a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS in clearing all comments from the SEC.", "We believe the separated retail business will perform well and unlock the value for shareholders for several reasons. So first, CST Brands will be the second largest publicly traded independent retailer of fuel and convenience merchandize in North America with nearly 1,900 sites.", "Second, these sites are located in geographically diverse regions; the Southwestern United States and Eastern Canada. Third, many of these 1,032 U.S. retail sites are in Texas and surrounding states, which have strong economic growth.", "Fourth, CST Brands have substantial ownership of the sites with approximately 60% owned and not leased. Fifth, there is a long history of strong financial performance in brand recognition. And finally, CST Brands have significant growth opportunities in merchandize, food service, and new build locations.", "Our Ethanol segment reported operating income of $12 million, which was down $169 million from the fourth quarter of 2011, mainly due to much lower gross margins at high corn prices and excess ethanol inventories squeeze margins to lower levels.", "Production averaged 2.7 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2012 for a decline of nearly 800,000 gallons per day compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.", "Until margins improve, we expect reduction rates to remain well below capacity with three of our plants temporarily idle. In the fourth quarter of 2012, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation were $189 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense was $402 million and net interest expense was $70 million, all in line with company guidance. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 34%. ", "Regarding cash flows in the fourth quarter, capital spending was $942 million which includes $140 million of turnaround and catalyst expenditures. That brings our full year capital spending including $479 million for turnaround and catalyst expenditures to $3.4 billion or $100 million below our guidance. Also in the fourth quarter, we paid $97 million in cash dividends to our shareholders and bought 4.2 million shares for $133 million in cash. For the full-year 2012, we purchased 10.6 million shares of Valero stock with $280 million of cash.", "With respect to our balance sheet at the end of December, total debt was $7 billion, cash was $1.7 billion, and our debt to capitalization ratio net of cash was 22.7%. At the end of December, we had nearly $5.7 billion of available liquidity in addition to cash. ", "We expect our 2013 capital spending to be consistent with our prior estimate of $2.5 billion, and this includes approximately $200 million for our retail segment. Our 2013 estimate also include spending to complete the St. Charles hydrocracker project, which has a total expected cost of approximately $1.6 billion or an increase of approximately $100 million from our previous estimate.", "Looking at the economic growth portion of our 2013 capital spending estimate, we're focused on three strategic areas. The first area is logistics and the spending is spread across our refining system for railcars, rail unloading facilities, pipelines, storage and terminals. The objective is to increase our access to more volumes of discounted U.S. and Canadian crude oils. The second strategic area is for modifications to our refineries that increase the flexibility to export products to premium markets and to process more of discounted crude oils, particularly domestic light crude. And the third strategic area is for expanding our distillate focused hydrocrackers Port Arthur, St. Charles and Meraux.", "Regarding other uses of cash in 2013, we retired $180 million of 6.7% senior notes that matured in mid-January and we expect to retire $300 million of maturing notes in the second quarter of 2013. Last week, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend rate by $0.025 per share or 14% to $0.20 per share or $0.80 on an annualized basis, which is our highest level in company history. This increase reflects our positive outlook for Valero and our commitment to return more cash to shareholders. ", "On the macro side, we continue to believe many of Valero\u2019s refineries have several competitive advantages versus other Atlantic basin refiners including low cost natural gas, increasing access to discounted domestic crude oil, and lager more complex and reliable refineries. These advantages have enabled us to compete both domestic and foreign markets and operate at higher utilization rates versus less competitive Atlantic basin refiners. ", "For modeling our first quarter operations, you should expect the refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges. The Gulf Coast at 1.4 million to 1.5 million barrels per day, Midcontinent at 390,000 to 400,000 barrels per day, West Coast at 245,000 to 255,000 barrels per day, and North Atlantic at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day. Refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter are expected to be around $4 per barrel. ", "Regarding our ethanol operations in the first quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 2.4 million gallons per day and operating expenses should average $0.40 per gallon, including $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization.", "Also we expect G&A expense excluding depreciation to be around $170 million and net interest expense should be around $85 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter should be around $405 million and our effective tax rate in the first quarter should be approximately 35%.", "Okay, Trish, we have concluded our opening remarks. We will now open the call for questions. I do want to advise callers that our goal is to keep the duration of the call to about an hour. Therefore, we're going to ask that you limit your each turn on asking questions to two questions. If you have additional question, you can hop back into the queue. Okay, Trish.", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.", "Good morning.", "Bill Klesse", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.", "You guys had a strong quarter throughputs for better than expected cash operating costs lower, but I wanted to focus on gross margin in the Gulf Coast. I assume that feedstock advantages probably flow through and contributed to a very strong margin capture. Could you talk about, any one-time events, or talk about how feedstock changes could be sustainable in continuing strong margin capture. Any step function change in U.S. crude, or Canadian crude influence in the fourth quarter?", "Joe Gorder", "Jeff, this is Joe, good morning to you too. Yeah, we did well in the Gulf Coast. I mean, if you look at the slate that we ran, we ran more of heavy sour and medium sours in the fourth quarter than we did in the third quarter.", "So and you actually mentioned during his comments what those discounts look like and they were very strong. We also rail lot more reserves, and while we ran a bit more reserves in the quarter, but we ran reserves with better pricing than we had in the third quarter. A lot of that had to do with the fact that the alluvial production was back on stream.", "So basically the guys did a just a very good job of optimizing the crude and feedstocks late into the plants. You know, actually in the quarter, we continue to push run more domestic light sweet crude which we were up over, I think 700,000 barrels a day. So all in, if you look at the crude slate, we had discounted crudes coming in really every form.", "Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.", "How do you see your feedstock changing with the addition of seaway having started up, I think for middle 250 and the Permian pipes coming on late March or April, an incremental rail coming into the market? How do you see those benefiting you in the first quarter and second quarter going forward?", "Joe Gorder", "Well, I think clearly we are getting access to more crews, right? And we mentioned I think in the notes that we were a 100% domestic light sweet crude, where we are running sweet crudes in the Gulf, so we back off all of our foreign dollars. And seaway has had an impact Jeff as you know, but they are not running at the rates that have been anticipated, and I think that\u2019s why we see that LLS is still trading at a bit of a premium to brand. I think as you get seaway up to speed and then we\u2019ve got significant additional projects that are going to bring more crude into the Gulf through 2013, you will end up seeing Brent trading at that discount that we are all expecting to LLS going forward, okay.", "As we run light sweet crudes in lane and Bill can speak to the projects that we are looking at, I think he knows some of those to allow us to run more light sweet crudes, we are going to be in beneficiaries of that.", "Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.", "Thank you, Joe.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Doug, your line is open.", "Bill Klesse", "Doug, whenever you are ready.", "Joe Gorder", "All right. You might have to hop in next. Trish, can you move to our next caller?", "Operator", "Yes. Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi, good morning, guys, great quarter of today.", "Bill Klesse", "Good morning, Evan.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yeah, just maybe a follow-up on some of those projects, I mean you mentioned fourth quarter placed the important lights with domestics and the Gulf Coast in Memphis, and pursuing several options. So I think I believe you are considering condensate splitter, clearly at Gulf Coast we will see more condensate moving out of the Eagle Ford, Rail was mentioned as an option that would \u2013 I think increase in viability if Keystone is delayed or blocked. I mean could you comment just generally on what those projects are because of cost magnitude to mention maybe the logistics spending that will be important as well as that could be put into different structure? And whether any expenses are currently included in that $960 million of strategic 2013 CapEx?", "Bill Klesse", "All right. Well, Evan, good morning. We are looking at a lot of real projects. And in the logistics capital, if I look at the logistics capital that we have in the 2013 budget is a lot of it has to do with dock capacity, logistics, sure that we have the ability to export the volumes that we\u2019ve got.", "We think today, we can put 225,000 barrels a day gasoline on the water and we\u2019re looking at ways to increase that at St. Charles at Port Arthur  These all we think we can move to 80 a day and we\u2019re looking at projects to take that up to over 400 barrels a day.", "So a lot of the capital that we have and the capital forecast is for that. In addition, we announced that we bought the railcars and we\u2019re working projects to figure out where we want to take this crude with these railcars. I mean we certainly have somethings in mind, but we are looking at projects, for example, at St. Charles to rail crude in.", "We\u2019ve got a project that rail crude into Quebec. We\u2019ve got the two West Coast refinery that we\u2019re looking at rail options for. And then Memphis we think we can rail a significant amount of crude in domestic. So we\u2019re working all those options and the guys are going through the overall logistics strategy for that including potentially additional railcars. So as far as the capital attributed to it, right now we don\u2019t have anything identified above the plan.", "Joe Gorder", "", "Yeah.", "Bill Klesse", "So all those things just to clarify, all those things Joe was talking about, I mean those are included in our strategic growth category which is just under $1 billion for 2013.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "That's great. And in terms of Memphis, you say that you were, you back at all foreign imports there. So I presume used kind of Capline. What are you running there and what is \u2013 how is it getting there and is there any yield pickup from the slight change at Memphis that's improved its profitability?", "Kim Bowers", "", "I'll speak to the crude supply piece and maybe Lane want to talk to the yield improvements. But we are running Bakken, it\u2019s \u2013 really still coming up Capline, and so we haven't changed the method of delivery into that refinery right now. We are looking at waterborne deliveries into Memphis going forward. Right now, the economics have supported continue to use Capline. ", "Lane Riggs", "So this is Lane Riggs. In terms of the quality of Bakken, it\u2019s really normally around LLS, but I would say because LLS historically have been a blended barrel made from a number of different components, Bakken is a neat barrel and it's been much in terms of its ratability and our ability to steady our operations around running it. We are certainly getting the benefit of a more steady crude diet, it\u2019s lighter so it's really its value versus the LLS directly function of what the gas frac is, but normally it's slightly \u2013 just today its slightly just kind of a quality basis to LLS. For us though we are getting quite a bit of value just out of the steady operation running Bakken need to our refinery standout to Memphis.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. I'll be there guys. Thank you. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "We have Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, can you hear me now guys. ", "Bill Klesse", "We can.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "I apologize. Technical problem. I hope I didn\u2019t get my course of questions taking here. I wanted to follow-up on Jeff\u2019s, if I may real quick and then I\u2019ll got a follow-up. I guess this question is really for Joe, but as you see the light sweet bar increase in terms of volume in the Gulf Coast, what\u2019s happening to the relationship as you see it for heavy crude particularly as it relates to this historical discount to LLS and what I\u2019m really trying to get out is, if you eventually see LLS move to discount to Brent, do you expect the heavy medium sour oils could maintain their relationship with LLS or not with the discount. I\u2019m just curious as to how you see that playing out and then I\u2019ll got a follow-up please.", "Joe Gorder", "Well, that\u2019s a good question, Bill and\u2026", "Bill Klesse", "So I\u2019ll answer it. The way we actually look at it, we would agree that if LLS goes to a discount of Brent, which we expect to happen, the world crude is still Brent. So heavy crude will sell at a discount, but the discount against LLS will narrow but you\u2019ll still have an acceptable discount against Brent. So going into a sunk coker we think that you\u2019ll have economics to do that but not to build the grass roots coker.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So what\u2019s the logic now of expanding your ability to process light crude if the heavy crude is going to move to the same discount as the light if you would I mean?", "Bill Klesse", "Just because of the availability, we\u2019ll see at Keystone actually gets filled. But as you can see in the press today, enterprises having trouble moving the oil, once it gets to Houston. so we have a lot of availability and personally, we\u2019ve said that the discount and I know its different today, okay? The discount LLS against Brent will move to several dollars at least tariffs, but it could move more. And those will be attractive to run that, but it\u2019s read, it\u2019s just so available where the heavy barrels are having to be imported. So now you start to look around and as I said it depends on what have to a Keystone. But as you begin to look around, the Mexican volumes are moving in different directions, you have the Venezuelan volumes moving different directions, you do have increases in Columbia. So we just manage the supply function here and think the light crude is going to be readily available.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great, nice for the full answer, Bill. My follow-up is probably something that you\u2019ve been asked a lot about recently, but your free cash flow obviously steps up this year. You had made this comment again in your rounding statement about having the competitively highest yield in the sector. Can you just help us understand what was framing that, the scale of ultimately what you think between your dividend policy and buybacks? And I guess you could bring into the answer perhaps shares that you issued in the middle of the crisis in terms of whether or not but I don\u2019t know that would prioritize buybacks over dividend increases and I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.", "Bill Klesse", "Well, Doug, I think we clearly have demonstrated the management team that we return cash to the shareholders. You go back to 2006, 2007, when we did not have better opportunities, we bought a lot of shares which we did get some criticism for, but actually we didn\u2019t have better projects, so we returned cash to the shareholders.", "So we\u2019ve demonstrated our ability to return cash to the shareholder. In the last two years, we purchased 27 million shares. We\u2019ve increased our dividend several times. We continue to buy our shares, because we think our shares are undervalued. We do not think the market is giving us credit for this distribution of our retail businesses. But on the other hand, we\u2019re going to maintain our investment grade rating, we think it\u2019s very important for a company of our size. I actually mentioned, we\u2019re paying off about $500 million of debt here in the first half. And with this volatility that we have in the marketplace today, we are going to hold more cash. So a couple of our projects are slightly behind, obviously as we said, we\u2019re a $100 million over from our previous guidance at St. Charles hydrocracker. So we\u2019re going to make sure we finish all that.", "Then what we tend to do is look at our balanced approach to everything. In our business, this is a very capital intensive long lead time of business. And if we believe that we can add more shareholder value than we can looking at our stock price today, then we make these investments.", "So we tend to have balance in our approach. You ask about the approximate 50 million shares that we issued in, I guess the second quarter of 2009. And sure, we would like to take those out. And everybody that supported us at that time sure, have a nice return as well. And but it\u2019s not a goal for say, it\u2019s more of our, the stock is undervalued, and we\u2019ll have a balanced approach.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "We appreciate the answer Bill, thanks.", "Bill Klesse", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Kessler from Tudor Pickering. Please go ahead.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.", "Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the dynamics you are seeing along the Gulf Coast and that is, are you getting a widening spread in the East versus West costal price of light, I mean you\u2019re getting a deeper price for light crude to say, Corpus than Houston, and now at seaway a discount \u2013 a deeper discount at Houston versus Louisiana. And what do you expect to happen with that East West spread going forward? And then are there any limits to exploiting a lighter spread should want to emerge?", "Gene Edwards", "Rob, you\u2019re wrong. I mean your description of the market is what we\u2019re seeing. I mean Corpus crude is trading less than Houston crude, and Houston crude is less than St. James. So where we expect going forward, I think if St. James is going to be Bakken based, it\u2019s always going to price more than Eagle Ford into Corpus or the Mid-Continent crude to Permian crude into Houston.", "Bill Klesse", "So I would add to that that as long as these areas are long, so for instance, I\u2019d like to say Corpus Christi is long, Eagle Ford crude thus it has to move, and it\u2019s going to move with the tariff and some timing deltas. So the clearing places St. James now for LLS, so you\u2019re going to have differentials toward Houston and differentials towards St. James. What you have to have the supply demand imbalance in those markets, the minute the market flips to short than the tariff turns around.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.", "And then theoretically barge capacity to exploit the spread if one persistent for long enough to want to put money to work in inventory on the water to take advantage of that?", "Joe Gorder", "Yeah, I would say, I don\u2019t know if there is enough barge capacity truly.", "Bill Klesse", "Well, I think your question is, when you store all along the barge to take advantage or you start make them shipping it.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.", "Yeah, I just \u2013 to me when you have a spread like that potentially emerge in that, you guys would seem to be as best places anyone to be able to take advantage of it and I just don\u2019t know, is there some limiting factor, I am not thinking of whether it\u2019s loading, unloading along the coast that kind of circumvent would might be in place already in the pipeline side, is there some kind of storage bottleneck. I just want, what could be a limiting factor that I will be thinking of and your ability to displace that dislocation and offset it in your system?", "Bill Klesse", "Well, I would assume others are doing what we are doing. We are fixing docks, we are increasing our capability, so if Corpus Christi come, the second quarter we will be able to load a lot more onto water. Lead time for railcars is a year to 18 months, lead time on barges is a year. ", "Joe Gorder", "Yes.", "Bill Klesse", "A year, so I think it just tells you by those lead times that those type of assets are short or tight.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.", "", "Second question from me, when you look at Western Canada Select or bitumen in Canada in general in the spread versus say, Maya in the Gulf, it seems like rail is in no [brainier]? And so you guys ordered a couple of thousand more railcars, some of those will be bit forward moving that crude down. Was about a year turnaround time I think on a new railcar. Why would could that not just accelerate to an exponential degree and where do you see that developing and say, in just overall market, rail lot of Alberta say down in the Gulf Coast and a year or two years time and how much will Valero participate in that?", "Bill Klesse", "Well, I think Joe answered you earlier said, we are looking at rail at St. James, St. Charles, so that\u2019s the Louisiana.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.", "Yeah.", "Bill Klesse", "And so we are doing it. Clearly, we are looking at rail in the Southern California just like all our competitors are as well. So as far as exponential, there is no question rail is growing very rapidly by every single company and part of it is because of the uncertainty surrounding some of the pipelines and a long lead time that seems to be developing. But the supply is there and the market demand is in these refining centers and you would not get any argument from us, or I think any of our competitors since all of us are buying railcars that this is the big part of our future and this business is your logistics capability to move to stress crude oils through your refineries.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.", "So if you are in 12 to 18 months time if the market was moving 200,000 to 400,000 barrels a day out of Alberta by rail that wouldn\u2019t surprise you?", "", "Bill Klesse", "I don\u2019t know the numbers I think as well as you do, but it does not surprise me to be a lot of railcars, I just don\u2019t know those kind of numbers.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.", "Sure, okay.", "Bill Klesse", "Okay, but\u2026", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.", "Well, thanks for your comment.", "Bill Klesse", "But we\u2019re looking at the same thing that I\u2019m sure you here from the other people.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.", "Gotcha. Thank you, guys.", "Bill Klesse", "Sure, Robert.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Cory Garcia from Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Cory Garcia \u2013 Raymond James", "Good morning, Klesse.", "Bill Klesse", "Good morning, Cory.", "Cory Garcia \u2013 Raymond James", "Just kind of one quick question, you guys alluded to in your slide deck regarding your Port Arthur hydrocracker that you\u2019ve been seeing from higher quality diesel and actually some better distilled yields overall. Just wondering how we should kind of think about that today as it normalize back towards your expectations of, I think I want to say, closer to 60%, or have you maintained the high level and really how we sort of get that around in terms of modeling?", "Lane Riggs", "Hi, Cory, this is Lane Riggs. Right now what we are doing this test run as Ashley alluded to in his opening remarks. We\u2019re at about 80% distillate yield, that take care of what distillate. Our diesel index, our CT index going off the units about 62 on the diesel, which is much better than we had anticipated, the properties on the (inaudible) grade. So certainly these are great distillate yield and a great product for our products if I figure out where this is safe to market.", "Bill Klesse", "So we\u2019ve got new catalyst, so we\u2019ve got high activity...", "Lane Riggs", "Right, (inaudible) business.", "Bill Klesse", "And we think that this unit will run till we have to replace catalysts.", "Lane Riggs", "3 years.", "Bill Klesse", "Three years. So there will be some degradation over that period.", "Lane Riggs", "That\u2019s right.", "Cory Garcia \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay, great. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Yeah. Good morning, and again, congratulations on the quarter. You\u2019ve talked a little bit about, just specifically in the quarter, sourcing more heavy oil, can you talk a little bit about where are those mediums and heavies are coming from? I mean, is this incremental Canadian barrels, is it kind of, let\u2019s call it Western Hemisphere, is it some out of Middle East, is it a mix of the above? And then as you\u2019re looking forward, we clearly are going to have more heavy sour capacity coming on globally. I was just curious, is it ultimately we need keystone, we need rail, or is there something else you\u2019re looking at in terms of sourcing those mediums and those heavies?", "Joe Gorder", "Okay. The heavy barrels, I mean we\u2019ve got them out of South America and Mexico, okay. And our normal suppliers, we increased our volumes from Venezuela and from Mexico both. I would say that, I would say there was nothing unusual about the sources of supply of these barrels other than the economics associated with running them versus not running them. We are bringing some heavy sour Canadian crudes into Port Arthur, and we\u2019re running that. But we didn\u2019t have any material change in the volumes there.", "So and then if I step forward to what you\u2019re talking about going forward. we want heavy sour crude in the Gulf Coast. Keystone pipeline is the most economical way for us to do that. We are still fully supportive of the pipeline and we want to see it happen. Second to that, then you look at other alternatives to get heavy sours up and we continue to look at those, as their capacity on Enbridge, their ability to take the crude into Hartford and then barge it down to St. Charles, which we tend to be doing somehow, can we do more of that. ", "And then rail, of course, we don't know exactly what those numbers might be today, but we're looking it. We have \u2013 needed railcars and we're looking at the ability to move heavy sour Canadian's to be a rail. So we're looking at all the options there Roger.", "Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. And the follow-up question looking at the hydrocrackers, obviously we now look at the price of the various products, if I was understood it correctly there is really sensitivity to natural gas as feedstock and power source. Can you walk us through what we should really think about the full quarter contribution in Port Arthur and obviously as we see the ramp up at St. Charles as well. What are the big things we should watch here on the price side to really determine the economics of these.", "Gene Edwards", "", "Yeah, Roger there are several key drivers, natural gas is one of them, diesel is one of them, overall crude is one of them. We've got sensitivities for barrel and the appendix to our standard IR slide deck. To give you a feel for how it\u2019s been running, it's been running at these planned test rates around 50,000 barrels a day. And so far in January where the market has been with low gasoline cracks, but good diesel cracks and pretty cheap natural gas, EBITDA has been up around between $20 and $25 a barrel and we've been running it about 50,000 barrels a day. So it\u2019s been pretty much what we expected. And this is kind of a depressed environment \u2013 assume January as full year commodity price debt, but in this environment, it\u2019s been pretty darn good.", "Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Definitely sounds like it. And then, as we think about moving into the spring time, the gasoline crack typically would react a lot better.", "Gene Edwards", "", "That\u2019s correct. You would have to assume \u2013 you would hope you could assume a higher average gasoline crack. As Lane said, it\u2019s nearly 80% distillate right now. The remainder is primarily gasoline or gasoline related components. So as that crack picks up, then you should see overall margins.", "Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. The original calculations we looked at was more like two thirds, distilling one third kind of gasoline another. So the 80% reflects, again the comments about catalyst overtime, maybe we think two thirds or one third?", "Gene Edwards", "", "Yeah, we\u2019ll see where it shapes out, because as Bill mentioned, the catalyst is highly selective right now which is advantageous, we\u2019ll where it shapes out, but I\u2019m not ready to change the base model for it.", "Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Dahlman Rose. Please go ahead.", "Sam Margolin \u2013 Dahlman Rose", "Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. I guess a lot of conversation has been around crude, I was a little more curious about product. In general, how have exports looked, is that kind of plateauing obviously there\u2019s been some pretty healthy inventory building in past month or so on the gasoline side. And I was just wondering if there is any trends that stand out to you on the export front, if it\u2019s decelerating or if you anticipate the same kind of growth that we\u2019ve had over the past two years?", "Joe Gorder", "Okay. Well, hey Sam, it\u2019s Joe. ", "Sam Margolin \u2013 Dahlman Rose", "Hey, how are you?", "Joe Gorder", "I\u2019m good. You?", "Sam Margolin \u2013 Dahlman Rose", " ", "I\u2019m good. Thanks. ", "Joe Gorder", "Good. Well, in the fourth quarter, we moved out almost 110,000 barrels a day of gasoline with primarily in Latin America and Mexico. And those are pretty high numbers, because typically we are doing 60,000 barrels to 70,000 barrels range. So demand was still very good. Latin America is growing and they continue to have supply issues. Mexico\u2019s demand is growing and they have some supply limitations. So from sustainability perspective, we still think that these export markets are going to be very good. ", "In the first quarter of 2013, from a gasoline perspective, we will probably export less than we did in the fourth quarter and a lot of that has to do with the turnaround activity we got going on in Corpus Christi. If we talk about diesel, diesel inventories unlike gasoline inventories, diesel inventories are low. They are at the low end of the five year range and although U.S. demand for distillate continues to be weak, distillate demand abroad is strong and it continues to grow. In the U.S., I think we exported over 1 million barrels a day. ", "Diesel fuel, that\u2019s up significantly from where it was last year. Valero exported 157,000 barrels a day of diesel fuel in the fourth quarter and we will increase that volume in the first quarter as we\u2019ve got the throughputs of the new hydrocracker. From our perspective, I think everybody else is always a market driven phenomenon and is the yard open or not and if the yard is open to move the barrels to South America or Europe, we will move them and if not we will keep them here at home. ", "Sam Margolin \u2013 Dahlman Rose", " ", "Okay, thank you. That data was really helpful. And then secondly, on the East Coast, I am sure you saw that was officially announced a plant that came up for sale. Historically, it hasn\u2019t been particularly competitive, but I was just wondering how you guys think of the East Coast as a derivative of your LLS thesis, barge activity might accelerate from the Gulf up to the North Atlanta and if you think that timing wise, it couldn\u2019t make sense to position into that theme a little early.", "Bill Klesse", "Well, as far as Valero\u2019s opinion on the East Coast, we exited the East Coast.", "Sam Margolin \u2013 Dahlman Rose", "Right.", "Bill Klesse", "And so I think as far as a refiner goes, we\u2019re still a supplier, marketer into those markets.

You spoke about Corpus trading at discounts to Houston, and then Bakken trading in St. James at a premium. Maybe I appreciate, it\u2019s a moving target, but if it's possible to be a bit specific about say what is the Eagle Ford discount into Corpus, what is the Permian discounts or the seaway blends down into Houston and what is the Bakken discount into St. James say relative in 4Q, say relative to LLS that would be helpful.", "Joe Gorder", "Okay. It's relative to LLS and if we keep it just as simple as we can and we have transportation right, okay. There are so many good reports out there now that are addressing this issue then we look at those to, but you've got a couple of dollars of transportation to get the Eagle Ford over to Houston. All right, and then you've got another couple of dollars to get from Houston over to St. James. So theoretically you could argue this Eagle Ford auto trade as an LLS minus $4 over in Corpus and LLS minus $2 in Houston.", "And then if you look at it relative to WTI and you said what WTI is $3 or so $3.50 to the cost \u2013WTI is going to be, if you took it into the Houston markets, you\u2019re going to \u2013 you get it there for $3.5, so it would be a $1.5 over the Eagle Ford and to Houston, and as you took it all the over to St. James you\u2019re $3.50, and so this is the kind of the math we\u2019re working up, we\u2019re doing just kind of the same way, your guys are for saying, okay, what is it going to be if LLS. Bill mentioned it before that St. James will be the clearing point for LLS, and everything is going to trade and it move west to a discount, LLS, and then what next with (inaudible), while you\u2019re going to have it for rent ultimately into the east coast, near the LLS plus $4.50 to $5 a barrel, which is U.S. flag transportation cost to get it up here.", "", "Edward G.

And then I know we\u2019re running out of time, so just the follow-up is, one of the issues that we\u2019ve seen with all these crude differential moves has been times right now heavy light spreads, but wee had a pretty good number in Q4. How is that dynamic working now this quarter and how do you expect that to play out? And I\u2019m thinking particularly one of the hardest things when we think about this is the fact that essentially a lot of that heavy crude is priced on a formula with a k factor. But we naturally expect that to be a narrower number going forward, because of how wide it got in Q4? Thanks.", "Mike Ciskowski", "As I mentioned its coming a bit Paul and a lot of it had to do with the fact that WTS was dislocated for a period there when there was some turnaround activity in midcontinent. So that and then the fact that residuals have been priced at a significant discount, both of those contributed to the mine discount. It has come in a bit and then the Mexicans have adjusted to K to try to get it back relating to market should we see us. I think we still have decent discounts that they have come in.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Right. And could you clarify where the Mexican think it should be?", "Joe Gorder", "Well, what do we say Bill, on discounts.", "Bill Klesse", "Well, into a sunk coker I have said to all of you that we need in this 10% range, so that we would have economics to go through the coker, but if you \u2013 to have good economics in the coker you need 15%, so but I\u2026", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "I get it, Bill, that\u2019s what you say, that\u2019s it\u2019s kind of clear as long as I guess on the contractual side that\u2019s there for you two I hadn\u2019t heard you kind of \u2013 we haven\u2019t split that circle previously. And then the residual fuel aspects of the discount, I guess I\u2019ve heard you say in the past is it kind of a secular issue to do with lower demand for residue? Could you just \u2013 in the one minute specific on that \u2013 talk a little bit about how you see that playing out?", "Joe Gorder", "Well, China is not running residue anymore. They\u2019re running crude, okay. So that\u2019s back resilient in the marketplace and then with Libya production back on line, we just found ourselves in longer-supply that we have been in the past. So that would help.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "And I think the demand side is weak as well right?", "Joe Gorder", "Yeah.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Great, thank you. Just one more question is light and heavy discussion. Are all your barrels, the heavy barrels in the Gulf Coast priced off Maya or the barrels from Venezuela and Colombia, does the price side kind done a different metric?", "Joe Gorder", "", "They all look at Maya cheap, but they\u2019re not all priced off from Maya.", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "So the (inaudible) barrels, do you expect the differential to stay wider on those barrels and what\u2019s happening with the formula based on Maya?", "Joe Gorder", "I would think so.", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Okay, great. And then just in first quarter in general, we talked a little bit about this, but how is the environment looking for you now in the different regions, 1Q versus what you realize in the fourth quarter?", "Joe Gorder", "See, it\u2019s really kind of too soon to say, too soon to get any guidance for the first quarter, particularly in the margin. However we did say that the heavy differentials or discounts did narrow, so. ", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Right, okay. And then Bill, you mentioned a couple of times here on Keystone XL, do you have any thoughts on how this might go?", "Bill Klesse ", "I don\u2019t, you mean to the answer of what the administration is going to be?", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital", " ", "Yeah, exactly, exactly. ", "Bill Klesse ", " ", "My thought would be no better than yours. ", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Okay. ", "Bill Klesse ", " ", "However I think it\u2019s just ridiculous. There is pipelines everywhere, there is a pipeline in front of your home, have in the streets. Canada there is an LOI and the refineries in the U.S. Gulf Coast need the Canadian order and the jobs and the assets and the tax payers are here in the United States. But my opinion is not better than yours. ", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital", " ", "Yeah. It\u2019s pretty absurd that it doesn\u2019t get on. Thanks, well, I appreciate it. ", "Operator", " ", "Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead. ", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Well, hi guys. Sorry for the follow-up. I just have a couple of quick ones and I want to queue up again. Can you talk about the cash burn in the quarter woven on there in terms of working capital just like, there is a big move there, and finally any comments on what you are hearing in terms of potential LIFO accounting changes on inventory and how that might effect you guys? I will leave it there, thanks. ", "Joe Gorder", "Okay. In the fourth quarter, we did have an increase in our receivables quite a bit, it\u2019s about $700,000 to $1 million, but that is really a timing issue as our cash received task picked up quite a bit here in January. And part of the differentials that are the reduction in cash as we had our federal or tax payment in the fourth quarter too a large one. So that was part of the reason cash going down.", "Bill Klesse", "I will note that this business is a taxpayer of nearly $500 million in the quarter.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thanks. ", "Joe Gorder", "And then you asked the question on LIFO.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah, I\u2019m just curious about when you guys are hearing about potential changes and what would happen if we did see International Accounting Standards and employees across the U.S.?", "Joe Gorder", "Okay, so our LIFO reserve is\u2026. ", "Bill Klesse", "$6.7 billion.", "Joe Gorder", "", "Is the value not on the books, $6.7 billion. We had $6.7 billion of value that is not represented on our books, so if they get away with LIFO and nothing change, we would owe tax on $6.7 million and again we would be a taxpayer.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, how much of that would be cash, and how much would be non-cash, can you quantify that?", "Mike Ciskowski", "The cash we pay 35%, I guess 35% of $6.7 billion.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Always that scary number guys, can you put some framework around how likely or what progress you think has been made to not issue on the \u2013 I leaver it at that?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Well, I'm going to say it's not going to happen. And obviously LIFO used in many, many industries, it's not unique to the oil business, but I don't say it would happen, and if it did happen, let's say it did, and we would obviously lobby for a payment schedule. But I mean obviously.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great, thanks guys. Appreciate it.", "Bill Klesse", "Okay, thanks, Doug.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Kessler from Tudor, Pickering. Please go ahead.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt, & Co.", "Hi, guys, sorry for the double up, I think you want to wrap up the call. But since you opened Pandora\u2019s box, it\u2019s kind of Brent versus LLS and how you calculate that spread? You referenced to $4 to $5 cost of moving LLS up to the East Coast. I guess my question will be at the limited market and with the rate of growth in U.S. supply, you saturate that market in maybe a quarter or so worth of time. How do you price the spread post that event?", "Bill Klesse", "Okay. So you\u2019re saying what you\u2019ve got...", "Joe Gorder", "Maybe, I\u2019d just answer, that\u2019s way out in the future, but I will say to you that the marginal cost of transportation is going to be, why it\u2019s going to be the debt. So if Bakken lays into the East Coast at $15 to $17 by rail, and you can lay it into the U.S. Gulf Coast that $12 by rail, it\u2019s going to have an inherent differential there. I think that\u2019s why you saw one of our competitors lock up some transportation \u2013 water transportation from the Gulf coast up to the East Coast. So we would think then those differentials \u2013 when the markets are imbalance, we\u2019ll all equate close to the tariffs of the marginal source, water from the Gulf Coast to the East coast or rail from the Bakken or somewhere out there to the East Coast versus getting it all down to the Gulf coast.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt, & Co.", "Yeah. I guess, I\u2019ll get you on that, once you\u2019re imbalanced, but the moment you flipped to a net long position on the crude and you feel that all the coast. I guess, this is what I\u2019m trying to get to.", "Bill Klesse", "But then it\u2019s looking for a home.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt, & Co.", "Yeah.", "Bill Klesse", "And who can take it and it will drive. So if you can\u2019t export crude, then it\u2019s going to be pushing to another refinery, some other place. The other stand we\u2019ll keep doing is discounting and keep backing out some of these other types of crudes, exactly what Valero is looking at here at our Houston refinery where we are a feedstock buyer, we\u2019re looking at crudes units produce our own feedstock.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt, & Co.", "Yeah.", "Bill Klesse", "So you have projects like that, that we and I\u2019m sure others will look at the key to (inaudible) this up.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt, & Co.", "And I could be wrong, but let\u2019s just say, it comes quicker than that project comes online, you\u2019ve already sort of matched on it quite 530,000 barrels a day in your Gulf Coast system. You\u2019ve already got a scenario where some that you are light sweet and that your delivery is equal to your medium sour grades. Is there a scenario where you could force feed more into Gulf Coast system, while you wait on those projects?", "Bill Klesse", "It\u2019s not to a great extent. We would need the projects and it\u2019s because you would overload your light and handling capability.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt, & Co.", "Yeah.", "Bill Klesse", "However, we are very smart people and our people are happy and trying to figure out how to handle the light in. But the increment would be, if the delta gets wide enough, we\u2019re going to take it to Quebec.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt, & Co.", "Yeah. And so that one a pretty quick too I imagine.", "Bill Klesse", "Well, it\u2019s a 200 and some thousand barrel a day refinery, but yeah, we\u2019ll say it will be, because we like those numbers and they were also involved in line nine, so you will be feeding Quebec from a lot of different ways. And that will be another refinery that today is a \u2013 so it\u2019s Canada, but today we\u2019re on four and sweet for Canada, and instead of may grow in U.S. and Western Canadian.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt, & Co.", "Thanks for the color. I appreciate it.", "Bill Klesse", "Okay, thanks, Robert.", "Operator", "Now, with our last question I\u2019ll now turn it back to the speakers for any closing remarks.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Okay, thank you, Trish. And I just wanted to thank investors for listening to the call. If you have further questions, please contact Investor Relations. Thank you.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Ashley Smith, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "Ashley Smith", "Thank you, Lorissa, good morning, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. With me today are Bill Klesse, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Ciskowski, our CFO; Joe Gorder, President and COO; Gene Edwards, our Chief Development Officer and several other members of Valero's senior management team.", "If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact me after the call.", "Before we get started, I'd like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the Company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under Federal Securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.", "Okay, as noted in the release, we reported second quarter 2013 earnings of $466 million or $0.85 per share. The results include after-tax charges to general and administrative expenses of $20 million or $0.04 per share and income tax expense of $9 million or $0.01 per share, both related to the May 1 spinoff of CST Brands to Valero's stockholders.", "In addition, the results include after-tax charges to G&A expenses of $34 million related to various environmental and legal matters.", "Second quarter 2013 operating income was $808 million versus operating income of $1.4 billion in the second quarter of 2012. The decrease was mainly due to lower refining margins in each of our operating regions.", "Our second quarter 2013 refining throughput margin of $9.26 per barrel was over $1 per barrel lower versus the second quarter 2012 margin of $10.63 per barrel. The decrease was partly due to significantly lower discounts per heavy sour crude oil.", "For example, the Maya crude oil discounts to Brent crude oil decreased by $4.40 per barrel from the second quarter of 2012 to the second quarter of 2013. Fortunately the Maya discount has improved by more than $3, over $3 per barrel with July month today discounts to Brent of nearly $8.20 per barrel.", "Also contributing to the decrease in margins were the lower discounts per medium sour crude oil and light crude oil. For example the Mars crude oil discount to Brent crude oil decreased by $0.69 per barrel in the second quarter of 2013 compared to the second quarter of 2012.", "For light crude oil on the Gulf Coast, the LLS crude oil was a slight discount to Brent crude oil in the second quarter of 2012 versus the premium in the second quarter of 2013, for an increase of about $1.80 per barrel.", "In addition, the refining throughout margin was negatively impacted by the higher costs of Renewable Identification Numbers or RINs needed to comply with the U.S. Federal Renewable Fuel Standard.", "For the second quarter of 2013, the reported cost to comply were a $125 million versus $58 million for the second quarter of 2012. Given the recent escalation in RINs prices, we now estimate our cost to comply with the renewable fuel standard to be in the range of $600 million to $800 million for the full year of 2013.", "Another factor that affected the refining margins was the higher cost of natural gas. Natural gas prices increased from $2.24 per MMBtu in the second quarter of 2012 to $4 per MMBtu in the second quarter of 2013. In addition to effect in our operating expenses, this increase impacts our cost of sales due to our use of hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas. So far in the third quarter, natural gas prices have favorably decreased about $0.40 per MMBtu versus last quarter.", "Our second quarter 2013 refining throughput volumes averaged 2.6 million barrels per day, for a decrease of 52,000 barrels per day from the second quarter of 2012, caused mainly by turnarounds and planned maintenance at our Quebec City, McKee, Port Arthur, and Meraux refineries.", "Refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter of 2013 were $3.82 per barrel, which was higher than second quarter of 2012 due mainly to higher energy costs.", "I\u2019d like to highlight several other items in our refining operations. First, the new hydrocracker at Port Arthur has continued to perform well and contribute to earnings. In the second quarter of 2013, we estimate the new Port Arthur hydrocracker contributed approximately $80 million in EBITDA with the throughput rates nearly at capacity and achieving high conversion rates. The contribution is slightly lower than last quarter due to changes in market prices for key drivers such as higher natural gas prices, lower naphtha values, and lower butane values during the summer RVP gasoline blending season.", "Using 2012 average prices, we estimate EBITDA would have been approximately $120 million.", "We look forward to the contribution from the recently completed St. Charles hydrocracker, which is essentially a clone of the Port Arthur unit. Earlier in July, the St. Charles hydrocracker experienced a smooth and successful startup and is now running at planned rates.", "As a reminder, both of these hydrocrackers were designed to take advantage of the current environment of relatively high crude oil prices, strong diesel margins, and inexpensive natural gas. This is also consistent with our strategy to increase production of high quality diesel.", "Also at the St. Charles refinery, the Diamond Green Diesel joint venture biofuels plant started up at the end of June. Throughout July we have been ramping up rates, this plant is designed to produce approximately 9,300 barrels per day of renewable diesel from low quality recycled cooking oils and fats using refinery hydro processing technology.", "The project is a 50-50 joint venture between Valero and Darling International, a leading gatherer of used cooking oils and animal fats. Valero\u2019s retail segment reported $39 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2013 prior to the May 1 spin-off of CST Brands.", "Subsequent to May 1, Valero reported its equity interest in the earnings of CST Brands as part of other income. As a result of entering into long-term fuel supply agreements, CST Brands became our largest wholesale customers. Our ethanol segment reported operating income of $95 million in the second quarter of 2013, an increase of $90 million from the second quarter of 2012 mainly due to higher gross margins per gallon and higher production volumes.", "Production averaged 3.5 million gallons per day in the second quarter of 2013 for an increase of 156,000 gallons per day compared to the second quarter of 2012. The increase in production volumes was mainly due to the economic incentive of higher gross margins per gallon.", "In the second quarter of 2013, general and administrative expenses excluding corporate depreciation were $233 million. Included in this were pretax charges of $52 million or $34 million after taxes for increases to environmental reserves related to non-operating sites and legal reserves and pretax charges of $30 million or $20 million after taxes related to cost incurred to affect the spin-off of CST Brands.", "In the second quarter of 2013 net interest expense was $78 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense was $405 million and the effective tax rate was 37%. Regarding cash flows in the second quarter of 2013, capital expenditures were $796 million including $162 million for turnarounds and catalysts.", "We returned $364 million in cash to our stockholders by paying $109 million in dividends and by purchasing 6.5 million shares of Valero common stock for $255 million. In addition, Valero paid off $300 million worth of 4.75% notes that matured in June and we received approximately $550 million of net cash from the CST Brands transaction.", "At the end of the second quarter of 2013, we had approximately $3 million remaining under our stock purchase authorizations. With respect to our balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, cash was $2.4 billion, total debt was $6.6 billion, our debt to capitalization ratio net of cash was 18.8% and we had over $6 billion of availability liquidity in addition to cash.", "We maintain our guidance for full-year 2013 capital expenditures of approximately $2.85 billion which includes turnarounds and catalysts. For 2014, we estimate capital spending including catalysts and turnarounds to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion. Returning cash to stockholders remain a high priority and we are balancing this with opportunities to create value by strategically investing in logistics assets, hydrocracking, petrochemicals, and processing cost advantage lighter crude oil.", "Our premise is to capture the competitive advantages provided by the growing supply of cost advantage crude oil and natural gas in the U.S. and Canada. Along these lines we are also evaluating potential petrochemical investments that will leverage our existing assets to upgrade the value of abundant and growing supplies of natural gas and natural gas liquids.", "Lastly, we are evaluating the formation of a master limited partnership for our logistic assets. If for modeling our third-quarter operations, we should expect refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges; U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.5 million barrels to 1.55 million barrels per day; the U.S. mid-continent at 420,000 barrels to 440,000 barrels per day; the U.S. West Coast at 270,000 barrels to 280,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 470,000 to 490,000 barrels per day.", "We expect refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter to be around $3.85 per barrel. For our ethanol operations in the third quarter, we expect total production volumes of 3.45 million gallons per day and operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon which includes $0.04 per gallon for non-cash cost such as depreciation and amortization. Also in the third quarter we expect G&A expense excluding depreciation to be around $160 million and net interest expense should be about $100 million.", "Total depreciation and amortization expense in the third quarter should be around $420 million and our effective tax rate in the third quarter should be approximately 35%.", "Okay, the rest that we have concluded our opening remarks, we will now open the call to questions. During this segment we request that our callers limit each turn in the queue to two questions. After those two questions callers may rejoin the queue with additional questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question is from Jeff Dietert from Simmons.", "Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.", "Good morning.", "Joe Gorder", "", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.", "Sure, they\u2019ll probably be a long list of these, but I wanted to start with RINs and one of the struggles I am going through is, our blenders passing through the cost of rents into the retail prices, does it vary by region, what are the major considerations with regard to whether or not these RINs cost are getting passed through to the retail well?", "Joe Gorder", "Well Jeff, this is Joe. I mean, it\u2019s a great question. We\u2019re trying to figure the same thing on ourselves. And I would tell you that we look at it on a regular basis and it\u2019s very difficult to quantify whether or not we are seeing the effect of the RINs in the cracks. ", "We think we might be able, but we\u2019re not 100% sure. I do know that if you look at our customers, there are some out there that are able to capture this and there is some that aren\u2019t and everybody is interested in somehow capturing this and the real question for us going forward is, how much of this actually gets pass through into the marketplace and how much doesn\u2019t because it\u2019s a legitimate expense for us as we have mentioned $600 million to $800 million, it\u2019s a big hit and we\u2019d like to be recapturing it, we\u2019re just not sure whether we are or not.", "Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.", "There has been press reports that have talked about blenders in the Gulf Coast reducing the price of blended gasoline in order to try to shift more gasoline sales through the blended stream rather than selling all RBOB and perhaps in the colonial pipeline and then it gets blended up in the Northeast. Have you seen evidence of this activity on the Gulf Coast? I guest the risk is, if you discount your blended gasoline, you loose the value on your traditional gasoline blended sales and I don\u2019t know how much you might be able to shift over from RBOB sales to blended sales?", "Mike Ciskowski", "", "This is Ciskowski. I\u2019m trying to get a handle on this issue, it\u2019s obviously very difficult. Joe gave you a couple of our perceptions as to the market and our estimate of costs. I guess I need to remind you that we\u2019re no longer in the retail business. So we're not focused on the street that CST Brands and our other operations. So we're a wholesaler.", "Valero is obviously trying to pass the tool where we can. We're obviously trying to recapture it where we can. Our opinion is we\u2019re getting some of it in the crack, but we're not getting all of it and now we can have a debate whether we\u2019re getting 50%, 25%, but we think we're getting some in the crack, but not all of it. And then, but having said all that Valero is going to maintain a competitive or be competitive to our wholesale branded customers where we capture the risk. And we will stay competitive and as if in fact the street and these other people are taking it on the street. We\u2019re going to be competitive to our customers \u2013 for our customers.", "Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.", "Thanks, Bill. Thanks, Jim.", "Bill Klesse", "", "Thanks, Jeff.", "", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Hey, good morning guys.", "Bill Klesse", "", "Good morning, Evan.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "First question just to follow up to kind of keep the RIN conversation moving. I know Bill, you've been front center in the RIN conversation and I read portions of your testimony in Washington last week. My question is, as you run your system do you make operating decisions based upon a fully loaded kind of RIN economic analysis of each asset. So the question is, would Valero or the industry potentially see economically induced RIN cuts based upon RIN cost and margins et cetera, particularly as you move into the seasonally weaker fourth quarter?", "Bill Klesse", "", "So that\u2019s a perspective question. Today, with the gasoline cracks where they are at the peak of the gasoline season, and we are primarily talking about gasoline.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yep.", "Bill Klesse", "Then I would say that you are not seeing it, because we have good cracks. But the part of that question was, do we include that in our economics, and the answer is yes. And so, as we look down the road, end of the fourth quarter I don\u2019t know what the world will look like, but it is turning into a cost to manufacture for our company, certainly for the independent refining segment of the industry.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And for second question on CapEx, I know this is the first time you\u2019re providing 2014 CapEx, which looks flat, [ex-] CST to 2013. Can you discuss how you think about overall CapEx levels, the new project returns versus potential share buyback and I guess this will be outside of MLP-able assets?", "Bill Klesse", "Well our goals continue to be, as I\u2019ve stated over the years, we\u2019re going to maintain a safe operation. We\u2019re going to maintain our investment grade rating. We\u2019re going to hold a little more cash. These are the things that I have continually said. We are investing in reliability. We think in this world you have to be reliable. So what the company can do to support our people in the refineries by investment we\u2019re doing.", "But then, this is a long-term capital investment business. And the marketplace has given us these opportunities because I know people are questioning methanol and you see some comments on petrochemicals. So the marketplace has given us this, given us lot of natural gas, giving us the potential from very inexpensive butanes, which obviously can be converted to gasoline, and Valero has the wherewithal, the expertise, the talented people to be able to construct and operate these type of plants. We have sustainable competitive advantages by extensions and bolt-ons to our existing assets and these are sustainable.", "So [I\u2019m] getting to be an old guy and I look at what management does, and I think part of management\u2019s job is to take our cash flow and look at our alternatives. Do we have projects that will give our shareholders value, growth, over the long-term, and if we do and we look at our stock and how we think our stock is priced, but if we do have these, then we should presume for our shareholder, and if we don\u2019t, we return cash.", "I think this management team has done a very good job at this, frankly. Over the years we bought a lot of our stock. There was a lot of stock issued in the acquisition period of Valero\u2019s history and we\u2019ve bought a lot of stock back over the years.", "We raised our dividend. We got caught by the Great Recession just like a lot of people and had to regroup. But once we got past 2009 and 2010, we\u2019ve gotten back on the same path we were on before of returning cash to the shareholder.", "We do continue to think our stock is inexpensive and we know that many of our shareholders are looking for yield anywhere they can get it. But we do think the marketplace has given us some opportunities.", "So, we match it all up. We bought in the last 2.5 years 41 million shares. We spent about $1.2 billion around share repurchases. I\u2019ll probably get criticized from a few guys because some of those shares we brought at high year prices. We raised our dividend numerous times, and I\u2019ve made comments to the investment community that when we have the hydrocrackers done, management will look at the dividend and make a recommendation to our Board. So we\u2019ve done that.", "Methanol has, actually it\u2019s gotten some feedback from some of you that are questioning that. Well, Valero is very uniquely positioned at our St. Charles refinery. We have a lot of hydrogen production capability. We can pull this syngas of these plants. We can build on ethanol plant for half of what the grassroots methanol plant can be built (inaudible) and with all the hydrogen capability of our own plants and third parties, we think we have an opportunity here to add significant shareholder value.", "So I feel strongly that this is our job and whether this or alkylation or adding some crude capacities around light sweet crudes, which we don\u2019t have at some of our plants. We certainly don\u2019t want to be buying feedstocks when I am absolutely certain. The light sweet crude is going to be very long on the Gulf Coast. These are the type of jobs I think that are clearly in our shareholders interest, but it has to be a long-term thought process because basically just about anything we are doing anymore with permitting and it now takes us four to five years. So that\u2019s kind of how we look at it.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "It\u2019s really helpful. If I just, a quick follow-up and I\u2019ll leave it there. Within 2014, I guess for CapEx, I mean the categories are spending similar to 2013 in terms of growth versus maintenance and your MLP-able EBITDA growth rate if you will?", "Joe Gorder", "", "Yes, because some of those projects we\u2019re talking about, we won\u2019t spent that much anyway. We get the railcars coming in, the logistics is still. All those projects are still significant part of that spending as next year.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. The next question comes from Robert Kessler from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co., LLC", "", "Hi. Good morning, guys. Two questions for me on transportation economics and logistics assets, one on barge traffic. Your recent presentation highlighted 20,000 barrels a day to 30,000 barrels a day in barge deliveries in the Gulf Coast. I\u2019m curious if you have any more color on the pace of increase there and from where and to where you\u2019re moving? Presumably you are moving kind of west to east. But I\u2019m curious if the volumes have picked up and what you are seeing in the market for barges on the coast, are you getting into a tight market situation there? And then, I\u2019ve got a question about railcars as well.", "Joe Gorder", "", "Yeah, Rob, this is Joe. I mean, our barge volumes have been pretty consistent. I\u2019d say if you look at everything, we are moving probably 90,000 barrels a day. We barge sweet crude into Houston. We barge sweet crude into Meraux, Memphis, receives Bakken. It will come up from St. James from barge periodically. St. Charles is receiving Cold Lake or they can heavy sour from higher crude down there and then we have a little bit of barge volume around corporate. So the major change there as far as our volumes go, okay. That\u2019s all I have there, so.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co., LLC", "Okay. Yeah, thanks for that. And if you wanted to pickup additional barges say in the spot market, your senses that would be available for you?", "Bill Klesse", "Yeah, I think in the spot market, it is a snug market, okay. I mean barges are being highly utilized and Jones Act vessels, which you could move products for crude on are very tight, and the prices have gone up on those. So there is not an abundant supply, but what we are seeing is and hearing from the barging companies is they have got so many barges under construction that we are going to find ourselves inadequate supply going forward.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co., LLC", "Okay, thanks for that. And then on the railcars, obviously the changing dynamics of this spreads of light has let\u2019s say, marginalized railcar transportation economics in the short-term, and just putting that in context with your capital program, you have previously stated plans for significant expenditures on railcar purchases, I think in fact that 850 million, it\u2019s the single largest of the spinning bucket you have outlined in your investor presentations, and I know that that\u2019s for optionality in feedstock in the like, but it sort of brings a question about the possibility of marginalized railcars sitting idle in the portfolio down the road. How do you think about that potential scenario in your overall capital budgeting process?", "Bill Klesse", "Well, there are two things I would say. You are right. The volume has come off and a lot of it has to do with what we have seen with WTI coming in so tight and that\u2019s affected it, that\u2019s going to vary. And we expect that discount will open up again. So the thing that we give with railcars is, you get tremendous optionality and where you move volumes and we are railing, we are actually railing now some bitumen down to Port Arthur, and that wasn\u2019t in our plan, but we have been able to get that and we are taking it across at commercial drop down or a commercial terminal down there.", "If we look out a little bit longer-term, Valero has over 6,000 railcars that we currently lease. We use them to move asphalt, we use them to move LPGs, what we\u2019re adding to our fleets, worst-case scenario, we would go ahead and displace these leased railcars and use the ones that we purchased.", "So we still feel good about our decision to go ahead and get these cars. I guess the fact that we have leased cars provides us a hedge on the downside, but we fully expected as these markets go back to a more normal pricing, which we expect WTI discount to go back out to $7 relative to the Gulf Coast, Bakken open up again, and I think we are going to see more normal discounts, which will put the railcars right back in the market.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co., LLC", "Understood, thanks Joe.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Doug Terreson from ISI.", "Doug T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC", "Good morning everybody.", "Ashley Smith", "Good morning Doug.", "Doug T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC", "Bill, returning to your comments few minutes ago about your meetings with Congress last week, and specifically on the renewable fuel standard, I wanted to see if you would comment on whether you feel that the industry is making progress in this area, and having its position understood, and any of the guidance for consumers, and also any updated opinion that you may have on whether changes might be ahead in this area, and also what you think there might be, just kind of a progress update on where we are headed with this?", "Bill Klesse", "Well, I think everyone on the call understands the RINs issue, and your assumptions when the 2005 and then the 2007 law were passed are very different today than before. The issue boils down to just a few things cellulosic is not available. That is not on the EPA's website, everyone says there is going to be a little cellulosic production this year, but it's totally uneconomic as well. I think it was clearly, let's pass the law and they will come, and it hasn't happened.", "The other part of the regulation that is clearly you pass part of this advanced biofuels in the sense of the ethanol fees and this, so you get cellulosic. Then the other part of it is, it encourages you or you have to buy Brazilian sugarcane ethanol or somebody sugarcane ethanol. We have a law that encourages you to import over producing domestically.", "And then on top of all of this, gasoline demand has not continued to grow. It's actually down and now flat. So the whole thing is screwed up and that's why, I said the other day it needs to be redone. And I'm supporting the industry position. I accept that. It needs to be done, redone because Valero is a little bit unique, and that we are a significant ethanol producer and we are also a significant renewable diesel producer. So we think E-10 is part of the fuel mix.", "We think E-85 is part of the fuel mix. We have no issues with renewable or bio-diesel. We think that's all fine. Some of this technology is pretty damn good. But the EPA solution of going to E-15 is not practical. There are no facilities. Even the service station people are saying they don't know about their tanks and lines. That is no, hardly any certified pumps and you have the car warranties. I understand some of the 2013 car warranties saying, it's okay, but there is a whole lot of culprits out there besides this. So the whole thing needs to be redone.", "The whole thing is basically with RINs is now, as I got quoted everywhere, it is out of control. RINs were in the preamble of the EPA\u2019s regulations that they were not going to be significant. They were there to give the industry flexibility and they give the EPA a way to monitor and now it\u2019s become a huge issue and so it just needs to be completely redone.", "So where do I think, it\u2019s going? Well, the EPA doesn\u2019t seem to be able to do anything, and so it\u2019s a White House or Congress conversation, and the only way the White House will move is they get enough political pressure frankly from consumers, because at the end of the day, the consumer is going to pay for this.", "Doug T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC", "All right.", "Bill Klesse", "And they get enough pressure from consumers or the option that you see happening, and there will be some bills introduced here is over in Congress and the House and in the Senate, where people are at least understanding that this, the basis of the law are not appropriate anymore, yet there will be some compromise, so I am optimistic.", "Doug T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC", "Okay.", "Bill Klesse", "That we are going to get something out of Congress and then the President will have to make a decision that is it backtracking or is it just fixing a problem. The earlier question is the realty, this is very unfair in the street, because you have winners and losers at retail and clearly in the refining segment, this is hurting the independent refiner, it is not hurting the majors. So you are actually hurting the independent guys. And it's that what you really want to happen, so I think we will get some congressional action, but I am not sure you're going to see anything this year.", "Doug T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC", "", "Okay, and then on methanol, I mean the outlook for that business is pretty positive for the next several years. And you\u2019ve talked about some of the rationale for the new plant, but I want to see if you elaborate on the competitive advantages, and the synergies that you referred to with some of your existing operations? And also what you guys plan to do with the product once you manufacture, I\u2019ll recognize that it\u2019s a way down. But if you can just kind of cover those that would be great?", "Bill Klesse", "So now you're jumping from the ethanol business to the petrochemicals?", "Doug T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC", "", "I am.", "Joe Gorder", "", "Ethanol to methanol?", "Doug T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC", "", "Yes.", "Bill Klesse", "", "Yeah, from ethanol and methanol, okay. Because we think on ethanol, we just think it is fuel mix and we think we have a decent business there. And our people are doing a fine job. So I remember the old saying because renewable fuel, old saying, the renewable fuels association, 'Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered'. We got a good business there and everybody corn prices are up, farmland is up, it's part of the mix, it's accepted by the consumer, so I think some balance needs to get worked into this.", "On methanol, because we have our own hydrogen plants at St. Charles, we are able to strip the sun gas before we finish and make hydrogen. We can take this sun gas, so we really don't have to build the front-end of methanol plant.", "Doug T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC", "All right.", "Bill Klesse", "And because there is a lot of supply capability and additional capability from an individual plan, when you look at the whole steam sink everything that you have around this. This is why I am saying we think that we will be able to build those plants for about half of what the grassroots plant 60% of the grass-roots plant.", "The other thing is we used to be in this business. We\u2019re in a joint venture down in Houston. We had managed our shutdown when natural gas prices were going up. Obviously it was part of the MTBE business as well and use methanol to do that. But methanol is a way to move methane in a liquid from, if you think about it. And so, we just think it\u2019s a nice little bolt-on and we\u2019ll develop it little further. But we felt it\u2019s important to get it added into our marketplace, and Valero was looking at this.", "Doug T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Paul Cheng from Barclays.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Hey, guys. Good morning. Maybe this is for Joe or may be this is for Bill. Bill, I was looking at, I\u2019m trying to understand between the difference in the ethanol business, how you invoice your customer and in terms of, say, in the reformulated gasoline, when you invoice it you will have, say, what is your charge for the alkaline and what do you charge for ethanol as the price, Bill?", "If then we really plan that much different that we can\u2019t move into the same system related to RIN. I mean that you could have two invoice if your customer want to buy the coupon reformulated gasoline including ethanol. So you will have to invoice that with the (inaudible) and then also separate item as ethanol. If they just want to buy the niche gasoline with alcohol, with our ethanol, so you have that and then you have a charge off the RIN given that every single refiner who sell to someone with our ethanol have to pay for that RIN. ", "It seems now it\u2019s just part of the parcel, possible yet. By doing in this way you have the benefit to crystallize and make it very transparent, what the consumer ultimately is paying for then, and as we say, Congress is not going to do anything until that they get the topic outlined from consumer, and perhaps we will help the process. And secondly that is also making, I think that water usage so that we'd don't get confused that these investment community that how much is being possible or not possible? So, if there are any hurdle or obstacle \u2013 why the industry and including you guys as the leader why not moving into that", "Bill Klesse", "Well, I will let Joe and Gene add to this, but remember when you blend, that's when you can separate the RIN, theoretically the RIN has no value till you blend it. Now it all of a sudden the value, and because we can't get \u2013 if you don't count the carryover from 12, because you can't get to the mandated volume, you\u2019re short of RINs in the market. So you are just short. Now I understand you're asking about a whole pricing mechanism here, but RINs have taken on the life of their own, they are a market in and of themselves now.", "And then at the rack, you have to be competitive. We sell ethanol at the market price, we sell gasoline at the market price, and so if the whole industry moves to some different pricing relationships, I'm sure you're correct, but unless the industry moves you can\u2019t capture it.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital", "That seems \u2013 yes, exactly what happened in 2005-2006, when we start moving into the ethane, there is a lot of confusion and you will never would expect to go ethanol, it\u2019s a separate item in the invoice. But by 2009, I think the only industry moved, I\u2019m just curious that you said anything stopping because everyone selling to their customer without the attachment of ethanol need to recuperating. So it seems like that is also fair because the stand that the guy that were buying the fuel, reformulated gasoline and they don\u2019t pay for the RIN?", "Joe Gorder", "Yeah, I mean Paul, Bill answered it I think correctly.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "You guys have an answer to this?", "Joe Gorder", "No, I don\u2019t have.", "Bill Klesse", "", "It\u2019s a competitive process and if you try to keep the RIN and other suppliers that\u2019s in the terminal is going to give the RIN to the customer, you are uncompetitive, so it\u2019s all got to balance out, it\u2019s a very fungible market out there, whether it would be the spot level or ethanol level.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital", "No. I understand that. What I am saying is that, you\u2019re making it crystalline and transparent for everyone to see and to know that what is that priced at they are paying and so we don\u2019t have the confusion.", "Mike Ciskowski", "Well, I think it\u2019s something we can kick around Paul, clearly we are just not there yet and we got to think through what the competitive implications are.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital", "All right. On my second question then, can you just give that the $2.5 billion, $3 billion for next year for the CapEx, is that new norm for the Company going forward, and at least for the next several years. I mean I think last year that we have been talking $1 billion, $2 billion, $2.5 billion, so is that now changed into this $2.5 billion and $3 billion and if that\u2019s the case how is that impacting in terms of your outlook on raising your recurrent dividend payout?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Well, I have never given longer term guidance than about two years out, I have said and I have thought 2014 would be in the $2.5 billion range previously and all we have done here is say, hey, it\u2019s $2.5 billion to $3 billion. So to me, we\u2019re still in the range, we are still in our budgeting for next year.", "So whether it is the new norm or not, I don\u2019t know, I think it depends on whether or not we believe we will add value through some of these discretionary projects. I have said several times that our stay-in business, when I call the whole making an agenda to business, turnaround, regulatory, all of that seems to run somewhere in the $1.6 billion to $2 billion range. And then on top of that we add this discretionary area. But your main question is, it's bout returning cash to the shareholder and I think that if we have projects that add greater value, we're going to presume and if we don't we're going to return the cash to the shareholder and I don't see that as one big change from what this management team has been doing.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.", "Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Yeah. Good morning.", "Joe Gorder", "", "Good morning, Roger.", "Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "I guess may be just to change the subject a little bit. Light-heavies obviously had an impact on Q2. Can you help us understand as we're looking at Q3 where if you measure by LLS, light-heavy spread is pretty attractive. If you measure it by Brent WTI not so much, kind of what you're seeing move out there and what do you think really will sort of drive the market here over the next or let's just say, through year-end in terms of the most important marker on the light side of that argument?", "Joe Gorder", "You mean which would be more important like a Brent or an LLS or TI?", "Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Yeah and maybe how LLS fits in, in terms of driving the Gulf Coast market there.", "Joe Gorder", "Right, so Roger, if we think about what's happened in this quarter, we obviously we had Brent WTI coming in a material way. We saw LLS move out and get priced at a more significant premium to Brent. I mean a lot of that has to do with the simple fact that, if we ended up being shorter in the Gulf Coast on light sweet crudes, than perhaps the market anticipated. And we\u2019ve said all along that the pricing of sweet crudes in the Gulf is going to be dependent on the quantity of domestic crude that\u2019s there, and we saw that we did have a bit of short supply, and there is a host of reasons for it. I mean, we had Syncrude outages in Canada that reduced the volume.", "We got BP Whiting still running light sweet crude, which has supported Bakken prices at Clearbrook. Bakken is pricing up in the field, that\u2019s an LLS plus transportation or adjusted for transportation, which is making it expensive. But it\u2019s expensive because it was in tight supply.", "So I think as we look forward into the third and the fourth quarters of this year. We are going to have more takeaway capacity out of Cushing and out of the Permian is going to bring those barrels to the Gulf, okay. I think that you will see more volume coming on-stream and moving into Cushing, so the inventory droughts that we saw will probably stabilize here a little bit. And so what\u2019s that due to the overall crude markets, well, I think you\u2019re going to see the light sweets, I mean our view is that LLS will trade down, and we will trade at a discount to Brent.", "Longer term I think we\u2019ll see the WTI spread back out to maybe a $6 to $8 discount. And I think we will see the medium sours will adjust and priced themselves into the refinery. And then we\u2019re getting some relief on the heavy sour discounts now, the Mexicans have adjusted the K factors aggressively as they can over the last several months, and they have adjusted a $1.90 and that will take affect on August 1, which will increase the discounts on the Maya, which effects of course all the other heavy sours.", "So I think as we look at the, we saw all the discounts on crude come in, in the second quarter. I think we\u2019re going to see them start to move back out in the third and the fourth quarters.", "Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And the unrelated second question, probably more for you, Bill, getting back to the CapEx versus dividend versus share repo evaluation, what are the rough returns you are looking for or what are the various ways you analyze what makes the most sense for Valero to do at a given moment in terms of investing in the methanol plant versus, say, a more aggressive share repo program or accelerated, maybe I should say rather than aggressive?", "", "Bill Klesse", "Well, so many of these plants are bolt-ons or extensions of our business. Because you\u2019re capitalizing on the whole refinery that\u2019s already there, these returns all are north of 25%, on all of them. These are IRRs. So, and we get into a huge conversation here, what is our cost of equity and I\u2019ve even had it with a lot of you that are on the call, and so we look at it and we try to balance and what you\u2019ve really seen with his management team and I keep going back to this is we\u2019ve bought our shares every single year that we\u2019ve been of this as part of this management except 2009 and 2010. And the other component here is next year we only have $200 million of debt that matures and year after that we only have $500 million of debt that matures. So we also see that we have ample cash flow coming out as well.", "So, I think some of these projects are very good returns. We look at that. We look at where our equity is priced. It\u2019s obviously down from where it was and don\u2019t forget we spot out for the shareholders of CST as well. So I think we\u2019re very shareholder focused here. The only caveat I really stick on is it\u2019s long-term. You got to think we\u2019re looking at long-term shareholder value, not tomorrow afternoon.", "Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Bill Klesse", "", "And we want a dividend that sustains, that we can sustain.", "Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. So when you are looking at the share repos, not necessarily \u2013 it\u2019s more a free cash flow driven than it is a return analysis, summing in other words, you are not going to worry so much about the share price at a given moment as you are, that\u2019s part of what you are doing or is it more to within that?", "Bill Klesse", "That would be correct. Back couple of years ago, we made a decision. We weren\u2019t going to buy any refineries, because we thought they were too high priced and we turned around and had a very significant share repurchase. So, yes, we have free cash flow. We have enough cash where we said our cash position is solid. We are going to maintain this investment grade rating. Then, yes, we are going to return the cash to the shareholder.", "Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, fellows. Good morning. Bill, maybe I could just change talk again a little bit to the MLP. I know you\u2019ve kind of suggested now that you are probably moving forward here, but you spoke to this $50 million to $100 million of EBITDA, but as we look through your presentation, but there was a fair amount of MLP related expenditures. So can you help us a little bit with how you see this scale about EBITDA ultimately and what the kind of timeline is to get there?", "Bill Klesse", "Well, we have said and I think this was 2012 assets kind of where we had $50 million to $100 million of EBITDA and that\u2019s probably the range of where we\u2019re looking to go out initially. And as, Mike Ciskowski running this project for us here and he tells many that getting everything done, this is probably a first quarter of 2014 projects subject to of course our Board. And then, so we\u2019re doing all of that.", "Obviously we\u2019re adding a lot of projects, pipelines, railcars, terminal enhancements, so rail facilities to unload and all of these assets are MLP-able. What we have said is our focus would be in the sense of a terminaling and distribution MLP, because some people has asked us about other assets and we said, well, our focus is more there. But obviously we have put many more potential dropdowns going forward.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Then you want to be drawing in a number, Bill, but just to keep it contacts. Obviously you\u2019re spending about $1.7 billion over the next, it says five years in the presentation, but it is really five years or is that a little quicker than that?", "Bill Klesse", "", "It will be quicker than that.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great stuff. We can figure it out from there. Last one from me though is to go back to the RIN question and it\u2019s really, just on your guidance that you gave for the full year. If I\u2019m not mistaken you\u2019d talked to the $500 million to $750 million before, but RIN prices were like $0.75. Now they\u2019re up 60% from there and you\u2019re barely above the top end of that range in your guidance. Can you help us understand why we\u2019re not getting kind of proratable impact and it sounds like there will not be a lot of change in your cost even though the RIN cost has doubled, and I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.", "Bill Klesse", "Well, part of it has to do with where we bought these RINs and our position in the whole process, plus there is assumptions in our numbers as to export volumes, how much we\u2019re capturing and all of that. So that\u2019s based in there as well. But this is the range that we\u2019re operating in now, $600 million to $800 million, but clearly if it\u2019s $1.50 a RIN, we\u2019re at the high end of the range. So, but we\u2019re only in July.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Right, but what I\u2019m trying to figure out is that, your previous range where the high end was $750 million and the RIN price was $0.75. Now the RIN price is about $0.36 and your high end is only up $50 million. So why only such a modest increase?", "Bill Klesse", "Well, obviously at the high end, I had a range of [$0.04] I mean, I was probably at the low end. So I think you just have to accept that we\u2019re not misleading you. This is how we are viewing it. You guys are asking us for guidance and I\u2019m saying to you, okay, $1.36. I always use $1.48 or something, but these higher numbers will be at the high side of our range. It has to do with our position as to when we bought a lot of these. So there is a serious timing component and volunteer.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So this is for 2013. Does it change the markets in 2014? Does it change significantly?", "Bill Klesse", "Absolutely, it will change. Remember when we first started this, they were $0.75, and in January or February they were still $0.05 and then they started moving up. They went to $1. They pulled back to $0.60, $0.70. Then they got back. But next year it would be a much larger number at $1.50 a RIN.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "", "Right.", "Bill Klesse", "We\u2019ll get into the conversation, well, how much a RIN is going to be in 2014, because you\u2019re totally unfeasible.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "All right. Okay. I\u2019ll leave it there, Bill.", "Bill Klesse", "No, seriously because you have the carryover from 2012. So that\u2019s the big debate this year, but you\u2019re going to have to carry from 2013 into 2014. You can carry in 20%, but there are going to be enough rooms around. So all the way it\u2019s totally not feasible next year.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "All right, Bill. Thanks a lot. Appreciate that.", "Operator", "Thank you. The question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.", "Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Bill Klesse", "Hello, Paul.", "Joe Gorder", "", "Good morning, Paul.", "Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Howdy. Thanks, well, for the CapEx guidance, early CapEx guidance. We appreciate that. Bill, you mentioned really part of my question, which was the $1.6 billion to $2 billion that you have the ongoing stay-in business CapEx.", "Bill Klesse", "So our DD&A is running on about $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, at $1.7 billion, and I think it\u2019s very unrealistic to assume we don\u2019t have to spend DD&A or maintain our assets.", "Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Let\u2019s see. I mean effectively one way of looking at this has even effectively doubled your growth CapEx at the margin, but we\u2019re coming of two huge projects in the past year or so that have come online. I\u2019m just wondering what the components are of the new relatively high number for growth CapEx. Could you list the biggest on several projects that you\u2019re going to be investing in? Thanks.", "Joe Gorder", "", "Yeah, Paul, the best guidance we can provide right now about those details would be on slide 19 of our latest IR presentation, which we presented earlier this month and that\u2019s focused on 2013, but the 2014 details are largely in line with that. As we get later in 2013 and we complete our strategic planning process, we\u2019ll be able to hung that and give you the specific chunks, but it\u2019s very similar. We also have specific continuation of spending on existing processes or existing projects. And keep in mind, as Bill said earlier, they\u2019re long-term projects. I know it takes you guys a second to update your model, but it actually take years to get permit and construction and do all these things and to spend the money.", "So, in order to achieve the returns Bill talked about earlier, it does take some time and that\u2019s why there\u2019s generally going to be continuation of existing projects.", "Bill Klesse", "", "And then on slide 32, in that same hand out we gave a little EBITDAs with some of the projects as well, okay. So if you can teach together how we\u2019re looking at them.", "Joe Gorder", "", "We\u2019ll update that later this year as we go through our planning process and complete that.", "Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "I think that you\u2019re referring to Deutsche Bank models. By the way they\u2019re actually with Deutsche \u2013 you\u2019re looking for from a planning. So thinking about how you decide on these investments, I\u2019m looking at your cash flows that are low in 2009 of little bit under $2 billion, maybe last year $5 billion. Is that how we think about it, and we\u2019ve been asking this question in various ways on this call obviously, but I\u2019m just wondering another way of looking at this is that you\u2019ve doubled your \u2013 effectively doubled your growth CapEx to the margin against the expectations. You could have effectively doubled your free cash flow, especially in a high risk RINs environment. I\u2019m just trying to drill down into why you\u2019re spending so much money basically. Thanks.", "Bill Klesse", "", "Well, if you look at the logistics capital, it's kind of being intact, so in place and I'll just try to add clarity here the place where I'm sure some of you guys are wrestling with is in this whole petrochemical methanol area, and our view is that the marketplace is giving companies like us a huge opportunity that add a lot of value for our shareholder. We expect low cost natural gas, that's why the hydrocrackers looks so good.", "Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thank you. For the years, you are assuming Bill that $4?", "Bill Klesse", "", "No, that\u2019s up $5. We think the number needs to be a little higher long-term, so that the drilling industry can make a reasonable return. There seems to be a debate sub four, how much return you\u2019re getting, but if you get into the $5 range, we believe they can make a return, no. You guys would know more about that I suppose than us.", "But then you look at the butane is coming, here we have alkylation units within our refineries right now. These things just look like something where Valero and its shareholders can really benefit.", "Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah I get.", "Bill Klesse", "So we\u2019re studying it and we're getting it out there, so at least you guys know these are the things that we are looking at.", "Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Can you give us a sense of how much more light sweet crude you think you will be able to run, let's say, by the end of 14?", "Bill Klesse", "Yeah, well, actually can, because we our projects weren\u2019t quite be done.", "Mike Ciskowski", "Yeah, by 14 not a whole lot more, it's not till these the toppers have done in early 2015 that would be able to increase those. And those I think\u2026", "Bill Klesse", "Go back and 14.", "Mike Ciskowski", "Yeah but if you\u2019re really talking \u2013 it\u2019s not until 2015 conversation. But if you take the Houston plant, it is 70, down in Corpus it\u2019s 90, we\u2019re looking at Port Arthur where we have a ideal crude tower. Our excess crude tower in excess basin tower is probably 50,000 to 75,000 and we\u2019re something \u2013 Quebec is already a sweet crude refinery but we\u2019ll be subbing in North American crude more and more as we go through time. And then at Meraux, we\u2019ll be running more liner crude there as well. So (inaudible) price et cetera significant, then we have these little change or add this deal here and repipe this project that\u2019s going on too. But as you \u2013 he\u2019ll give you numbers.", "Joe Gorder", "", "It\u2019s 160,000 barrels a day.", "Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "", "For those two?", "Joe Gorder", "", "For those two.", "Bill Klesse", "", "My counting then the other one that I just said, so we\u2019ll pick up another 50 to 100 to Port Arthur and Meraux.", "Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "", "Okay. So in closing from me, end 2015, how much more slight sweet would be if you like a substitution and how much more would be incremental throughput in what throttle. And I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.", "Bill Klesse", "Some with all the incremental throughput, so as incremental throughput backing others our feedstock purchases. So remember we buy Algerian Resides, a lot of those that we bring directly into our units, we bring some other of these feedstocks in that basically go to the cads and instead we\u2019ll be making a lot of our own gas oil.", "Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "", "Okay. Is all incremental replacement, a bit confused? Is the (inaudible) capacity is higher or lower?", "Bill Klesse", "", "The overall crude capacity will be higher per share.", "Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "I know that.", "Bill Klesse", "Not our throughput capacity.", "Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Got you. Okay. That's great. And so...", "Bill Klesse", "Remember we run today, I guess officially we'd say we're 2.3 million barrels to 2.4 million barrels a day of crude, but we\u2019re 2.8 million barrels to 2.9 million barrels of throughput, because we're buying these other items.", "Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah. And I don't want to take up the whole call, but that's very helpful, and I will come back potentially with more. Thanks a lot.", "Bill Klesse", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Arjun Murti from Goldman Sachs.", "Arjun N. Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you, and sorry for another follow-up on the RINs, but if you look at the 2014 and I agree with your comments and how unworkable the RFS looks, can you talk about to what degree you guys can crack up your exports to help offset some of your RIN obligation next year relative to what you might be doing this year?", "", "Bill Klesse", "", "Well, it depends on the cost of the RIN. So you have to have a basic crack. So sooner we'll have a basic crack that says, hey, it's profitable to make those barrels. Then you have if RINs are $1.50, technically you have $0.15 a gallon here that you're playing around with. So you can be very competitive going in export versus the U.S. market, as far as ramping up.", "Joe Gorder", "Ramping up the exports.", "Arjun N. Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I mean if the industry is basically out of RINs next year and you guys are on the coast who do have export capability, I mean again Congress is going to have to take actions at some point here, but in the absence of that it seems like you could have a very, very high RIN price well above where you are today.", "No one wants to shut in their unit, which I guess is the other way to not have a RIN obligation, it would seem like exports is one of the outlets and you guys would seem to have the better position to do that, but just trying to kind of see if we can frame how much you could reduce your volume metric RIN obligation next year, if it\u2019s whatever the right phasing is very, very high RIN price, much higher than where we are right now.", "Joe Gorder", "All right, so Arjun, let\u2019s assume that the markets out there for the barrels to be exported, okay, and as the Arabs support the exporting and just as an example, we exported 70,000 barrels a day of gasoline. In the second quarter we exported 170,000 barrels a day of diesel. Now those numbers are what they are because we optimize the supply into the marketplace. We had a very strong market to add to because, yeah, Joliet turnaround, and Whiting turnaround, I think we\u2019re down and so we\u2019re able to move barrels to that higher market.", "Barring that and saying that the market was demanding the barrels abroad, we could go to 225,000 barrels a day of gasoline and 280,000 barrels a day of diesel and then the projects that we\u2019ve gotten underway to improve docks and tankage and segregations at the refineries would allow us to take it up beyond that going forward, particularly with the same trial hydrocarbon coming on and the quality of the diesel fuels that we\u2019re getting out of St. Charles and Port Arthur. So there is capacity.", "Bill Klesse", "", "I think Joe is giving you a capacity conversation and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic because the industry is in the same boat and so yes, we are on the Gulf Coast and we have that capability, but so like other people and you get down to the basic, you got to have the basic racks. So yes, the way you\u2019ve phrased your question, Joe answered you, yeah, we would have capability. Yes, we are on the Gulf Coast, so we could do that, but I would not want lead you down a path that this would be a significant solution for us. I don\u2019t think so.", "Arjun N. Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I appreciate, yeah, go ahead.", "Gene Edwards", "It\u2019s Gene, I would just add to those that both of these solutions there, exporting more ore reducing refinery runs, reduce supply, so to Maya really doesn\u2019t go down, which we don\u2019t think in the next year. We got to meet demand, but still to me it\u2019s definitely got new price in the cracks on the U.S. basis and maybe lower basis for exported barrels.", "Arjun N. Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "No. That to me would be the mechanism right by which you then get the true pass through, especially if the U.S. economy recovery and the demand is there, do you guys either supply less, which I don\u2019t think you do, but potentially export more, it\u2019s clearly a mechanism to get the pass through, but I appreciate your counter and the answer, thank you so much.", "Operator", "The next question is from Edward Westlake from Credit Suisse.", "Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC", "Hey good morning, yeah there are obviously a lot going on in refining, lots of questions. I guess the 2Q Gulf Coast was probably the weakest absolute number that we\u2019ve seen for a long time. I guess despite the first hydrocracker, and that\u2019s also despite, there is some cheap Eagle Ford coming into the Corpus. Clearly light heavy is weak, but is there anything else material going on that we should focus on, and I guess if not and it\u2019s like heavy expands again overtime, you should go back to a more normal capture?", "Ashley Smith", "Yeah, that\u2019s it. I mean, when you are referring to light-heavy either you are talking about really kind of the sour crudes versus the sweeter crudes in general?", "Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC", "Yes.", "Ashley Smith", "Because, they were \u2013 you are right. The discounts at all of those crudes relative to the sweet crudes were off and we should just like, we ran about the same amount of heavy sour crude. Core Q2 2012 versus Q2 2013, we ran quite a lot less medium sour though, because it tended to be just out of the market. Now, on the heavy sour side, we don\u2019t provide all of our heavy sour for example, Maya so we had some advantages there. But I don\u2019t know of anything else overlaying, I don\u2019t know of anything else going on in the Gulf other than that.", "Joe Gorder", "Well, we make a lot of other products and they are all moving around, but if you take our poor relative refining which is a very (inaudible) Maya crude oils, it did very poorly in the second quarter.", "Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Joe Gorder", "Even with its new hydrocracker.", "Bill Klesse", "Yeah, and that\u2026", "Joe Gorder", "Okay, due to the pricing of Maya. So you can see that have a huge impact.", "Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC", "And then a second question, more broader around the Texas market I guess, I mean you\u2019ve got the Eagle Ford growing some decent Permian well results. Recently you\u2019ve got two major pipelines probably more coming down into Texas. I mean, do you think there is a limit on the effective capacity of the industries to move those barrels over to Louisiana or earlier you spoke about there being enough barges, but it feels like there is a lot of volume and it could cause some stress, any color on that would be helpful.", "Joe Gorder", "Well, I think as the volume comes into Houston eventually here it\u2019s got to move east. And so you\u2019re going to have shales pipeline running, which have the very high tariff, which is a lot higher than barges. So I think you\u2019re going to see the barges, you\u2019re going to see assets come into play here. Of course it\u2019s got to move. It\u2019s got to move along the coasts, and one of our competitors have signed a deal to take to ship it up to the East Coast by water as well. And so you\u2019re going to see it moving and to us Houston is going to be the bulk of quite of all in this.", "Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC", "And I mean in terms, I mean obviously does any limit how much light you can run I guess moves across, but as you talk to your major suppliers, I\u2019m thinking Mexicans obviously those mediums coming over from the Middle East. How do you think they're going to respond to the fact that not just yourselves, but the whole industry on the Gulf is going to probably looking for less of their products.", "Bill Klesse", "Well, it remains to be seen and there will be political considerations as well, because I mean Valero, we buy from the Persian Gulf suppliers. And they have a stake in this market, and their crude is more medium than this light that we are talking about, but this isn't today's issue and it\u2019s probably not tomorrows\u2019. This is probably a 2015, 2016 conversation, but over time the U.S. is going to have a lot more oil on the Gulf Coast than I think the refining industry got to figure out how to run it.", "Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC", "Thank you. That's very clear.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Faisel Kahn from Citigroup.", "Faisel Kahn \u2013 Citigroup", "Hi, good morning, it's Faisel from Citi.", "Ashley Smith", "Hey Faisel.", "Faisel Kahn \u2013 Citigroup", "Hey, Ashley. Just another ethanol question, I guess how difficult would it be for you guys to increase your blending capability, and I know you sell a certain amount of merchant volumes, and you blend some of your volumes, but how difficult will it be to increase your blending capability given your natural supply of ethanol here and your production of gasoline?", "Joe Gorder", "Well Faisel we are looking at increasing it everywhere we can as you would expect and for example, with the Diamond Green project, we're going to have a lot of renewable diesel that we can blend it to the pool. But we're looking at every asset we have, and if it requires some modest investment to increase the blending capabilities there, we're going to do it. And but generally said, I mean we just don\u2019t have access to the terminal assets to control blending up all the products that we produce. We are a merchant refiner, and we sell a lot at the plants of the refinery and we just don\u2019t have the opportunity to blend that up.", "Faisel Kahn \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, understood.", "Mike Ciskowski", "So we are blending where we can and diesel side is what Joe is talking about more, because we have a customer base here.", "Faisel Kahn \u2013 Citigroup", "Sure.", "Mike Ciskowski", "And the customer base goes into a terminal, I mean everybody sees I guess somebody said the $1.36 RIN. So I mean it\u2019s a matter of customers as well. So where we can we have added facilities where we are blending, but clearly the marketplace is in disarray because the wholesale racks theoretically anyway you got all these different prices now.", "Faisel Kahn \u2013 Citigroup", "All right, fair enough.", "Mike Ciskowski", "We are trying to minimize, if the question is that you are trying to do things to minimize your exposure, the answer is absolutely.", "Faisel Kahn \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, got it. And then just last question from me and the call is being going on for a while. On the potential investments in natural gas liquids and also alkylate sort of investments, can you talk a little bit and little more granularity and kind of where, what type of assets you are looking at building and where you are looking to doing that, is it fractionation and where would it be and also on the alkylate side, where are you looking to increase your production of alkylate?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Well, so it\u2019s not fractionation per se. We don\u2019t think I answered this on the last call, last April. I don\u2019t think we add value per se just to build the fractionator. But where Valero, we don\u2019t really have a competitive advantage over some of these guys like enterprise for instance, you can come in and build fractionator, but what we do, do is, we have alkylation units in all our refineries, alkylates are great blend stock. ", "When you look at how we make gasoline, gasoline, gasoline\u2019s are Brent. If you remember that it\u2019s made up of all these different components, and so as we look at our system. We have, we believe we\u2019re going to very inexpensive butane subsequent to last, we have spend the last 10 years of our maybe 15 years of our careers, we\u2019re moving butanes from gasoline. And the one way you can stick butane back into gasoline is by alkylating it, or making a longer carbon chain.", "And so, as we see normals coming and converting them to butylene and you see cheap or inexpensive isobutane. There is we just think this is a good option in a refinery to be able to increase that the amount of that blend stock.", "Faisel Kahn \u2013 Citigroup", "It make sense within how, when where do you do that? And how are you, I mean what are the magnitude of investments, you make to kind of increase that capability?", "Bill Klesse", "Well these alkylate units would be $200 million, $300 million and all the sulfuric acid Valero would not build the new HF Alky and as we look at our system there would be on the Gulf Coast.", "Faisel Kahn \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, understood. Thank you.", "Bill Klesse", "With one possible exception, for a different reason.", "Faisel Kahn \u2013 Citigroup", "Got it, thanks guys I appreciate the time.", "Ashley Smith", "Sure, thanks Faisel.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital.", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Great.", "Bill Klesse", "Hi, Chi Chow.", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Hello, hi Bill. How are you doing? I think you noticed this, hey just sorry to keep pound as the main issue, but Mike, can you tell us how the accounting works on your RIN purchase and how exactly that flow to your P&L.", "Mike Ciskowski", "Our accounting is based on whatever our RINs deficit is and we amortize them. We purchase forward, we have been purchasing a number of contracts and we amortize that cost in as a deficit basically created.", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "", "Okay, great. And is that split by region as far as where that amortization goes in the cost of good.", "Mike Ciskowski", "From a regional standpoint, we allocate all of that based on throughput basis to the regions.", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Okay. So split in each region by throughput.", "Mike Ciskowski", "Correct.", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Okay. Got it. Thanks on that. And Bill, I just want to clarify, I think you mentioned on one of the other questions, the $600 million to $800 million on the 2013 cost, is that a net number net of some sort of pass through assumption?", "Bill Klesse", "No, that\u2019s not a net number. That\u2019s just what the deficit would cost us.", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Okay. Okay, good. Thanks for that. And I guess, final question on rail movements. How do you think this Quebec railcar accident is going to impact crude by rail going forward? Is they going to be more regulation costs? Any thoughts on that?", "Mike Ciskowski", "So this is Ciskowski. I don\u2019t think it will impact in the sense of the extremes. I do think that you\u2019re not going to see one person trains anymore. You are not going to see trains less sitting on the siding, full of products. I think it\u2019s just one of those areas that people just hadn\u2019t focused on and this is a very tragic accident and I mean, we all understand that.", "So I think you're going to see more of the procedures. You\u2019re going to see a very strong review of procedures. I think you will see the cooperation increased in North America here between Canada and the U.S. on regulation on \u2013 maybe on tank car design. You will see more on these bonnets beeping them up. I think also you'll have a conversation that will pull the Mexicans into this as well. But rail and crude, railing ethanol, railing distillers grain, railing corn, railing asphalt, propanes, they're all here. They are part of the distribution system. But there will be procedural things that will change. I mean this train was left below. I don't think you're going to be leaving a train on the side with nobody there anymore.", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Yeah. Sure. Not going forward.", "Bill Klesse", "But those kind of things will take a little time, but to me that's rare. We'll see more procedures and maybe it's in the operating area.", "", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "You mentioned maybe changes in tank car design. Does that impact your deliveries at all going forward on your railcars?", "Bill Klesse", "That would not because there is no change in that, right?", "", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Right.", "Bill Klesse", "", "And then, if it is we operate a very \u2013 we strive all the time for safety and reliability and at some times we take a look at it.", "", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "All right. Okay. Thanks, Bill. I appreciate it.", "Bill Klesse", "", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Allen Good from Morningstar.", "Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar Research", "Good morning. Just a question on the chemical investment follow-up. You mentioned some of the characteristics around St. Charles that made it attractive. When you look around your system, maybe what are some of the other opportunities you think for additional chemical investments. And if you do identify those, would you be willing to move forward with maybe several of these similar size investments at the same time.", "Bill Klesse", "Well it is a very fair question and we are looking at this because the market place is changing so quickly because I am of the belief that United States can have a huge manufacturing and petrochemical resurgence here, our government will figure out how to get behind. But we\u2019ve looked at the Gulf Coast plans, there are in the sense of our crown jewel assets. They give you access to the water, because some products would be exported. Remember Valero was already in the benching time with xylene business. We\u2019re already in the propylene business. So we\u2019re in a lot of these businesses anyway, and so we are just talking about (inaudible), but they\u2019d be along the Gulf Coast.", "And would we take on several projects at the same time? Sure, we have the capability as the other companies do, they match projects in the capital spend level that we\u2019ve guided you.", "Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar Research", "Okay, thanks. And I guess the second question is, early you mentioned that you expect some of these crude differentials that have narrowed in the first half of the year to widen back out. Well, this year, looking at your most recent presentation you have small lift here of rail and barge projects that you anticipate to come online later this year moving, (inaudible) crude in the Gulf Coast, West Coast and North Atlanta region.", "If we\u2019re at the same situation here as far as differentials are concerned, I guess mainly being the brand, as we get into the third and fourth quarter where it\u2019s basically no differential, would you still expect some of those rail projects to come on line and start delivering some of that crude via rail or would you delay that in the next year and to may be give some more widening into this spread?", "Bill Klesse", "Yeah, it would absolutely depend on some of our deals. But yeah, hey we\u2019re in business to make money and if it\u2019s not economic to do some, we may have some fees we have to pay a few guys, but and where we have to take it, well we\u2019ll have to do it, make the best of it. But we try very hard to maintain optionality on these deals. I\u2019m sure, if you don\u2019t have any spreads, you\u2019re going to optimize.", "Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar Research", "", "Is there really general, that we have Brent spread or any other source spread we could use just may be a rule of thumb to see whether there some of these rail projects in general are economical for you?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Well, in the back of our handout, we have that big map where we made this price call it 12 to 18 months and we said, New York Harbor is where we see the equilibrium point between Brent and delivered sweet crudes into the harbor. So you take Brent plus a couple of bucks for freight, and so we\u2019ve been saying that\u2019s where a lot of these balances run these costs. And then you back up from there, and so we think overtime, you\u2019re going to have these differentials, because the crudes got to move to the markets and it\u2019s got to displace the foreign barrels.", "So \u2013 but sure you\u2019re going to have a spot month or two of what\u2019s going on right now, but we don\u2019t believe they\u2019re going to last. So we\u2019re in business for the long term.", "Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar Research", "", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Mike Ciskowski", "In our appendix it\u2019s in there, we put all those numbers in there, and so I think we say 12 to 24 months is our price outlook. But the basis is the East Coast being equilibrium. So Gulf Coast, we think that LLS is several dollars below that.", "Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar Research", "", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, guys. Just real quick question, Bill, I know that you may not want to give us an absolute number, but what is the percent of your rail arrangement with the rail operator, is I think will pay for the long-term or what percentage is that like 30 day roll over kind of deal?", "Bill Klesse", "I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s, I don\u2019t want to give it to you. I am not sure we know\u2026", "Joe Gorder", "No, we don\u2019t have\u2026", "Bill Klesse", "", "I think we have loading fees. Well I think here we just, we\u2019ll give Ashley a couple, we\u2019ll gets and puts up together. The railroad, we own the cars, so Joe\u2019s point is, hey you don\u2019t have that. But the right reason I was hesitant on the previous question is we make some commitments the load cars at these third-party loadings at our own refineries, at our facilities, so there are no obligation. But we do have some fee commitments below then a couple of things like that, purchases of oil. So we will put some thing together, but it\u2019s very, it\u2019s relatively small, but we have a, once we get all our railcars, we will have a $750 million investment in railcars, and a couple other 100 million in sidings. So we want to return to.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Secondly that on the (inaudible) and also the Seaway one and two can you give us some rough idea there what is your (inaudible) commitment on those?", "Joe Gorder", "", "Yeah, Paul, we don\u2019t do that.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Final one, Bill, when we\u2019re looking at your dividend policy when the Board [give out] whether you are going to increase or not, is there a policy from management that this is a annual exercise or it is a semi-annual or that\u2019s really no policy at all?", "Bill Klesse", "Well, I\u2019d like to \u2013 went away and phrase your question, no policy at all.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "No, I mean, you made\u2026", "", "Bill Klesse", "I think we are little better than that. We\u2019ve raised our dividend in January and I said that we would look at it and management would have a recommendation. We have it at our Board meeting this month after we finish the hydrocrackers, but we will look at our balance. We\u2019ll look at our forecast. We\u2019ll look at our payout rate. I have said that Valero wants to be among the highest in dividends and returning cash to our shareholder of our peer group and so we look at those guys as well.", "So I feel like there is more of a process, but we don\u2019t say the July Board Meeting is a dividend meeting. It is a dividend meeting with the Board, but we don\u2019t say management is going to raise the dividend or some at the January meeting or the April meeting or the July. We go into it with us having looked at our forecast where we think our cash is, do we think we can sustain it, and then we make a recommendation to the Board.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Ashley Smith", "", "Thanks, Paul.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have no further question.", "Ashley Smith", "Okay. Thank you, Lorissa, and I just want to thank everyone for listening to our call today.

My name is Chris, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ashley Smith. Ashley, you may begin.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Thanks, Chris, and good morning. With me today are Bill Klesse, our Chairman and CEO; Joe Gorder, President and COO; Mike Ciskowski, our CFO; Gene Edwards, our Chief Development Officer; and several other members of Valero's senior management team.", "If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact me after the call.", "Before we get started, I'd like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.", "Okay. As noted in the release, we reported third quarter 2013 earnings of $312 million or $0.57 per share compared to adjusted earnings of $1.1 billion or $1.90 per share in the third quarter of 2012. Without the adjustments noted in the release, our reported earnings for the third quarter of 2012 were $674 million or $1.21 per share.", "Operating income was $532 million compared to $1.3 billion of operating income in the third quarter of 2012 or $1.7 billion when adjusted for the items noted in the release. The decrease was mainly due to lower refining margins across all of our refining operating regions.", "Our third quarter 2013 refining throughput margin of $7.76 per barrel declined more than $5 per barrel versus the third quarter 2012 margin of $13.12 per barrel. The decrease was primarily due to significantly lower gasoline and lower diesel margins. For example, the Gulf Coast gasoline margin on Brent crude fell 57% from $9.33 per barrel in the third quarter of 2012 to $3.97 per barrel in the third quarter of 2013, while the Gulf Coast diesel margin dropped by $2.74 per barrel or 14% to $16.86 per barrel.", "Despite the decline, diesel margins were still quite strong in the third quarter of 2013. To capture these strong margins, Valero increased its distillates production by 16% to 1,047,000 barrels per day, which also represented an increase in the percentage yield of distillates versus the third quarter of 2012. This favorable yield shift is mainly attributed to the operation of new hydrocrackers at Port Arthur and St. Charles.", "Now, also contributing to the lower refining throughput margins were narrower discounts relative to Brent crude oil for light sweet, medium and heavy sour crudes. For a light sweet crude example, the WTI discount fell sharply by $13.44 per barrel from $17.30 per barrel in the third quarter of 2012 to $3.86 per barrel in the third quarter of 2013. Additionally, light sweet crude on the Gulf Coast was more expensive, with the premium for LLS crude relative to Brent higher by $0.66 per barrel in the third quarter of 2013 versus the third quarter of 2012. Heavy sour crude oil discounts also narrowed, with the Maya crude discount, $1.68 per barrel smaller in the third quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter of 2012. In the fourth quarter, crude oil discounts to Brent have improved versus the third quarter. WTI discounts have widened by $4.46 per barrel, and LLS has improved by $6.46 per barrel, going from a premium to a discount versus Brent. Also, the Maya heavy sour discount has widened by $6.14 per barrel since the third quarter.", "So refining throughput margins were also negatively impacted in the third quarter of 2013 by the higher costs of Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, needed to comply with the U.S. federal Renewable Fuel Standard. The reported compliance costs were $185 million in the third quarter of 2013 versus $70 million in the third quarter of 2012. Given the recent drop in RINs prices, following news of the EPA's potentially favorable revisions to the 2014 renewable volume obligation, we have reduced our estimated cost for complying with the Renewable Fuel Standard to a range of $500 million to $600 million for the full year 2013.", "Our third quarter 2013 refining throughput volumes averaged 2.8 million barrels per day for an increase of 172,000 barrels per day from the third quarter of 2012. Refining throughput volumes were higher due to fewer unplanned refinery and maintenance events and less weather-related downtime. You may recall that Hurricane Isaac negatively impacted operating rates at our Louisiana refineries in the third quarter of 2012.", "Refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter of 2013 were $3.74 per barrel, similar to the third quarter of 2012. Although natural gas prices increased year-over-year, our higher throughput volumes in the third quarter of 2013 favorably offset the higher energy costs per barrel.", "Our ethanol segment reported operating income of $113 million in the third quarter of 2013, an increase of $186 million from the third quarter of 2012, mainly due to higher gross margins per gallon and higher production volumes. Production averaged 3.4 million gallons per day in the third quarter of 2013 for an increase of 992,000 gallons per day compared to the third quarter of 2012. We increased our ethanol production to capture the higher gross margins available to us.", "In the third quarter of 2013, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $170 million.", "Net interest expense was $102 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense was $448 million.", "The effective tax rate was 27.5%, which was lower than guidance, primarily due to an adjustment in deferred taxes as a result of a U.K. tax law change.", "Regarding cash flows in the third quarter of 2013, capital expenditures were $557 million, including $78 million for turnarounds and catalyst. We returned $151 million in cash to our stockholders by paying $122 million in dividends and by purchasing approximately 800,000 shares of Valero common stock for $29 million. We ended the third quarter with approximately $3 billion remaining under our stock purchase authorizations. Subsequent to the third quarter, we bought approximately 2.6 million shares of Valero common stock for approximately $90 million. This brings our total year-to-date stock purchases to almost 17 million shares for a total of $675 million.", "With respect to our balance sheet at the end of the quarter, cash was $1.9 billion, total debt was $6.6 billion, our debt to capitalization ratio net of cash was 20.2%, and we had over $5.0 billion of available liquidity in addition to cash.", "We maintain our guidance for capital expenditures, including turnaround and catalyst, at approximately $2.85 billion for full year 2013 and approximately $3 billion for 2014.", "So for modeling our fourth quarter operations, you should expect refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.45 million to 1.5 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 420,000 to 440,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 245,000 to 255,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be around $4 per barrel.", "For our ethanol operations in the fourth quarter, we expect total production volumes of 3.5 million gallons per day, and operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon, which includes $0.04 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization.", "Also in the fourth quarter, we expect G&A expense, excluding depreciation, to be around $175 million, and net interest expense should be about $100 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense in the fourth quarter should be around $425 million, and our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter should be approximately 37%.", "Okay, Chris, we have concluded our opening remarks. We will now open the call to questions. [Operator Instructions] Okay, Chris.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I'm going to take my full quota of 2, if I may. So one specific for Valero and one industry, if I may. Actually, I don't know if I missed this in your remarks, but can you quantify, please, how the hydrocrackers contributed to EBITDA in the quarter and if you could put it in the context of the guidance that you had given us for your expected run rate when these projects were underway? And I've got a follow-up on the industry, please.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Yes, Doug. The St. Charles hydrocracker came up in the -- in July of the third quarter and pretty much hit full run rates by mid-August. Both hydrocrackers performed very well, particularly given -- relative to expectations in this margin environment. Specific EBITDA performance, we're not going to provide on these units or pretty much any other unit going forward. We get hundreds of units throughout our refineries, and it's just too tough to reconcile and manage expectations and to audit each of those. So we -- those units have performed well.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "But in the context, you did give a specific guidance for what you thought they would contribute. Can you at least frame the contribution relative to that former guidance?", "Ashley M. Smith", "Yes. It's -- given the margin environment, because the guidance was in terms of a margin set, under certain margin sets, it -- they performed within guidance, within expectations of those -- that guidance.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. My industry question -- I'm going to leave it to someone else to talk about riddance [ph], but my issue is on utilization rates for the industry. The context I really want to set here is that we've obviously still got very low feedstock prices, particularly natural gas. But we've also got some refineries that have expanded and refineries that have been given something of a reprieve on the East Coast. So what I'm kind of curious about is your thoughts on overall gasoline capacity in the U.S. against a weak demand backdrop and whether or not you think the weakness we saw on margins in the third quarter could be something about kind of new dynamic that may have us reset or lower our expectations for mid-cycle margins. And I know it's a bit of a broad question but just curious on your thoughts on that.", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Okay. Doug, this is Gene. In general, I think the margins in the third quarter are getting squeezed. And I think you probably saw some economic running cuts [ph] towards the end of the quarter, in September, primarily, but you also had turnarounds coming into play. But then moving forward in the fourth quarter, I think you got to look at what type of crudes you're running. If you're running imported sweet crude, your margins are pretty bad right now. But on domestic crude, with the differentials blowing out, I think you're seeing better margins in the U.S. And I think you'll see utilization rates in the U.S. higher versus Europe going forward because of crude advantage and the natural gas advantage.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "How does that impact your thinking then about incremental use of cash in a go-forward basis if the margin environment is going to be more challenging? I'm thinking about your decision to move forward with another step-up in your spending.", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Well, I think the margin environment in the U.S. is going to be better. It's going to be squeezed in Europe because, again, the crude -- where you have advantaged crudes, you're going to have better than average worldwide margins. And where you don't have advantaged crudes, you're probably going to be a little bit below mid-cycle.", "William R. Klesse", "The step -- this is Klesse. The step-up in our spending, let's get it in context from the guidance I've given, is about $0.5 billion, and this is guidance. The market is giving us opportunities in the sense of increased crude oil production at a discount. So the light sweet crude is at a discount to Brent widening. We have the NGLs that are clearly coming to the entire industry, whether it's petrochemicals or refining. And then you look at what we're doing, we're spending a lot of money on logistics because the part of your question actually dealt with exports, let's be honest, and that is a huge part of the future for the refining. So maybe at the most, we're talking about guidance of $0.5 billion, and frankly, we've disclosed this in our last presentation, how it's split out. We gave that guidance. It shows a lot of it's logistics and it's -- being in half is economic. But we're still in this period of time where we're scoping these projects. But in our endeavor to keep you all informed, we told you guys what we were looking at. So that's how we justify. But clearly, in the view of this industry in the United States, as Gene just was speaking, you have to be able to export. And operating rate will be higher because we think that the U.S. industry, certainly between the Appalachian Mountains and the Rocky Mountains, is extremely competitive in the world environment.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons & Company.", "Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "With LLS and Mars prices being soft here early in the fourth quarter, there's a great advantage for Valero on the Gulf Coast and also a strong disincentive to import crude into the Gulf Coast. Could you talk about how these discounted light and medium prices in the Gulf Coast are impacting your crude imports and how you think it might impact the industry as a whole, imports into the Gulf Coast?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Well, Doug, this is Joe. I mean, obviously, they've backed out our waterborne light sweet imports, and we basically were there months ago. The only time that we brought in any light sweet waterborne imports into the Gulf Coast was when there were distressed cargoes out there that we could buy and take advantage of operating with. So this is not a new phenomenon here. It's just kind of a continuation. If we talk specifically about the light sweets, I mean, we got production -- and it's a fundamental issue. We got production way up, 7.9 million barrels a day, pass-through [ph] inventories are now at 194 million barrels, which is 10 million barrels above last year, and it's at 5-year highs. And although we've seen draws in Cushing that brought them down, we've seen builds over the last couple of weeks. But essentially, what you've got is supply of domestic light sweet crude exceeding demand in the Mid-Continent. And that crude, with all the pipelines that we've been talking about for some time now, flowing to the U.S. Gulf Coast, and it's creating length down there. So it is pressuring those margins. And we expect that, that's going to continue for some time. Medium sour has got to compete for space in the refinery. And Mid-Continent production pushing down there is pressuring Mars, and that's where it is today. And then as Ho-Ho [ph] comes on, and you're going to be able to move more Mid-Continent barrels over to the Louisiana markets, I think you're going to see even more pressure on it. So I think we're in it for an extended period of discounted light sweet crude on the Gulf Coast, as well as solid medium sour discounts. And then I think you didn't ask about heavy sour, but it all ties into the same issue. You've got heavy sour discounts looking very attractive right now. A lot of it has to do with fuel oil weakness because we've got weak Asian demand. And then you've got more supply of fuel oil coming into the market with Middle Eastern and Russian production increases. So the inventories of fuel oil are way up. You've got WTS, which we benefited on discounts improving lately because of refinery outages. And then you have Longhorn barrels. Now they're coming to the Gulf that in the past quarter, were headed to the Cushing market. So you're seeing more medium sour head to the Gulf, but the WTS discounts are coming off a bit. So -- and then you got the K factor. So you've got very solid discounts on your heavy sours, on your medium sours and on your light sweets. And we're starting to see those barrels run through the plants in October, and we're seeing much more significant discounts headed for us in November. So we're very optimistic about where the crude discounts are. Long answer [indiscernible].", "Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Secondly, you guys have been successful moving Eagle Ford barrels out of Corpus Christi to Qu\u00e9bec. And I believe you're permitted to move 100,000 barrels a day. That arb is wide open. Eastern Canada imports about 600,000 barrels a day, light crude. Will more crude move from Corpus, Houston, St. James up to Eastern Canada, given the arbs, where they are today? Could you discuss that and maybe some of the constraining factors?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Well, Jeff, it is. Yes, you will see more of the domestic crude moving up to Canada. And I think -- I don't know if you know. Gene, I don't know if you know enough about it on how much they can feasibly run up there. I can tell you that for us, we are running Eagle Ford crude in the Qu\u00e9bec City refinery today, and we got WTI crude headed that direction. So we're doing what we can to go ahead and move barrels up there, and we're learning how to run these crudes at Qu\u00e9bec City as we go. So do you want to speak to the...", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Well, some of the other refineries up there, they are predominantly medium sour-type refineries. But I imagine they have some capabilities running sweet, but I just don't know what. I'm sure they're running their LP models, and they're trying to optimize that as well.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Robert Kessler of Tudor, Pickering, Holt.", "Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "I want to see if we could touch a little bit more on this kind of U.S. versus Europe dynamic. Looking, for example, at your North Atlantic margin contribution or operating income, I'm wondering if you could split out that income in the third quarter between, say, Qu\u00e9bec City on this side of the pond and Pembroke on the other side.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Robert, we're not going to break out those details. We report by region, but we're not going to give results by refinery.", "Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Any color you could provide on the market? I mean, your volume guidance for the North Atlantic region for the fourth quarter would imply you're still going to keep the European side running. Where are you relative to kind of cash costs on a crack spread today at that plant? Can you give us some kind of color there?", "Ashley M. Smith", "We don't have any guidance for you on that, either.", "William R. Klesse", "I think we'll just stick with the general stuff that you read in the industry, and that is, until this dip the other day in Brent pricing, it was reported there were a lot of cutbacks in throughput rates in Europe. And then there was a cutback, and it says -- in the industry data, everyone says there's some profit in Europe [ph]. Our system is a little unique in the sense as we do try to run an Atlantic Basin strategy and we do have marketing in the U.K. and Ireland. And so we'll leave it at that.", "Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I guess my second question then, third quarter exports for you of gasoline and diesel out of the U.S.?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Yes. We exported 193,000 barrels a day of diesel and 91,000 of gasoline, and those numbers are looking larger for the fourth quarter so far. We continue to have low inventories. We got a global demand growth, and we got very consistent demand out of Latin America. And so -- and we're seeing it industry-wide and from Valero's perspective. Right now, Rob, the arb -- the diesel arb to Europe is opening, ignoring the RIN, and that's the first time it's been like this here in a while. So we're very optimistic about the ongoing pull of products out of the Gulf to Europe and Latin America.", "Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "I think your capacity to export on the diesel side is 280,000, moving to 400,000 or 425,000. When do you move up to that 400,000-plus?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Well, we've got all these capital projects that Bill referred to earlier, the logistics projects, and so it will be over the next several years. I would tell you, today, we're probably at maybe a capacity of about 325,000 barrels per day for distillate.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I guess kind of taking on with some of the other questions that have been asked, if we look at the light-heavy spread along the Gulf Coast, and this came up on the last call, you kind of believed an 8% discount between the lights and the heavy sours. If we look at LLS, we've kind of stayed in that line, if we look at Brent, it's clearly blown out quite considerably. What is, at this point, given that there aren't much in the way of light barrels being imported to the Gulf Coast, which one is the better indicator? And how do you work around that if LLS is the barrel, but, I guess, you would say the refined products are being priced off of Brent still?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Yes, that's -- we look at Brent as being the benchmark -- this is Gene again, Roger. Brent as being the benchmark, so then you've got 2 components to your margin. You got your feedstock discounts. We're really not running any Brent, obviously. So if you're at Brent today, we've got an LLS discount. It's in the $7 range, and then you add your crack to it. And on medium sours, they're probably more in the $14 range. So you think about a medium sour at Brent, $14, $15, but LLS, it's $7, $8. So it's a -- they're very good numbers, which is kind of what we've been saying all along. A lot of people were concerned that LLS would get cheap, and it would sell cheaper than medium sours. Well, clearly, it's not happening. We're seeing pressure on the medium sours as well.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And as you start to move forward on moving more barrels from the Texas Coast to, say, Eastern Canada or wherever else they may eventually go, I mean, what -- how long before we would see an impact then on kind of Gulf Coast prices having to come up, obviously, reflect whatever the transportation costs are, but come up and kind of meet more of a global price issue? I mean, is that -- can we move enough barrels to Canada? Is there an appetite, let's just say, from the Gulf Coast to get the permits from the Department of Commerce to make that happen?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Right. Well, first of all, the arb light we were talking about earlier to Canada is wide open for our facility, and we mentioned, too, that the competitors up there sometimes are medium sour. So they're going to be looking at light sweet in the Gulf Coast. But they're still going to be looking at medium sours, and medium sours are starting to be discounted on an international basis to compete in the Gulf Coast. So they'll have to optimize based on that. You also see the arbitrage at current pricing that you could use a U.S. wide vessel and take crude up to the East Coast refineries. But there's limited amounts of these U.S. wide vessels available. So right now, I'm not sure it does get solved in the short term. I think all these barrels are competing against each other. There's more crude than the market needs in the U.S., but there are market pressures to try to solve them. But there's limitations on all those. So -- and on top of that, you've got more and more domestic sweet being produced every day. I mean, the Bakken numbers, the Eagle Ford numbers, the Permian numbers just keep ramping up month after month. So it's -- I'm not sure exactly how the situation gets solved right now.", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Well, Roger, just to add to Gene's point, we've got the production coming on stream, but it was just this last week that Longhorn started running now at higher rates. I think they are up to 225,000. They were running between 90,000 and 170,000, I think, for some period of time. And then when MarketLink comes on stream later this year, you're going to have another significant slog of these barrels moving out of the Mid-Continent into the Gulf. So the pressure continues to build. As Gene said, higher production, more takeaway capacity out of the Mid-Continent to the Gulf. It's just going to continue to build.", "S. Eugene Edwards", "And, obviously, the rail economics from the Bakken area to the Coast is wide open as well. So there's a lot of market pressures to try to correct this. The big question is, is there enough of it to really solve it? We don't think there is right now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Cowen and Company.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "I was hoping to touch on the light oil units you guys are building in the Gulf Coast. I know it's pretty far out, but if there's anything you could share about sort of current pricing, feedstock replacement, differentials that are maybe off benchmark right now that can help us get a better picture of the economics once those start running and help us model it out.", "Ashley M. Smith", "So Sam, the premise behind these -- there are a couple of kind of toppers at specific units that leverage some other infrastructure at those plants. We're not just doing crude expansions. We're doing it to fill up some downstream units that are currently importing feedstocks. So that's basically it. But it's too soon to give out details, to model it, specifically. We're still evaluating the cases, evaluating the investment needed and the various margins that are going to drive it. So we think they look good but still evaluating. So too soon to get into model specifics.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Well, maybe this is a little more near-term. In the past, you've talked about the West Coast. Those assets have been up for review a couple of times. It was obviously a really tough quarter out there this past period. And I was wondering if you could shed any light on the way you're thinking about that asset base now. I don't know, maybe the MLP changes things in terms of what's out there to drop down and remonetize. You might not want to lose it. But what's your latest thinking on that region?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, it's obvious that we're not making a lot of income or cash flow in the West Coast. And so we're looking at our options and continue to look at them from improved operations. Benicia this year hasn't run very well for the whole year, working there. We work on our cost structure. I think you know we have a rail facility planned at Benicia to run these sweet crudes, domestic crudes, but now we're stuck into an environmental review -- or I guess it's an assessment. And so now that project slipped on us. Where we thought we'd have it done at the end of this year, it's probably the end of next year. So these are the -- we're doing a lot of different things to try to improve our situation. But when you get all said and done with that conversation, PADD V, if we broadened the focus is just long refining capacity relative to product demand, which has not come close to recovering from the prerecession period. And so we just keep looking at all the -- all of the above.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. I mean, I think last year sort of demonstrated that region goes from long to short very quickly. Is there any resistance as far as rationalizing capacity there or it's all up to you?", "William R. Klesse", "I suppose you mean resistance being from politicians or somebody?", "Sam Margolin - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Yes.", "William R. Klesse", "I'm sure there would be resistance. You saw what happened with Tesoro in Hawaii. So that would be. But the truth is, the whole PADD V seems to be 1 or 2 refineries long. So when 1 or 2 refineries go down, you make a lot of money.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Two questions. Maybe this is for Gene. Gene, have you railed in any Bakken and WCS into any part of your system in the third quarter and how that looking in the fourth quarter?", "William R. Klesse", "Joe will answer you, Paul.", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Yes, Paul. Yes, absolutely. We have railed Bakken in, and we've railed heavy sour crudes in also. We've got bitumen that has gone into St. Charles, and we're probably doing 20 a day of that. And then the Bakken is actually -- I would tell you all of Memphis' volume is theoretically railed Bakken. It goes down to the U.S. Gulf Coast, to St. James, and then we bring it back up on Capline, but it's railed down there. And in Qu\u00e9bec, we started up the rail-loading facility, and that's going very well.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "You must be [indiscernible] because the Brent and Bakken is like $25 discount on the wellhead. So you can get your hand on. I mean, how much is the total Bakken that you are running? Any rough estimate of that in the fourth quarter?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Let me see. I'd tell you it's -- it was -- in the third quarter, it was 130 a day, and that's primarily Memphis volumes. It will increase -- I don't have the number of Bakken versus other crudes that we're going to be running at Qu\u00e9bec, so maybe another 40 or 50 on top of that.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So call it 200?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "I'll call it, sure, 180 to 200.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "You must be extremely profitable on those. And, Joe, it looked like that the LLS delivery price is even lower that the spot at this point. So when people looking at [indiscernible], say, LLS 6321, it actually is underestimating the margin. Is it?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Yes. It's very close, Paul, but it might be -- I don't know, it might be $1.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And then a final one. When I'm looking at that sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter with the lower RIN price and looks like better wholesale margin, so far, quarter-to-date, is it safe for us to assume your margin capture weight [ph] in your system is actually better in the fourth quarter comparing to the third quarter?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "You're talking about just our income, Paul, specifically?", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "On your gross margin, that comparing to the benchmark, you guys provide in your website. Should we assume that the third quarter looked like may have hit the low point at least in the near term, and both quarters looked like it's much better?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Right. And that's true. The lag effect in our crude pricing is going to give us better discounts going into the fourth quarter, and it's going to help our economics. I mean, they're significantly better. We saw a little bit of it in October, but we're seeing a lot more of it in November.", "William R. Klesse", "Yes. The point we're trying to make here, Paul, is you're asking, obviously, for a little guidance here. And what you would tell you is that October generally isn't that much than September. But because of the lag in the system for all us guys in this business, November and December look a lot better. So on a gross margin basis, fourth quarter does look better than the third quarter, but it's lag -- it's a lag.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Perfect. Joe, when I'm looking at your guidance, say, the RIN cost for the full year at $500 million to $600 million. This quarter, you have $75 million; second quarter, $125 million; third quarter, $185 million. So you're suggesting that the fourth quarter is still at $115 million to $215 million, given that the RIN cost seems to dropped down to the $0.30 comparing to the $0.80, $0.85 in the second and third quarter. Are we missing something or is that just that you're being conservative?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "No. Well, I'll tell you that the numbers I have don't really sync up with the numbers that you just stated. I would tell you that the number that we've got to achieve compliance is probably a lower number than you have.", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "The year -- Paul, this is Mike. The year-to-date number through September is $439 million. So to get to the $500 million -- the bottom end of the range, you're looking at $60 million.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Question for you on Meraux. I had seen some press reports suggesting there was a rupture at the crude unit, obviously, Ashley has already given us throughput guidance for 4Q. I'm just trying to confirm that there's no major issue or anything that we need to be aware of there.", "Lane Riggs", "This is Lane Riggs. [indiscernible] the crude's back in today. And we're going to be at full rates in about another 2 days. So in terms of forward guidance on throughputs, we're -- Ashley's numbers are fine.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. Good deal.", "William R. Klesse", "I just want to be clear. It wasn't, per se, a rupture. We had -- we were doing maintenance work and we had a stopple, and the stopple didn't hold. And that's what happened. So we didn't have a piece of pipe just break this up. We were doing maintenance work, in which we're looking at our procedures in tremendous detail here as to how that could have happened.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, got it. The second question was on the unloading facility at Qu\u00e9bec. I'm trying to see if we can kind of help quantify maybe the potential shift in feedstock. Do you have any kind of clarity you could provide or ways to think about maybe the cost of transporting up there via rail and maybe the discounts you're getting? Any kind of color you could provide will be helpful.", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Blake, this is Joe. Now you know I can't tell you everything you want to know here, right? But I'll tell you, from a volumetric perspective, the rail facility was available to us in August. And in September, we started ramping up volumes a bit. I would tell you we might have run 15 a day of rail crude in September. By later this year, we will be running 50 a day of rail crude. We've got it set up now so we can take 100-car strings, which is a block, which basically kind of gives you a unit train operation, which is kind of the best economics that we can achieve on this. You know what the rail cost is to the East Coast out of these producing regions in Western Canada. And the rail cost into Qu\u00e9bec is cheaper. So I would tell you, if you wanted to use $10 to $12 a barrel, you could probably use that. And you can see what the discounts are for Bakken and the Syncrude over in that market and kind of come up with what the benefit might like look like right now. So in addition to the rail crudes we've got going in there, then we also then we have the waterborne crudes. And I've said earlier, we're moving [indiscernible] -- we're actually moving Eagle Ford and Bakken crudes up there. And we expect that we'll be doing somewhere around 50 a day by the end of the year, so 45 to 50 a day. So we're getting a lot of North American crude into the Qu\u00e9bec refinery. And then, we had a call yesterday with our Canadian guys and discussed the status of Line 9. And it looks like everything's going well and the project is progressing. We're encouraged by the fact that some of the reviews, for example, in Ontario, they were going to review the project on an independent basis. They've canceled that review. So everybody seems to be getting more comfortable with that pipe. And at that point in time, we'll probably be running all North -- when that line comes up, we'll be running all North American crude, and Qu\u00e9bec will back out to foreign barrels.", "William R. Klesse", "Blake, this is Bill Klesse, and so this even goes back to Paul's question or maybe I'm trying to manage expectations a little here. There is no question running domestic crude oil or North American crude oil is very advantageous. And we give up on some of that by the costs. But clearly, shipping from the Gulf Coast to Canada is a couple of bucks; the rail, it's in our handout, we have all those rates in there. So I'd say all of this is extremely profitable. On the other side though, the gasoline crack still isn't really that good. Actually, it's crummy. Butane -- we make a lot of other stuff besides just diesel and gasoline and jet. And a lot of those markets are weak. So yes, the crude is clearly an advantage, but some of the other products are not contributing here. So I'm just trying to manage it because I could see with your question, Paul's question -- yes, it's better than it was in the third quarter, but there are things that are negative.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. So yes, just coming back to the crude side, I mean, obviously great conditions down in the Gulf at the moment. Are you seeing from, say, some of the medium importers sort of 1.5 million barrels a day comes into the Gulf and I appreciate you're more heavy. But are you seeing some of those medium imports? I'm thinking mainly the Middle East start to try and redirect the cargoes. I mean, how do you think that's going to pan out with the growing supply that's coming down the pipes?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Ed, I don't know. I mean, I don't know that we've seen Middle Eastern cargoes redirected. I know we haven't.", "S. Eugene Edwards", "No, we haven't. They're really priced [indiscernible] index, which is a complicated dollar. So their prices are based on U.S. basis. But do they have better opportunities to move over to Asia and we haven't really...", "William R. Klesse", "Historically they have, right?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "They always have, yes. Still a lot of barrels that needs to clear to the Gulf Coast to put [ph] in those market.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And I mean, I guess just thinking about the $8 spread at the moment between, I guess, LLS, is the only decent benchmark we have. How has that changed your thinking about the sort of, I guess, the industry expectations, say, a year ago of sort of $2 to $5 as being the sort of right kind of discount to sort of encourage those to move to other markets?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "This is Gene, again. When the market gets oversupplied, it's hard to really pick the right number. Why did WTI, the breadth [ph] go to $25 last year? So when it's oversupplied -- so $2 to $5, I mean, to me, fundamentally, is no different than $8. It's just a matter of where the market shakes out. The market is clearly long. It's hard to say what the right number is.", "William R. Klesse", "So we think -- we still stay to our position that things will eventually evolve to transportation costs. But you have to have what Gene just said, you have to have adequate ways of -- adequate capacity in the transportation area. And until you get that, and what Gene said, what is the number? And yes, are we a little surprised it's blown up this much? Of course we are. But I think, long term -- for long term, it doesn't really change our thinking.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "The -- switching to that idea of transport, I mean, obviously $1.5 billion, I think, is your CapEx for strategic and, obviously, a chunk of that is methanol, but a chunk of that is going to be on the logistics. Could you give us sort of an update on what type of -- I'm thinking, to make it simple, EV/EBITDA that you're investing at. I mean, Obviously, we know the MLPs trade at the high multiples. But what sort of returns do you think you're getting on your organic logistic investments?", "Ashley M. Smith", "Ed, this is Ashley. We don't have returns for each project. And then you can slice these different ways because, does the refinery get the benefit? Or does the railcar get the benefit? There's a lot of ways you could look at it. And then how will that return then go in. If it was going -- that asset was going to go into a logistics partnership, where do you put the return? Directionally, they're all beneficial. Most of them are pretty high-return projects, especially because they're bringing advantaged crude to refineries. But giving specific returns by each dock, by each railcar, we're not going to provide.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Yes. I'm just fishing to try and help us, say, get an estimate of how much logistics EBITDA you'll have down the road after you've spent a lot of this capital.", "William R. Klesse", "And it's a fair question. Part of the problem is what Ashley said. The other piece of it is we're very convinced the future in this business, just strategically, is you've got to be able to move stuff around; you got to be able to load ships. And so some of these projects, like our dock at Corpus Christi, we just say we got to have it. The docks at Saint Charles, building a new dock over there maybe, the dock at Port Arthur. We're just saying this is the way the future has to be, just like some of our competitors are saying the same thing. With the MLP, obviously, you have a cost structure that permits them to be dropped at a reasonable rate. So it all fits together, we think, as a management team, very well. But it's hard for us to tell you, as Ashley said, this project yields that, this project yield that. But they're all going to be above cost of capital and they are all going to fit very nicely in this portfolio.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I mean, maybe, one final thing then. Is there a constraint on moving even faster in terms of growing these logistics or spending more money in that area?", "William R. Klesse", "I don't see us doing that. So I guess it's just our capability to do things. And we think we're doing the right projects now that work on our strategy. So it's not -- we've given you guidance for next year, and that's the guidance we're sticking with.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI Group.", "Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I have a couple of questions. First, the capture rate seemed a little bit low in relation to Q3 of years past. And so I think we've talked about how it's going to rebound. But just wanted to see if there were any color you could provide into those results. And then second, this morning, BP highlighted normal seasonal factors. And I think growth compared to capacity is the driver of weakness in global gross margins recently, meaning, exclusive of the positive feedstock points that Ashley, Gene and Joe made about Valero's system in the United States. And so this might be a question for Bill, but I just wanted to see whether you think the recent weakness in global margins is seasonal, cyclical or both? And also whether or not there are any other issues that may help to explain some of these recent global trends?", "Ashley M. Smith", "Doug, let me start with your capture rate stuff. I'll give a couple of generalities because everyone models differently and has got different assumptions. So it's hard to reconcile subjective stuff like that on an earnings call. But key factors that aren't in a typical indicator are RINs costs, not everyone captures butanes and naphthas and things like that. And those had wild depressed swings in the third quarter that impacted what you would normally see in prior periods when those weren't a factor. Those are probably the biggest ones probably across the entire industry. So -- but any other detail, we'd have to do it one-on-one, because that's [indiscernible] on your model.", "S. Eugene Edwards", "And Doug, this is Gene. On the global margins, I guess the way we view it is with the new capacity coming on in Saudi and some of the Chinese refineries, that there is going to be pressure on certain refineries in the world to kind of make room for that. And I think that includes some of the Asian refineries in Japan and Korea and Australia, some of those have been rationalizing. And also in Europe because Europe is going to have to make room for not only the U.S. exports but the new Saudi refinery exports and Europe's only advantage is limited to distillate demand and that could be supplied cheaper from other sources. So we think global margins are off a little bit if you kind of look at past 2011, 2012 margins. '13 margins are a little weak or are definitely weaker as you're moving into the fourth quarter. So I guess we could say that pattern continues to next year. And I don't think margin is going to be so bad as they are right now in the fourth quarter, where every refinery in Europe loses money. I mean, that's too far, right? So it's somewhere you'll get some bounce back, but I think you'll see weaker margins in Europe than we have over the last couple of years.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "You gave us the product export numbers, which Bill, you said in the past, is really the key to the whole bull case here, given the weakness of U.S. demand. I was interested that you've got more capacity to export seemingly, or correct me if you don't. But given the weakness of, as you said, crummy gasoline cracks, I was wondering why more -- why there wasn't more export, if you like, or what the constraint was on exports and I understand you also said that exports -- less [ph] exports are up this quarter.", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Yes. This is Joe, Paul. So economics dictate a lot of our export volume. And so we take into consideration not only the margin that we can get on the barrel that's going out but also then the RIN effect. And clearly in the third quarter, that would have encouraged exports to be as aggressive as possible. The distillate export volume we had was very much what we expect. It is going up significantly in October. And again, with the arb being open to Europe, we're going to see that be much stronger I think in the fourth quarter. The gasoline exports, we moved most of that volume out of our Corpus Christi refinery, and a lot of it's termed up and went into Mexico and some of it went into South America. But that is part of our business that as we look at it going forward, we're very focused on expanding. And so strategically, we have initiatives that we have underway to try to create additional opportunities for ourselves to move those barrels out. But it wasn't there yet today. So even though we've got capacity to export, you've got to have a market to move it into and there's got to be demand for it. And so we moved as much as we could economically move, versus the alternative.", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Yes, it's all versus the alternative, Paul. After netbacks and different grades in those different markets. So just -- we're constantly optimizing around that.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "But I guess what you're saying is that diesel is great, right? You can export it with the RINs [indiscernible] RINs to Europe and so that's maxed out. On gasoline, the alternative is a different -- as a competitor, essentially. Is that what you're saying, that has a lower price than you?", "William R. Klesse", "I think what we're going to say to you is you're optimizing the refinery to make distillates. Even our distillates are up. And it's not necessarily that we're sparing the cats [ph], but if you look at our operating rates, our operating rates in the whole industry have been -- with the turnarounds that Gene mentioned earlier, have been very good. So operating rates are okay. They've come down some on crude units, but generally they're okay. And so we're making the product slate that maximizes our profit on the back end of the refinery. And so then we have this gasoline. We place it in the domestic market. And some has to go out of the country. As Joe said, some are from our refinery in Corpus Christi. But we're not necessarily sparing gasoline units. But the gasoline margin is poor. So we're optimizing to jet diesel on those strings.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, I get that and it's...", "William R. Klesse", "I know you do.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I think -- I just -- to go back to kind of what Joe said, just to reclarify, the -- can you kind of go over again why there's not more gasoline export, Joe? Sorry, I know you kind of answered. But if you could just totally clarify it for me.", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Where [ph] would the next 50,000 barrels of gasoline go at? Would it be a loss or would it be marginal economics? That's basically the question. And...", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And that would be set by the bid from a buyer abroad?", "William R. Klesse", "That's right.", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "And netbacks and shipping.", "Joseph W. Gorder", "And Paul, remember, I think we had shipping rates that were very high during the third quarter. I think we were $0.115 a gallon versus like $0.075 in Europe or $0.07 today. So there are a lot of factors that come into play. But again, it's economics.", "William R. Klesse", "Let me add a little side conversation here. So we obviously have export capability. So then it turns into either quality or the refinery economics. And as we run our economics in the refinery, basically we're always in balance, right? Because you adjust operating rate. So we didn't find it attractive to make more gasoline. So I mean it's because of the economics. If the economics for gasoline had been really strong, we would have figured out how make more gasoline.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes. Just to clarify...", "William R. Klesse", "And that is the answer. The economics in the refinery didn't drive us to make more gasoline, then the marketing groups dispose of it to the best way they can.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, I get it. Just -- I think -- did you say that your export capacity is now 350, because we were running with a 280 number. And if I add the 193 plus the 91 -- the 193 distillate plus the 91 gasoline, I get obviously to 284. But then I think you said your capacity to export was actually 350 or am I wrong?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "I said gasoline, we would say that our gasoline export capabilities, logistically is 225. And logistically, on diesel, it's 325 today. So the point, I guess, Paul, we're not logistically constrained. It goes back to Bill's point about economics.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Right. That's exactly what I was trying to get at. Yes, I think I get it. I think it's all an Atlantic basin thing that we're going to have to think about, right. And the RINs you're referring to, obviously, is European RINs, right? In terms of export...", "Joseph W. Gorder", "No, U.S. RIN.", "William R. Klesse", "No, this -- we're talking about the RINs, the cost of RINs. So in the U.S., when we sell product to the U.S., we're the obligated party. When you export, you don't have that obligation. So Joe is telling you that works into the math.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes. I know to take this off-line, but I'm getting there, it's just so important, obviously, to the outlook, how much we can export and how much we can grow that going forward. Just separately, the DD&A jumped up, even with high utilization, high throughputs, DD&A per barrel jumped up. Is there anything you can add on that?", "William R. Klesse", "Yes, Paul. Yes, it was up about $40 million from the prior quarter. And it relates to accelerated depreciation that we took on some of our logistics assets, as we were finalizing the financial statements for the MLP. And then we also had Saint Charles hydrocracker startup. So we had added depreciation from that project.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So that's not going to be an ongoing? That's not -- we don't, obviously, forecast that to keep growing at that rate?", "William R. Klesse", "No, no, no. The guidance I think Ashley gave was 425. So it's going to be about $30 million less than what the third quarter was.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "I got a question back on the cost advantage crudes. And in your latest presentation, you have a slide showing the Gulf Coast -- well you got -- you have advantage crudes processed by region. And I was just noticing your Gulf Coast capacity, it looks like it's -- first quarter, second quarter this year is around 320,000 -- maybe 325,000 barrels a day. Do you have that same metric for the third quarter?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Let me see -- capacity -- yes, it's about the same. It was a running -- we estimated capacity to process like light crudes was in 2Q, around 280,000, 290,000. We estimate it's up around 310,000 now for third quarter.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Okay. So are you maxed out in the Gulf Coast at this point on the advantage crudes until Corpus and Houston, those projects come on, or are there just more opportunities to kind of tweak the volumes higher in the meantime?", "Lane Riggs", "Chi, this is Lane. We still have the opportunity to optimize the domestic sweets versus really, I would say, medium sour imports. And so we haven't entirely used all of our capacity yet to put these domestic crudes into our refineries. We still have some capacity left but -- even beyond these key projects we're looking at.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Lane, do have estimate [ph] on volumes on how much more you can kind of optimize towards?", "Lane Riggs", "Our capacity right now is around 415,000 barrels a day to run these crudes.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "In the Gulf?", "Lane Riggs", "In the Gulf.", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Remember you're displacing medium sours in some of this, though, that we still have better economic [indiscernible] than medium sours. So that's the reason we're only running the 310,000 versus the 400,000 capacities, because we still have better economics on the mediums.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Right. I guess second question back on this RIN issue, Bill, do have any comment on this supposed leaked EPA document? And really, what is the outlook on your end into 2014 and what the mandate might look at. And have you had any discussions with regulators or the administration lately and any feel for how they're talking about next year?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Chi, this is Joe. I think the answer to all your questions is yes. I mean, obviously, the leaked information, along with the other things that the EPA has said, have led to the decline in RIN prices. They recognize clearly the blend wall is an issue and they said they are going to address it. They extended the deadline for compliance from 2013 to June '14. And then the leaked memo comes out, it has of the significant reduction in 2014's statutory levels to what they've proposed in '14. Now, that being said, none of us know if this is true or not. But it certainly had the effect of taking the pressure off of the RIN market and that's why we saw a drop from the mid $1.40 to $0.20 or sub $0.20 today. So if we look out, I mean, the EPA gave us a short-term release, if we look out, there has been a lot of activity on the legislative front. And there are many bipartisan groups that are working on amendments, rewrites, essentially, of the RFS. And they're kind of across the continuum as you would expect. Although we think it's poor legislation and it should be repealed, it's really much more probable that it gets amended and it becomes palatable, and it puts the RINs where they should be, which is a compliance tool and not something that economically affects compliance with the RFS. Bill's had many meetings on this in D.C. and other places. And I've had one also. And so we continue to work the issue. And we do think that we're going to get some relief in '14 and hopefully, longer-term, with legislative relief.", "Chi Chow - Macquarie Research", "Okay. So do you think these legislative actions on the rewrites, I mean, does EPA kind of -- do they just short circuit that effort by just kind of taking the rug out of 2014? And is this just going to be just a year-by-year kind of rolling uncertainty as we go into RFS for the following year? Or do you really believe there will be a rewrite at some point on the RFS?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Okay. So first of all, I think the EPA did what they could and then acted within their authority to do what they needed to do for '13, '14, okay? But looking out, I do think that there's enough attention on this issue that you are going to get a legislative fix. I'm hopeful that you are and there are a lot of people working it. So I expect that we're going to see something. I'm not sure when it will be. It certainly won't be this year. But hopefully, we see it sometime in the early to mid part of next year.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Chi, it's Ashley. I want to clarify on your first question. I was just talking about the light crude capacities and what we're processing. So when you add in the Canadian stuff and this better matches that chart you were referring in the appendix of our slide deck, it has been improving. 1Q was 331,000 a day -- this is all Gulf Coast, 331,000 a day, 2Q is 336,000, 3Q is 346,000. It's mostly light but we're getting some advantaged Canadian heavier stuff, too.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Allen Good of MorningStar.", "Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I wonder if I could just come back to the export issue and to get your thoughts on the market, maybe a bit longer term. It would seem that every refiner, including yourselves, are betting on maintaining high utilization through exports. As a result, you're building out export capacity. But if we look at the U.S., it seems like the oversupply will be in gasoline. If you think about globally, it seems like Europe will bear the brunt of the refinery closures, and that's not really a gasoline market. So I'm just wondering, where do you see that extra demand for gasoline coming from, given it seems like gasoline exports will need to increase over the next few years. Is it simply a fact of increasing demand in Latin America? Or do you think you can grow markets elsewhere? And then more importantly, how do you think Valero maintains its market share of exports, considering your peers are really jumping into the export market with additional capacity as well?", "S. Eugene Edwards", "Okay, this is Gene. As far as Europe not importing gasoline, you're right, they don't. But they do export a lot of gasoline when they run the refineries full out. So I think when you get the rationalization in Europe, they all reduce their gasoline exports in places like West Africa and Latin America to make room for the U.S. barrels, which have a big cost advantage.", "Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "And so -- and then what do you think as far as -- with peers increasing as well, do you think there will be enough of that lost supply from Europe really to accommodate all U.S. refiners who are looking to export more product?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Well, it's more than just Europe. We talked a little earlier about the whole global market. There's also refineries going down in Australia, Korea, Japan, the European refineries. Anyone that has disadvantaged crude without a market. Some of the -- if you're importing crude, exporting products in Europe on LNG, gas -- natural gas. You're pretty much disadvantaged and those are the refineries that will make room for the more competitive refineries.", "William R. Klesse", "And gasoline demand in Latin America, you've got population growth, you've got economies growing, you've got increased demand, and you've got operations that, historically, anyway, have not been very good. And Mexico, they have decent operations but structurally, they're short gasoline, and they continue to grow. Venezuela's had significant refinery operating issues in the Caribbean, which have affected gasoline supply, and which I don't if it will get resolved anytime soon. So although I think Gene's comments on Europe are right. And I also think we're fairly comfortable that with low cost, efficient refineries in the U.S. Gulf Coast and the natural resources advantages that we're enjoying there, we're going to be able to continue to be very competitive exporters, not only to Europe but also to Latin America.", "Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then if I could just come back to capital spending, I guess a couple of years ago, it was assumed once the hydrocrackers were completed, that you'd see capital spending fall? Clearly, you mentioned earlier that the market's presenting a lot of opportunities for you to continue to reinvest in the business. If we were to assume that current market conditions hold going forward, do you think your queue of potential projects is deep enough, where we could assume that this $1.5 billion on growth will continue and maybe the $3 billion total for capital spending would be a safe run rate over the next few years? Or do you expect you'll extinguish some of these current opportunities over the next 1 or 2 years, where we'll see capital spending maybe fall back down once we get 3 or 4 years out?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, we're only giving the guidance for '14. But a big part of the '14 spending is logistics and those projects get completed. And so as they fall off, it remains to be seen. But we think part of our job is to add shareholder value and there are these opportunities. But we are not -- we're not just saying, hey, capital spending is going up, up, up. What we did is we raised our '14 guidance basically $0.5 billion to $3 billion, because really a lot of logistics stuff we're trying to get done. And a lot of it does get done next year.", "Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. If I could just, one quick follow-up. I guess share repurchases fell off in the third quarter. It seems like on your run rate for the fourth, you're back to about, call it, a little bit less than $300 million per quarter. Should we assume that run rate going forward until you extinguish the $3 billion? Or would you look to potentially add to the $3 billion once we get closer to the end or extinguishment of that debt level?", "Ashley M. Smith", "Allen, this is Ashley. We don't have guidance on how much specific buyback activity we're going to do going forward, except that we do consider that a priority return of cash to shareholders along with a recurring dividend. But we won't provide specific guidance.", "Joseph W. Gorder", "But just to reiterate what Ashley said in his comments, we spent $675 million buying our shares this year. We raised our dividends. Our dividend's going to approach, I think, $400 million on an annual rate. So that's over $1 billion and we spun off CST. So this management team, for any of the people that are still on the call, this management team has been very focused on returning value to the shareholder.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Matt Carter-Tracy of Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Carter-Tracy - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just one additional question on crude exports. I know you addressed the product export constraints in some depth. But I'm curious as you're looking at both railing Bakken crude into Qu\u00e9bec and also shipping Eagle Ford crude by tanker, if there are actually any logistical strengths [ph] that would keep you from shipping more Gulf Coast crude to Qu\u00e9bec if the differentials became favorable to doing that?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Well, on the water there aren't, because we're supplying Quebec on the water today with foreign light sweet crude. So, they certainly wouldn't be on the water. On the rail side, think we're probably going to be maxed out somewhere around 55,000 [ph] barrels a day. But then we're also going to be a shipper on Line 9. And so, those barrels will deliver in -- on the water, but they'll come from Canada. So I would say no.", "William R. Klesse", "So Joe said that earlier that once all those projects you just mentioned get finished and we said it on previous calls that the Qu\u00e9bec refinery is going to evolve into a North American crude-supplied refinery where it used to be 100% foreign, But you'll still have this economic opportunity because you have the hardware. But over the next year, we're still importing crude into Qu\u00e9bec. And we've told you guys in the past, we run Saharan [ph] out of Algeria, CPC [ph]. So that means there's probably some West African thrown in there. So they're running out the whole 240,000 barrels a day or so of our capacity there. For the next year, we'll still be an importer of crude because you do wind up with some refining hardware capability here. Eagle Ford is very paraffinic. It gives the whole industry problems in the crude heater. So we -- you do wind up with some processing limitations, which then we all try to address here through hardware. But for the next year, we're still going to run from foreign crude there.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Valero Energy Corporation's management for closing remarks.", "Ashley M. Smith", "Okay. Thank you, Chris. We thank the callers and listeners for joining the call today. And if you have any other questions, please call Investor Relations. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

My name is Bakiba and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Ashley Smith. Mr. Ashley Smith, you may begin.", "Ashley M. Smith", "", "Thank you, Bakiba. Good morning, welcome to our call. With me today are Bill Klesse, our Chairman and CEO, who will step down from the CEO position this Thursday; Joe Gorder, President and COO, who will become the CEO this Thursday; Mike Ciskowski, our CFO; Gene Edwards; and several other members of Valero\u2019s senior management team.", "If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also, attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.", "Now, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe-harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we\u2019ve described in our filings with the SEC.", "As noted in the release, we reported first quarter 2014 earnings of $828 million, or $1.54 per share. First quarter 2014 operating income improved over first quarter 2013, with gains in the refining and ethanol segments partly offset by a decrease in our former retail segment due to the spinoff of CST Brands in May 2013.", "The refining segment throughput margin in the first quarter of 2014 was $10.90 per barrel, which is an increase of $0.31 per barrel versus the first quarter of 2013. Decreases in gasoline and distillate margins in most regions and WTI discounts in the Mid-Continent relative to Brent were more than offset by increases in light sweet and sour crude oil discounts in the U.S. Gulf Coast.", "Also contributing to the higher throughput margin was our Quebec City refinery\u2019s increased consumption of cost-advantaged North American crude\u2019s in the first quarter. North American grades comprised 45% of the refinery\u2019s feedstock diet, up from 28% in the fourth quarter of 2013 and zero in the first quarter of 2013. This shows execution of our strategy to process more volumes of cost-advantaged North American crude.", "For color on crude pricing, the shifting of U.S. Mid-Continent crude supplies from Cushing to the U.S. Gulf Coast as pipeline flow rates ramped up in the first quarter drove WTI discounts versus Brent to narrow by $9.15 per barrel, while LLS discounts to Brent widened by $5.39 per barrel as crude inventories built in the U.S. Gulf Coast between the first quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014.", "Gulf Coast sour crude oil differentials to Brent also widened from the first quarter of 2013 to the first quarter of 2014 in response to the increasing supply of light sweet crude. The discounts for Mars and Maya relative to Brent increased by $4.10 per barrel and $8.76 per barrel, respectively.", "Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.7 million barrels per day in the first quarter of 2014, which is an increase of 135,000 barrels per day versus the first quarter of 2013. Refining volumes were higher primarily due to less maintenance activity, which enabled the refineries to run at higher rates and capture margin.", "Refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter of 2014 were $4.00 per barrel, which is $0.21 per barrel higher than the first quarter of 2013, due primarily to increased energy costs on higher natural gas prices.", "I\u2019d like to highlight another item in our operations during the first quarter of 2014. The new hydrocrackers at Port Arthur and St. Charles ran well and at a combined feed rate of about 120,000 barrels per day, which is their stated capacity. The new hydrocrackers also contributed to an increase in yields of gasoline and distillates and a reduction in the yields of other lower-value products.", "The ethanol segment delivered record first quarter earnings, generating $243 million of operating income versus $14 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2013. Increased gross margin was driven by weather-related supply disruptions, low industry ethanol inventories, low ethanol imports, and lower corn costs relative to the first quarter of 2013. Ethanol production volumes averaged 3.1 million gallons per day in the first quarter of 2014, which is higher than first quarter 2013 but lower versus the fourth quarter of 2013 due to production slowdowns caused by weather-related rail congestion.", "As noted in the earnings release, we acquired an idled 110 million gallon per year ethanol plant in Mount Vernon, Indiana, for $34 million in March. Efforts are underway to restart the facility, and production is expected to resume in the third quarter of this year. Given the favorable ethanol margin environment, we like the returns potential for this new facility.", "General and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $160 million in the first quarter of 2014. Net interest expense was $100 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense was $421 million. The effective tax rate was 33.9%. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter-end, total debt was $6.6 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $3.6 billion of which $384 million was held by Valero Energy Partners LP. Valero\u2019s debt to capitalization ratio net of cash was 14.3% excluding cash held by Valero Energy Partners.", "Valero had approximately $5.4 billion and Valero Energy Partners had $300 million of available liquidity in addition to cash. Given our financial strength and favorable outlook for refining margin conditions last week S&P affirmed our BBB investment credit rating and raised our outlook from negative to stable.", "Cash flows in the first quarter included $517 million of capital expenditures, which included $129 million for turn arounds and catalyst. In the first quarter, we return $359 million in cash to our stockholders by paying $133 million dividend and by purchasing approximately $4.3 million shares of Valero common stock for $226 million.", "For 2014, we maintain our guidance for capital expenditures including turnaround and catalyst at approximately $3 billion. We expect stay-in business capital to account for approximately 50% of total spending and for the reminder to be allocated to strategic growth investments, which are primarily for logistics and light crude oil process and projects.", "For modeling, our second quarter operations you should expect refinery group of volumes to fall with in the following ranges. U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.42 million to 1.47 million barrels per day, U.S. mid-continent at 370,000 to 390,000 barrels per day, U.S. West Coast at 260,00 to 280,00 barrels per day and North Atlantic at 420,000 to 440,000 barrels per day.", "We expect refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter to be around $4.20 per barrel, for our ethanol operations in the second quarter, we expect total production volumes of $3.5 million gallons per day and operating expenses should average $0.40 per gallon which includes $0.04 per gallon for non-cash cost such as depreciation and amortization.", "We expect G&A expense excluding depreciation for the second quarter to be around $160 million and net interest expense should be around $95 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter should be approximately $410 million and our effective tax rate should be around 35%.", "Okay Bakiba, we have concluded our opening remarks. In a moment we\u2019ll open the call to questions. Just want to remind our callers that during this segment we would like to limit you each turn to questions. You can always jump back into the queue for additional questions. Okay Bakiba, we\u2019re ready.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions). And our first question is going to come from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead your line is open.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey guys, good morning.", "William R. Klesse", "Good morning Paul.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "When I looking at your buyback into first quarter is $226 million, in January from your last conference call you said $204 million. So when we looking at say in February and March, the decision that to slowdown the buyback, most there, can you help us understand what is the thinking? What is the criteria, when you determine that, how much you want to buyback?", "William R. Klesse", "", "So this is Clark. We were basically out of the market in February, and March because of our pending management change, which our legal advice was we could not be up buying our stock and then in March because of the earnings, the whole period of February, March and then in the April here with the earnings. So we've really just been, in a way, blacked out or locked out of the market. There's no change in our strategy here. Returning cash to the shareholders, and our dividend, which we raised in January, and then buying our shares.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Second question (indiscernible) that I mean how fast do you guys want to grow the LP EBITDA or distribution growth you want to talk about during the initial year. I think that's two school of thought amongst some of your peers, one is that want to grow the LP as quickly as they could so that they would get to a size they can use their own balance sheet to raise that to fund future growth. The other school is that they want to be just in the high teen what is the school of thought that you guys belong.", "Joseph W. Gorder", "", "Hey, Paul, this is Joe. If you look at our peer group in this, and we're really talking about the sponsored MLP's, we consider Phillips and Marathon to be the two, and you know, Phillips has said publicly they're going to grow their distribution to 20% to 25% range. Marathon is at a range slightly below that, we understand, and we tend to focus on the higher end of the range, so we're targeting 20%, 22%, 23%, distribution growth, annually going forward. And our approach will be do it, initially with drop down assets that are same type of assets that we did, when we did the initial assets in, which are those with very gradable, stable cash flows, based on fee based income. So we're going to target the timing for our first drop to be early part of the second half of this year. And then I would think, although we can't give that kind of direction, it should increase cash flows, and distribution increases should follow.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Joe, can we still assume that the MLP assets sitting in the C Corp. today is somewhere in the $300 million to $400 million for you?", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Paul, the range that we talk about is actually higher than that. I would say we're in the $800 million EBITDA range that we believe we could drop.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you. And before I finish that Gene and Bill congratulation on the retirement thank you for all the years of your insight, we appreciate. And best of luck, and have a lot of fun. But don\u2019t spend too much time in the (indiscernible).", "William R. Klesse", "Thanks Paul.", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. And our next question on the call from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead your line is open.", "Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi, good morning.", "William R. Klesse", "Good morning, Roger.", "", "Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Could we talk a little bit about Gulf Coast volumes here in the second quarter and then within that broader kind of expectation, generally speaking, volume has been better in the last two quarters, then I think kind of or at the higher end of the range of expectations, can you walk us through what's happening in the Gulf Coast and then maybe what could push that to the higher end of the range again.", "", "R. Lane Riggs", "", "This is Lane Riggs, are you asking in terms of our performance or the overall industries of Gulf Coast.", "", "Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Specific to you.", "William R. Klesse", "Specific to us, when you look at sort of quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year, our turn around activity was lower, in the first quarter we set little bit higher in the second quarter. In terms of our volumes, that you'll see our second quarter volumes will be a little bit lower in terms of Gulf Coast, that we have a bigger turn around period. In terms of North American crude, the light crude processing that we have versus our capacity. We still have about a 165 a day versus our capacity that we could have run, and this was largely due that we have, you know, medium sour and heavy sour looks still quite competitive in the first quarter versus our capacity that we just still run about 165. Other than that, we are signaled to run forward or near sort of full as our availability would allow.", "Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Okay. Could you walk us through what the turnarounds are in the Gulf Coast in Q2 to the extent that you want to the specific units or type of work that\u2019s being done?", "William R. Klesse", "We choose not to disclose that until after the turnarounds, until the following quarter when the turnarounds are complete. The numbers are in terms of the overall volume metric they were actually the initial comments in terms of the guidance on the volume.", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "So what happened here is this is all legal advice and some of things that have happened in the markets. We\u2019ve changed our policy on this. I think some of you have noticed, so we no longer announce our turnarounds ahead of time. And so you just have to rely on the guidance that Ashley gives you as the volumes we\u2019re looking at.", "Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "", "Okay. Well as long as we know who to blame if it doesn't go other way it was supposed to go.", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Well, blame Ashley.", "Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "There you go. Just a last question here that, condensate we\u2019re hearing to lot more about that becoming a bigger and bigger issue and even in some parts of West Texas where it's being rejected. I was wondering, what are you seeing along the Gulf Coast or any other part of your operations, in terms of condensate. Are you having any rejection issues, in terms of what's being delivered to the units and then what your thoughts are on, how Valero may deal with the condensate issue not worrying so much about, you know, the industry with condensate splitters, et cetera.", "Gary Simmons", "Hey, Roger, this is Gary Simmons. I would say in the Gulf we haven't had too much of an issue with getting light material to our crude units. We have taken a hard look at the condensate. We don't really see that the discounts are wide enough to really warrant a capital investment to be able to run a lot larger volumes of condensates in the Gulf Coast. We are taking a heavy look at this in the Permian basin in some regions and kind of getting with producers and seeing where they're seeing the production to see if there is some opportunity, but right now we don't have anything planned.", "Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. And then our next question is going to come from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead your line is open.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey, good morning guys. And firstly congratulate to Bill and Eugene and your careers and retirement to Joe and the new role to come May. My first question really for Bill, and it's obviously more general and somewhat reflective question. I mean as you think about your 40 plus year career with Valero, and it\u2019s predecessors and lot has changed and how do you think about the current Valero and how it stacks up, relative to your history, and just your outlook today for the company versus other periods of time?", "William R. Klesse", "", "Okay. Well, the independents are a bigger segment of the business today than it used to be for sure, and I think that will continue. So that's one of the major changes in refining is that the independent segment has far more weight, and I think we react quicker to market influences. But Valero, we\u2019re a company that\u2019s put together bunch of assets and a bunch of people. Some of those assets were under invested in some were operated very poorly. But we come together with one culture and we have one goal, and it\u2019s really to perform with excellence.", "We\u2019ve improved our operations tremendously over the last few years, we\u2019re a for more reliable operators are much, much better operator, in that thanks goes to our people being very focused on excellence, respect for each other, hard work, safety, and teamwork.", "Valero is one company and you knowing our history, all the acquisitions, but we\u2019re one company. This business, though, far it's going to continue to be volatile, it will be seasonal, but it\u2019s made up a very hard working people and I always like the point this out to people, this industry pays taxes and we give a product to society that makes peoples lives better.", "The world needs the oil and gas for regardless of the rhetoric that people talk about. Oil and gas is inexpensive, and it, I mean, frankly, the developing world has have oil and gas. All the alternatives, and we know them all and we know all the cost structures, and except for ethanol, that has been able to work into the fuel mix all the rest of these alternatives are too expensive, inefficient, and will do absolutely nothing to improve the environment. And it's a waste of money.", "Well, I think we're very competitive very well, competitively positioned, and we had value to society, and Valero has a very bright future and no question that the crude oil and natural gas that\u2019s happening in North America is the biggest thing in my career, and I'm sure in Gene's as well, and its having a tremendous influence on all manufacturing in the United States that people thought was really last forever because the jobs in our industry really do allow people to on their own educate their kids and retire with benefits.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "", "That\u2019s great. I have a second question. There is a current debate regarding the impact of current battery, crude inventories are well above five year highs and a continuing heavy turnaround through the second quarter of this year and just how fold the system might be as it relates to Gulf Coast crude differentials.", "I know batteries are big place, I was wondering if you comment on what you\u2019re seeing in the physical inventory market. I know you have talked on the conversation side, but how many tank tops are general inventory levels that you\u2019re seeing in various Gulf Coast storage reasons, I'll leave it at that. Thanks.", "Gary Simmons", "David this is Gary Simmons. If you look at the BOE stats from last week, we\u2019re 209 million when we combined the refinery tankage with third-party terminals we would say that the working capacity in the Gulf is somewhere in the 2.75 range so that puts you about 76% of overall working capacity that\u2019s being utilized today.", "We\u2019re not seeing problems in the Gulf and there are some areas that it does appears starting to get pretty full with the SPR release loop seems pretty full, one of the things that we\u2019re seeing is our barrels are showing up faster than they used to. So the third-party terminal operators aren\u2019t sitting on inventory. They\u2019re turning those barrels pretty fast, and they\u2019re showing up it our refineries sites a little bit faster than what we\u2019ve seen in the past, but no real issues that we\u2019ve seen thus far.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "", "Great, I appreciate it guys.", "Gary Simmons", "Thanks Evan.", "Operator", "Thank you, and then our next question is going to come from Edward Westlake from Credit-Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Yes and let me also say congratulations, 650 I think is the EPS consensus not quite the $8 you guys did in the boom times, but certainly Valero looks like in good shape, just a follow on question on the MLP. I mean, obviously it\u2019s a great currency as well not just for what you can drop down into it, trading at a 2% yield. Maybe think a little bit more broadly about talking to us about what you envisage the MLP to allow you to do over the next several years, potentially external M&A as well as the drop down. Thank you.", "Joseph W. Gorder", "", "Yes. Okay, this is Joe. It\u2019s a good question. I mean, obviously the drop downs are the primary focus for the strategy in the short-term, but we do realize that we\u2019ve got a very competitive currency to use to do other transactions. You know, I think if you look at the logistics investment that Valero is making this year, and it will continue to make next year. In docks, we even have the rails, we\u2019ve got pipe investments that we\u2019re making and looking at. We\u2019re going to continue to build the logistics portfolio at Valero Energy that will allow us to look to drop for an extended period of time, which really just eliminates the need to go into the market to pay a premium for assets.", "So we find that to be a great benefit to us, but we would not hesitate to look at what\u2019s available in the marketplace, and to consider those assets and to use the currency to acquire those assets, but we felt that they fit into the system, and they were really assets that Valero Energy felt good about being able to make commitments to provide in that ratable, cash flow stream going forward.", "Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then a specific question on \u2013 and condensate has been team so far this call, but say you look at your sort of more mid-continent refineries Ardmore and Mckee, as you look at the crude that\u2019s coming into those refineries, presume say it\u2019s, WTI mix a lot of refineries are starting to complain that WTI isn\u2019t the same WTI used to be, because obviously condensates are spiked into it. Do you have any color on o how the sort of gravity of that WTI has changed over time or where we are against the sort of 42 API speck", "Unidentified Company Representative", "", "Yes. I would say both Ardmore and Mckee, we definitely see a trend toward the crude getting lighter and it has caused some operating issues for us, some constraints where we have to cut rates, because the gravity of the crude is getting higher. So we try to control at the best we can with working with producers to control the quality of the barrels that we\u2019re getting, but we have seen issues with the barrels getting lighter.", "Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I mean, I guess I\u2019ll ask the direct I should have asked, which is do you think there will be a point where the really light crude will need its own infrastructure rather than being blended into the TI stream.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Yes, I do I think ultimately we\u2019ll have to do that because the refineries just can reject the light ends.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "But how that structure comes out remains to be seen, I\u2019m not necessarily sure you\u2019re going to see a gathering system, but you may see some type of fractionation that occurs that allows it to move from the field economically into these hubs and then get address that hub before it then moves to the refiners. There\u2019s a lot, but just think that there is - you wouldn't necessarily think you're going to have a whole pipeline network to handle this, but you may have fractionation occur at different places in the system, including at the refinery.", "Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Yes. Which would be an opportunity for you guys in the MLP?", "William R. Klesse", "That\u2019s right.", "Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And then our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons. Please go ahead. You line is open.", "Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co. International", "Good morning. It\u2019s Jeff Dietert.", "William R. Klesse", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co. International", "Good morning. My congratulations to Bill and Gene and appreciate all you education and knowledge and being an industry statement for the last many years. I\u2019d like to focus on some of the medium sour crudes on the Gulf Coast. I think there have been a lot of discussion about light crudes coming in and more competition between light and medium. Yet, when you look at the Ed Mars, it's trading 5.5 under LLS, which is wider than average over the last 18 months.", "And you look at Thunder Horse, Southern Green Canyon some of that medium sours and trading at nice discounts as well. Obviously, the 700 a day keystone south pipeline is started up and we have got SPR putting medium crude into the market. Could you talk about how significant of these factors are and maybe other considerations you believe are driving the wide discounts from medium crudes in the Gulf Coast, and maybe how sustainable that weakness will be.", "William R. Klesse", "Yes. So I think we\u2019ve been fairly consistent in our view that\u2019s you know the medium sours and the heavy sours are going to have to trade at a quality adjusted differentials to the light sweet and as the light sweets are pressured down, the medium sours and the heavy sours are going to have to follow. I agree with your comments certainly in the short-term, the medium sours followed with the SBR release pressured the medium sours down in the Gulf a little bit more than what we had seen especially in the first quarter. But overall, I think we'll see that trend continued.", "Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co. International", "And your LP's are viewing that you should run near maximum rates, given where discounts are, and crack spreads are and just looking at the high levels of inventory reasonable U.S. demand and increasing product exports?", "William R. Klesse", "Yes, I think as Lane commented, the LP's are really pushing toward maximum utilization across the system.", "Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co. International", "Thanks for your comments.", "William R. Klesse", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "Thank you. And then our next question is on the call from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead Paul. Your line is open.", "Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC", "Hi, good morning everyone.", "William R. Klesse", "Good morning, Paul.", "Paul L. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC", "Bill and Joe congratulations indeed to both of you, and again as always I said, thanks for being so much fun to deal with over the years and so interesting to deal with. Could we just talk a bit about Gulf Coast again sorry to go back to this, but the throughput number could you just remind me what that was in terms of what you expected to be in the second quarter could you just repeat for to make it easier what you did in the first quarter and then could you also talk about what your capacity is now on the Gulf Coast, what you think your refining throughput capacity is overall. Thanks.", "", "William R. Klesse", "Yes, Paul. In the first quarter our throughput was 1.585 billion barrels per day. Our guidance was one for the second quarter is 1.42 million to 1.47 million barrels per day. And I'm going to get an updated capacity. Capacities is around a total throughput, just over 1.6 million barrels per day.", "Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC", "Yeah. Okay, so I\u2019ve got that 1.6 and then I think it was officially 1.54 last year and then so it\u2019s to be so detailed here, but then I think you gave a light weep throughput capacity as well for that system.", "R. Lane Riggs", "", "Yes. This is Lane Riggs. Just in the Gulf Coast it\u2019s about 480,000 barrels a day.", "Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC", "For you guys?", "R. Lane Riggs", "Yes.", "", "Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC", "Yes, okay that\u2019s interesting. The outlook for that as we move forward. Firstly, I guess that\u2019s a turn around number in Q4 that\u2019s the reason why you are so much lower, but then I suppose that we are going to go back up to much higher level of utilization through the rest of the year Q3, Q4. And then when we move forward beyond that, is your capacity going to increase let\u2019s say into 2015 or do you think you\u2019ve reached a steady state. Firstly for the overall capacity, second for the light sweep? Thanks. Sorry to miss the detail.", "R. Lane Riggs", "Yes, Paul this is Lane again, we have the two crude unit project. So everything you said is true. But in terms of project we have in terms of our pipeline of project is our crude expansion for both Corpus Christi and Houston both of which will be somewhat finished towards the end of next year. So the capacity of those 90,000 barrels a day at Houston and 70,000 barrels of day in Corpus in terms of our additional capacity in the Gulf Coast were on light sweep.", "Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC", "And that would be at the end of 2015?", "William R. Klesse", "Yes, we\u2019re calling kind of early 2016. So when those are operating.", "Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay, great. And then the other question I have here is just related to the further outlet light sweep crude in terms of exports, can you just, again on a look forward basis talk about how much more oil you guys would be using in Canada and there is some line reversal stories as well as some shipping stories, thanks.", "William R. Klesse", "Yeah, so what we said is our Canadian refinery should be at a 100% domestic light sweep by the end of the year, we\u2019re still on pace to complete that, we\u2019re a little bit ahead of schedule, I would probably have about a 130,000 barrels a day of capacity that we haven\u2019t utilized yet for the domestic light sweet. So if you take Lane\u2019s number in the gulf of 165 in the gulf plus 138 back here in this 295 range of capacity that we still have to absorb light sweet crude absence the capital program that we have.", "Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC", "Well, understood. And is that the limit on what you can do absent the capital program I mean the only crew that you\u2019ll take up that is for your own use and your own refinery?", "William R. Klesse", "So I guess I don\u2019t understand which you are asking?", "R. Lane Riggs", "Well you may and we can ship out there and sell it to one of the other refineries in Canada?", "Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC", "Yeah, exactly whether\u2026", "R. Lane Riggs", "Our permit allows us to ship it to all four, I think of the company arriving and compensate with somebody else, I think it\u2019s four anyway.", "Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay, great. And I guess additional final one and Bill, because it\u2019s presumably your last call, if you want to talk about how things have changed and or you think the outlook is in Washington D.C. Particularly I\u2019m wondering if you think will be able to export, condensate in relatively short order and then longer term, whether you feel that in due course potentially if prices in the U.S. get very low, we maybe exporting crude as well and any other thoughts you have on what\u2019s going on in Washington? Thanks.", "R. Lane Riggs", "Well I do accept that the ground work is being laid for condensates to be an issue and that\u2019s all definition of what crude oil is and then the question was asked earlier about infrastructure, which is absolutely correct. So condensates may need to get addressed at some point. As far as exporting of crude, though, the industry is running the oil, the discounts we have in the marketplace today are really because of logistics in many of these markets. And we\u2019re doing things and I\u2019m sure everyone of our peer group are doing things to be able to run more oil, and then we support the free markets, but you need to remember that this business isn't very free.", "There\u2019s a lots of restrictions from the Jones Act and the cartels, to everything else that goes with it. So I think it remains to be seen, but under the law, there's a lot of flexibility. You can re-export Canadian crude, you can get licenses for that, as Gary just spoke, you have licenses to send U.S. domestic crude to Canada, there is also possibilities of exchanges, if it becomes so much, but the thing I think that people need to remember is this is a windfall for the North America and the United States as far as manufacturing, whether it's natural gas liquids, natural gas or crude oil, and we can have a manufacturing boom, the petrochemical industry can boom, where do you build petrochemical plants.", "Resource advantage, consumer advantage the U.S. is now resource advantaged. So this is a huge opportunity for jobs. We have a lot of rhetoric about jobs. Here is a real area for jobs. Job training, huge opportunities for welders, pipe fitters, instrument techs, operators, that was not here just five years ago. So this question of exports, and how our country should conduct themselves especially when you see the turmoil in the world, that we have going on, I think should take a lot of stuff. And I think it will.", "Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC", "Great, thanks for your thoughts. Thank you guys.", "William R. Klesse", "", "Thanks, Paul.", "Operator", "", "Thank you, and then our next question is going to come from Faisel Kahn from Citigroup. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Faisel H. Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.", "", "Thanks. Hi, good morning guys. I\u2019m Faisel from Citi. If I could ask a question on the heavy oil sort of consumption in the Gulf Coast, just with all the things going on in Venezuela, what are the risks to you guys the volumes into your facilities, from heavy crude, you're taking from Venezuela and then to sort of counter that can you give us an update on how much heavy crude you're bringing down from Canada specifically through the pipeline into Port Arthur as well.", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Yes, our heavy sour volumes were fairly consistent from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. You brought up Venezuela, we did choose to allow our heavy sours inventories to creep up a little bit in the first quarter. In case we had a supply disruption from Venezuela. But we haven't seen any changes that would indicate that we would have a risk of supply loss from Venezuela. The Canadian values \u2013 Canadian volumes were down in the first quarter and that was mainly just a matter of pricing.", "The Canadian production \u2013 the heavy Canadian production was down somewhat due to weather and then demand was also a little higher with BP Whiting\u2019s coker coming online. So we didn\u2019t see the economic incentive to run the Canadians in the first quarter that we have seen in the fourth quarter and early. That incentive is starting to come back and so we are ramping the Canadians back into Port Arthur here in April.", "Faisel H. Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.", "", "Its okay, understood. And can you also give us an update on what your strategic thinking is with the California assets, has that changed at all, and here what\u2019s the \u2013 process going on or, how are you guys thinking about those particular assets?", "William R. Klesse", "", "Well. In California obviously our financial performance is not that great. It is our weakest group of assets now financially, operationally though it\u2019s excellent. We have a very solid asset, they are operated very well. We continue to make improvements on those assets. And so when you look at the basic issue of supply demand where demand has not really recovered out there at all from pretty great recession, although we're starting to some improving economy and some optic in demand.", "To focus that we have is to work on our crude costs and to continue to work on the operating costs and of course, adjusting our yields to fit the market. So we view it as some of our competitors publicly stated that in a way, it's an option value out there. It's a huge market. The LA basin is still absolutely a huge gasoline market, and so the markets there, we just needed to show a little bit of growth back to levels it was before.", "Faisel H. Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.", "", "Okay, understood. And then last question for me. Can you give us an update on the methanol plan to alkylation unit projects and sort of when you might think of sort of sanctioning those projects?", "R. Lane Riggs", "Hi, this is Lane Riggs, where we are \u2013 we're in the Phase II and Phase III process in terms of working on ethanol, which means were doing a more detailed engineering to get a better cost of fine tuner economics, we will bring the project forward for a Phase III review, around November this year, and we'll probably have sort no go on the project at that time, but so far the project looks very, very favorable until there is no show stopper at this point time with respect to that project", "Faisel H. Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.", "", "Okay, great. I appreciate the time guys.", "William R. Klesse", "", "Hey thanks Faisel.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Good morning, everybody, Bill, Joe and everybody congratulations. It\u2019s you have been agree educator build for the industry and will miss you at the grantee for sure. But good luck to all of you. My two questions if I may, first of all on the Gulf Coast, I think Lane made a comment earlier, but well refinery utilization, but I don\u2019t would like to go to the industry utilization.", "We have seen the big build in inventories, but we have also seen our step changing utilization rates and as I look at it, if you want to characterize it, our supply days of crude on the Gulf Coast, are actually near the lowest level seasonally, that we have seen in quite some times. And this one if you guys could comment on that. And what it means for working capital for the industry and for Valero specifically as you move through utilization rates higher on the Gulf Coast. I got have follow-up. Please?", "R. Lane Riggs", "Well. This is Lane. And I will take a little bit of short at as days of supply I will differ to my friend list, but in terms of we absolutely had a, if you look at our crude margins, from the LP guide. We have had a huge incentive, to run through all the first quarter and fully with the margin refineries exist today so if you want turnaround or if you are having issues, you're trying to run crude, and you are not only trying to crude and crude still for example we are running crude in some of our SPC's, two or three of our SPC's where we have the ability to run resin, we are running crude in all of that so the industry is doing quite a bit in terms of trying to run more crude, because that\u2019s where the economic people\u2019s are telling us the range and I don\u2019t know if you want to talk on employees.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Yes, so the days is hard working capital in general \u2013 we generally see our domestic refineries that are taking ratable pipeline deliveries require less working capital than some of our Gulf Coast assets and our view was as we switch to more domestic barrels that would drive down working capital, I\u2019m not sure I think it\u2019s a little too early to tell that, and some of its just we're not sure what our pipeline line fill capacities are going to be on some of these new lines to be able to really give you guidance on that at this time.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "", "I guess sort on what I\u2019m really trying to figure out is I mean \u2013 but all looking at the differential on the Gulf Coast there has been obviously a consensus expectation that was going to blow out again probably for all of us and it hasn\u2019t at least in the magnitude in prior quarters we\u2019ve had down time. And I guess what I\u2019m really trying to understand is are you guys seeing the same sort of indications that we are, which is that days of supply for the system as a whole, is actually still quite tight given the higher utilization rates or are you not seeing that at all?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "It appears to me that the market in the Gulf is well supplied today. So I don\u2019t know that I have actually looked at it in terms of days of supply, but the market seems well supplied.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. My follow-up really hopefully quick, one more Valero specific. The comment you made earlier about you are seeing a lightening of the crude slate or for WTI specifically and that's becoming more problematic I guess in terms of filling up some of your secondary units. Can you talk about what that's doing to you\u2019re capture rates relative to the legacy capture rate of the system. I guess what I\u2019m really trying to get to is, we\u2019ve seen capture rates drift a little bit lower versus indicators and I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s got something to do with it in terms of incremental challenges you are having on running those crudes and I\u2019ll leave it there.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "", "It\u2019s difficult for me to comment exactly with that does in terms of running lighter in terms of where the capture rates go we could look at that in more detail.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "", "I\u2019ll take it off-line thanks guys.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "", "Thanks Doug.", "Operator", "", "Thank you, and then our next question is going to come from Sam Margolin from Cowen and Company.

You may have to rejoin because we are hearing some weird feedback coming through.", "Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Is it better now?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Every time you do it, it sounds like you are playing a videogame.", "Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Really?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Yeah, yeah.

Congrats also to Bill, Gene and Joe, its great working with all you guys. Two quick ones for you. One, you mentioned the Quebec refinery and potential reversals of line nine, of course I know you are barging Eagle Ford crude up there as well. I\u2019m just curious if you could talk abut how you see the economics unfolding, I guess I always viewed pipeline as more efficient than barging crude, although I believe you kind of outlined about $2 cost of barging on a non-Jones Act vessel. So I\u2019m just curious once the. line comes on, do you think we'll start or maybe reduce the amount of the Eagle Ford barge crude up there?", "Gary K. Simmons", "", "Yes. This is Gary Simmons. I guess the way we would see it is that the pipeline delivery would be the most advantaged and then second to that would be the barrels that we get over the water, and then finally would be the tranche that were currently taking by rail. So if barrels starts to drop off it would probably be the rail volume that you would see fall off before the volume that we are taking over the water.", "Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil", "Okay, great. The second one for you quickly there is some press reports out there that the Milford Haven refinery will be closed next month, obviously you\u2019ll get a direct benefit of Pembroke with those volumes being offline, but I\u2019m just curious if there is any opportunity to maybe buy some units or specific assets from that facility that would enhance Pembroke\u2019s performance?", "William R. Klesse", "Well, this is Klesse, we\u2019re fully aware of what\u2019s going on there and we are not sure how this is all going to work out and if there is an opportunity for us to improve our situation at Pembroke will take a look at it, but as of today we don\u2019t have anything moving on direct.", "Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil", "Okay, fair enough. Thank you.", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Thanks, Blake.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Chi Chow for Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.", "Okay, thank you. I want to go back to the Canadian strategy, and it\u2019s been reported you\u2019ve got this application for re-export license of Canadian crude. And first have you receive that permit yet and then secondly can you just discuss the strategy with the permit and what\u2019s the strategy on moving volumes out to either backup by if I guess to Qu\u00e9bec or out of Pembroke from what I understand that\u2019s part of permit as well.", "Gary K. Simmons", "Yes, this is Gary Simmons, we do have the permit in place, some of that why we went out and got that, actually when we are having the weather problems moving the Canadian barrels by rail to Qu\u00e9bec, we wanted to be able to shift that volume and move the rail volume to the gulf and then be able to bring it up over the water to Qu\u00e9bec, and weren\u2019t allow to do that. So this permit will allow us to do that, certainly at some point in time that we could also look at taking volume to Pembroke, but today we don\u2019t have any plans to do that least in the short term.", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.", "Does the permit allow you specifically to move to Pembroke only or that open to destinations within Europe or the U.K.?", "Gary K. Simmons", "I\u2019m not sure on the specific for that.", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "I think in the permit, you actually identified and I believe or you have nine different places were allowed to take it in the permit and you actually have to specify and so you asked the philosophy or strategy question, the strategy is that flexibility. We have the assets going in place with rail and at the U.S. gulf coast that allows us to keep the crude oil and that allow us to plan to go ahead and keep it segregated and then if the economics so there we have flexibility in our system.", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.", "Okay, Bill that the nine different places are they all with in your own facilities at Valero?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "No, there are not.", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.", "I\u2019m just wondering is in our your best interest to keep as much crude in the gulf as possible and what point would you look to I guess execute on this part and moving the crude down?", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "It\u2019s all flexibility and this is about economics and we would do exactly what years have leading to is always in our self interest for our shareholder.", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.", "Okay, thanks. And then I guess second question, can you give us the product export volumes in the first quarter and what the capacity is for both gas and diesel at this point.", "Gary K. Simmons", "", "Sure, this is Gary Simmons again in the first quarter we exported 208,000 barrels of distillate. We would say that our capacity the day is close to 325 and we have some capital projects in the work that will bring that up to 425 on the gasoline side we exported a 124,000 barrels a day of gasoline in the first quarter and that capacity is probably in the 225 range it will also go up to about 250 with some of the dock work we have going on.", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.", "Okay, thanks Gary, any timing on the increase in the capacity on both products.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Yes, so the dock work is probably a year to two years away from being complete.", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.", "Okay and then one final question on the exports have you noticed any impact from some of the new refineries that have coming to the market and most notably I guess that you\u2019ve well planned in Saudi Arabia.", "Gary K. Simmons", "We\u2019ll still see a margin today a good margin to export when you take the RIN into account and so we were finding plenty of homes to take the barrel. So I don\u2019t say that, I can\u2019t say that we\u2019ve seen a big impact from that.", "Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.", "", "Okay, great, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is going to come from Sam Margolin Cowen & Company. Please go ahead your line is open.", "Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hey, coming through okay.", "William R. Klesse", "Sounds good.", "Joseph W. Gorder", "Great.", "Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great, thanks for let me back I\u2019ll keep it tight I wanted to, I think that was brought up earlier the connection between sort of utilization and capture rate I think one of the moving parts there might be intermediate feedstock costs, seems to be like one of the last remaining sort of structural challenges I bring it up because you guys are addressing it with crude units and I was just curious of if any of those economics are changing if there is an opportunity at this stage to make them bigger or add another one or even drop them down and put a toll on it because kind of the commodity structure is looking more favorable?", "R. Lane Riggs", "", "Hi, Sam this is Lane Riggs so our both crude units, that we did we are big as \u2013 as large that could be in enter the green house gas. So we don\u2019t really have the opportunity to make them larger at this point time about reporting without going through the process to getting the green house gas.", "Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, and then I guess I will just bring up Maya, Brent spreads have been pretty favorable I think some of that has to do with WTS and Midlands kind of I guess leakage of the price dislocations there and West pipelines the infrastructure start to come online at a West Texas and maybe Midland normalizers closer to, closer to other benchmarks and then WTS comes with it if you guys are expecting any kind of weird price action in Maya maybe in the third quarter and if there is something we should prepare or try to bake in ahead a time to our estimates.", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "", "Well, I think with the Maya formula there is always that risk that if Midland comes into Cushing that it can affect that Maya formula in the short-term but we believe they\u2019re trying to price their crude so it can be competitive with Mars and so that even if Midland comes in they would eventually adjust the K to keep their crude competitive with a medium seller alternative.", "Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, thank you so much. Have a good one.", "Michael S. Ciskowski", "Thanks Sam.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Then our next question is going to come from Cory Garcia from Raymond James. Please go ahead Cory your line is open.", "Cory J. Garcia \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "", "Thanks good morning Bill, definitely want to echo everyone start and that\u2019s what it is going forward for Bill and Gene. Most of my questions have already been answered. But I guess as follow up to Faisel earlier Lane do you have any sort of no go, no go timeline on the Al key unit that you guys as talked about, obviously, a little bit lower stop in the scale of project, but just wondering if you have a similar sort of training for us to at least keep an eye out for.", "R. Lane Riggs", "It's on a similar time line. We'll have the same sort of base to review in the fourth quarter with management and then make to sort of the similar decision.", "Cory J. Garcia \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "", "Okay, perfect. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. And we have no further questions at this time.", "", "William R.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to John Locke. John Locke, you may begin.", "John Locke", "Thank you, Sylvia. Good morning. Welcome to Valero Energy Corporation\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our CEO and President; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero\u2019s senior management team.", "If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also, attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.", "Now, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we\u2019ve described in our filings with the SEC.", "As noted in the release, we reported second quarter 2014 earnings from continuing operations of $651 million or $1.22 per share. For all period shown in the table that accompany the earnings release, our results of operations reflect our Aruba Refinery as discontinued operations and we recognize $63 million of charges in the second quarter of 2014 associated with the recording asset retirement and other obligations related to our Aruba Refinery.", "Second quarter 2014 operating income improved over second quarter 2013 with gains in the refining in ethanol segments partly offset by a decrease in the retail segment due to the spin-off CST brand in May 2013.", "The refine segment throughput margin in the second quarter of 2014 was $9.84 per barrel, which is an increase of $0.58 per barrel versus the second quarter of 2013. Decreases in gasoline and distillate margins relative to Brent in most regions and narrower WTI discounts in the Mid-Continent relevant -- relative to Brent were more than offset by wider discounts on light sweet medium sour and heavy crude oil in the Gulf Coast.", "Also contributing to the higher throughput margin was our Quebec City refinery\u2019s increased consumption of North American light crude in the second quarter. North American grades composed 83% of the refinery\u2019s feedstock diet, up from 45% in the first quarter of 2014 and up from 8% in the second quarter of 2013. Additionally, at our St. Charles refinery we have began processing Canadian bitumen by our new crude-by-rail unloading facility.", "The U.S. crude supply landscape continue to transition in the second quarter with oil stock shifting from the Mid-Continent to the Gulf Coast, the inventory reduction in Cushing and corresponding oil supply growth in the Gulf Coast led to a $2.49 per barrel decline in the WTI discount to Brent and $5.19 per barrel increase in the LLS discount to Brent compared to the second quarter of 2013.", "Gulf Coast sour crude oil differentials to Brent also widened over the same time period due to increase in supply of crude oil. The discounts for Mars and Maya relative to Brent increased by $4.69 per barrel and $8.49 per barrel, respectively.", "Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.7 million barrels per day in the second quarter of 2014, which is an increase of 115,000 barrels per day versus the second quarter of 2013.", "Less turnaround activity and higher utilization rates spurred by the increase availability of discounted North American light crude in the Gulf Coast led to the increase in refining throughput volumes.", "Refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter of 2014 were $3.90 per barrel, which is $0.07 per barrel greater than the second quarter of 2013, due mainly to higher energy costs.", "The ethanol segment generated $187 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2014 versus $95 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2013. The increase in operating income was mainly due to a $0.39 per gallon increase gross margin which was driven by lower corn prices on an abundant corn crop and low industry ethanol inventories at the start of the quarter.", "Ethanol production volumes averaged 3.3 million gallons per day in the second quarter of 2014, which were lower than the second quarter of 2013 due to production slowdown caused by lingering rail congestion in the Mid-Continent.", "Now looking at the third quarter for ethanol, we expect volumes to increase with the startup of our recently acquired plan in Mount Vernon, Indiana, given the favorable ethanol margin environment we look forward to this plant\u2019s contributions.", "General and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation were $170 million in the second quarter of 2014. Net interest expense was $98 million and total depreciation and amortization expense was $414 million. The effective tax rate was 34.3%.", "Now with respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $6.4 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $3.5 billion of which $382 million was held by Valero Energy Partners.", "Valero\u2019s debt to capitalization ratio net of cash was 14.1% excluding cash held by Valero Energy Partners. Valero had approximately $5.8 billion and Valero Energy Partners had $300 million of available liquidity in addition to cash.", "Cash flows in the second quarter included $806 million of capital expenditures of which $240 million was for turnarounds and catalyst. We also repaid $200 million of debt that matured in April.", "In the second quarter we return $361 million in cash to our shareholders, which included $133 million in dividend payments and $228 million in purchasing of approximately $4 million shares of Valero common stock.", "Subsequent to the second quarter, we continue to return cash to stockholders by purchasing an additional 2.0 million share of common stock for $104 million. We also increased our regular quarterly dividend for the third of 2014 by $2.05 per share to $27.05 per share or $1.10 per share annualized.", "Also in the second quarter we announced the sale of the McKee crude system, the Three Rivers crude system and the Wynnewood Products system to Valero Energy Partners for $154 million. This transaction closed on July 1st and as an example of executing our strategy to create stockholder value to Valero Energy Partners.", "For 2014, we maintained our guidance for capital expenditures including turnarounds and catalyst at approximately $3 billion. We expect stay-in business capital to account for slightly under 50% of total spending and for the reminder to be allocated to strategic growth investments, primarily for logistics and advantage crude oil processing capability.", "I should add that approximately $870 million of Valero\u2019s estimated strategic capital spent for 2014 is all logistics and most of this is expected to be eligible for dropdown into Valero Energy Partners.", "Now for modeling, our third quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges, Gulf Coast at 1.45 million to 1.55 million barrels per day, Mid-Continent at 410,000 to 430,000 barrels per day, West Coast at 260,000 to 280,000 barrels per day and North Atlantic at 440,000 to 460,000 barrels per day.", "We expect refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter to be around $4 per barrel. For our ethanol operations in the third quarter, we expect total production volumes of 3.6 million gallons per day and operating expenses should average $0.40 per gallon, which includes $0.04 per gallon for non-cash cost such as depreciation and amortization.", "We expect G&A expense excluding depreciation for the third quarter to be around $165 million and net interest expense should be about $95 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense in the third quarter should be approximately $420 million and our effective tax rate should be around 35%.", "Okay. So we have concluded our opening remarks. In a moment, we\u2019ll open the call to questions. During the segment we request that our callers limit each turn to two questions. They may rejoin the queue with additional questions after that.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons", "Good morning.", "John Locke", "Good morning, Jeff", "Joe Gorder", "Good morning, Jeff", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons", "I was hoping to hit on capital spending? You stand consistent with your $3 billion forecast for 2014. I was curious as you look forward continues to be an opportunity rich environment in your view more light processing, more logistics, perhaps on the logistics side do you see that as a steady trend or trend that accelerating as far as logistics investment opportunities?", "", "Joe Gorder", "Hey. Good morning, Jeff. This is Joe. Yeah. I\u2019d say you raise a very good point. I mean, if you look at it broadly, we are going to maintain a very balanced approach with the use of cash returning it to shareholders via the dividends and buybacks.", "And then, investing to maintain the quality assets, which is, just a core part of our capital programs and then we are also investing to take advantages, natural resources advantage were enjoyed.", "Relative to the investment in logistics asset, I think what you would see now is a bit of shift in capital -- in the strategic capital from -- for example, we shift some of the spending for the purposed methanol plant for 2015 and we move the crude by rail facility up into 2014. So as the percentage, I think, that we have now is 54% of our strategy capital now is focused on logistics, where as previously, Jeff, is in the 40s. So the point that you make is one that we clearly agree with and recognize and so we\u2019ve seen a shift in that capital.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons", "Secondly, could you talk a little bit about your historical capital investment and what types of returns you\u2019re seeing so far from some of those investment, maybe hit on the hydrocracker investments at Port Arthur and St. Charles? What kind of returns are you seeing there based on their performance to date?", "Joe Gorder", "Jay, go ahead.", "Jay Browning", "Long time, yeah.", "Joe Gorder", "Yeah. Jeff, I\u2019ll tell you what, you asked a question and I think you recognized that it\u2019s very difficult to look at unit within the refining complex and determine specifically what\u2019s the return to that is, because of all the interrelationship in the plant.", "I think we\u2019ve said in the past and we would continue to say that the hydrocracker project were very good investments. Project -- the units are running very well and Lane can speak to that and the projects that we are getting out of units are good, high-quality diesel fuel that we are able to export as EN 590 grades versus a conventional diesel fuel.", "So, although, I don\u2019t have a specific return on hydrocracker project per se for you, I\u2019ll tell you we are pleased with the investment. We think they have improved the quality of the portfolio and they are performing very well.", "Lane Riggs", "Jeff, this is Lane. They\u2019ve averaged 120,000 combine units averaged 120,000 barrels in the second quarter. They\u2019ve definitely earned very well. These are great units. We are currently in the process of performing a test run at our St. Charles Refinery. It\u2019s I don\u2019t want to. I would be careful not to say what they are, where we are on that. But it certainly allows us to look at a very limited opportunistic capital investment. Those units are really bring them up to essentially all about the equipment and the sizes. But they\u2019ve ramped fantastically in the second quarter.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons", "Thanks, guys.", "Joe Gorder", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays", "Hey, guys. Two questions, Joe, I joined a little bit late, maybe you already covered it. Do you have a preliminary CapEx outlook for 2015 and \u201816?", "Joe Gorder", "Yeah. No, Paul, we don\u2019t and I\u2019ll tell what, what we are doing right now is we are going through the strategic planning process here at Valero and part of that, obviously, is the review of any kind of growth project we might be looking forward to in the 2015, in addition to what we got base loaded. We are spending $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion a year on maintenance reliability turnaround.", "So, that is going to continue and be fundamentally part of what we\u2019re doing. But we haven\u2019t settled in on the projects, the growth projects we want to carry forward those and we continue to pursue the crude units, we continue to look at the methanol plant. And then as you would expect there is host of logistic projects that we are evaluating. But we haven\u2019t settled in on the number, yet.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays", "Do you have settled into a direction at least this year is three, are we talking about -- from a direction standpoint flat, up or down?", "Joe Gorder", "Yeah. Paul, it won\u2019t be up.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays", "Okay. The second question that, do you have an estimated downtime cost in the second quarter in terms of the actual incremental cost and also that if you can give it, if you have it, would be helpful that for two number, one is the actual incremental cost and the second one is the opportunity cost that you lost?", "Lane Riggs", "Hi Paul. This is Lane. So our unscheduled downtime cost in the second quarter was $103 million.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays", "$103 million. And that\u2019s pretax or after-tax earning?", "Lane Riggs", "That\u2019s really EBITDA.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays", "And you say, that\u2019s opportunity cost or it\u2019s actual cost? I\u2019m sorry.", "Lane Riggs", "That is what we would call our volume variance which is if the units would\u2019ve performed the way we had planned than they would have generated another $103 million.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays", "Right. So that\u2019s the opportunity cost?", "Lane Riggs", "Yes.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays", "And how about actual incremental cost. Because I presume that you probably have some because of all the downtime, you have some additional maintenance cost and all that\u2026", "Lane Riggs", "Yeah. I\u2019m not -- it\u2019s really that's embedded inside our performance. We\u2019d have to get back with you on that exact number.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays", "Okay. Will do. Thank you.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research", "Hi. Good morning everybody.", "Joe Gorder", "Good morning Paul.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research", "Guys, your throughputs in the quarter beat your guidance in every region. And you've effectively raised your guidance for 3Q to be more in-line with the better performance in Q2. Could you talk a little bit more about the dynamics of how you're coming in so much higher? Really, within weeks and months of having set the guidance, you're coming in about 10% plus higher, in terms of throughputs. Could you just talk a bit more about, firstly, the technicalities of that? Secondly, the implications? And thirdly, where we might go, given the CapEx you've highlighted this year for presenting yet more light sweet? Thanks.", "Ashley Smith", "Okay. So Paul, this is Ashley. On actual runs, throughput runs versus guidance, guidance is -- it\u2019s a conservative estimate based on planned downtime and turn around, things like that. And I think what you can do is run some -- get some throughput. It might be lower margin throughput because you\u2019re buying higher-price intermediates or other feedstocks to keep downstream units going. Generally that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to see delta.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research", "So, it's not a function of you running more light sweet and, therefore, pushing more crude through the refineries?", "Ashley Smith", "No. I think we generally planned to run the amount of lights that we expected. It more has to do with planned downtime.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research", "Okay. So actually, what you're pretty clearly saying is, the better performance is simply due to a conservative guidance that you beat?", "Ashley Smith", "Because of relatively heavy planned turnaround activity.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research", "Right. The final part of my question was, does your current CapEx program expand the capacity or is it a shift mix entirely?", "Joe Gorder", "Paul, we\u2019ll let Lane talk about the crude units and what the impact will be.", "Lane Riggs", "Yeah. So Paul, this is Lane Riggs. So again we have our two announced crude units, one at Corpus Christi and one at Houston with the combined capacity of incremental suite capability of about around 160,000 barrels a day. And then we\u2019ll finish McKee which is an incremental 25 a day next year. Those are really the planned expansion on light sweet product capability.", "So with that said, we still are learning limits of our system on how much light sweet crude we can run, particularly on a Gulf Coast where it\u2019s available. And we\u2019re not really -- we still optimize those crude into our system versus our alternative medium sour, heavy sour, Canadian heavy and all these other. So we still have -- we can feel optimize and run more if the economics signals are there.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research", "The final part of this whole question is for me to ask you, in the past, you said that you need a 10% light heavy differential to run a (indiscernible) I think, was the guidance. Do you have a sense the -- you talked about the sensitivities. Can you give us a sense for what the price differentials need to be to be running, more or less? Yeah, on lights, on lights?", "Lane Riggs", "So you are saying -- Paul, this is Lane. So you are saying that we\u2019ve given guidance in the past that we need a light heavy differential of 10% versus\u2026.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research", "Yes. Kind of a rule of thumb for what causes you to run more light sweet in a mix against, for example, a medium sour.", "Joe Gorder", "To back out heavy and run.", "Lane Riggs", "Yeah, back out heavy and run sweet. It\u2019s probably fair somewhere in that number. Today we definitely have incentive to run all three et cetera. And they all have slightly a pretty similar margins into our crude capacity and/or into an open (indiscernible). So I think today, if you would look at, they are very reflective of what these -- what the relative values in refineries are.", "Joe Gorder", "13% off of rig. Right, so it\u2019s in that general range. It still would trickle to run the heavy solid crudes versus pushing more light sweet into the plant.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research", "Okay, guys. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Cowen & Company.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Company", "Good morning. I'll just touch on the condensate export issue. It seems like it's come into flux a little bit over the past couple days. I was wondering, as we await the BIS public guidance, as far as what the requirements will be in processing, if you have identified any opportunities at Corpus Christi, maybe either on the midstream side or sourced at the VLO level for that kind of processing capacity? Where you can kind of lean into some regulatory shifts that might nominally work against you but with VLP, could actually become the revenue margin driver over time?", "Joe Gorder", "Well, Sam, we look at these projects all the time. Right now, we don\u2019t have a condensate splitter project on the board. We\u2019re very focused on the two crude units that we talked about and really nothing beyond that at this point in time.", "Lane Riggs", "So Sam, this is Lane. I\u2019ll follow-up a little bit. The two crude units that we have designed, have a designed API gravity of 50. So these two crude units are fairly long although we would say the equipment is necessary to run a pretty light diet. We could run condensate and this is going to be a matter of again, what the economic signals and how distressed it is.", "In our economics, we had LLS and Brent parity. And we had to export naphtha out of U.S. Gulf Coast close to Far East. So that stream whether it\u2019s condensate, it\u2019s naphtha, whatever form it takes, it\u2019s got to find the market whether it\u2019s western Europe or the Far East, that sort of -- the value of naphtha is in the value of these condensates. It\u2019s still -- it will be interesting to see how that goes.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Company", "Okay. Even if they are taking up to 50, they'll still produce some BGO for the hydrocrackers and some of the other downstream units too?", "Lane Riggs", "Yes, it\u2019s not as much, right, because it\u2019s lighter.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Company", "Okay.", "Lane Riggs", "And that will be included in our economic because our alternative would be the intermediate to fill out of conversion units.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Company", "Okay, thanks. And I just wanted to touch on differentials in the Gulf, too. There has been a lot of volatility. I think last year when LLS spiked to that Brent premium briefly in July and August, you guys had highlighted the fact that some barrels were coming in on Longhorn offspec and the spot market for LLS and in Houston got very tight because of that. Is there any single piece of infrastructure development that we can be mindful of here over the last couple of weeks, aside from just very high utilization in the Gulf, maybe the delay in BridgeTex or something of that nature that might explain that LLS pop a couple of weeks ago?", "Joe Gorder", "Sam, this is Joe. Randy Hawkins is with us reporting and Randy is our Senior Vice President of Crude and Feedstocks Supply and he will be able to answer that for you.", "Randy Hawkins", "I think you touched on it already -- the high utilization rate that kind of led to some of the spike that we saw in LLS at the end of the August trade month. But I think you hit on the nose. The thing that we are looking ahead is the BridgeTex startup that we are anticipating at sometime late Q3 that will bring some of this distressed midland type barrels to the Gulf Coast that should help to provide some of the barrels that the Gulf Coast needs.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Company", "Okay, great. I think it's delayed, right? Is there some planned barrels or something that people are missing, and sort of a spot market issue, maybe?", "Joe Gorder", "Yeah, I mean, I think there were some -- maybe some people that were anticipating BridgeTex being a bit earlier and I think overall the high run rate, people were just a bit short and falling inventories as well led to that.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Company", "All right. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez -Howard Weil", "Guys good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I had two for you. One bigger picture and one more specific. But the big picture, Joe, as you kind of transition into your new role, I'm just curious if there is any low-hanging fruit or any strategic shifts that you see on the radar screen that you really want to address out of the gate?", "Joe Gorder", "Blake, good morning. I mean that\u2019s a fair question but quite honestly I think that this management team that\u2019s in the room today has been working with Bill for a long time and the plans that we put in place are plans that we are all very comfortable with. And so if you look at what we have got on the burner with the crude units and the logistics investment and then you look at some of the projects that are being contemplated like the methanol plan. These are all projects. This team feels pretty good about and that we are continuing to advance the conversations around.", "So from an investment perspective there isn\u2019t. From a use of cash perspective, we have maintained for sometime now that we are going to try to maintain a balanced program between investment and capital projects for growth and return of cash to shareholders. And I think we are going to continue to do that. I mean very clearly the fact now that we have had our second dividend increase this year which support the fact that we are permitted to increasing the cash returns to shareholders. And then today we bought back about 10.4 million shares and we will continue to do that throughout the year as cash flow is available to do it.", "So I would say there is no major shifts right now. The ox cart is not in the ditch. And as I mentioned earlier we are going through the process of pulling together our strategic plan for the next several years including and that will be capital plan. So I think we are in a pretty good position.", "Blake Fernandez -Howard Weil", "All right. That\u2019s great. The second question, I hope this is one question, but you runs up at Quebec of North America crude hit at 83%. I was hoping if you can give us a breakdown of how much of that has been barge from Gulf Coast and how much is actually tied I guess from Canada? And then I guess similarly on the rail to St Charles, just trying to understand should we be thinking about the economics on that as far as once you pay for transport. Is that kind of competitive with Maya or even more competitive just kind of some general feel about how we should be thinking about the margin impact there? Thanks.", "Randy Hawkins", "Blake, this is Randy Hawkins again. At Quebec the split of our North American crude was around 58 days by rail and about 1 00 a day shifts from the US Gulf Coast and two Quebec. Could you repeat the question on the Canadian?", "Blake Fernandez -Howard Weil", "Yes. Basically it looks like you started railing bitumen into St. Charles and I guess that is kind of view that as competing maybe with Maya and I didn\u2019t know by the time you pay for transport to rail it down from Canada if we should be viewing that as if more competitive. In other words, discounted to which you could access Maya at or at par?", "Randy Hawkins", "Yes, I would say that we\u2019re railing from Canada would be on par or better than Maya. The volumes for Q2 are fairly small. We anticipate this increase as we move into Q3.", "Joe Gorder", "Yes, Blake the refinery was moving turn around in the internally around in second quarter, so we aren\u2019t going to see the impact of any of those that bitumen movement until the third quarter.", "Blake Fernandez -Howard Weil", "Okay, great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Good morning, it\u2019s Faisel from Citi. Just had a question to follow-up on Blake's question on Canadian heavy. So I guess with the rail capacity at St. Charles and even some of your other facilities, and then with the connection to Keystone from Port Arthur, how much Canadian heavy do you guys envision having the ability to access by the end of the year? And then how are you thinking of that, versus your term contracts with PEMEX. Is there flexibility? Just sort of arbitrage those barrels between each other?", "Randy Hawkins", "Sure. Faisel, this is Randy Hawkins again. On our Canadian volume, we do anticipate with our rail facility in Lucas coming up later in the year that we will increase the amount of rail that we are taking into our production facility. We also buy regularly Canadian heavy after the pipeline systems coming out of cushion as well. So right now we don\u2019t anticipate that impacting our volumes with Mexico and it more is backing out some of the spot heavy that we are doing elsewhere from around the region.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. And just how much sort of capacity for Canadian heavy do you think you guys will have the ability to sort of run by the end of the period what always pipelihe and real capacity?", "Joe Gorder", "I think for now we are limited logistics more so than we find the configuration .", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, fair enough. And just my question it\u2019s on the changes in the rail regulations, have you see from the DoT and also the Canadian regulators. Is that going to have any impact of sort of the volumes you guys are moving around your system by rail?", "Joe Gorder", "Faisel, I think we are all waiting to see what those regulations settling in at and if you look at the things that are being proposed with the shell thickness in the (indiscernible) protection systems, the breaking systems. There is going to be a lot of retrofitting activity and modifications to already planned cars that has to take place and frankly the fleet, the rail fleet is in service today, it\u2019s very large and depending on the timeline for retrofit, it\u2019s going to have an affect on rail movement just in general.", "So we don\u2019t have a good estimate as to what the overall impact is going to be. We are in the process of working this year or so specifically working with ASP and formulating response to DOT and to transport Canada\u2019s proposal, but its probably just a little bit early for us to give you any idea as to what the impact might be.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. Understood. Thanks. I\u2019ll get back in the queue.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.", "Jason Smith - Bank of America", "Hey, guys. It's actually Jason Smith, on for Doug. If we could touch on throughput from the product side. With you guys and industry seemingly running at a higher overall level and in the release, I think you highlighted product prices versus Brent. Can you talk about what the implications of a self-sufficient U.S. system are, particularly on gasoline, where I think we're exporting as much as we're importing, at this point?", "Joe Gorder", "All right. So we\u2019re kind of looking at each other, trying to figure out exactly what it is you that you\u2019re trying to understand. Are you saying, at what utilization rates do we satisfy U.S. demand?", "Jason Smith - Bank of America", "No. I'm trying to say, I mean, we've basically seen, we've talked about product prices, pricing off Brent. But is there -- as we become more self-sufficient on the gasoline side, is there risk? Do we potentially price off of LLS?", "Joe Gorder", "I see.", "Jason Smith - Bank of America", "How do you see that playing out? We're producing 9.5 million a day of gasoline today. We're exporting as much as we're importing. ", "Joe Gorder", "Right. That\u2019s an interesting question. Why don\u2019t we let -- Scott Lively is with us today and he is our Senior Vice President of Products, Supply and Trading. Maybe he can just give you some thoughts on that.", "Scott Lively", "Hey Doug, how are you doing?", "Jason Smith - Bank of America", "Good.", "Scott Lively", "I guess, the way that I think about it, I don\u2019t think about necessarily what price products have to price off of as a feedstock. I just think, you\u2019ve got prices that are around the globe and we have to compete. And so barrels either arb into those markets or did not arb into those markets. And so you can say, we priced against Brent or we priced against something else.", "Well, we\u2019re running a lot more WTI based crudes in the Gulf Coast. So that region sees more of a WTI like margin whereas, something on the East Coast of New York refinery say, might price more against West African, Canadian that moves eastward. So I think you\u2019re going to see pockets, the differentiation based on what crude types people run. But I don\u2019t get it but I necessarily think about the way that you\u2019re trying to describe with pricing against brand specifically or WTI specifically.", "Joe Gorder", "We do talk about the incremental barrel into a refiner being a light sweet water borne barrel, which should be kind of a Brent type barrel, as long as that\u2019s the incremental barrel, you\u2019re going to be pricing products off of Brent.", "Scott Lively", "You have to get rid of all the gasoline production in those marginal refineries, which -- that\u2019s a lot of European and African and South American refineries. Those would have to be backed down, shut down before your price in the marginal barrel off of LLS or WTI and that significant amount, so those are the price pattern. Yes, you going to have times where U.S., low quality gasoline in the winter going to trade cheaper than it does in summer, you always have seasonality. But the marginal barrel is still going to be pricing out of the U.S. that\u2019s going to set the prices.", "Jason Smith - Bank of America", "Got it. How is the shift to a lighter crude slate and how is that impacting your gasoline yield? Are you seeing more gasoline out of that crude, at this point? ", "Lane Riggs", "Hey, this is Lane. And now we\u2019re pretty much still running, making almost within the noise of our systems, the same amount of gasoline that we were. And because of flexibility in the system and how we can change in points, whether we made naphtha or gasoline or just a lot of optimization points that we still have.", "Jason Smith - Bank of America", "Got it. My follow-up is on the West Coast. One of your peers recently announced a petrochem feedstock project. Are there any opportunities for projects like that within your portfolio? And also, if you could, maybe, give us an update on the Benicia rail project and where that stands right now?", "Lane Riggs", "Okay. This is Lane again, all start with the Benicia rail project. It\u2019s currently in the -- DEIR is out during the comment period, we close on that. The comment period will close September 15. We\u2019re still confident that we will get a permit, of course we\u2019ll hope -- we'll, certainly along the city of Benicia will help to help answer all the question that come out of DEIR.", "On the first point, we are looking at a lot of projects to the ones that you\u2019re talking about. And I think we\u2019re fairly skeptical. It would be tough to get permits. I think at the end of day, we take a while to build the project and get permit push through with quite an effort, as you can see with the crude-by-rail project on the West Coast.", "Jason Smith - Bank of America", "Okay. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "And then next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.", "Roger Read - Wells Fargo", "Hello, Good morning.", "Joe Gorder", "Good morning, Roger.", "Roger Read - Wells Fargo", "Well, I guess, I wanted to ask a little bit about the export market, what you see for volumes as we head into the fourth quarter. Traditionally, the strongest part of the year. And if you could give us a recap of what you've seen in the diesel market year-to-date. If we looked at where the futures were a year ago versus what we realized, margins came in a lot lower and I'm just speaking from a general or generic term.", "Can you kind of walk us through what you are seeing out there in the diesel market, both domestically and on the export side? And whether or not that has any particular concerns, as we look to the end of the year?", "Scott Lively", "Hi, Roger. This is Scott again. Over the quarter, we exported 210 a day of diesel and I would say, that\u2019s pretty flat with where we were on 1Q. We still see continued global demand growth in that fuel. So we feel pretty positive about our ability to export number one and having those markets to export into number two.", "You did have a little bit of hangover effect of the mild winter that Europe had, which really, particularly kept German stocks from drawing down. But those stocks are coming back more in line and those guys look like they are going to need to be building going into the winter. So we fully expected these export rates that we\u2019ve had to continue out in the 3Q and 4Q.", "Roger Read - Wells Fargo", "Okay. And then, something that got beat up on last year. We keep waiting for the EPA to give us the official numbers. Can you give us an idea of what you're seeing in the RINs market? We all know where the prices are. But what you've been doing about buying RINs, what your plans are if they make changes, presumably, an upwards revision to the ethanol and other biofuel requirements, as has been rumored in the press. As we, maybe, get something next month. Certainly hope to see something by the October, November period?", "Scott Lively", "Well, we do of course, keep our eye on the markets and we are participants. I think it probably put me at a competitive disadvantage if I said exactly what we were doing and what I planned on doing if we got an idea that they were actually going to raise too or above the blend wall as Podesta and potentially, Gina MacCarthy have alluded to.", "I think we just have to sit back just like everyone else and wait for them to come out with the final decision on what the obligation is gong to be. And hopefully at sooner rather than later because obviously as the time horizon shrinks that shrinks the time horizon for you to be able to go out there and procure the RINs that you\u2019re obligated to in arrears.", "Joe Gorder", "Yeah. I think the one thing that we do have going right now though is that there is probably as much ethanol being blended into the gasoline fuel. This could possibly be blended and as a result supply of RIN is there. So the economics are supporting it and the ethanol market in general, this is favorable to blend.", "Roger Read - Wells Fargo", "Right. Unfortunately, it's not always an economic driven story, where RINs are concerned and ethanol. I guess, one final question, just as a follow-up on that. Have we heard anything about 2015 volumes or adjustments or any of that or is the expectation that, that may come out with the revised \u201814 numbers?", "Joe Gorder", "I think that\u2019s what their expectation is, is that it comes out it would be interesting to have \u201814s and \u201815s come out. Well, it would be interesting to have \u201815 come out in \u201914. I wouldn\u2019t think that there hasn\u2019t been our past practice, but I don\u2019t think there is anything that we\u2019ve heard to a great that\u2019s given us any indication of what \u201915 might be.", "Roger Read - Wells Fargo", "Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.", "Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse", "Yeah, good morning everyone. Just on I guess a bigger picture, strategic question, $1.5 billion of growth CapEx, of which around 50% going into logistics. You've got VLP out there, $2.6 billion. So it's a relatively small MLP, but Valero's market cap has got a currency of its own. And obviously, you can drop down assets into VLP over time. Just get a sense of the color of how big you see the organic suite of opportunities in logistics. And then maybe even, any comments on using your equity to be more assertive, perhaps, in the inorganic M&A space?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Okay. Well, I think, we stated before that we Valero Energy have about $800 million of EBITDA that could be dropped to VLP. So, it\u2019s a very significant number. We completed the first drop here at the beginning of the third quarter on July 1, I think it was -- and that was about $154 million transaction. And I think it\u2019s fair to expect that we are working the subsequent drop transaction as we go forward. I think we recognized very clearly the value of interrelationships of the two entities and the multiple pickup we get when we drop Valero Energy down to VLP.", "We have a lot of projects as you mentioned that are in our current growth capital that we are working on which will be assets that would add to the base of assets that can be dropped. So really the question is that we are working through is the pace and the timing on those. And we said we are going to grow VLPs distribution to 20-plus percent a year. We still are intending to do that. And so our drop schedule at a minimum would be able to accommodate that growth rate.", "Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse", "It just seems like there's a large opportunity for companies in your space who have the skills to be very large and successful infrastructure companies, against the shell revolution to continue to shift assertively into that direction, given the relative multiples. So appreciate you might be going through the planning process now. But any thoughts about the direction you want to take the company?", "Joe Gorder", "Yeah, I think we\u2019re looking at host of different logistics project that are in development and will allow us to take advantage of what you've described. There\u2019s great opportunity with the shale plays. But I don\u2019t have anything specifically share with you right now ", "Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Then, maybe a question for runs, just on crude. Obviously, LLS spiked last year, and then LLS collapsed in the fourth quarter. The spike is, let's hope its history. And let's focus on the future, where we could see, perhaps, a repeat of what we saw the fourth quarter. A couple of things seemed to happen last year. Obviously, we built gasoline for a hurricane that didn't happen.", "There were lots of imports during the period. There was a rapid rise in inventories, seasonally. And you folks and others in the industry were trying to reduced inventories for the usual year-end planning purposes. So I'm just, sort of, the question. You mentioned BridgeTex earlier. But is there anything different that you see happening this year or do think this is sort of a new seasonality that's going to set in for the Gulf Coast crude prices?", "", "Joe Gorder", "Yeah, thanks for that. I think the biggest difference that I see, is that crude runs are so much higher than what they\u2019ve been as of late which we go through some regional turnarounds that we head into Q3 or so. My thoughts is that this thing will get back to normal. As we\u2019re seeing September contract trade today and we\u2019ve seen LLS back down $2 to $3 under Brent and last year $7 under Brent. So things are starting to look normalize.", "Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse", "Yes. And then, maybe, one tiny follow-on. Obviously, in winter, there's a difficulty pushing gasoline into the U.S. market and so you try and export the product into other markets. How are we, in terms of the ability for you to say, maintenance aside, run at a higher utilization than you would have done in the past? Because of the ability to export more product and out-compete other refineries around the world? Any color, there?", "Scott Lively", "This is Scott again. As you know that those gasoline exports are seasonal. So we do export less in 2Q and tend to export more in 3Q and 4Q especially we have more availability in butane works itself back into the pool. I think that we\u2019re going to cost advantaged. And we do see plenty of opportunities with growth and market in Central, South and Central America, South America and in Mexico we still see put in opportunity to put barrels out in those regions. So we still pretty good about our positions to export and keep refinery rates high in our system as result of those exports.", "Joe Gorder", "We are up on it. One last thing I\u2019ll add was Scott has said to your point, U.S. Gulf Coast capacity is most competitive capacity in the world. So if there we can save any market, we have low natural gas front. We are (indiscernible) and we\u2019re well positioned to maintain our assets. High utilization is we can find. We\u2019re not really up against any export logistic per se. So we don\u2019t really see being (indiscernible).", "Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse", "Thank you ", "Operator", "", "And the next question comes form Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "Hi. Good morning, guys. Maybe a more specific follow-up on next question. I know you are not providing 2015 CapEx guidance at this point. It was asked and answered yet. Given you had the MLP and given midstream spending as a increase percentage of CapEx, how do MLP dropdown relate to your consideration of CapEx, and it would appear to me that they are direct offset and distributable -- potential distributable cash flows and I have follow-up? Thanks.", "Joe Gorder", "Well, I mean, that\u2019s a million dollar question right there. In the subsequent question that is, at what point in time do we start doing this logistics projects in VLP itself and not at Valero Energy for dropdown?", "We have a lot of good projects that we are looking and what we are trying to understand is whole notion around, if you would look at gross capital or net capital number to be quite honestly, yes. We have a very good feel for I believe what we are going to be spending on refining side of the business that the wildcard here is, how much do we spend on the logistics side. So, I know you love to have a number and there will be a point when we give it you but I am just not prepared to share today.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "What would, let me ask you a question when you are evaluating midstream projects and what ultimately goes into the EBITDA that you characterize as MLP EBITDA. I mean, do you consider the relative cap rate versus the MLP drop rate in the overall calculation of the IRR. For instance the rate different and more color there, I think, would help us, I am just curious that\u2019s an element of your evaluation of what to proceed on?", "Joe Gorder", "Yeah. I believe it is.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "Maybe lastly, then, for me, any update on the timing, we're keeping a midstream focus here, but any update on the timing of potential methanol facility decision and given Westlake Chemical Partners MLP IPO that uses a fixed-rate structure versus variable and is, I think it's up 25% this morning, well through the range? How does a structure like that factor into that project consideration, which I know is under review and I'll leave it at that? Thanks.", "Joe Gorder", "Okay. Well, honestly, you know, we mentioned earlier that we continue to take a look at the project and we are advancing engineering. Lane and his team are trying to get our arms around exactly, what the scope of the project is. And again, yet, to look at the transaction you mentioned to know the impact of it, so we will take a look and then perhaps we can look back with you and have actually involve and John.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "Okay.", "John Locke", "Specific we are in Phase II. We are doing all those sort of engineering to major equipment so we can nail down the cost estimate. How that we view in the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re in the process.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Okay. And that's the process prior to -- it's going to reach an FID. Is that accurate?", "Joe Gorder", "It\u2019s the process, I\u2019m sorry, can you say that again?", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "I'm sorry. Is that the step -- after that phase is complete, is that when you then decide whether or not to go to a final investment decision?", "Joe Gorder", "That phase we\u2019ll make a decision whether we feel so good about that we\u2019ll go ahead and order all the equipment, which would expedite the project. That\u2019s really the critical decision that we\u2019ve taken.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "Great. All right, guys. Appreciate the information. Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Allen Good from Morningstar.", "Allen Good - Morningstar", "Good morning, everyone. I want to try to come back to the export question and, maybe, get your longer-term outlook. There seems to be a lot of changes underfoot there, with a lot of the refining capacity additions in Asia and the Middle East, potential improvement in European competitiveness given exports of, maybe, heavy crude over there, maybe even light crude. I think you have a bunch of peers increasing exports as well. So could you just talk about your long-term outlook there and how you think the export market for U.S. refineries and Valero, particularly, will develop?", "Scott Lively", "Allen, this is Scott again. I think that we were a bit ahead of the curve versus Europe of course on running those price advantaged crudes. So depending upon how long that takes to work its way and you can still see more closures in Europe. And clearly, Europe\u2019s kind of at a pinchpoint between the United States -- and mostly U.S. and Russia.", "Like I said before, I steel feel pretty good about our ability to export into these markets. A lot was made about Jubail coming on line. So far, you can see a sprinkling of cargos go here and there. But so far, what we\u2019ve seen is those cargos from Jubail have mostly gone into internal demand and stayed on the east coast of Africa.", "So sure, going forward, there is more refineries, they are going to come online and by way of China, there is going to be more capacity in U.S. but you should see that tempered with refinery closure especially those ones that are marginal. And as we said before, we still see the prospect of world demand growth for diesel.", "Allen Good - Morningstar", "Okay. Switching to the condensate export question, just looking at your recent investment presentation. And you have some notes in there saying that at the end of the day, less condensates in the crude stream could ultimately be beneficial for Valero, given some of the utilization rates and yields. Have you been able to quantify, exactly, what the loss on utilization or yields may have been over the past couple of years, as those crude streams did get lighter with additional condensates?", "Lane Riggs", "This is Lane. I don\u2019t know -- I'm not sure, I can give you exactly the loss. It hasn\u2019t been large but what we do, we\u2019re very careful in terms of how we articulate the quality of those suppliers. We have deducts and we can\u2019t give you numbers but we have standard deductions with API gravity goes up. We try to offset any sort of financial penalties we might have. But as refiners, we personally would like to see the condensate out of the blended crude.", "We\u2019re not but that\u2019s going to take a considerable infrastructure buildout to try to get condensate in whatever locations pushed to back in half. And so we\u2019re not necessarily opposed to condensate being segregated to other crude strengths. But today, we don\u2019t have. We haven\u2019t had any real major constraints based on these gravities that we certainly have. The way we purchase our crude, we certainly attempt to offset it.", "Allen Good - Morningstar", "And just a follow-up from the earlier comment regarding that, you\u2019re not interested in making any of those investments that would be separated too?", "Joe Gorder", "Well, again, our two crude units had a capacity there we provide them for 50 API. We can certainly run them at slightly reduced capacity. We can run even more. I think, the way we best -- the way we do things, we\u2019ll compare condensate and versus our alternative crude economic and that will determine how much we\u2019re going to run. I think what I was trying to talk earlier was I think, the industry and everybody making it stream, its going to have to try the market.", "That was the like condensate, whether it\u2019s slightly altered condensate, process condensate, new condensate, I\u2019m not sure. That\u2019s I have to plan at own somewhere. Our assessment was it\u2019s going to be the Far East. But we will certainly our best relationship with condensate and crude oil is this becomes more available.", "Allen Good - Morningstar", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Faisel Kahn from Citigroup.", "Faisel Kahn - Citigroup", "Yeah. Hi, guys. Just a couple of small questions. First one, with the Cushing inventory, sort of, reaching bottom, is there any impact to McKee and Ardmore for you guys or do you have sort of enough inventory within the refining gate to, basically, not be impacted by lower inventories at Cushing?", "Randy Hawkins", "Faisal, this is Randy again. The key specifically it\u2019s mostly a Midland market which is with crude oil at the moment. And similarly, Ardmore also takes some barrel out of that market as well. So we\u2019ve really not seen any impact on supply of the source barrels.", "Faisel Kahn - Citigroup", "Is it fair to say that, because of where production is, that you just don't need the inventory levels? Because you've got enough growth in production to offset sort of the balancing impact of having storage in place in previous years?", "Randy Hawkins", "Yeah. I think definitely to market goals are backward aided so there is no incentive for people to hold barrel there.", "Faisel Kahn - Citigroup", "Okay. Fair enough. Last question on -- actually two more questions. On the Corpus Christi dock, could that dock be used for condensate exports? Have you guys looked at that?", "Lane Riggs", "Yes. This is Riggs. We looked at that and they could be use for condensate.", "Faisel Kahn - Citigroup", "Okay. Fair enough. The last question is on getting barrels into Louisiana from Houston. Are you guys having any issues, or are you pretty much able to get as much crude from the western side of Houston into Louisiana? Any sort of constraints that you guys are seeing?", "Randy Hawkins", "No. This is Randy get in. No real constraint. I mean, it moving to your pipe on that Ho-Ho and barging and shipped in through Louisville. All that does satisfy and the rail is continuing to come down as well from the Bakken. So (Indiscernible) is well supplied.", "", "Faisel Kahn - Citigroup", "Great. Thanks a lot guys. Appreciate the time.", "Randy Hawkins", "Sure.", "Joe Gorder", "Thanks, Faisel. Thanks, Sylvia. I think with that we appreciate everyone calling in and those listening to our call today. If you have additional questions, please contact our IR department.

My name is Hilda, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Locke. Mr. Locke, you may begin.", "John Locke", "Thank you, Hilda. Good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations and Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero's senior management team.", "If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also, attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.", "I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions about the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Joe for an update on company operations and strategy.", "Joseph Gorder", "Well, thanks very much, John, and good morning, everyone. Well, as John will cover in more detail momentarily, we did have a great fourth quarter and a great year. What I'd like to do is spend a few minutes discussing our key strategies and highlight a few of our accomplishments in the quarter.", "As you have seen from our recent disclosure, our strategies are focused on operations excellence, returning capital to stockholders, maintaining disciplined capital investments and unlocking asset value. Operations excellence continues to be important to us. Our team understands that reliability drive safe and profitable operations, so we are relentlessly committed here.", "An example of this can be seen in our Meraux refinery, where we completed our reliability improvement program and the hydrocracker revamp project. We expect the investments we've made here to improve the refinery for liability and performance.", "Disciplined capital allocation is another key focus for us. Last week, we increased our regular cash quarterly dividend by 45% to $0.40 per share or $1.60 annualized. This increase demonstrates our belief in Valero's earnings power and our commitment to returning cash to stockholders.", "Regarding capital investments, we completed our 2014 capital program under budget, as noted in the release. This resulted from the rigor and discipline that Lane and his team applied to spending throughout Valero's gated project management process. We're committed to applying the same rigor to future investments.", "The majority of our growth investments for 2015 and 2016 are allocated to logistics, and to increasing our capability to access and process advantage crude oil for our flexible refining system. We expect the majority of the logistics investments to be eligible for future drops to Valero Energy Partners, which is our sponsored master limited partnership.", "On the topic of VLP, we're committed to its growth and unlocking value. As we noted in the release, we're targeting approximately $1 billion of drops into VLP in 2015. At that level of growth, we also expect VLP's distribution to exceed the 50% tier for our general partner and incentive distribution rights by the end of this year.", "We're continuing to evaluate and structure new potential earning streams that can be dropped to VLP, and those represent incremental growth opportunities. We understand the MLP landscape has changed since our IPO, and we're committed unlocking value.", "In summary, we're focused on operational excellence, disciplined capital allocation and value creation. Our team remains committed to high performance and achievement.", "And with that, John, I'll go ahead and turn it over to you to cover the results.", "John Locke", "Thank you, Joe. As shown in our earnings release, we had another strong quarter. We reported fourth quarter 2014 earnings from continuing operations of $1.2 billion or $2.22 per share. Adjusting for special items described on Page 7 of the financial table that accompany our release, we are at $952 million or $1.83 per share, which compares to $963 million or $1.78 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013.", "For the full year 2014, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $3.7 billion or $6.97 per share. Adjusting for special items, we earned $3.5 billion or $6.68 per share in 2014 versus $2.4 billion or $4.41 per share in 2013.", "The refining segment reported fourth quarter 2014 operating income of $1.9 billion versus $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. Nearly all of the $377 million increase in operating income resulted from the previously noted special items.", "Excluding the special items, operating income was flat in the fourth quarter of 2014 versus the fourth quarter of 2013, as stronger gasoline, distillate and other product margins relative to Brent crude oil as well as higher refining throughput volumes were offset by lower discounts for sweet and sour crude oils relative to Brent crude oil.", "Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.8 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2014, which is an increase of 41,000 barrels per day versus the fourth quarter of 2013. Refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $3.76 per barrel, which is $0.03 per barrel lower than the fourth quarter of 2013.", "The ethanol segment generated $158 million of operating income in the fourth quarter of 2014 versus $269 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The decrease in Ethanol segment operating income was mainly due to a $0.31 per gallon decrease in gross margin, driven by lower gasoline and ethanol prices with relatively stable corn prices. Production from the Mount Vernon plant contributed to record quarterly ethanol production volumes, which averaged 3.8 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2014.", "General and administrators expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $214 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, which is $35 million higher than in the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to changes in legal reserves. Also in the fourth quarter of 2014, net interest expense was $101 million and total depreciation and amortization expense was $425 million.", "The effective tax rate was 28.4%. The rate was lower than normal, due primarily to earnings from our international operations that were higher than projected and taxed at statutory rates that are lower than in U.S., the biodiesel blender's tax credit that was passed into law in December and a reversal of certain tax reserves. With respect to our balance sheet, at quarter end total debt was $6.4 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $3.7 billion, of which $237 million was held by VLP.", "Valero's debt to capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash and excluding VLP was 17.4%.Valero had approximately $6.1 billion of available liquidity in addition to cash, including VLP's $300 million of available liquidity. Cash flows in the fourth quarter included $857 million in capital expenditures, of which $157 million was for turnarounds and catalysts.", "In the fourth quarter we returned $640 million in cash to our stockholders, which included $143 million in dividend payments and $497 million in purchases of approximately 10.3 million shares of Valero common stock. Our total cash returned to stockholders for 2014 was $1.9 billion, a 33% increase over 2013, and included $554 million in dividend payments and purchases of 25.7 million shares for $1.3 billion.", "For 2015 and 2016, we maintain our guidance for capital expenditures, including turnarounds and catalysts. In 2015, we expect to spend approximately $2.65 billion, consisting of approximately $1.5 billion for same business capital and $1.15 billion for growth investment, and this excludes $150 million for St. Charles methanol project that remains under evaluation.", "For 2016, we expect to spend approximately $2.4 billion, consisting of $1.4 billion for stay-in-business capital and $1 billion for growth investments, excluding $300 million for the St. Charles methanol project.", "For modeling, our first quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall in the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.45 million to 1.5 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 240,000 to 260,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be around $4.20 per barrel.", "For ethanol operations in the first quarter, we expect total production volumes of 3.7 million gallons per day. And operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.04 per gallon for non-cash cost such as depreciation and amortization.", "We expect G&A expense, excluding depreciation for the first quarter to be around $170 million and net interest expense should be about $100 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter should be approximately $449 and our effective tax rate should be around 33%.", "Operator, we have concluded our opening remarks. In a moment, we will open the call to questions. During this segment, we request that our callers limit each turn to two questions. Callers may rejoin the queue with additional questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first comes from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.", "Chi Chow", "I've got a couple of questions regarding your very strong performance in the Gulf Coast region. I guess, first, can you explain the gross margin adjustments you've shown in the back of the table, in particularly that blender's tax credit and how that's going to be sustainable going forward? And then secondly, even with the adjustments, it looks like your capture rate was very strong sequentially versus 3Q, when all the indicated cracks were down. And just wondering if you could explain some of the factors that were coming into play versus the indicated?", "Michael Ciskowski", "The blender's tax credit, that was passed into the law in December for 2014, so it was available to us last year. At this point it's not hatch for 2015, so we would not have that in our earnings going forward.", "Joseph Gorder", "And on the margin capture, Gary, you want speak to that.", "Gary Simmons", "Yes. I would say, in the Gulf Coast margin capture is largely attributable to great performance from the hydrocrackers in terms of refinery operation. And then we also begin to see some good advantages on running some of the South American heavy sour crude again in our Gulf Coast system in fourth quarter.", "Chi Chow", "How much impact was there, just with the decline in crude prices? And is that something that if crude prices stabilize or eventually increases kind of the capture rate going to switch there versus what we saw in the fourth quarter?", "Gary Simmons", "We definitely see some benefits in terms of capture rate and a lower flat price. It's mainly the other products that we produce, the sulfur and coke, LPG, those types of things. Now, when the flat price is lower we tend to have higher capture rate, because those products tend to be a little sticky with crude.", "Chi Chow", "I guess one final question on the Gulf Coast. Looks like the Maya light/heavy differentials is pretty wide here in the first quarter so far on percentage basis. How has your crudes slate changed versus 4Q? It looks like you ran a lot of light crudes in the fourth quarter. Has that change here going forward? And do you have any sort of earnings sensitivity for the Maya spread?", "Gary Simmons", "Yes. I guess to answer the question on our crude diet, we tend to buy crude out quite a ways. So probably the first month you start seeing a significant change in our crude diet would be large. And we have started to move in the direction that exactly what you talked about as several of our Gulf Coast refiners were backing down on some of the light domestic type crude and starting to run a higher percentage of medium sour crudes and heavy sour crudes, those have been more economic for us to process in the Gulf.", "Chi Chow", "So do you have any sort of EPS sensitivity to changes in the light/heavy?", "Joseph Gorder", "No, actually we don't.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.", "Brad Heffern", "You all announced a pretty substantial dividend increase last week I think. Has that changed your thoughts at all on the buyback? And how do you think about dividend versus buyback in general and then versus capital projects or acquisitions?", "Joseph Gorder", "Mike, you want to?", "Michael Ciskowski", "Yes. We're working really to returning more of our cash to our stockholders based on our analysis of the market data and capital allocation scenarios. We are still interested in higher return projects, but our capital is down, projected as we disclosed, so we thought it was appropriate to increase the dividend at that level. So we're going to be looking at exceeding our payout ratio going forward in 2015 on what we've had the last couple of years.", "Joseph Gorder", "As far as our consideration of the dividend versus buybacks, when we did the analysis and looked at where our dividend was relative to the peer group, we felt that we were a little bit low. And so this type of move was something to get us more aligned with the other guys. It is also something that we view as being non-discretionary when we look at our use of cash going forward. The share repurchases, we are committed to trying to achieve a metric that we defined internally, and we're going to continue to pursue that as Mike said, but that will be more flexible for us than the dividend, which we consider to be, as I mentioned, non-discretionary.", "Brad Heffern", "And then looking at refined product exports for the fourth quarter, do you have a figure that you can provide us how much you exported? And can you also talk about how demand is looking for those exported barrels?", "Gary Simmons", "Yes. In the fourth quarter we did 139,000 barrels a day of gasoline exports. On the distillate side, ULSD, we did 280,000 barrels a day. In addition to the ULSD, we also exported kerosene and jet, and if you included that total distillates would be 255,000 barrels a day.", "In terms of the current market, I would tell you we're starting to see some incentive to export gasoline again, especially to Latin America and to Canada. Most of the distillate are through strength in the Gulf, there is not a lot of incentives to do much distillate export in the current market.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.", "Phil Gresh", "Just a follow-up on the capital allocation question. You talk about having a payout ratio that exceeds 50% of net income for 2014. Consensus actually has EPS down year-over-year. You also have some excess cash. You have just accelerated drop program. So I was just trying to calculate how high you're comfortable going in 2015 as a percentage of net income, if indeed consensus is right?", "Joseph Gorder", "Well, I figured that you'd probably ask a question like this. And really the target we've set is the one we've stated, it's to exceed the previous year. Now, as I mentioned previously, internally we've got a target that would be higher than that. But I am not prepared right now to give you a fixed percentage for the overall payout ratio.", "I just think we need to see how the year evolves. Look at the dynamic nature of the market that we are dealing with today. Are we're seeing crude go from a $100 late last year to $50 this year. And so for me to give you a committed number right now is something that's probably just wouldn't be prudent to do. So I think for now, if I were you, I would just assume that we're going to exceed the 50% target and go with that.", "Phil Gresh", "And that actually keens up my next question, which is just in your general outlook for the market, as we exit '16, it's starting to look like crude oil production growth could actually be down year-over-year. There is talk of increased global refine capacity. So given this dynamic market, I'd love to hear your general big picture views and just how you're thinking about planning for this type of environment?", "Joseph Gorder", "That's a fine question. Gary Simmons is so very close to this, let us let him go ahead and comment on it.", "Gary Simmons", "So overall, I think we see that the crude market will continue to be in a oversupplied position for foreseeable future. I think the fact that the Saudis have signaled that they are going to continue to put medium sour barrels on the market will mean that our medium sour differential should remain supportive. The combination of that with additional Canadian heavy into the Gulf, we believe it will give us good heavy sour differentials as well. So both of those things we think are very supportive in terms of our Valero's performance moving forward.", "When you turn to the refined product side, I think it's a little unclear at this stage to see exactly what will happen with refinery margins. However, we think that the fall off in flat price, we should see a positive demand response, and you have been able to see that in the past few weeks from the DOE stats. And so as demand increases, that should also be supportive of refining margins.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.", "Paul Cheng", "Two questions. First, if I look at your margin capture rate against your Valero index that you posted in your website, it was quite amazing that the last two year, 2013 and 2014 versus the two year before in 2011, 2012, your capture rate actually improved somewhere between 3% to 9% between these two period, with the exception of the West Coast.", "So wondering if you can have a stat, I'm trying to quantify, how much of the improvement you think is just that the market condition is just in favor of your configuration and how much of that is really based on the better operation, reliability that you guys has been able to improve? And how much is related to the large capital investment in the previous years you guys have made and have subsequently come on stream. The second question -- or that you want to answer that before I go to the second?", "Joseph Gorder", "Paul, I'd tell you, we'll let Garry speak to this, but just as member of management for last several years, I'd like first to take credit for all of it. That being said, Garry, you want to give your view.", "Gary Simmons", "Yes. So I will tell you, Paul, probably you have to look at this regionally. And when you look to the Mid-Continent, some of our improvement capture rate has just been due to the fact that the Midland market has been very disconnected from the Cushing market over the past couple of years and the wider Midland spreads. We're running a lot of Midland barrels to Ardmore and McKee, it certainly helped our capture rates there.", "Same thing in the North Atlantic Basin. I would say a lot of that is market driven. Especially as we transition Quebec from a foreign crude diet to a North American light sweet crude diet. We saw a significant increase in our capture rate there. However, in the Gulf, I would say that the improvement in capture rate is primarily just the fact that we're seeing a lot better yield and the operational improvements we've made in our Gulf Coast at this time.", "Paul Cheng", "And how much is the benefit is just coming from the investment that you guys have been making. Is there any way that we can quantify it?", "Joseph Gorder", "In the recent analyst presentations we've put together, we have included a lot of information on the economics associated with the projects. And the hydrocrackers are the one that we tend to focus on. I think what you can expect is that we'll continue to disclose this information as we go forward. And we obviously believe when the capital that's been invested over the last several years, it's had a significant effect, not only in, for example, the hydrocracker projects in driving the capture rates relative to more distillate production, but the increase in the reliability in our system and so on, it's all beneficial. We haven't tried to pin down specifically what's related to what, but I think we can all see it in the results.", "Paul Cheng", "A final one. I think that there is a change in your project investments decision process comparing to the past. Maybe that you can elaborate a little bit more in terms of what condition may have change or what criteria you have changed differently now?", "Lane Riggs", "So as you mentioned we're booking them for deliberate gated process, really what we look for are the projects that will enter our gated systems. We don't even look at them unless they have sort of 50% IRR as to gate one. And then also we right now have a tendency to be a little bit more focused towards the stock optimization, and not as nearly as large as maybe some of the projects that we did started in the past.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons & Company.", "Jeff Dietert", "There has been some refining margin strength in Europe and on the U.S. East Coast, the Atlantic Basin refining margins overall have been pretty healthy relative to the other regions. Could you talk about what factors you believe are contributing to the strength as a marginal product on the U.S. East Coast? Is it supply by U.S. Gulf Coast via the Jones Act ship? Or what do you think is causing the strength in the Atlantic Basin?", "Gary Simmons", "I think you hit exactly on it. We saw the New York harbor market get very strong. The colonial pipeline is always full, so that means the barrel is flowing in there to set the price, it's either a barrel from the U.S. Gulf Coast on Jones Act ship or a barrel from Western Europe, and so to incentivize imports and incentivize the flow off with Jones Act ship from the Gulf, the harbor market had to strengthen.", "Jeff Dietert", "So Jones Act laws are actually increasing prices on the East Coast?", "Gary Simmons", "Yes.", "Jeff Dietert", "Secondly, I was hoping you could comment on the EPA and the renewable fuel standard, and what you're anticipating could happen there? Rents prices have risen with the uncertainty that's been created there. Could you comment on that issue?", "Gary Simmons", "Yes. So we're still waiting for the final numbers for '14 and the numbers for '15 to come out from the EPA. We're hopeful we'll have something by the end of March, that's kind of what we're hearing and as you pointed too. Until those numbers are set, we see the red market as being very volatile. And so we're hopeful, we'll get some direction here pretty soon from EPA.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez", "My questions on the VLP drop. Appreciate the more aggressive strategy. The way I had kind of envisioned this in the past was kind of progressive increase over time. So I'm just curious, do you think the $1 billion in '15 kind of sets a baseline to where we should expect progressive increases into '16, '17, et cetera?", "Joseph Gorder", "This drop, as you mentioned, is really much larger than we have previously planned. But we have quite a portfolio of logistics assets, which we've mentioned and obviously this level of drop is based on the EBITDA that we have in the system will allow us to sustain this level of drops for some years to come. It's our intention to continue to drop at a pace that makes sense for Valero and for VLP.", "As you know, we continue to invest in logistics projects to support the refining operations, and then Mike Ciskowski and his team are evaluating additional sources of qualifying EBITDA, so to get from the fuels distribution business. So when we look at our portfolio today, we believe that this is sustainable for some period of time.", "If you look at VLP specifically, we stated in our plans were to increase the distribution 20% to 25% a year. And based on this particular drop, I think that you can expect that we're certainly going to be at the high range of that for this year and it looks like it's very sustainable going forward.", "Blake Fernandez", "Second question, the OpEx guidance you have of $420 a barrel, if I'm not mistaken that seemed a little bit higher than where we've been trending last year. And I'm just curious if there is anything in there that's driving that? And maybe if you could tie in with that as we kind of move more towards heavy sour runs. Should we expect that to kind of create some upward pressure on the operating cost?", "Lane Riggs", "So the guidance really, as a function, that we have some turnaround activity that's going to occur here late in the first quarter, so our volumes are a little bit lower. And then, I would also say, that the outlook is pretty consistent in terms of our natural gas price from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, so that's sort of the reasons we have the guidance where it is.", "Blake Fernandez", "And if you don't mind, just any comments on, again with the heavy sour coming back in the favor, should we think would that have kind of upward pressure on operating cost moving forward?", "Lane Riggs", "No. Not really.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio", "My first question is it's a different take on the prior question on the outlook. And you addressed the souring and heaving crude oil global slate with higher OPEC market share growing over Mexico and Canadian production. Can you discuss the developing and steepening contango and how it benefits Valero, especially given the structural way in which the crude markets are being forced to balance with the U.S. as the new swing producer?", "Gary Simmons", "Really the contango market structure is yet a good indication that the crude market is over supplied. And so as a buyer of crude, Valero benefits from the competition from producers to gain market share. So we think this is supported for us for at least the next couple of years.", "Evan Calio", "Can you quantify how much you're hedging on PI to avail one to two or one to three months contango? And how you think about your own storage assets in this market or even do you see the potential for U.S. storage filling?", "Gary Simmons", "So I think definitely when you look at the economics of what you can get tankage in Cushing, those economics are supportive of putting oil in tankage and storing it there. I think we'll continue to see Cushing builds. I read something this morning. They expect Cushing to continue to build about 1.5 million barrels a week until through April.", "In terms of us, particularly we do some of that. We don't do a lot of it. When we choose to put barrels in storage and take advantage of contango, it's also for other reasons. So we may see an opportunistic barrel that we think has a good discount. We might not be able to fit it into our systems. So then we'll go ahead and put those in tankage in Aruba and take advantage of the contango, and also what looks to be an opportunistic purchase for us.", "Evan Calio", "And just second one for me, maybe more a request for detailed information, if you don't that data. But can you break down the $900 million of MLP-able EBITDA into any sub categories? And I guess, I raised a question in the sense of, one of the subcategories of recent spending in rail, and also has some commodity price exposure to that sub segment. Yet I know, however, you use a significant portion of that rail fleet to move product under ethanol, which should have relatively higher utilization tariff. Any break down or help us in the composition of the EBITDA and/or -- sorry to make this multiple question, I didn't intend to -- or any break down in just that rail segment, how much is product in ethanol?", "Joseph Gorder", "That's fine. Well, because it's a multi-part question, we'll let Rich and Martin Parrish answer it. Obviously, Rich is the President of the VLP, and Martin runs the ethanol business, the renewable business. So why don't we let those two guys speak to this, and see if we can get you some color here.", "Richard Lashway", "So on the rail cars just to kind of break that down a little bit. So obviously they are qualifying to dropdown to VLP. We've created a company to hold these cars and our intent is to drop these cars down and trying to over time. But if you look at the cars that we have, there is a general purpose and they're coiled and insulated cars. The coiled and insulated cars, obviously, fit well into the ethanol business and coiled and insulated would fit into the asphalt and crude and fuel oil business. But our intent would be to drop these down over time in tranches.", "Martin Parrish", "We have about 3,000 cars in ethanol service, the general purpose cars, as Rich said. As those leases expire, we'll take those off and use the VLP cars. As you know, rail is the primary transport for ethanol, we expect these cars will be highly utilized in a good fit for VLP. ", "Joseph Gorder", "So now to the broader question on the $900 million, Rich, you want to provide a little more.", "Richard Lashway", "So if you kind of break down broadly the $900 million of EBITDA. So when we were out on the road a year ago, we talked about our retained assets. It's not about $620 million EBITDA and pride upstairs at the parent level. And from '13 and '14 we've got about $140 million [indiscernible] billion capital spending, which is mostly complete. So that would generate roughly another $140 million of EBITDA. So that kind of gives you to an 800 number.", "And then in '14 we've got another $400 million of capital spending, which generates another $40 million in '16 and '17. We got large spending on our, what we've talked about in the past, the diamond pipeline and some other pipeline projects. So kind of through '17 the capital spending will get you to about $900 million of EBITDA.", "Evan Calio", "Maybe at some point, just color on the types, whether how much is pipeline, how much is storage, how much is rail or fuel marketing distribution to at least better highlight the drop down values given the assets have some different multiples on?", "Joseph Gorder", "We can sure do that. I mean obviously in this case the bulk of this is logistics assets. The number that we're scoring doesn't include anything that will be associated with the fuels marketing business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the Roger Read from Wells Fargo.", "Roger Read", "I guess maybe I had a couple questions here. You've done a fairly phenomenal job in last several quarters of outperforming volume expectations, particularly in the Gulf Coast. Clearly from guidance here you're expecting descent amount of turnarounds in the first quarter. Well, could you just sort of give us a -- is it strictly market conditions or have there been other things that have allowed you to outperform sort of volume expectations? And I'm thinking you made comments earlier about the hydrocrackers having run very well in the fourth quarter. Could you just sort of walk us through that maybe how that could imply the stronger results in the first half of the year?", "John Locke", "Roger, our performance, when we give guidance is based on what we plan, we plan conservatively. If the market provides opportunities and we're constantly seeking opportunity, as crude prices or as product prices change, we try to optimize. And if we have the opportunity to go after extra barrels, we'll do it, and that's kind of what you've seen in the last, beside what you talked about here.", "Joseph Gorder", "Well, that's the fact, and then I would tell you that the fact that we've invested capital in the business, the way we've invested it over the last several years in our commitment to continuing to maintain the high levels of our reliability and safety within our refining system, is going to contribute to this.", "I think what you're beginning to see here is a realization of the value of the investments that have been made. And then the capabilities of this management team to execute to optimize the slates in, the movement of products out, and then the day-to-day operation to the refineries.", "Roger Read", "And then coming back to the other side of that, the comment earlier about distillate exports, not exactly being incentivized in this environment, there's all kinds of seasonal factors and other things going on. But are you seeing anything particularly different on just general volume demand sides here in the U.S.? We've seen descent data, although obviously somewhat we have to be skeptical of exactly what we see on the EI and API on a weekly basis, but look like gasoline demand is better here. And how maybe that's flowing through both in terms of the export market demand-wise not just arbitrage-wise, and then local demand as well?", "Lane Riggs", "Roger, so I would tell you that we have definitely -- since the flat prices have fallen off, we see greater demand for refined products on gasoline and liquid side. That's some of the reason why the Gulf has been supported. And when the Gulf has supported then we might not see quite the incentive to export, if we do. I would tell you we're still sending distillate to South America, so we still see good export demand, not necessarily quite the demand in Europe. And some of the reason for that is that just they've had mild weather in Europe, and to distillate demand has moved down there.", "Roger Read", "And then, just a last question is the North Atlantic margins, if you were to -- I know you don't like to do this, but if you were to break down sort of how Pembroke performed versus how Canada performed. Was there an unusual item? Both units were better, one was better and then other, just any granularity you can offer there?", "Joseph Gorder", "I mean you kind of preface the question by the fact that we work and answer it. So we appreciate you doing that. I mean, both refineries are performing well. And obviously, our Canadian operation, it's a very strong operation, but beyond that I don't think we want to try to get into that detail.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.", "Jason Smith", "It's actually Jason Smith on for Doug. Just a follow up on refining projects and being a bit more selective, can you just update us as to where the Benicia unloading facility is, first in the permit process? And then is there incentive on your end moving forward, given the recent narrowing in spreads?", "Lane Riggs", "So we are still working with the city to try to address all the comments that came out. We have only submitted EIR for review, and we're in the process with their folks to continue to push this forward. We're still pretty optimistic we'll get the permit. Timing at this point is a little bit difficult for us to project. I'd say some time early next year would be when we would actually get started putting the crude-by-rail project in place. And I'll let Gary speak to the economics of crude-by-rail right now.", "Gary Simmons", "So I would say, definitely over the last few weeks, whatever Brent TI was, we wouldn't be incentivized there to move crude-by-rail from Benicia. But we're starting to see that arc widen back out, and our view is that we'll see a wider Brent-TI than what we've seen over the last few weeks, and that we believe that we'll have an economic incentive to move the crude to Benicia.", "Jason Smith", "Is there anything in your '15 or '16 budget for that project at this time or is there anything else in your budget for '15 and '16 that could potentially get cut more beyond the methanol project that you guys obviously are slowing down on?", "Lane Riggs", "There is money budgeted in the 2015 budget to forward crude-by-rail.", "Jason Smith", "And then slowing down?", "Lane Riggs", "Literally, that will mean that we'll slow that spend down versus the budget, but we are least succeeded right now.", "Jason Smith", "And just one quick follow-up on the splitter projects, and you guys had talked about $500 million EBITDA in a 2014 environment. Can you give me the frame what those look like in the current environment?", "Joseph Gorder", "So you're talking about the crude topper projects.", "Jason Smith", "Yes.", "Lane Riggs", "Well, what I would do is refer you to our investment on our slides, we have sensitivity. So again, if you're right, the $500 million of EBITDA is based on 2014 prices. In the neighboring next phase right there, we have this whole set of sensitivity from drivers that affect the economics of that project.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Sam Margolin from Cowen & Company.", "Sam Margolin", "Back to the capture rate question. I guess in light of the outperformance, and then some of the comments you just made in general about crude over supply. I was wondering if you could maybe give us some color on some crude prices that maybe aren't necessarily in the benchmark that we can't see everyday. You mentioned that South American barrels, but I was also wondering about some domestic areas, so that's Huston, South Texas and maybe even the Bakken wellhead, where you have some real exposure too, if there is some contribution for pricing there at discounts below sort of what we see on the boards.", "Martin Parrish", "It's difficult to get into a lot of detail. But we continue to see that if you look at an LOS related market, in terms of the eastern Gulf, the Houston market is discounted a couple of dollars below that. And then you move further west and you get into the Corpus Christi area market. And again, we see another $2 of discount off LOS for an Eagle Ford type barrel.", "The same thing if you move up into the Mid-Continent, the discounts get deeper as you move up on the light sweet side. On the heavy sour side, definitely we're seeing some incentive to run a lot of the South American barrels. The biggest switch without going into a lot of details on discounts, as the Canadian differentials came in, we started to see an advantage to switch to more Brazilian grades and less Canadian grades, and that's an optimization we do everyday.", "Sam Margolin", "And then switching gears to the dropdown commentary. So the MLP space has obviously been really volatile, VLP has outperformed. So I'm wondering if there is any consideration or any effect on sort of valuation of drop downs in general. There was a question before about the valuation spectrum between types of midstream assets. But I'm just wondering sort of, as a complex, if there has been any impact or as long as VLP is over 10x EBITDA, the dropdown values can stay at 10x EBITDA and there is no real problem.", "John Locke", "We haven't seen any change in drop down multiples of the deals that have been occurring here recently. So they're still at roughly 12% pre-tax for VLP.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Mohit Bhardwaj from Citigroup.", "Mohit Bhardwaj", "The question is on ethanol. You guys just talked about ethanol market in 2015, obviously in 2014 ethanol was a big support and you guys made like $700 million to $800 million in operating margin. Moving to 2015 it looks like the corn prices have kind of held up and ethanol prices are coming down based on the global economics, maybe just talk about that?", "Martin Parrish", "Ethanol margins are likely to remain low in the $50 crude environment. And we don't know how long crude is going to stay at these prices obviously. What we do know is we have the best assets in the ethanol industry in the U.S. and we're in an advantaged location and we know we're not marginal producer. So we expect to weather this time.", "Mohit Bhardwaj", "And market do you expect to remain in the positive territory or do you think right now you're seeing negative markets in that?", "Martin Parrish", "I think it's going to chop around some, but we think overall it will be positive with our fleet.", "Joseph Gorder", "And it's positive today, yes.", "Mohit Bhardwaj", "And you guys mentioned crude-by-rail to California, it looks [indiscernible]. Is Port Arthur and St. Charles will be utilizing the rail side or you guys have just been looking at getting heavy cars from Latin America.", "Richard Lashway", "So your question is -- can you restate your question?", "Mohit Bhardwaj", "I was just wondering if economics for crude-by-rail into Port Arthur and St. Charles for heavy Canadian are still working out or is it more profitability to just look for opportunities for Latin American heavy metals right now.", "Richard Lashway", "So I would tell you today that barrels that we're bringing to Port Arthur with today's economics would be breakeven versus on my alternative with where the market is today.", "Mohit Bhardwaj", "And final one from me, just looking at California, the American [indiscernible] and talk about California models improving for them. And California remains the only place where the market has got a lot [indiscernible] value. Are there opportunities as you see to improve margins there?", "Joseph Gorder", "To improve margins in California?", "Lane Riggs", "The only project that we're working on really besides our ongoing optimization efforts, and maybe a real small thing is the crude-by-rail. We believe in the optionality available for us crude from the Mid-Continent ultimately, and because our views, the West Coast is a very challenging environment. We are very careful and very disciplined in how we approach capital into the West Coast versus all our opportunities we have elsewhere in our operations.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.", "Ed Westlake", "Congratulations on the earnings. I guess, last year we were talking about LLS, and this year we're just talking about all round good performance and margin capture, so well done. One of the, I guess, opening comments you made was, it was attributable to great performance from the hydrocrackers. Obviously, oil has fallen further and that's just sort of a swirl, and then obviously mentioned that diesel demand is a bit weaker, partly due to weather. I mean, presumably some of that will give back, although obviously take the point that the crude market part of it could still be an area of positive surprise. Just some thoughts there.", "Lane Riggs", "We have a pretty good slide in our IR presentation on how the hydrocracker performed and sensitivities around it. We have sort of basic set of economics on the 2014 price stat. With that said, yes, oil price have fallen and the distillate crack is where it is, but natural gas prices have fallen as well. But I think when you look at it, when you look at these drivers, you just need to take all that in consideration. Today, we still have very good margins on the hydrocrackers.", "Ed Westlake", "And was there any wholesale benefit? I mean, obviously, I guess racks in 4Q crude could fell?", "Lane Riggs", "Yes. We did see a benefit on the wholesale side. The rack prices tend to lag a little bit. And so we had very good rack margins through the fourth quarter.", "Ed Westlake", "I mean is there a way to quantify in dollar millions, I mean just obviously trying to get to sort of a sense of a more steady state level of earnings, appreciate there's lots of volatility in the fourth quarter and still today?", "Lane Riggs", "I don't have those numbers.", "Ed Westlake", "Any volumes of wholesale products, which perhaps because that stuff which you can sell over the rack where the wholesale margin may not have expanded as much, and then there are other parts to be U.S., I'm thinking, some of these states which don't have refining, where you'd imagine that there would be a greater sensitivity to wholesale. I mean any sort of overall number for production that is sold in rack prices, which is a price to the positive?", "Joseph Gorder", "Well, I mean our wholesale business really consist of I would say several different types of businesses. We've got the branded wholesale business. We've got the unbranded contract business. We've got our national accounts business. And then we've got spot wholesale business. And all of that is volume that's moved across the rack.", "Ed, we don't have a problem talking about it, but quite honestly the income associated with the wholesale business is embedded right now in the way we report our refinery operations. And the volume and the margins on the wholesale business are so much smaller than we would have, if you look at the refining margin, it's just doesn't makes sense to break it out before. And it also tends to vary so much. So I would tell you, if you want we can talk about this a little bit offline, but I don't think it's going to have a material impact to your forecasting going forward.", "Ed Westlake", "I was just trying to check, when you have surprises like this, you're trying to work out where they came from?", "Joseph Gorder", "Sure. I understand, but I would tell you that maybe it was a good quarter for wholesale, but it wasn't something that material affected the numbers that we reported.", "Ed Westlake", "And then just a tad theory of mine. We're all driving F150s to Disney World this summer. I'm driving from New York it's a long way, I might even take the F350 on the road. How do you think the industry is going to be prepared to make the summer-grade gasoline given that we probably haven't have this type of market for sometime. Maybe just give us a color on any constraints that you see in making summer-grade gasoline or not, just a view?", "Joseph Gorder", "I don't see any thing where I would tell you that we'll have any constraints on being able to produce the gasoline for the summer time market.", "Ed Westlake", "So it should just be a normal seasonal trade as we switch out from winter to summer, but nothing exceptional in your view?", "Joseph Gorder", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.", "Neil Mehta", "Joe, just as a follow-up from a conversation of couple of months ago, obviously Brent TI is tighter. So we're inside this export arbitrage, but now in 2015 the politics Washington are a little bit different. Wanted to get your temperature on the discussion around the crude export band and what discussions in Washington feel like around that right now?", "Joseph Gorder", "That's a good question. I mean we maintain our position that we're totally supportive of free and open markets. If the crude export ban were lifted, we believe that Congress is going to address this and needs to address it, and the other issues associated with this as well such as the Jones Act, cross-border pipelines in the RFS, that's been our position and I think that we continue to believe that.", "It's hard to pick one particular issue and focus attention on that without looking at the overall energy policy that we have here in the U.S. in aggregate. So we talked to our government relations guys all the time. We know that there is a lot of conversation taking place around crude oil exports, but we're not seeing it being promoted in any kind of material way at this point in time.", "Now, if you go to the practical side of this, we are still importers of crude in the United States. We import significant volumes, probably still 4.5 millions barrels per day, and that's not from Canada. There is additional volumes that are coming from Canada. So you've got crude that's being brought into the country.", "You've got at market right now that is putting downward pressure on crude prices, and you ultimately will get to who's got the lowest cost to produce to determine who is going to be continuing to produce and provide the supply. So I, honestly, am not sure where you would see domestically produced crude being exported today as it's trying to find its way through refining capacity globally. So issues flare up and then they tend to calm down a little bit. This one is still getting some conversations, but I don't think our perspective has changed from what we've talked about historically.", "Neil Mehta", "The other question is around Brent WTI just separately. You made the comment that you think they has the potential to widen out here over the next couple of months. What's driven the widening over the last couple of weeks? What do you guys see in Cushing happening? And then as you think about where that widening could occur, is it on the TI LLS piece of the equation or is it Brent LLS?", "Gary Simmons", "Yes. So I would say the team has driven the Brent TI wide, as if you look at the DOE stats over the last two weeks, we had two very large crude bills. So it kind of starts to tell you that as the Saudi start forcing more medium sour barrels into the market, it displays that some of this like light sweetening will begin to light sweet. And as inventory is build then it means we need to wider for EIR in order to start the incentiving refineries to take that light barrel back into the market.", "So I think that's what's happened. I do think it will get wider to the point where we are incentivized to go back to light sweet. And I would tell you that I would expect that the Brent TI could be a little bit wider and part of that is also due to the fact that we're building all this inventory in Cushing, and so maybe the Brent TI is a little bit wider than the LLS to Brent Spread.", "Operator", "The next question comes Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.", "Chi Chow", "Just a couple of follow-ups there. I guess this is a really question for the second half of year. With the Line 9 reversal, what sort of volumes do you have committed on that line and what sorts of crudes are you expecting to move on? Is it Bakken or Syncrude or some other Canadian barrel?", "Joseph Gorder", "So I don't think we've talked about our line commitment is. What we've said is when Line 9 comes up, we'll be able to completely supply the Quebec refinery with North American domestic barrels. In terms of the quality of crude, we would expect to ship. About 50% of the volume we ship would be a synthetic-type barrel and the other mix of other Canadian light sweet Bakken.", "Chi Chow", "And do those crudes, when you bring them in, are they going to change the yield at all or are they going increase the possibility from product standpoint on yields and volumes.", "Joseph Gorder", "So what we would say is with the change in diet, the crudes that we anticipate getting off Line 9 tend to be a higher distillate yield crude. And so we do show that they have a margin advantage as long as distillate is over gasoline compared to some of the West African grades that we run today, which tend to be a higher gasoline yield crude.", "Chi Chow", "And then a couple of questions just for Mike. I guess, you've got to couple of debt maturities this year, what's the timing of those? And secondly, how do you think about sort of a minimum cash balance that you're comfortable operating at.", "Michael Ciskowski", "The timings, there's 400 is due next week. I believe it is. And then we have 75 that's couple of months later is on the timing. And what was the second question?", "Chi Chow", "Just how you think about minimum cash balance? What sort of minimum levels are you comfortable operating at?", "Michael Ciskowski", "I mean we really don't have a minimum cash balance identified, but when you look at our operations, I think, we are comfortable in the range of around $2 billion.", "End of Q&A", "Operator", "At this moment, we show no further questions. I will like to turn the meeting over to you for any closing remarks.", "Joseph Gorder", "Thank you, Hilda. We appreciate everyone calling in and those listening today.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to John Locke. You may begin.", "John Locke", "Thank you, Christine. Good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations and Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero's senior management team.", "If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com.

As John will cover in more detail shortly, we reported record first quarter earnings per share. With great performance in a favorable margin environment we demonstrated Valero's earnings power in a heavy maintenance period. The one thing that I'd like to reaffirm with you before we proceed is that our team remains focused on executing our strategies to improve our valuation through operations excellence, optimizing our business through disciplined capital allocation and unlocking asset value.", "With that John I'll hand it back over to you.", "John Locke", "Okay, great thank you Joe. What we like to do now is highlight a few accomplishments this quarter, that aligned with our key strategies and then we\u2019ll cover the quarterly results. As noted in the release our focus on operations excellence yielded solid results while we successfully managed the heavy turnaround season in the first quarter. For the remainder of 2015 we have a lighter schedule of planned maintenance compared to the first quarter. We remain committed to deliver a payout ratio of earnings to our stockholders that exceeds 2014's ratio at 50%. So far we are on track to meet this goal with a 55% payout ratio on first quarter of 2015 earnings.", "Regarding capital investments, we continue to optimize and improve our business while maintaining rigor in our capital budget. For 2015 we maintained our guidance for capital spending, including turnarounds and catalysts at approximately $2.65 billion which excludes a $150 million for a St. Charles Methanol project. The proposed St. Charles Methanol project and Houston alkylation units remain under valuation and are progressing through our gaited project management process. We expect to make final investment decisions on these projects later in the second quarter.", "With respect to unlocking asset value and accelerating the growth of Valero Energy Partners LP, which is our sponsored Master Limited Partnership, we are clearly delivering growth and have a backlog of assets to dropdown. Given the closing of the $671 million dropdown of our Houston and St. Charles Terminal Services business in March we\u2019re on track to complete our goal of $1 billion of dropdown transactions in 2015.", "Now moving on to the quarterly results we reported net income from continuing operations of $964 million or $1.87 per share for the first quarter of 2015. Earnings per share was 21% higher than first quarter 2014 earnings per share of $1.54. The refining segment reported first quarter 2015 operating income of $1.6 billion versus $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2014. We covered the key drivers of this increase in the release but I'd like to highlight that while discounts were more narrow this quarter for most sweet and sour crude oils relative to Brent crude oil on a dollar per barrel basis.", "On a percentage discount basis these crude were priced more favorably in 2015. For example, in the first quarter of 2015 my [ph] priced on average at a 20% discount to Brent versus a 17% discount in the first quarter of 2014. Our significant crude side flexibility allows us to adjust feedstocks and optimize margins based on the discount environment.", "Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.7 million barrels per day in the first quarter of 2015, which is an increase of 9,000 barrels per day versus the first quarter of 2014. Volumes and utilization rates in both periods were impacted by heavy plant maintenance. Refining cash operating expenses were $3.95 per barrel in the first quarter of 2015 or $0.04 per barrel lower than the first quarter of 2014. That\u2019s our 12th consecutive quarter with cash operating expenses below $4 per barrel. Our focus on safe and reliable operations, combined with advanced domestic energy costs provide us a global manufacturing competitive advantage.", "The ethanol segment generated $12 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2015 versus $243 million in the first quarter of 2014. While Ethanol margins compressed in the first quarter of 2015 they have rebounded some here in April. Longer term we believe Ethanol remains a key component of the transportation fuel mix.", "General and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $147 million in the first quarter of 2015, which is $13 million lower than the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to changes in legal reserves. Also in the first quarter of 2015, net interest expense was $101 million and total depreciation and amortization expense was $441 million. The effective tax rate was 31.7%. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end total debt was $7.4 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $4.9 billion of which $28 million was held by VLP.", "Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio, net [ph] of $2 billion in cash was 20.3%.Valero had over $10 billion of available liquidity including cash. Cash flows in the first quarter included $698 million in capital spending, of which $240 million was for turnarounds and catalysts. We also issued $1.45 billion of debt which included $1.25 billion of bonds in March for general corporate purposes, including the refinancing of current maturities and $200 million issued by VLP to partially fund their March acquisition.", "We returned $531 million in cash to our stockholders in the first quarter, which included $206 million in dividend payments and $325 million for purchase of 5.4 million shares of Valero common stock. Year-to-date we have purchased 7.1 million shares for $429 million.", "Now for modeling our second quarter operations we expect throughput volumes to fall in the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.55 million to 1.6 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 280,000 to 300,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 460,000 to 480,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter to be around $3.90 per barrel.", "Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.7 million gallons per day in the second quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon, which includes $0.04 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization.", "We expect G&A expense, excluding corporate depreciation for the second quarter to be around $175 million and net interest expense should be about $105 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $445 million and our effective tax rate is expected to be around 33%.", "Christine, we have concluded our opening remarks. In a moment we will open the call to questions. During this segment we ask that our callers limit each turn to only two questions. Callers may rejoin the queue with additional questions as time permits.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Evan Calio", "Good morning guys. My first question relates to cash distributions and unlocking value, cash returns averaging 7% yield year-to-date, you also built a billion in cash in the quarter, you\u2019re now through the low end of your leverage guidance of 20% to 30%. I know you mentioned target payout ratio, how do you determine the optimal cash positions that continues to build and determine when to increase distributions from current rates?", "Michael Ciskowski", "Evan this is Mike. I do not have a precise number I can give you but what I can give you is that in our debt to cap ratio guidance, we reduced our debt by $2 billion [ph]. From there we would like to keep some cushion in our cash balance given the volatility of our business. And then we look at the future capital and working capital requirement and then the payout of greater than 50% that we\u2019ve already committed to you guys. But I would like to point out that excluding the debt issue that we had in the first quarter we actually had a decrease in cash about $300 million.", "Evan Calio", "Right, as you say, there\u2019s upside scope I guess from a $5 billion cash position to distribution, I guess would be my question.", "Michael Ciskowski", "Yeah, I mean I would just to add further, we had committed to the greater than 50% payout. As we move through the year and if burning some cash flow continue positive where they are we will assess this and consider increasing that payout number. Go ahead.", "Evan Calio", "Yeah understood, that makes sense. And then my second question in more on the product demand side and global credit spreads have been higher than expected year-to-date, global demand estimates continue to rise in response to low commodity prices. So is there any comments kind of what you\u2019re seeing through the system on demand trends and what you might expect for summer driving season we may not have seen in quite some time? Thanks.", "Gary Simmons", "Yeah, Evan this is Gary, I think definitely we\u2019ve been in a good credit spread environment. I would say early in the year it was probably driven from, we had some heavy turnaround maintenance, we find return on maintenance and that type of activity. Also I think the U.S.W Union negotiation came into the play then supported the credit spread. That\u2019s kind of behind it now and I think really the market is being driven up by demand. We\u2019ve seen some pretty encouraging numbers thus far. We expect that, that trend will continue but I think it\u2019s a little too early to tell what\u2019s the magnitude of the demand response will be to the credit price.", "Evan Calio", "Fair enough guys, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Neil Mehta", "Good morning.", "Joe Gorder", "Good morning.", "Neil Mehta", "So my first question is just thoughts on spreads and particular Brent oil last which Brent WTI is healthy right now, LOS Brent looks little bit tighter, just any thoughts there in potential bottlenecks between Houston and St. James?", "Gary Simmons", "Yeah, this is Gary again. I think the LOS to Brent spread has been a little bit narrow than what we would expect. I think ultimately the Gulf Coast Sweet market has the price at the level that allows the East Coast refiners to be able to receive domestic light sweet crude by [indiscernible]. So that kind is healthy overtime that LOS should be around $2 discount to Brent as long as the standard transportation differentials are going to hold. I think on what you\u2019re seeing today is the Houston market is bottlenecked with logistics getting the paid gains [ph] and so we\u2019re seeing Houston trade at much wider discounts to St. James than where it had been and so that\u2019s going ahead, [indiscernible] that economics to hold but they\u2019re right kind of breakeven and I would expect LOS to come off.", "Neil Mehta", "Okay, that\u2019s very helpful and then on RINS, just any thoughts as we get into the second quarter here on where RINS prices are and how we should assess the impact on a go forward basis?", "Martin Parrish", "This is Martin Parrish. So we think the RINS are just where they are, just waiting on the EPA announcement in June and just the uncertainty even though the EPA set it at the levels as everybody just waiting to see. So I think after June we'll see what happens then.", "Neil Mehta", "All right, very good. Thank you very much guys and talk soon.", "Joe Gorder", "Thanks Neil.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Edward Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Edward Westlake", "Yes, good morning and I guess the first question still on the macro side. We are seeing a decent tanker [indiscernible] still from the Gulf of - Saudi are still pumping. I mean you drilled Mexico and Venezuela how would you characterize at the moment supply availability of water borne mediums inside into the system.", "Gary Simmons", "I feel very good. Like you said we actually in the first quarter ran more South American crudes than what we've historically run. The Saudi are committed to the U.S. market. So I don't know that we'll go back to levels of imports that we saw three years ago. But I definitely think that volumes into the US Gulf will be up from what we saw last year. We're seen a lot more heavy Canadian than historical. So overall the Gulf Coast seems well supplied with all grades crudes.", "Edward Westlake", "Right, okay. And on the VLP, I mean obviously a great - in March, a $1 billion, clearly very easy to achieve. Any view of going faster or you just hoping that $1 billion which is obviously a still healthy pace is the right pace going forward.", "Joe Gorder", "No, and this is Joe. And we're very comfortable with the $1 billion pace this year and so that would imply that we're going execute another drop sometime in the second half of the year, probably later in the second half of the year. But what our real focus is, is on the distribution increase and we're committed to growing into that 25% plus this year for the next couple of years. So we're very comfortable with the pace we've got right now.", "Edward Westlake", "Okay, thanks very much Joe.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Paul Cheng", "Hey guys good morning.", "Joe Gorder", "Hi Paul.", "Paul Cheng", "Joe, couple of years I think the company when looking at California has always said is not really a core for the long haul, and you're looking for, if someone give you a okay price that you would sell, is there any change in the view from management about how you look at California from a long-term standpoint. And if it is now part of your long-term portfolio? Is there any initiative for you that you're picking to improve the result relative to your key value seems to be lacking in there?", "Joe Gorder", "Yeah, well Paul we've said this before that on the west coast we have very good assets and we have very good management teams operating those assets. And frankly we view our portfolio on the west coast as an option when the margins are strong on the west coast. And certainly we're experiencing that today and we had a very good first quarter. If you don't mind Paul what I'll do is let Lane just speak to our capital approach to the west coast.", "Lane Riggs", "Hey Paul it's Lane. We just continue to be very disciplined in our capital. We look for small opportunistic enterprise to improve margin capture but we in, terms of like any major capital program we - in the event that we spend much money we have better opportunities in our Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent. So I would say though one of the things you'll see in terms of our margin capture because we need to make so much gasoline you'll see our capture versus an index probably got better. The first quarter is really a story of on the west coast to the west coast gasoline fracs.", "Paul Cheng", "The second question, Mike going back into the cash position, is there a lag or you can share what is the comfort level of the cash that you want to hold?", "Michael Ciskowski", "Well, I don't really have guidance for you on like a minimum cash balance but you can start with the $2 billion that we use in our debt calculation. And then we would like to keep some cushion in that given the volatility of our business.", "Paul Cheng", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Chi Chow of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.", "Chi Chow", "Hey, thanks, good morning.", "Joe Gorder", "Good morning Chi.", "Chi Chow", "I have a couple of questions on the North Atlantic market. You've realized strong double digit margins in that region for two quarters running now. Tad one [ph] and European cracks been pretty robust over this period. What do you think is the sustainability of those tighter product markets in that Atlantic Basin region?", "Gary Simmons", "Well, I think there is a number of reasons for what we have seen in the first quarter and I think some of it is sustainable, you know obviously we had strong turnaround maintenance in that area as well, colder weather helped - always helped with demand but I think you are seeing good demand response in a lower crack price which is certainly constructive moving forward. I think the other thing that is happening the U.S. dollar strength versus the Europe it helped us with our operating costs, it is and - Pembroke as well. So I think there is a lot of encouraging signs on it.", "Joe Gorder", "This is Joe, the one thing I would add to Gary\u2019s point, which are all correct is that the Pembroke asset is a very good asset and what we acquired when we bought that refinery was an integrated system. So when you think about merchant refining in Europe you really shouldn\u2019t think about Pembroke in that regard. The distillate barrels that we produce are moved in inland and certainly a significant volume of the gasoline moves inland. So it is a little bit difference set-up than some might be experiencing.", "Chi Chow", "Are you concerned about distillate crack spud weakness going forward with all the global capacity that\u2019s come online over the year, last year or so.", "Joe Gorder", "I would say we are not that concerned about the distillate cracks in our system. I think there is a couple of things, the U.S. market has been so strong we still see good export demand. However, we have been somewhat priced out of the market because our market has been so strong. So I think we think moving forward we will see a combination of a better demand domestically and we will see that our export volumes will pick-up again as the U.S. market falls off a little bit.", "Chi Chow", "What were your export volumes for the quarter on gas and diesel?", "Joe Gorder", "It is our gasoline was down a little bit at 94,000 barrels a day. The reason for that was really just because of the strength in the U.S. market. You know again this is an optimization for us and we would kind of say the way we optimize that it is more demand push rather than supply push and the export markets really weren\u2019t strong in on gasoline to pull the barrels away from goal. Our distillate volume were fairly flat about 205,000 barrels a day ULSD. If you look at the ULSD plus kerosene we were up, 255,000 [ph] barrels a day, so fairly consistent there. The change we saw for a lot of the first quarter in Europe was in open, so we are usually 64 between Latin America and Europe 70% of our volume actually went to Latin America and we did see that for the Europe that we predict foreseeing.", "Chi Chow", "And one more question on the North Atlantic, can you talk how the 9 million [ph] reversal is going to impact your crude sourcing options going forward?", "Michael Ciskowski", "Yes, I will give you little update on that you know we are still waiting for regulatory approval on land from the National Energy Board in Canada. We don\u2019t know the timeline on that. We feel like there is a good chance the NEB could approve that by mid-May. With a mid-May approval that would mean we really won\u2019t see any impact from line 9 in the second quarter.", "But we are optimistic we will start to receive oil in the third quarter, gives us a lot more flexibility in Quebec to be able to have the access to those Western Canadian and Bakken grades and not just relay on rail and U.S. Gulf Coast sourced barrels.", "Chi Chow", "Okay, thanks. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank.", "Ryan Todd", "Okay, thanks. Good morning gentlemen. Maybe if I could follow-up first with a follow-up question on VLP, is there earlier we talked about the potential for any evaluation of the wholesale fuel distribution EBITDA as a potential to drop the VLP. Maybe can you talk a little bit about whether that has done evaluation and any rough guidance to what that figure might look like?", "Michael Ciskowski", "Yeah, Ryan this is Mike again. You know we are still evaluating that in the appropriate structure that we would consider to drop in the MLP. So I do not have a number that I can give to you on this call.", "Ryan Todd", "Okay, great. I appreciate and then maybe just a general I mean we see the margin on the screen which looks supportive. But can you give us maybe just an update on what you are seeing a month in the second quarter in terms of the general operating environment?", "Michael Ciskowski", "Yes, I think we are - the cracks continue to be strong and we continue to see good discounts on the crude. The big change probably has been in the crude market, some of the discounts could commence and we're run the lot more light sweet crude in our system today than what we did in the first quarter. But again I think we're seeing good demands both in the export markets and domestic demands. And so feel very encouraged about the profitability moving forward.", "Ryan Todd", "Okay great, thanks. I appreciate it.", "Joe Gorder", "Thanks Ryan.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Dietert of Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Dietert", "Good morning.", "Joe Gorder", "Good morning Jeff.", "Jeff Dietert", "I had a strategic question. I think historically Valero\u2019s been a little bit more of a refining pure play relative to some of the peer strategies that have been more integrated. You guys have sold off NuStar interest in Corner Store. And I was just hoping for an update on now Valero strategy is evolving going forward. What do you think about integration through the value chain do you expect a materially larger mid-stream business.", "Joe Gorder", "Jeff that's a good question. I mean very clearly we are fuels manufacturing company. And certainly that involves refining it also involves our renewable fuels business. So that is it is such a significant part of the portfolio today to see any significant shift from that it just really - is not in the cards now.", "To answer your question on the mid-stream business. I do think we're going to see our midstream business expands significantly over the next several years. And as we've said our strategy in mid-stream is really to develop projects and acquire assets that are supportive of Valero's core businesses and I think if you look at the investments that we've made to date it would certainly support that. That being said the refining portfolio is large enough and the renewables portfolio is large enough that it provides plenty of opportunity for growth within that midstream business.", "I don't think you should expect us though to be looking upstream from where we are today in any material way or significantly downstream from where we are today. Although opportunities present themselves and you look at it but certainly that's not part of our plan today.", "Jeff Dietert", "Thank you and secondly, looking through your refinery throughput guidance for the second quarter, it looked relatively conservative and my question is what are the LPs suggesting that you should max run, under what conditions would you run more aggressively or perhaps less aggressively.", "Michael Ciskowski", "I think in terms of throughput probably be the biggest thing. And change as we see a pretty good rate level on some of our plants depending on if we're maximizing heavy sour versus light sweet especially like at $4 Jeff. It can change our throughput significantly when we start maximizing light sweet over heavy sour. I would say that was the only thing I can speak.", "Jeff Dietert", "Thanks for your comments.", "Joe Gorder", "Thanks Jeff.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Brad Heffern", "Good morning everyone.", "Joe Gorder", "Good morning.", "Brad Heffern", "So just following up on the couple of previous answers looking for a little more color. I think in the first quarter you all talked about just the sheer number of water borne that were trying to find their way into the Valero system. Is the fact that you're running less water borne now and more domestic suggest that maybe the global crude environment is and is oversupplied as it was a few months ago.", "Michael Ciskowski", "I think there has been a couple of events that are kind a driving the crude differentials. First, the medium seller market in the Gulf due to the market structure a lot of people were pulling their barrels off the market trying to hold them in collective role. So it kind of tightened up the medium sours. Now the storage is getting full. You also have some turnaround maintenance going on to the Deepwater pipe ones in the Gulf that's kind of also tightening the market a little bit. And then the heavy sour side in the Myer [ph] of course you had the buyer on the platform in Mexico which has also disrupted production there.", "So as my view is that these crudes as they compete with the light sweet we'll see the differentials come back as we move in the second quarter.", "Brad Heffern", "And okay that's great color. And then maybe for Joe, a lot of E&P's have seem pretty confidence of way that the crude export ban is going to be lifted in the near term maybe in 2015. Do you have any updated thoughts or anything you've been hearing about that.", "Joe Gorder", "Well I think we're probably hearing the same thing that you're hearing and we know that there is activity in the house and decided to bring the issue forward. But certainly the administration does doesn\u2019t seem at all receptive to this. Anyhow just to be clear on our position we believe in free and open market. As we talked about many times there\u2019s currently legislation and regulation in place that hinders the petroleum markets from being free and open and these for the included things like the crude export ban, RFS, the Jones and others. So we believe that looking at a specific issue relative to that overall issue is just not the right way to deal with this topic and you need to deal with all of the issues.", "One thing about Valero is that we\u2019ve continued to invest and we\u2019re running significant quantities of domestic crude today and we continue to invest to enable us to run more of this crude. So we\u2019re doing what we can to process it as are many other refiners. And then really the last point on this is when you look at the general need for crude exports the U.S. remains a net importer of crude oil with about 7 million barrels per day coming in we certainly export much lower volumes than that. So the question becomes do you really need the export and I think that\u2019s the question on everybody\u2019s mind.", "Brad Heffern", "Okay, great that\u2019s it from me, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Doug Leggate", "Thanks good morning everyone. Morning Joe.", "Joe Gorder", "Morning Doug.", "Doug Leggate", "If I could follow up on the last question on exports Joe from what we\u2019re seeing it looks like light sweet imports from Middle East in particular, looking at Kuwait in particular this is one example, they actually seem kind of increasing I'm just curious as to what is your strategy around accessing light sweet or just generally crudes outside of the U.S. and how do you think that impacts the crude export to-date? I think that\u2019s one of the key issues as the net balance as opposed to just the issue itself?", "Joe Gorder", "Sure Doug, I\u2019ll let Gary, if you don\u2019t mind we\u2019ll let Gary speak to the imports.", "Gary Simmons", "Yes, so Doug I would tell that primarily what we see from Kuwait is really not light sweet is more medium sour barrels and I would tell you that we have had many discussions with them and they seem interested on maintaining or actually growing market share in the U.S. on that grades of crude and the light sweet what we see happened is with all this volatility in the Brent TI moving in and out when the order comes in very narrow then we start to see incentives to import light sweet. In the first quarter we definitely saw that and as I\u2019ve discussed in the past the first place we generally see is at Kuwait and there were certainly times during the first quarter where the Brent TI got narrow and that incentivized to step back in and buy Brent related West African type crudes.", "Doug Leggate", "Okay I appreciate the answer. Obviously we\u2019re watching this one closely, but my follow up Joe is really on the return of cash to shareholders and it\u2019s obviously the share price I guess like all other financial have done well from a lot of this trend in the first quarter and I think you said you guys said yourself in the prepared remarks the business is obviously volatile. When you think about the last time your predecessor had a very substantial share buyback program and where are the share prices now in the flight to Euro again embarking on a very substantial share buyback program how do you think about balancing the timing and I guess the balance between dividends and other methods of returning cash as opposed to just right buying back stock at current levels and I\u2019ll leave there, thanks.", "Joe Gorder", "All right Doug I\u2019ll speak to it briefly and see if Mike has anything to add but the timing of the market is something that is almost impossible to do, right. I think the particular transaction you\u2019re referring to might have been the accelerated share repurchase that we executed some years ago and we don\u2019t have plans to do that. Now I don\u2019t want to get into being specific about our strategies around share repurchases other than that we\u2019ve committed to this greater than 50% payout ratio which we said would be a blend of repurchases and the dividend. We had a significant increase in the dividend at the end of January and we continue to look at cash and how we\u2019re going to employ it. What the capital budget is very manageable in the current context so I think if you said what are your plans are I think our plan is to continue to buyback share certainly to meet that greater than 50% target. Mike is there anything that you?", "Michael Ciskowski", "I think that\u2019s well said.", "Joe Gorder", "Okay.", "Doug Leggate", "Thanks a lot everyone.", "Joe Gorder", "All right Doug.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Phil Gresh", "Hi good morning.", "Joe Gorder", "Good morning Phil.", "Phil Gresh", "First question just on the midstream M&A potential. Appreciate the color you've given already just a follow up, would you rather have more EBITDA drop at this point before you consider midstream M&A at VLP. Are you comfortable within out of EBITDA there already and to extent that you would consider midstream M&A would you likely or do have developed any other Valero level given the cash that you have available right now.", "Michael Ciskowski", "Phil, this is Mike. I think at this point in VLP stage they've probably would prefer to do the drops and get a little bit more sizable before they start taking on third party acquisitions. As you know the drops come with the minimum volume commitments they you may not all even get in the third party deal, depending on the deal so given their size I would say the drops are the more likely have that they will go.", "Phil Gresh", "Got it okay. And just one final question the export ban. I guess the question is really like if you think about the ban being lifted if it were to happen. Would this materially change how you manage your business whether its growth projects or refine your logistics potential M&A aspirations just generally how do you think about the way you're managing your business today versus in that kind of a world and how you think about crude differentials.", "Joe Gorder", "Well Just I'll fly over this and then let Gary speak to it if he would like to also our strategy is to optimize our operations. And that is a broad statement I know when it goes to our crude and feedstock slate it goes to our disposition of our products and it goes to our capital investments. And so I think what you would see certainly there is nothing that we're doing today that I would say we need to change in a crude export environment. We'll have to see what the market does and how the market will respond to that. I mean I guess you're pushing you'll be pushing additional crude barrels into the markets that seems to be well supplied today. And so the question are might this how the market is going to react to that and honestly if I don't think we're smart enough to tell you what that will be. Gary you\u2026?", "Gary Simmons", "No, I agree. I think overall even if the export ban is lifted we would continue to have a location advantage running the domestic crudes. We continue to have significant operating costs advantage with the cheap natural gas. And then we're very happy with our portfolio of refining assets that are very complex very efficient refineries.", "Joe Gorder", "And whether there is have a - material change on your real crude differentials?", "Gary Simmons", "No, I don't think so I think overall the crude have to continue it compete or stays in refineries and so we're going to be the beneficiary in that.", "Phil Gresh", "Okay great thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Sam Margolin of Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Sam Margolin", "Good morning. I wanted to ask you about the notes offering, familiar within the context of the gated process that you guys have talked about a lot. How was the pricing sort of relative to your expectations, did it change anything as far as return hurdles and maybe opening up some more capital intensive optimization plans or even or even on the M&A side? I mean it was a pretty in line with what you're expecting.", "Joe Gorder", "Yes, the interest rates were well and pretty much where we expect for that offering coming at. I mean the funds will be used for general corporate purposes including the refinancing of our current maturities. I do not think that the issuance of that debt will increase any gated capital project or anything like that. It was just an opportunity to issue debt at low rate.", "Sam Margolin", "Okay thanks a lot. And I don't think I heard you guys mentioned Methanol in the prepared remarks. So I'm assuming this question is again it gave any far. But I'll ask anyway. Is there anything incremental there to update us with there with or is it still just in the evaluative stages and or wait on the final decision.", "Lane Riggs", "Hey Sam this is Lane so I'll just give a bit of an update. It's kind of where it's been. We anticipated our funding decisions here late in the second quarter. I'll just add any real consider this project going forward and our strategy we'd obviously more likely have a partner and we I would add that in terms of comment, that we're still on track to review this project here in the late second quarter.", "Sam Margolin", "All right, perfect, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Roger Read", "Good morning.", "Joe Gorder", "Hello, Roger.", "Roger Read", "Just wanted to follow-up, I guess, Jeff Dietert\u2019s question about potential higher throughputs and what signals maybe we need to look forward here either in terms of Brent LOS relationship or are there other sort of last mile pipeline issues in the Gulf Coast to think you hit you know higher throughput number in the second quarter here potentially hitting a higher number I would say.", "Joe Gorder", "I don\u2019t really know what link come in the only thing I can think we are definitely signaling higher runs of light sweet crude which can have a late leverage at some of our heavy sour refiners but I don\u2019t know of anything else that would signal significantly different throughputs.", "Lane Riggs", "No, right now our economic signals maximum throughput and Gary mentioned in the earlier answer there are obviously a rate thing that occurred in whether we were running light, medium or heavy sour crudes that obviously doesn\u2019t impact on our overall throughput.", "Roger Read", "Okay, thanks. And then back to the OpEx initial comments mentioning under $4 for several quarters on a row here and then you know FX strength that helped out Pembroke. So could you kind of walk us through is there anything that you have operationally challenged and succeed or we are looking at you know it is cheap natural gas and it is an FX item flowing through this healthcare lower OpEx and I know throughput\u2019s being high also helps on a per barrel basis but if there is anything else you can offer that will be great.", "Lane Riggs", "This is Lane. I want to say we are always vigilant on operating cost is our culture we work every day, every month, every hour, to make sure that we are busy maintaining our fixed and our structural operating it is into natural gas prices in the first quarter versus the fourth in last year throughputs were a little bit and so partially offset by that and we will absolutely maintain our focus volume and having lower operating cost.", "Roger Read", "But nothing specifically you think about it is just general pressure on the system?", "Lane Riggs", "No, no.", "Roger Read", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. Please go ahead.", "Blake Fernandez", "Hi, guys, good morning. Two questions for you if I could; one, you mentioned in the press release the benefit of the secondary product pricing and I assume that is just kind of some spill over from the glut in crude prices but now that we are starting to see kind of reversal in the crude markets and moving higher. Are you starting to see a bit of a reversal on that secondary product pricing here into 2Q?", "Joe Gorder", "Well I would definitely say that you know when you get out into the products other than gasoline [indiscernible] PATCO, LPG a lower slot price environment tend to have these products trade closer to group value and it helps track realization and as crude moves up and the reserve will also be true.", "Blake Fernandez", "Okay. Gary, secondly just a follow-on for me previous exports commentary the shift that we have seen basically away from Europe. Can you just talk a little bit about the upper - needed there in other words to drive the economics to incentivize transport over to Europe is it basically like a $1, $2 a barrel that is needed and then maybe as a follow-on to that. Do you have any sense I know you mentioned indigenous demand growth here, but do you have any sense that maybe from European utilization rates moving up there or any of the new global facilities beginning to penetrate that market do you have any color there? I appreciate it, thanks.", "Gary Simmons", "Yeah, I guess I will start with that. I think we just still feel like our traditional exports markets are there for us as long as it is economic for us to supply those markets and we have seen a move back to where we are Europe it is open you know it basically is just looking at the differences in the two markets, freight and then we are also taking to effect the RINS. And so the higher RINS prices that we are seeing today helps incentivize exports basically to Europe. So you know freight generally were lower $2 you know to get a barrel to Europe and the RINS in the 71 that range that kind of give you the differential that\u2019s needed to support exports.", "Blake Fernandez", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Paul Cheng", "Hey, guys, I have two quick follow-up. One, Joe can you give us or maybe this is for Lane, the [indiscernible] expansion are we done that, or that what is the schedule there?", "Lane Riggs", "No, we\u2019re finished there, this is Lane by the way Paul, we finished that in the third quarter this year.", "Paul Cheng", "All right. And maybe that this is for Gary. Gary, are you guys currently, given the current defense. Are you exporting crude oil from the Gulf Coast to Quebec? And that also after the Line 9 reversal complete do you still need to export from the Gulf Coast or that you will get sufficient Western Canadian crude into Quebec?", "Gary Simmons", "Yes. Paul so we are exporting from the Gulf to Quebec in the first quarter little over a 70% of our diet was crude sourced from Canada and the US gulf and post Line 9 we would still anticipate that we would see some flow of oil from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Canada over the water.", "Paul Cheng", "Can I ask a final question?", "Joe Gorder", "Just for you", "Paul Cheng", "Thank you. In the last two years when we look at from the first to the second quarter, your margin capture rate seems highest on an average drop by about 10%. Into the first quarter this year that do you have a far more heavy down time especially in the Gulf Coast and in the second quarter your - is going to be much higher. So should we still assume that your margin capture rate would be the pattern will be similar to the last two years that drop of roughly above 10% from the first quarter therefore or that it should deviate somewhat differently?", "Joe Gorder", "Yeah, Paul so generally what would be happening in the transition for the first to second quarter you go through our VP [ph] transition on the gasoline and decrease ethane blending which drive down our crack repayment. You\u2019re correct that as we have lighter turnaround main region in the Gulf it should offset some of that where we come out I don\u2019t know but I\u2019ve to look at it.", "Paul Cheng", "Okay. Thank you.", "Joe Gorder", "Thanks Paul.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to John Locke.", "John Locke", "Hey, great. Thanks Christine. We appreciate those who called in today and everyone listening. If you have additional questions please contact me or Karen in the IR department.", "Operator", "Thank you.

My name is Tiffany, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Locke. Mr. Locke, you may begin.", "John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Tiffany. Good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me today are: Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations and Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero's senior management team.", "If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.", "I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in our press release. In summary it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.", "Now I will turn the call over to Joe for a few opening remarks.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks very much, John, and good morning, everyone.", "As John will cover in more detail shortly, our team operated our system safely, reliably, and efficiently during the second quarter, allowing us to capture a very high percentage of the favorable margins available to us. In particular, we saw market conditions that incentivized maximum gasoline production in most regions.", "As for our priorities, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to stockholders by exceeding our total payout guidance. As reflected in the earnings release, we've increased the targeted total payout ratio for 2015 to approximately 75% of net income.", "We continue to advance the next dropdown transaction to Valero Energy Partners LP, which is our sponsored MLP. We've also completed our estimate of potential MLP-eligible EBITDA within our fuels distribution business. In that regard, we've identified approximately $350 million that may be eligible for dropdown transactions to VLP, which is incremental to the approximately $800 million of remaining EBITDA that we've previously identified.", "And finally, in regard to the proposed methanol project at St. Charles, we plan to have a final investment decision by the end of the fourth quarter. As a reminder, our prior investments in hydrogen production capacity at the refinery provide us with a competitive advantage versus a greenfield methanol plant in the U.S. Gulf Coast region.", "So with that, John, I'll hand it back over to you.", "John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations", "Great, thank you, Joe.", "Now moving on to the quarterly results, we reported net income from continuing operations of $1.4 billion or $2.66 per share versus second quarter 2014 earnings per share of $1.22. The refining segment reported operating income of $2.2 billion, notwithstanding planned turnaround work on the FCC [Fluid Catalytic Cracking] and alky [alkylation] units at our Port Arthur refinery.", "Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.8 million barrels per day, which is an increase of 87,000 barrels per day versus the second quarter of 2014. Our refineries operated at 96% throughput capacity utilization in the second quarter of 2015.", "Refining cash operating expenses were $3.66 per barrel in the second quarter of 2015, or $0.24 per barrel lower than the second quarter of 2014. Lower energy costs, primarily due to lower natural gas prices and less planned and unplanned downtime, were the main drivers for the decrease.", "The ethanol segment generated $108 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2015 versus $187 million in the second quarter of 2014. General and administrative expenses excluding corporate depreciation were $178 million in the second quarter of 2015. Also in the second quarter of 2015, net interest expense was $113 million, which is $15 million higher than in the second quarter of 2014, primarily due to the debt issuance in March of this year. Depreciation and amortization expense was $425 million. The effective tax rate was 30.8%.", "With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $7.3 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $5.8 billion, of which $52 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was approximately 20%. Valero had over $5 billion of available liquidity excluding cash.", "Cash flows in the second quarter included $530 million of capital spending, of which $160 million was for turnarounds and catalysts. We also repaid $75 million of debt that matured in June.", "We returned $870 million in cash to our stockholders in the second quarter, which included $203 million in dividend payments and $667 million for the purchase of 11.3 million shares of Valero common stock. Year to date we've purchased 19.5 million shares for $1.2 billion.", "For modeling our third quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.57 million to 1.62 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 445,000 to 465,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 275,000 to 295,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 475,000 to 495,000 barrels per day.", "We expect refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter to be around $3.75 per barrel.", "Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day in the third quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.04 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization.", "We expect G&A expense excluding corporate depreciation for the third quarter to be around $180 million, and net interest expense should be about $110 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $450 million. And our effective tax rate is expected to be around 33%.", "Lastly, following the EPA's announcement of proposed RFS [Renewable Fuel Standards] targets in late May and the subsequent decline in Ethanol RINs [Renewable Identification Numbers] prices, we expect 2015 RINs expense to be between $350 million and $450 million.", "Tiffany, we have concluded our opening remarks. In a moment, we will open the call to questions. During the Q&A, we ask that our callers please limit each turn to two questions. Callers may rejoin the queue with additional questions as time permits.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. And our first question comes from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Neil, you may go ahead.", "Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Morning, Neil.", "Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Joe, we continue to see this tremendous bifurcation in the crack between gasoline and diesel. Is this the world that you envision here over the next couple months or even into 2016, where gasoline stays strong and diesel stays weak? And can you talk about the demand dynamics you're seeing from the product side between those two different categories?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You bet, Neil. It's probably best if Gary Simmons spoke to that. He's closest to the market.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "Neil, I guess what I would say is we certainly expected some price demand elasticity for gasoline with the fall in flat price. And we've seen that, and we didn't really know exactly what the magnitude of the pent-up demand would be. And it's been a very pleasant surprise, and I think we do expect that that response will continue into the future.", "Overall, you talk about diesel margins being weak. Really diesel margins are about where they've been historically. It's just mainly the strength in gasoline. We would see that there would be some seasonality. As we get out of driving season, we would certainly expect some fall-off in gasoline demand. But as long as we see the lower prices, I think we expect the demand response to continue to be good.", "Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Very good. And then the follow-up here is on the methanol project. Maybe I'm over-interpreting the remarks here, but it sounds like you're more constructive on a possible project. Can you talk through the pluses and minuses associated with methanol and just remind us of some of the project economics?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, we'll let Lane talk to this and then we'll all add.", "R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering", "Neil, this is Lane. Just as a reminder on the fundamentals of that project, it's really a natural gas-to-liquids project. And we still have a long view that natural gas is going to be advantaged going forward, and it is one of the most economical ways to get natural gas into the liquids, crude-related pricing environment. We did review all of the way up through Gate 3. The project still looks good. But as we've mentioned in all of our Investor Relations meetings, where we are now is trying to get the right deal with a partner to make this a good deal for our shareholders, and that's what we're working on currently. And we expect to have some resolution on that by the end of this year or early first quarter. What else was it?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think that covers it. Neil, honestly, the project looks good and the guys have now identified what the capital might look like, and we're just working through the negotiations with a partner on what the transaction might look like. We consider having gas-to-liquids projects as good projects for us. We also consider that entering into what we would consider to a be a bit of a new line of business, it's always prudent to try to manage that risk and to look for opportunities not only to do a project like this but additional projects going forward. So again, we continue to advance it. I would tell you we feel pretty good about it. And if we can get the type of deal that we're looking for, I would suspect that we'd advance it.", "Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks, Joe.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You bet.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Paul, you may go ahead.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, guys, good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Paul.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Joe, one of your competitors recently did a deal using the high-currency MLP vehicle to buy another MLP, and the end result for the C-Corp has been quite excellent. And last year the other competitor of yours did something similar. So I know that you guys have been focusing on the dropdown. But given the success from your competitor, is that something that you guys will reconsider, maybe shifting the strategy a bit here or that you're going to stick with dropdown?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Paul, I didn't see the transaction that you're talking about. I'm teasing you. But I think, look, we've seen two transactions now take place like this. Let me start by saying we clearly understand the value of the general partnership and we understand the value of pushing to the high splits.", "That being said, we're very comfortable with the approach that we've taken thus far with our dropdowns. We'll execute the second dropdown transaction later this year, and I think that you could expect that going into next year that dropdowns will probably be accelerated somewhat further. But it's always a matter of opportunity and timing, and for us we don't believe that VLP currently is positioned to do a transaction similar to this on their own. They don't have their investment-grade rating. We're probably a year behind these others in getting an MLP into the marketplace. And so we believe that right now the most prudent thing to do is to execute the strategy that we've laid out, and then longer term we'll look for opportunities.", "And obviously, these deals seem to be a double-edged sword. They do create significant value at the C-Corp, but they've also had a fairly questionable effect on the LP. And so in a perfect world, we could get a transaction that would benefit both, but right now our focus is on continuing to do the dropdowns.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay, second question. Maybe this is for you or for Simmons. There seems to be a tightness in the alkylate or the high-octane component in the market today, and I just want to see whether you guys agree with that assessment. And secondly that if it is, how do you think the impact on the industry gasoline supply as well as the gasoline crack? Thank you.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "Yes, Paul, so this is Gary. We certainly do see that all heavy octane components are trading at a significant premium. I think there are several driving factors here that are causing that to occur. One, you have a very wide spread between naphtha and gasoline, so that's incentivizing people to try to blend naphtha into the gasoline pool. In order to make that happen, you have to have a high octane blend component.", "The second thing that's happened is there has been quite a bit of planned and unplanned maintenance on re-formers and Appalachian units throughout the industry. So some of it is supply-related. And then finally, some of these export markets, in particular Mexico, we're seeing a lot of good demand for Mexico for gasoline. And although the octane retirements in Mexico are comparable to what we have here in the U.S., they have an olefin spec on their gasoline, NPT and olefins, and that forces you to blend a lot more reformate and alkylate and less TET gasoline in order to sell your product into that market. So I think this is something that we see that will continue into the future.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Gary, can I ask a slightly somewhat different question? With the LLS mass discount we know with Maya is over $4 and LLS priced at $50, it seems like you guys must be printing money in processing the medium sour, and especially comparing to the Maya discount is not really attractive. So do you think that it will ultimately force the Maya discount to be wider now, or that you're actually going to see the mass discount narrow from here?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "I think we're into a period where the crude discounts will be very favorable for us in the third quarter. Yes, economically right now we're incentivized to maximize medium sours in our system. I think the hard thing to see when you talk about heavy sours is certainly we agree with your comment; Maya is not priced competitively today. When we roll to August, they have widened the K by another $1.50. And most of the heavy sours that we're buying are not off the Maya formula, which gives us a good incentive for those as well.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Paul.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. You may go ahead, Ed.", "Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "I think gasoline is going to be a seam \u2013 congrats on the results. I was just looking at a chart which showed that globally we're 2.5 million barrels a day more gasoline demand than we were before the financial crisis. So how possible is it do you think, and obviously specs have tightened as well around the world, particularly for summer grades. And how possible is it do you think that we just hit a tipping point and this could take some time to resolve?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "I think it will take some time to resolve. We're certainly running all of our gasoline producing units at max utilization. We've seen good utilization in Europe. And as you've mentioned, we're having trouble keeping up with gasoline inventories. So I think it will be here for an extended period.", "Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Coming back then to the more strategic payout versus growth, obviously you've been very clear about what you're planning to do this year. Presumably with VLP also being a little bit, should we say, still needing to develop before you could do something maybe more strategic with that, you would continue to adopt that through into 2016 because obviously your guidance was very much this year. Maybe some broader comments about payout versus reinvesting for growth in the business.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, and so let's put VLP to the side for just a minute. But, Ed, we believe that growth and return of cash to shareholders aren't mutually exclusive, and I think that we've been demonstrating that. We've shared in our analyst presentations a definition of what we would consider to be discretionary and non-discretionary uses of cash, and we explained how we've created a competition within Valero for the use of that cash. And from a capital project perspective, it's largely based on the adequacy of the returns and then the timing to get the projects through our gated process to where we're looking at doing that.", "But I don't want \u2013 with our increase in the payout ratio, we view this as an opportunity to return what we would deem to be excess cash to shareholders. It's not at the expense of starving the organization of capital certainly for our maintenance projects but also for our growth strategy projects. We forget that we've got two crude units that we've spent somewhere around $800 million on excluding tanks and infrastructure to support those. Those two projects will be on the first part of next year. We've got investments that we made in Line 9 assets that are going to allow us to take that crude into the refineries, which will provide significant crude benefits for us. That hasn't shown up yet in the earnings because of course Line 9 isn't functioning yet.", "So we've got a lot of things we're doing to drive growth in the earnings of our business in addition to returning cash to shareholders. But as we've communicated clearly too, I think we're being very disciplined in our assessment and in our communications of our plans around these projects, and we'll continue to do that. It doesn't mean that Lane and his team aren't looking at a host of very interesting projects for the refining business, but they tend not to be of the order of magnitude like the hydrocracker projects. They tend to be smaller, higher returns, and projects that we can execute quicker. As we run them to ground, we'll be happy to share them.", "Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Thanks very much, very clear.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You bet.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe. Paul, you may go ahead.", "Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Thank you. Hi, everyone. Could you talk a little bit about the outlook for utilization in the back half of the year, turnaround season firstly for you guys to the extent that you're prepared to do that? And then if you've got any observations on how you see the industry running, that would be helpful. Thanks.", "R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering", "Hey, Paul, this is Lane. So, we don't really provide forward-looking comments on our turnaround, but I will say I think you'll see a seasonal drop in utilization in the industry going into the late third and obviously the fourth quarter. But I do think you're going to see a pretty heavy turnaround season in the first and second quarter of next year. If you think back, we had the USW strikes, which caused many of our counterparts to delay much of their turnaround activity. So talking to our main contractors, we believe there's going to be a heavy turnaround season in the first half of next year.", "Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Interesting. Lane, while I've got you, could you talk a bit more about crude markets? Particularly, we've been consistently surprised this earnings season by the strength of U.S. oil production through Q2. And also I guess imports are high, and you've talked about some of the spreads that are attractive to you as regards imported barrels. How do you see the market playing out now? Do you get the sense that we are going to see a rollover in U.S. production or not? And also how sustainable do you think the import story is going to be? Thanks.", "R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering", "Paul, I'm going to have defer to my esteemed colleague, Mr. Simmons, on that, so he'll answer that.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "I think we've been surprised with the decline in rig count, production still seems to be holding. I don't really know that I can give you much insight whether that will continue or not.", "I think what we're seeing in terms of the imports is just the volatility in the crude markets. The Brent/TI [WTI] spread comes in and incentivizes people to start importing foreign light sweet. As we talked about in the past, the first place we tend to do that is our Quebec refinery, which we did in the second quarter. In fact, the Brent/TI spread got narrow enough that we even took some foreign light sweet into St. James. You see that same dynamic hold on the medium sours. We maximize Mars and domestic medium sour production into our refineries. And then as the differentials come in, we actually brought in some Brazilian grades to compete with that when the markets get tight. So I think as long as you see this volatility, you'll continue to see windows where it supports imports of crudes into the market.", "Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Sure, and I've seen particularly that the foreign light sweet is basically just West African that bounces in and out depending on where the spreads are.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "Primarily, yes.", "Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "When we go into turnaround season coming up and as distillate takes leadership in the market in general, I guess you'd be anticipating lower crude prices through Q3 and Q4 if we turn around \u2013 at least to this extent turn around the U.S. refining system.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "Yes, I would suspect that that would happen. We're sitting on a pretty good overhang of crude oil inventory here in the U.S. We're 90 million barrels above where we were last year. So with that overhang and then heading into a typical maintenance period where refiner demand is down, you would think that that would have pressure on the price of crude oil.", "Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Just checking, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Evan, you may go ahead.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good morning, guys, and I look forward to the VLP strategy evolution over time. My question is maybe a follow-up on the buyback. Given the cash position, especially with the dropdowns, and I know you raised that potential today, your net debt to cap is at 6%. Does that really imply that while active that you're pacing the buyback so you can continue at maybe a similar rate, even in the potentially seasonally weaker margins of other quarters, or really relate to some of the projects that you're maturing in your portfolio with the potential to change that CapEx outlook for 2016?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "When we look at our rate on our buybacks, this is Mike. We do look at our future capital and working capital requirements, and then also what we've committed to do to date. But we do realize that we had a great quarter. Our cash balance built despite doubling our buyback rate. So we will continue to look at these things as we move through the year.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And then, Evan, though, the tail on your question addressed 2016 CapEx. And we haven't gone through the process of reviewing 2016 details with the Board of Directors yet, so we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. But we don't see any material change to 2016's numbers. We've got good projects that have good returns, but as I mentioned, they tend to be much smaller. And we don't expect we're going to come out with a big huge capital number to drop on you.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, even with the methanol and/or alky unit proceeding?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Look, the methanol plant, as we've talked about, what we're really looking for in a partner there is somebody who's willing to put skin in the game along with us. And of course, we would view a significant part of our capital contribution to be the infrastructure and other assets that we're bringing to the table.", "So let's just assume that you're talking about a project that's somewhere around $900 million to begin with, and you ended up with a 50:50 relationship, and part of our contribution to that is going to be what we have in place today. You're not talking about a significant amount of capital from Valero's perspective. We are willing to put some in, but I don't think it's going to exceed anything that we've shared with you. In fact, I'm certain it won't to date. That being said, that project somewhat hinges on our ability to get the kind of transaction that we're comfortable with, number one, that brings expertise to the table; and number two, provides a potential platform for us to do additional transactions down the road. So that's really our view on that. Do you guys want to speak to alky at all?", "R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering", "Yeah. Evan, this is Lane. So the alky is still in the gated process. It still looks okay. We're going to reach a funding decision, yes or no, somewhere in the first quarter of next year.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great, that's good news, guys. And if I could just maybe get one follow-up as we're talking about capital projects, any detail on the McKee expansion startup and/or Line 9 in the back half the year? Thanks.", "R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering", "Evan, this is Lane. I'll answer McKee and I'll let Gary answer Line 9. So McKee, we should have the projects entirely complete in September, and that's a plus 25,000 barrel per day crude throughput, so that's the status of that project.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "And on Line 9, Enbridge did get the approval to start up the pipeline from the National Energy Board, which was good news. However, they had a stipulation that they had to hydro-test three sections of the line. They have a plan to do that which has also been approved by the National Energy Board. It does require some permits that they don't have, and then we don't know what will happen with the hydro test. But for us, assuming everything goes well, there's a chance that Line 9 is operational by the end of the year.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good, thanks, guys.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Evan.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Dietert of Simmons. Jeff, you may go ahead.", "Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "Good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Jeff.", "Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "Could you talk about product exports for the quarter, especially I guess both gasoline and diesel, and what you're seeing in the international markets there? And perhaps talk about opportunities to sell gasoline out of the Gulf Coast into California as well.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "Jeff, this is Gary. Our export volumes of gasoline were down a little bit in the second quarter, and it was primarily just due to the strength of the domestic markets. We exported 76,000 barrels a day of gasoline. Most all of that volume went to Mexico and Latin America. A small amount of it went to Eastern Canada. On the distillate side, we did 235,000 barrels per day of diesel; then we did another 45,000 barrels per day of jet kero. So total distillates were 280,000 barrels per day, most of that to Latin America. We also sent some of that to Europe. Over 60% of it was to Latin America though.", "As far as your question on Gulf Coast exports to the West Coast, in our system, mainly because of Jones Act 3, the way that optimization works is we generally supply West Coast barrels from our Pembroke refinery, and we did do that in the second quarter. Pembroke blended CARB [California Air Resources Board] gasoline, which we took to the West Coast.", "Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "Got you. And secondly, the industry is focused on distillate yield over time, with a historical growth rate that was more rapid for diesel than for gasoline. Recently, it seemed gasoline demand has been really strong. Can you talk about maybe some of the major drivers there and how sustainable you think that trend might be?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "I think that the big driver for gasoline demand has just been the lower flat price and demand elasticity and the response to the lower flat price. And so I think as long as we're in this lower price environment, we'll see good gasoline demand moving forward.", "Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "Got you. And finally, you've got the Houston-Appalachian unit projects that you've been talking about. And with the tightness in octane, do you see other projects developing to bring more octane into your portfolio?", "R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering", "Hey, this is Lane. The only thing we're really, we'll have to \u2013 obviously, our re-former margins are very wide. Naphtha is very discounted. We're focused on getting our re-forming unit capability tuned up. We've been working on it all summer to make sure that we are getting full utilization of our current assets. We don't have a whole lot of other, besides the alky, of projects in the pipeline to address the shortage on the octane side yet.", "Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "Okay, thanks for your comments.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Chi Chow of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. You may go ahead.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Hey, thanks a lot.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Chi.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Hi, Joe. How are you doing?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "It looks like you've had this structural uptick in margin capture in the North Atlantic region really over the last four quarters or so. Is this really the result of crude slate optimization at Quebec, or are there other factors contributing to that trend?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "Chi, I would say that the biggest driving factor has certainly been that we're supplying the Quebec refinery with domestic crude from the U.S. Gulf Coast. Again, that's an economic optimization, but we've put our Corpus dock in place during the quarter, which gave us a further incentive to get those barrels to Quebec. In April, 95% of the barrels we ran in Quebec were domestic barrels, and I think that's been the biggest reason.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "And do you believe once Line 9 starts up, are you going to get another uptick in that capture rate just with the additional flexibility you've got with Line 9?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "Yes, we certainly think that that will be the case. If you look at today's economics, a barrel off Line 9 into Quebec would have about a $3 a barrel margin advantage over something that we're sourcing from the Gulf Coast. So if this holds, it would be a fairly significant uplift.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Good to hear, okay. And what's your outlook for refining dynamics in Europe going forward here for Pembroke?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Pembroke is a little bit unique, I would say, Chi, in that it's really satisfying that the domestic market in the UK with some export capability. So it tends to not be as exposed to import barrels, for example, as some of the other European refineries might be. But I think our view is the same. Longer term, Western Europe and the Med have probably the least competitive refineries out there. And as barrels move into those markets, they're going to be exposed.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "All right, okay, one final question here. In California, obviously, it's been a great environment out there this year. How do you see things playing out in the second half? Do you expect ongoing strong gasoline cracks there for the balance of the year?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "Yes, it's difficult to predict. Certainly, as you know, as we head out of driving season, demand weakens a little bit, and then you get more butane blending into the pool. That will swell production some. So to me, a lot of what happens on the West Coast will be supply-driven. And some of these refinery outages that we've been seeing, will they continue or not will really determine how strong the West Coast market will be.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "But your plants are running well at this point out there?", "R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering", "Chi, this is Lane. I've got to knock on wood, they've been running very well.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "It shows up in the second quarter. Okay, thanks a lot.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You bet.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Faisel Khan of Citigroup. You may go ahead.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks, good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Faisel. How are you, Faisel?", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "All right, just a couple quick questions. First is just going back to some of the comments around your payout ratio, I just want to make sure I understand. So this year we're looking at a 75% payout ratio. And then just so I understand how that evolves as we go into next year, is it wait and see, or should we expect something similar in that range? I appreciate all the commentary around capital spending and everything.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We're in the process of running I guess our strategic plan and budget for next year, and so we really haven't come up with guidance that we're prepared to give at this particular time.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, understood. Is it fair to say there's \u2013 is there something special about this year versus the forward years that makes the payout ratio 75% this year different than \u2013 I'm just trying to understand how you guys are philosophically looking at the outlook on this payout ratio.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Philosophically, we started the year saying we want to achieve a minimum 50% payout ratio. I think you could expect that if the business is performing, that would be a minimum that we'd like to live with going forward. You know the potential volatility in this business, and so what we have committed to is we've given you an indication of what we deem to be the minimum cash that we want to keep on the balance sheet. We've got a capital budget that's certainly under control and very manageable. And the other thing we can tell you is that we don't plan to raffle cash. So depending on the performance in the business, we would look at returning surplus cash flows to shareholders. That being said, there are other opportunities that may come up that from quarter to quarter we'd want to change that.", "But again, if you look at what we've said in the analyst presentations, we're committed to maintaining the assets. We're committed to the dividend. We will continue to look at the dividend going forward and make changes as we see fit. And then we're going to let the investment-grade rating overall govern it. So I think we're very comfortable taking this year's payout to 75%, and I think you could expect that we'll try to maintain a 50% level going forward.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "That's very clear, thank you. This is the last question. I believe you've received the last set of rail cars, the 5,300 you purchased. I'm trying to understand. How is that fleet being utilized now? I know the differentials have been pretty narrow. But I'm just trying to understand what the fleet utilization is given the current market situation.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "We certainly saw in the second quarter that we didn't have near the advantage to ship crude by rail that we have been seeing in the past. However, the differentials are coming back up, and so we see that we'll start ramping up volumes in our Lucas terminal. We're still taking volume to Memphis via rail, St. Charles as well. So we're utilizing the rail cars, and then some of the general purpose cars that we have we are going ahead and transitioning into our ethanol service.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay.", "Martin Parrish - Vice President-Alternative Fuels", "And this is Martin Parrish. On the ethanol, we run at least 2,800 cars there routinely in that business. We don't see that changing, so we've got a lot of room there for rail cars.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great, thanks for the time, guys. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Philip Gresh of JPMorgan. Philip, you may go ahead.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi, good morning, so just one follow-up first on the distillate exports. Obviously, the trends have softened over in Asia in the past month or so. I was just wondering what you're seeing more recently relative to the 2Q trend and whether that distillate arb is still there for export. Just in general, what's going on?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "I think we're still seeing good demand in Latin America for the distillate exports. That's still there. The other big market for us, Europe, we've been hovering around breakeven, and it's still about there. The big thing that's impacting that is freight. So the freight has been varying anywhere from $0.07 to $0.11. And depending on freight, it means that the arb is either open or closed. I would tell you today it's about breakeven.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Got it, okay. And on the commentary about potentially accelerating drops, I'm curious how you're thinking about the capacity for drops right now. And if you accelerate it, how much more would you be able to do? How much could the market handle in your view?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "It wasn't really commentary. It was just a comment. And I think that what we've done, this year we're going to end up slightly over our $1 billion. Next year I think we'll end up slightly over what we're doing this year. Your sense on how big that market is, is probably as good as our sense on how big that market is. But we think that we can execute the transactions and do the drops on the pace that we're thinking about without rattling the market. So, Rich, is there anything that you'd add to that?", "Richard F. Lashway - Director, President & Chief Operating Officer", "No, I think that's the plan and to grow distributions in that targeted 25% range.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Right. Phil, we just haven't wavered on that. And I don't know if you could hear Rich or not but the point was that we've still got the 25%-plus distribution growth as our target.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Sure, okay. And just to confirm on the buybacks that the buyback target is just as a percent of net income and you're going to also add in 100% of all dropped capital on top of that in terms of buybacks. I believe that's something you said in the past. I just wanted to confirm that?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Let me say what we've said in the past is 50% plus the cash proceeds for buybacks. So resetting the target to 75% of net income is now going to be 75% of net income. Mike, you want to elaborate on that?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No, that's pretty much it.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So the drops, of course, and you know this, Phil. We haven't taken a lot of free cash in on these drops yet. And until VLP has access to the public markets, we'll probably continue to have a limited amount of cash that we get from VLP for the drops. So from our perspective, what we've done is just simplify the way to look at this, and we're saying it's 75% of net income.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, fair enough. And I guess to the extent that M&A opportunities do come up on the midstream side, and you've mentioned you'd rather wait a year to get investment-grade, et cetera. But if something comes up that is attractive to you, would you consider doing M&A at the Valero level for midstream and then dropping it down later, or is it more of a let's wait and see how it goes for the next year and not really looking at those sets of opportunities right now?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Would we consider doing an acquisition the Valero Energy level? Sure, we would look at that and compare that to our other uses of cash and make that decision, but we would consider it.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Phil, we're not opposed at all to acquisitions, and we tend to look at everything that's out there. And we're well positioned to do acquisitions, but we just haven't found one yet that we think adds value for Valero shareholders.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Fair enough. Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may go ahead.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you, good morning, everybody.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Doug.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Joe, periodically you've talked about whether the West Coast was strategic for Valero. And obviously, it's been \u2013 I guess with the Torrance situation in February that this sector has never really looked back against the strong gasoline demand. So I'm just curious. Does your view on the strategic importance of the West Coast change given recent events, or just update us on how you're thinking about that?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Doug, honestly, I think it's been in the past and it's really well in the past that we looked at potential dispositions around the West Coast. Subsequently, we've said that we view the West Coast as a great option. I think Lane has answered the question that even when margins were challenged out there, we were cash flow positive on the West Coast. We continue to monitor our investments out there so that we don't end up going cash flow negative, but it does provide a very interesting option for periods like this where we've got basically extraordinary cracks. And so I would tell you that this management team hasn't changed their perception, that we really like having the West Coast assets, which as Lane said, are running very well. They have strong management teams. We're very comfortable and pleased to have them as part of this asset portfolio.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, I appreciate the answer. Joe, my follow-up is really more really to get your sense as to what you're really seeing in this market currently. And really you've not made any secret of the fact that we all know this is a seasonal business and we've had a lot of extraordinary events this year, starting with Torrance, albeit against a backdrop of very strong demand. And I guess what I'm really getting at is that last year gasoline cracks were zero in December, and we're probably going to see 0.5 million barrel a day drop in demand in gasoline seasonally between now and the end of the year.", "So my question to you is do we see the typical rotation towards distillate given where distillate cracks are right now from yourselves and from your peers? And not so much from your peers but from yourselves as far as what your plan would be? If your LP is still telling you to max gasoline, do you keep running that until it flips even though the gasoline demand drops? Because obviously that's a harbinger for weaker gasoline cracks in the second half of the year. So we're all wrestling with this, obviously I just want to get your perspective as to how you're planning to run Valero's business if cracks remain at a significant premium for gasoline over diesel.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You bet. Gary, do you want to?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "Yeah, so overall, the way our optimization works is it would be like you suggested. We would continue to maximize gasoline as long as the prompt market supports doing that. Looking forward, I do see that you'll have the general seasonal trends and that we'll see some fall-off in gasoline demand, again, a lot of that probably weather related. But I would expect as we head into the third and fourth quarter that gasoline would get some weaker and distillates strengthen, and we'll put ourselves back into a max distillate mode.", "The other thing I think happens in the market is, the Northwest Europe 2-1-1 yesterday was around $15. And as it falls below $15, that's when you start to see utilization in Europe fall. And so I think you'll see utilization fall, some due to economics in Europe and then also seasonal maintenance, which will open up the distillate arb again from the U.S. Gulf to start supplying that market with diesel.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Gary, maybe I could just risk a quick follow-up on that topic. There has been a lot of chatter about delays and ultimately startups, and you're finally coming in Middle East refining. That obviously is probably going to back into the Atlantic Basin some European product. So I'm just curious. From an international perspective, we've all been waiting on this international refinery expansion coming, and it never really seems to have arisen. Do you have any perspective as to whether those things are finally coming online, and if so, how you see it impacting the current market environment? And I'll leave it there, thank you.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "The only thing I can really tell you is we have not seen an impact in the current market from anything happening in terms of the refinery capacity additions. And our view is that the place that you'll probably see that is more in the eastern Med, which is not really a market we tend to go into.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Doesn't that back into the Atlantic Basin though?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "It could, but again, we have not seen any indication of that as of yet.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Doug, the other thing to keep in mind is that U.S. Gulf Coast refining is very competitive. And so your concern is that ultimately these barrels get pushed back at us, what you might do is have some rationalization. But I think that goes to \u2013 if you're going to assume it's a zero-sum game, there's going to be winners and losers, and U.S. Gulf Coast refining is going to hold its own very well.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "I appreciate the answers, guys. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. You may go ahead.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi, good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Talked a lot about returning capital to shareholders and improvement this year and absolutely deserve congratulations for that. I'm curious though. Given a year where margins have been so strong, obviously helped out on the West Coast, fairly \u2013 if I look at Q3 guidance for throughputs, not really much growth year over year relative to actual numbers. The growth in McKee, what else should we be thinking of as we look forward to 2016 in terms of thinking about earnings growth or cash flow growth or free cash generation? Is it more modest CapEx that helps out? It's hard for us to think about replicating West Coast margins, although the Gulf Coast could obviously be strong. I'm just trying to think about, other than the growth in VLP, where else do we look for some increases in 2016 and maybe into 2017?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "We spoke to this briefly earlier today. We've got three projects that will be on stream certainly by the beginning of next year. We've got the two crude toppers, Corpus and Houston, and those will produce significant returns for our shareholders. And then we've got the Line 9 project, which Gary mentioned earlier. We've invested a couple hundred million dollars to prepare to process that crude at our refineries and we haven't received the benefit of that yet. So we've got those three things that are clearly in hand. And then down the road we've got the Diamond pipeline, which will certainly add benefit to the Memphis refinery. And then as I mentioned, we've got the methanol project that we continue to look at. And then Lane's got some other smaller that you'd almost call self-help or optimization projects, which we're running the traps on. And then Martin Parrish has some of those similar type of projects for the ethanol business.", "So there's no hydrocracker, Roger, that's coming on that's going to create some step change in what we're looking at, but we don't feel we need to do that. We've got a great portfolio that we're executing very well. We have a great team that's making sure that our assets are available and running, and we will see continued growth as a result of that.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "I appreciate the answer. And then getting back to the questions that have been asked earlier on the distillates side, a small part of the overall complex, the jet inventories have really increased significantly over the last several months. I'm just wondering if there's any color you can provide on that. I'm talking about total U.S., but you could also point to Gulf Coast jet is up fairly significantly.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "I really don't know that I have any commentary on that, Roger, on what's driving that.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "All right, good enough for me. Thanks, guys.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. You may go ahead.", "Blake M. Fernandez - Howard Weil, Inc.", "Hey, guys, good morning. I hope you're doing well. Gary, I wanted to go back. I think there was a lot of discussion on the strength of gasoline, and you talked about potentially maximizing distillate and gasoline depending on the market dynamics. If my model is set up correctly, it looks like you've been trending at a product yield toward gasoline to the tune of about 48% pretty consistently. Can you remind us what kind of flexibility you actually have to swing that back and forth?", "R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering", "This is Lane. I'll give it a shot. So right now with naphtha so dislocated, normally we'd flex that in and out of the distillate pool, but you really need to compare it to jet. So if you say if it's really discounted we're going to take that out of the mix. We have about probably a 4% ability to change our gasoline to distillate mix. If you were to be in a posture where you have been trying to make naphtha, it would be even bigger than that. It would be more like 8% to 9%. But today, we've been trying to minimize naphtha just because of where the market is on naphtha.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "So, Lane, is it fair to think going into 3Q we may see a little bit higher yield on gasoline just given its strength here?", "R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering", "Gary alluded to it earlier. We run our models and we have a forward view and we run our assets into that forward view. And I think seasonally, most of it \u2013 somewhere in October-ish we normally see a switch in the signals where we'll maximize diesel at the expense of gasoline.", "Blake M. Fernandez - Howard Weil, Inc.", "Okay.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, Blake, are you trying to understand, are we maximized on gasoline today at a 48% yield?", "Blake M. Fernandez - Howard Weil, Inc.", "Yes, yes.", "R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering", "The answer to that is yes.", "Blake M. Fernandez - Howard Weil, Inc.", "Okay, okay, I'm just trying to get a step change going in moving forward. So, Joe, you briefly touched on M&A at the parent company level. And I guess as I look at the equity price moving higher as a result of these aggressive buybacks, I'm just curious. Is it fair to think that as the stock price moves higher and you have considerations of what to do with capital, does asset-based M&A become more likely as Valero shares move higher?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I wouldn't say it's more likely because, Blake, we always have an eye towards it, and we tend \u2013 and historically we've done this too. We've tended to look at M&A opportunities outside of the context of the capital budget because Mike's got a balance sheet here that's like gold-plated, and so we have plenty of opportunity here without using the equity to do that.", "Our real focus here has been twofold, and we've talked with you about this. Number one, try to demonstrate earnings potential for the company through excellent operations, and try to get our multiple to the point where we're not trading at a discount to the peer group, and that's the number one focus. Number two then, what that does is provide you with the opportunity to do something with the equity if you ever choose to do a very significant transaction. And although we don't have anything like that on the radar screen today, we could do fairly sizeable transactions with the balance sheet as it sits today without \u2013 and in this case, it would be highly accretive transactions without negatively impacting things. Now that being said, we've looked at the market, we've looked at what's out there, and we just haven't seen anything yet that warrants us to do that.", "Blake M. Fernandez - Howard Weil, Inc.", "That's very clear. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Heffern of RBC. Brad, you may go ahead.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good morning, everybody, maybe one for Gary. Thinking about McKee, you guys have obviously made some strides into getting more Midland barrels into that refinery. Do you have any thoughts on Midland trading at a premium right now, whether you think that's sustainable, and whether you guys are optimizing the Midland out of that refinery and going back to Cushing, or how are you dealing with it in?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "We don't have a lot of flexibility at McKee to swing between the Midland and Cushing markets. A lot of what we have are term contracts with producers that are tied to one market or the other. I think we're probably in a realm where Midland stays fairly strong because there's a lot of takeaway capacity from that market. And so our view would be that Midland stays pretty close to parity to the Cushing market or could trade at a slight premium to it.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, thanks for that. And then, Joe, any thoughts on the proposed renewable volume obligations at this point?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "It's very interesting, and I'm sure you've read some of the same stuff that we've read here recently. The notion of shifting the obligation seems to be being recognized as a potential positive. I think that there was a letter that was put out here this past week that somebody shot across my desk, which talked about the fact that shifting the obligation might actually lead to incremental blending of ethanol. And so it certainly would be a huge benefit to us if that were to take place. Martin, is there anything you'd like to add?", "Martin Parrish - Vice President-Alternative Fuels", "I think on the RVOs itself, certainly for 2015 it's pretty achievable. You get a little tighter to the blend wall in 2016. But with the carryover RIN, we don't see that as a real big issue. So the question, as Joe said, is where does the obligated party go and what happens in 2017.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And that's more of a long-term solution for us than short-term relief, but we're hopeful. We always are.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, understood. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays. You may go ahead.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey guys, two quick follow-ups. One, in the past, Joe, I think Valero raised dividends two times a year, and the second time is around this time. And so on a going-forward basis, have you guys changed the process to become more of an annual process?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hello, Paul. We have raised it two times a year. Typically, they've been a little bit more modest than the one that we did back in January. And I can let Mike speak to this a little bit. Do you want to take a shot?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I guess we had a very significant increase in the dividend in January. And as I had mentioned earlier, obviously, we've got a material amount of cash, so we will be looking at our options to utilize that cash over the next few months. One of those is obviously the dividend.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Right. I guess, Joe, what I'm asking is that is there an intent, effort from management to change that to become an annual consideration, or that this is more ad hoc, that we shouldn't really look at say in the past it was two times a year and now that you look like this year is one time, to see if there's a process that we should know.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No, I understand, Paul. Let me just say this. Bi-annual (sic) [Semi-annual] (59:36) increases in the distribution, in the dividend, wasn't something that we've institutionalized. And so in this case, the large increase we had back in January was because we were lagging. And I think we have a sense that there's opportunity to raise the dividend again.", "Now what I don't want you to do is hold me something going forward that we're going to continue to raise the dividend twice a year into perpetuity. But I do think it's safe to say, as Mike described, that we're taking a good hard look at it. And, Paul, you know how devastating it is if anyone ever has to cut the dividend, so we're more deliberate on that. It's obviously easier for us and provides for flexibility to buy back shares and return cash that way, but we are looking at the dividend.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Sure. The second one is for Lane to see if there's any opportunity in the reformate (1:00:32) for your alkylate or re-former units in your system, or that you're already maxxed out, there's really not much of a debottleneck opportunity there?", "R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering", "Hey, Paul, I alluded to this earlier. We did, this was unusual versus where the signals around the re-formers have been in a couple of years. So we had to relearn in terms of where we could run the re-formers. We've always been maximizing alkylate. Our alkylation units have been very good for several years now, but we are at our maximum in reformate and alkylate capacity today.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Have you gone into and seen whether you can make some small investment and be able to expand the capacity on those units inside your system, or that you haven't done that process yet?", "R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering", "We are. We did a robust look at all of our alkys. We started really looking at our alkylation units about three years ago and figuring out where we want to spend \u2013 where we wanted to put the dollars, and that's where we landed on this Houston alkylation project. Obviously, it's in our gated process. Joe has mentioned several times on the call. We have a list of smaller projects that we're working. We're being careful not to try to tout them ahead of when they would be ready for show time. But there's clearly an opportunity to address this octane shortfall in the market, and so we're obviously working with those projects.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Paul.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. You may proceed with closing remarks.", "John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations", "Okay, we appreciate all of those who called in today and everyone listening.

My name is Ethan, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like turn the call over to Mr. John Locke. Mr. Locke, you may begin.", "John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Ethan. Good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me today are: Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations and Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero's senior management team.", "If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at Valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.", "I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.", "Now I will turn the call over to Joe for a few opening remarks.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone.", "We had another strong quarter, as our team operated safely and efficiently. Favorable product margins, which were supported by strong demand during the quarter, incentivized us to run at high utilization rates. While we are seeing some seasonal pressure on product margins today, demand for our products remains strong and crude oil markets continue to be well supplied, so we maintain our favorable outlook for 2016. We continue to focus on our priorities of maintaining safe and reliable operations, investing in our business, and returning cash to stockholders.", "Regarding strategic investments, we continue to grow our business. We expect to see contributions in the fourth quarter from our recently completed McKee crude unit expansion, Port Arthur hydrocracker expansion, and from delivered crude off of Enbridge Line 9B.", "Additionally, we're making good progress on our two crude unit projects. The Corpus Christi crude unit is ahead of schedule and is expected to start, with a startup date of December 1. We expect startup of the Houston crude unit around the end of the first quarter of 2016, as scheduled. We also executed another dropdown transaction earlier this month to Valero Energy Partners, which is our sponsored MLP.", "And finally, regarding cash returns to stockholders, over the first nine months of this year we've delivered a 73% payout of net income, so we're on track to hit our 75% target for 2015. Additionally, the Board of Directors approved a 25% increase in the regular quarterly dividend, which is the second increase approved this year.", "So with those highlights, John, I'll turn it back over to you.", "John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Joe.", "Moving on to the quarterly results, we reported net income from continuing operations of $1.4 billion or $2.79 per share versus the third quarter 2014 earnings per share of $2.00. The refining segment generated operating income of $2.3 billion.", "Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.8 million barrels per day, which was in line with the third quarter of 2014. Our refineries operated at 96% throughput capacity utilization in the third quarter of 2015 in spite of unplanned downtime, including the refinery-wide outage at our Texas City refinery due to a lightning strike. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.80 per barrel in the third quarter of 2015 were also in line with the third quarter of 2014.", "The ethanol segment generated $35 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2015 versus $198 million in the third quarter of 2014. General and administrative expenses excluding corporate depreciation were $179 million in the third quarter of 2015. Also in the third quarter, net interest expense was $112 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $482 million. The effective tax rate was 32.4%.", "With respect to our balance sheet, at quarter end total debt was $7.4 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $5.3 billion, of which $51 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was approximately 20%. Valero had over $5 billion of available liquidity excluding cash. The cash flows in the third quarter included $467 million of capital spending, of which $109 million was for turnarounds and catalysts.", "We returned $1.3 billion in cash to our stockholders in the third quarter, which included approximately $200 million in dividend payments and $1.1 billion for the purchase of 17.2 million shares of Valero common stock. Year to date we've purchased 35.5 million shares for $2.2 billion.", "So for modeling our fourth quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.55 million to 1.6 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 420,000 to 440,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 235,000 to 255,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 480,000 to 500,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be around $3.80 per barrel. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.85 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization.", "We expect G&A expenses excluding corporate depreciation for the fourth quarter to be around $200 million, and net interest expense should be about $100 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $475 million, and our effective tax rate is expected to be around 30%.", "Ethan, we've concluded our opening remarks. In a moment, we will open the call to questions. During this segment, we continue to ask that our callers please limit each turn to two questions. Callers may rejoin the queue with additional questions as time permits.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And our first question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Neil, please go ahead.", "Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning, guys.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Neil.", "Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Joe, can you talk about \u2013 and you alluded to it \u2013 the outlook for product margins as Valero sees it? It sounds like the decline we're seeing in your view is more seasonal than structural. There has been a lot of talk about gasoline versus diesel. And anything you could comment on the demand side, so just broadly some commentary on the product margin outlook would be helpful.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You bet. Neil, if you're okay, we'll let Gary Simmons talk about that.", "Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "That would be great.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "Neil, this is Gary. I certainly do see that what we have this year is just the seasonal nature of our business. We start to get out of gasoline season and you see the gas cracks begin to soften, and typically we go through a period of time where refinery margins are squeezed until heating oil demand begins to kick in.", "I think the surprise this year is actually the gas cracks were much stronger for a longer period of time than what we typically see. Even today, a light sweet refiner in the Gulf has a $9 crack spread. If you're running medium sour, it's around $12. And a heavy sour refiner in the Gulf has a $15 crack spread. So to us, those numbers don't look bad at all for this time of year. We see good product demand on the distillate side. Our export markets remain strong. And then on the gasoline side, as the markets in the Gulf have softened some, it's opened up the arbs to start gasoline exports as well. So we feel pretty good about the markets going forward.", "Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks, Gary. And then the follow-up question is around the dividend. You guys raised your dividend by 25%. So can you talk a little bit about what drove the decision, how you're thinking about the allocation of capital between dividends, buybacks, and organic growth?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Okay, Neil, this is Mike. We went ahead and increased the dividend this quarter. We're having a great year, and we thought it was appropriate to increase it at this time. Going forward, ultimately we would like to get to the position of increasing the dividend annually. And our intention is to pay a dividend at the top end of the range for our peer group.", "Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And then, Mike, between buybacks and dividends, any thoughts there?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "On the dividend payout, our intention is to be at the top end of the range of our peer group. And then as we increase that, buybacks would be a little bit less of the total pie.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Neil, the only thing I'd add to what Mike said is, in the investor presentations we made \u2013 and management made the commitment at the beginning of the year that we'd look at the use of our cash in a non-discretionary and a discretionary way, and clearly we view the dividend as something that is non-discretionary. So when we commit to doing the dividend, we believe we need to maintain the dividend. And so as Mike said, it was a good time to do it. We've had a great year. We want to reward our shareholders, and we'll continue to look at it going forward. So when you look at the total payout ratio, it's based on net income, and we've been very forthright about that. All we're doing really in this case is altering the makeup of that payout ratio and increasing the percentage that would be made up of the dividend.", "Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. All right, thank you so much.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Neil.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Evan, please go ahead.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good morning, guys. Let me tie your macro comments in the prior answer to the return policy and connect the two. You raised the dividend, had a large step-up in the buyback in the third quarter. I know you have the annual payout guidance which you're closer to your target, but you also have significant room in your net debt to EBITDA guidance. So how do you adjust the buyback between these two metrics according to the margin environment, meaning given your macro view, should we expect a continued pace of buybacks even in a seasonally weaker quarter?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We increased the payout target from 50% to 75% on the last call. So we had to pick up the buybacks quite a bit to meet our commitment to our shareholders and payout to 75%.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, Evan, as Mike said, I think you can expect that we're going to hit the 75% target. That's our objective. So if you're trying to gauge pace of buybacks in the fourth quarter, they're probably going to be at a somewhat slower pace than they were in the third quarter, as we made up ground during the third quarter. I think going forward, as Mike has talked about, we want to maintain the dividend at the high end of the range of the peers. So we will continue to look at it.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "It's based off of net income. And so we're not providing earnings guidance here on what the fourth quarter would be. So if net income comes in very strong, we'll be buying back a lot of shares.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it, that makes sense. Let me ask a different question, my second question, on the midstream side. I know you funded the last drop to VLP. If that market remains closed, would you do that again in 2016, or can you talk about how you're thinking about that going forward?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Okay, the last \u2013 and this is Mike again. The last drop on October 1, our plan was all along to self-fund that drop. On the capital markets, based on our discussions with the bankers, we do not believe that the capital markets are closed. We believe that they're open. The equity markets have been challenging. There's not been a lot of activity in the last six weeks or so on the equity side, but we do believe that the markets are open.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great, I'll leave it there with two, guys.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Evan.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Evan.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Edward Westlake from Credit Suisse. Edward, please go ahead.", "Johannes M. L. Van Der Tuin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hi, it's actually Johannes here playing stand-in for Ed at the moment, a couple of quick questions. First one, I was wondering what your West Coast outlook is given that it was so strong over the last quarter going into next year. Do you have a view on what turnaround activity in 2016 would be and how that may impact that particular crack?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "Yes, I think we definitely see a lot of turnaround activity in the fourth quarter of this year, which will probably keep the West Coast market fairly tight. As you move into next year, I think we've seen a good demand response as a result of lower flat price on the West Coast. That will certainly keep that market tighter than what we've seen in the past several years, so we're fairly optimistic on our West Coast operations for next year. I don't really have any insight to turnaround activity. I don't know, Lane, if you...", "R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering", "This is Lane. I think it's fairly public knowledge you have a heavy turnaround season currently going on and into the very beginning of the fourth quarter. But I don't have any insight into where the turnaround activity is going to be on the West Coast the first half of next year, and we don't give any forward guidance for Valero in that respect either.", "Johannes M. L. Van Der Tuin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. And generally over the last year there's been a reasonable amount of M&A, either outright M&A and/or acquisition of assets, and that's in the midstream and in the downstream segments. Is there a reason you haven't participated in it, or is there a way you're thinking about M&A and growth that we could use to see through your eyes, so to speak?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, we do participate. We do look at the opportunities as they do become available to us. We have not I guess been able to consummate an acquisition during this time.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And again, our attention to M&A hasn't changed. We continue to look at everything that's out there. And obviously, there have been a couple of deals that have been done. There are a couple of refineries that have transacted this year. And as Mike said, we look at them. And if they're of interest to us we pursue them, and if they're not we don't. Obviously in this case, they weren't of enough interest to us for us to be aggressive.", "When you look at the space that might be more rich with opportunities going forward, it seems to be more the midstream business. And again, we look at the opportunities out there, but we've been pretty clear about what we want to do. To the extent we transact there, we'd like for it to be assets that are supportive of Valero's core business. So our view of M&A hasn't really changed, nor has the level of activity that we pursue internally. We just haven't pulled the trigger on anything.", "Johannes M. L. Van Der Tuin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Is there a framework you use to evaluate the value proposition when it comes to those businesses that might be related to your core business?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Yes, but I don't think we're going to get into what our acquisition criteria is with you, no offense.", "Johannes M. L. Van Der Tuin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay, no problem. Thank you.", "John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations", "Thank you.", "Operator", "and our next question comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Ryan, please go ahead.", "Igor Grinman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi, guys. It's Igor Grinman here actually chiming in for Ryan. I had a quick question on the crude slate in the quarter. It seemed like the light sweet mix was around \u2013 it looked like record levels or at least as far as I could see here. I'm just curious as to what drove that preference for light sweets in the quarter given the relative widening seen on the sour dip side. Was it running next gasoline mode (18:47) related, or were there some other drivers there? And along the same context, it would be great to hear your latest outlook on the lights versus sours differentials for 2016.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "So you're correct, we did run record levels of domestic light sweet crude during the third quarter. That was somewhat tied to where the crude differentials were, but we also see rate lever that we get from running a lighter crude diet, so that pushed us in that direction. And then also with the strength in gasoline, we get a higher gasoline yield off those types of crudes, so that pushed us to the domestic light sweet as well. As we transition into the fourth quarter, the crude markets remain very volatile. And so we have definitely transitioned to where we're running a lot more sour crudes in the system today than what we did in the third quarter.", "I think as you move to 2016, as long as we're in this market that the crude markets are oversupplied, you're just going to see a lot of volatility between the grades. And so we are just going to be responsive. As the markets move, we'll run the diet that is most economic in our refineries.", "Igor Grinman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Maybe just as a quick follow-up, what are you guys generally expecting out of the 1Q turnaround season? I know you brought up maybe some color on the West Coast side, but just overall U.S.-wide color would be great.", "R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering", "This is Lane. We obviously have a dialogue with all of our contractors and we have a large business with them. And the outlook that they're telling us is it will be a fairly heavy \u2013 the first quarter of 2016 will be \u2013 I mean the first half of 2016 will be heavier than the first half of 2015.", "Igor Grinman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "All right, great. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Phil, please go ahead.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, good morning. Not to beat a dead horse on the dividend, but you had a big step up in the first quarter, and this is another sizeable step up. So I was just wondering how you thought about this one in terms of whether it was a bit of a catch-up still going on here to get it to the spot where you wanted as a percent of cash from operations or something along those lines, and whether the increases moving forward would be more ratable over time.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think if we looked at it, we were behind the peers. And Mike laid out what the objective was, Phil, and it's to pay out towards the higher end of that. And so I guess you could look at it as a make-up, in fact, the whole year. I think when we looked at it, we were behind going into the year, and we felt that we needed to try to get caught up. So obviously, that was the case. I think as we get closer to the peers, I think this thing \u2013 the prospective increases would be at a more moderate level.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Second question is just with Line 9B now ramping up, how soon would you expect to see a benefit? To what magnitude do you think you can get access to all of the crude that you're hoping to get through Line 9B, or is there any kind of delay in getting any of those barrels to Quebec? And how do you think about the impact that this would have on margins for the refinery?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "This is Gary again. We purchased pretty much our full volume on what we had committed on Line 9 for November injection, and so those barrels will begin to start showing up in Montreal in December and making its way to the refinery.", "In terms of the barrels that are available to us, it's pretty much what we had planned, so we have a mix of Bakken and MSW and Syncrude from Western Canada. With the arb being narrower, the economics aren't quite as strong as what we had envisioned, but Line 9 barrels are still at or better than what we can do from a U.S. Gulf Coast sourced domestic light sweet barrel.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, got it, thank you.", "John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Phil.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons. Jeff, please go ahead.", "Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "It's Jeff Dietert with Simmons, good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Jeff. We knew who you were.", "Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "If you could, let's talk a little bit about some of the outages during the quarter, with emphasis on Texas City with the lightning strike. But also, I believe you had some FCC [Fluidic Catalytic Cracking] and alkylate unit downtime during a period when octane was tight, and I was hoping you could talk about the influence those had on 3Q.", "R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering", "Jeff, this is Lane. Our unscheduled downtime during the third quarter cost us about $116 million, with the big event being this lightning strike that knocked out our substation at Texas City.", "Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "And were there meaningful FCC and alky units down during the quarter? Did that have a meaningful influence as well? It's okay to...", "R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering", "I quantified the impact on our results. I'm not really \u2013 I don't think \u2013 I'm not going to comment on the impact that might have had on the market, if that's what you're looking for. I'm just saying \u2013 I'm giving you what happened to us.", "Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "All right. And when you think about the tightness in the octane market and the premiums we saw there, is your view from an industry perspective that that's transient or structural? We did have some industry FCC outages and reformer and alkylation unit downtime and very strong high octane retail gasoline demand. Could you talk about that issue?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "Jeff, this is Gary. At least my view is it is more structural in nature. We did have some refinery downtime, but I don't think that was the key driver. I think that as the Gulf Coast refineries are running lighter crude diets that we're out of reforming capacity, you become long naphtha. And as long as you have a strong gasoline market, there's an incentive to blend that naphtha into the gasoline pool, and to do that it takes high octane blend components. In addition to that, some of the big growing export markets have specifications that require high alkylate blends, not necessarily even for octane.", "And then finally, I think one of the things that we've seen this year is with where aromatic pricings have been, both toluene and xylene have been under their blend value, which has allowed both of those components to be in the gasoline pool. Assuming we have some strengthening in the aromatics pricing moving forward, you can see that both of those high octane blend components actually get pulled out of the pool and octane premiums remain strong.", "Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "Thanks for your comments.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays, Paul, please go ahead.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Two quick questions actually. One, Mike, do you have guidance or a target for the cash payout to your shareholders for 2016 and 2017 yet?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No, we don't. We're not prepared today to give the payout target for 2016, but I would anticipate that we'll do that early next year.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay, and secondly, maybe for Joe. Joe, on the last six months, the MLP sector has been under tremendous pressure. Just curious that the changing market conditions, does it in any shape or form have changed the management view to how you're going to manage VLP and what that means in terms of the dropdown pays or organic or inorganic investment in that business, and how that relates to the C-Corp.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "That's a good question, Paul. Let me let Mike fire away first and then if there's anything to add.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Obviously, the capital markets have been very volatile. We continue to market that. But our plan is to continue to execute upon our previously communicated dropdown guidance for 2016, and that's around $1 billion of assets.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You bet.", "John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Paul.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Paul, please go ahead.", "Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hi, guys. It was a little bit of a follow-up or somewhat asked by Paul already, but I was wondering about this 75% of net income target. I guess at the highest level, I was wondering why you use net income. It seems like a bit of a bouncy denominator, if that's the right word \u2013 or numerator I guess.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Paul, we're in a volatile business. And whether you use net income or cash flow, I think you just pick one, and we picked net income. So it was one that's very easy for everybody to look at and identify the number. And so it seemed to provide the most transparency from our perspective.", "Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Sure, that's fair enough. And now I guess what you're saying, given that we're new to this, is that your intention is early every year to provide guidance of approximately how much net income share you intend to return?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think you could probably assume that's the case. Paul, I think we did it at your conference last year. And so that's where we laid out the 50% targeted payout ratio. It's our objective to have a stated payout ratio. And again, this is the first year we did it. We set one out there. We viewed it as a target that we wanted to hit. Things went well this year. We were able to raise that target. So philosophically, I think we're going to always look at our cash flows and our free cash and decide what to do with it. And certainly we've set our priorities with the dividend now and with the share buyback program, and we'll continue to pursue it.", "Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Jeff, I wasn't excited enough about our conference in January. I'm super-excited now, so I'll look forward to your announcement January 6.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Paul, we always feel the same way.", "Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Just on a really important thing for us is my second and final question. This whole thing of a view that global distillate is weak, oversupplied, really doesn't come through in your commentary at all. Is this just the strength of Latin America, or could you just provide just more detail, as you see it, on where this distillate is going, and why you can succeed in exporting so much more when there's this perception that the market globally is weak? Thanks.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "Paul, this is Gary again. The way we're viewing the distillate markets, we've seen six straight weeks of draws in the stats here domestically. Export demand remains very robust. You have some seasonal maintenance that's coming in. And so I think the combination of seasonal maintenance and exports will keep domestic inventories in check. And then really the wild card is what happens with the weather and heating oil demand.", "As you look globally, I think a lot is being made of the stocks in the ARA [Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp]. There's just not a lot of tankage over there. So when we talk about inventory being very high, it's 8 million barrels above where it was last year. I think some of the things that we're seeing is that the Rhine River levels are low and hindering some of the typical demand pulls we see out of the ARA. So to some degree, I think we feel like some of the inventory in Europe may be understated or overstated. But we continue to see very good demand, both Latin America and Europe, for diesel, and feel pretty good about those markets.", "Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Interesting, thank you very much.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Chi, please go ahead.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Good morning, guys. It's Chi, as you know. Hey, just following up on Paul's questions there, could you give us your export volumes for the quarter in both diesel and gasoline?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "Sure, this is Gary. Gasoline, we did 89,000 barrels a day of exports, primarily in Mexico and Latin America. And on the diesel side, we did 241,000 barrels a day of exports. It was a 65:35 split between Latin America and Europe. On the distillate, if you include kerosene, it brought us to about 285,000 barrels a day of total distillates.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks, Gary, and then just one semantic question here. Your non-controlling interest line was a loss in the quarter. What's the detail behind that?", "John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations", "That's primarily Diamond Green Diesel. The loss had nothing to do with VLP.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay, so just a loss incurred at Diamond Green?", "John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations", "Yes.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thanks, John.", "John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Chi.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Brad, please go ahead.", "Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good morning, everybody. Joe, I think in the past, you've certainly had a stated goal of narrowing the multiple discount that Valero trades at versus peers. I think you've done the obvious things on that front with the dividend increases and all the repurchases, certainly showing more CapEx discipline. I'm curious as we move forward here how you see the best path towards narrowing that further. Is it just continuing to execute? Is it buying back more shares? Any color there would be helpful.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Brad, that's a good question and it's one that we continue to wrestle with as we look at the strategy going forward. It's hard to really understand what drives the multiples. We look at sum of the parts, and clearly our portfolio is more levered towards refining perhaps than the peers. And so clearly a more diversified set of earnings streams for the company would be something that might lift that multiple.", "The other thing that we really couldn't factor in entirely is where having a payout ratio, certainly the dividend that was below the peers might affect us from a multiple perspective. And so you address what you can in a timely manner. And we've addressed now the fact that we've lagged on the payout in the dividend, and we're continuing to look for the opportunities to grow different earnings streams within the business. And the drops from Valero to VLP clearly is targeted at trying to do this. And then we'll continue to look for good projects to grow the refining business, the renewables business, and then we'll look for other business lines that we might be able to get into. The objective would be to do it with a stronger currency. And so we continue to have this as a major point of focus, but I just don't know that there is a silver bullet that you could fire that's going to immediately get the stock rerated and have you up to where your peers are, but we're taking the actions that we can that we think will help drive that way.", "Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, that's fair. Thanks for that. And then maybe for Gary Simmons, just thinking about spreads, both Bakken and LLS are relatively tied to WTI. Is that a symptom of declining U.S. crude production? Is it a symptom of too much midstream, or is it just that maybe people haven't been able to arb things on the import side particularly quickly?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "No, I think you really hit the nail on the head. We have a combination of overbuilt logistics in light of flat to declining domestic crude production. So with the current market, the U.S. Gulf Coast bound pipelines from Mid-Continent have tariffs that are greater than where actually the market is today. So you're just seeing people with take-or-pays going ahead to ship even though it doesn't look like they have economics on paper, and that's what's really driving the differentials.", "Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And is that something that you think is going to persist until we see a turnaround in U.S. production? For instance, have you guys changed your behavior and you're importing much more at this point and you expect that to widen the arb back out?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "I think the tariff and the midstream situation is here until we get some recovery in production. I would tell you on the imports, that's more the volatility between grades. I think what we saw is that as people started to see that production was falling, it was very supportive of the domestic light sweet pricing. At the same time, medium sour production in the Gulf was growing and medium sour exports in the Middle East were increasing. So all of a sudden, we saw a fairly wide differential between medium sour and light sweet, and it incentivized us to bring in a lot of imports of medium sour into our system.", "Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Cowen & Company. Sam, please go ahead.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Good morning, everybody. How are you?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Sam.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "In the press release, you guys updated the topper progress. As Brad just pointed out, LLS is below Cushing right now. Maybe the toppers fixed that. But I don't know, what do you make of what looks like everybody trying to flood the Gulf or avoid Cushing on the marketing side for crude right now? And does that change the economics of the toppers at all, or are you more excited about them or less excited than you might have been six months ago?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "I think the weak LLS market is actually supportive of the toppers.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Right.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "Where we were with \u2013 the economics for the toppers assumed LLS/Brent flat. And so as LLS is discounted to Brent, it actually improves the economics of those toppers fairly significantly. I think some of the \u2013 two things causing the LLS-to-TI spread being where it is today. One is this overbuilt logistics and people shipping even though the economics don't appear to be supportive. And then secondly, we have a lot of imports coming into the Gulf. So ultimately, you can't keep having these inventory builds of domestic light sweet. We're going to have to see those differentials come off and incentivize refiners to go back to a lighter diet at some point in time.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, thanks for the color. And then just revisiting the October drop and VLP in general, it's true that MLPs have been really volatile. VLP has seemed to be a lot more stable. I don't want to make you repeat yourself on the thinking behind sponsoring that drop in October maybe to a greater degree than people expected. But just to your view, do you think \u2013 it's sort of a chicken and the egg question. But how much of VLP's stability is a function of the strength of the sponsor and you demonstrating that, or how much of the structure of that drop was really preempted and maybe just more being cautious and preserving your outside capital for another time?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Our plan was to self-fund the drop. With this particular drop, though, we're now at a debt-to-EBITDA of about 3.5 times. And so we'd likely not want to be longer than that on a long-term basis. So with the next acquisition, we're going to have to go get our investment-grade credit rating, which our plan is to do that late this year or next year, have the ability to go to the debt capital markets. And then with the ratio of being 3.5 times \u2013 or approximately 3.5 times, the next acquisition also might require an equity component \u2013 or will require an equity component. So from this point forward, I think you would anticipate the capital markets.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. All right, thanks very much.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Sam.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Blake, please go ahead.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.", "Thanks, guys. Good morning, just a point of clarification. Mike, you mentioned being at the top end of the peer group for dividends. I just want to double-check. I'm assuming you're using the metric as a percentage of net income and not yield or some other metric like that.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We're using payout; that's correct.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay. And then going back to Line 9, Gary, I don't know if you can help us a little bit here. If you could just remind me, we're seeing Cushing, obviously, has been fairly depleted, and the spread between WTI/Brent has been compressed. Can you remind me of the metrics we should maybe look at as far as what is economical to actually shift those barrels on Line 9 over to Quebec? Should we be looking at Gulf Coast versus Brent, or Brent versus Cushing, just any help you can have there to help us understand it?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "So Line 9 for us is primarily fed with Western Canadian light sweet, then Bakken. And so you're really looking at that spread and comparing it to a U.S. Gulf Coast supply or a foreign light sweet alternative.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay. And are there any specific numbers you can give to us where it covers transport or where it makes sense to actually move it?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "I don't think we can talk about the tariff we're paying on Line 9.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay, fair enough. Thanks, guys.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Blake.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Doug, please go ahead.", "John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations", "Doug, are you there?", "Operator", "Doug, your...", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Sorry, I had the volume on mute. I apologize. Good morning, everybody. Joe, one of the advantages you guys have had over the years was obviously your heavy crude diet on the Gulf Coast. And I think obviously you've now seen U.S. production it seems go into decline, at least on the domestic side. What are you thinking is the prognosis of the outlook for how you move your \u2013 or how you choose to run your crude in 2016? And I guess what's in the back of our mind is it's really more of a macro question. Iran potentially coming back on stream, one would expect U.S. production tightens up a little bit, and it seems to us that the advantage might move back in your favor. I'm just wondering what your thoughts are in terms of a heavy oil advantage.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Doug, we'll let Gary speak to that.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "So, Doug, I think the way we see it is there's just going to be a lot of volatility between grades. And it certainly is an advantage for someone like us with the quality of refining assets that we have that can swing to a light diet, medium diet, and a heavy sour diet. And that's the way this year shaped up, and I don't think we see it much differently next year. There are times when it's certainly been an advantage to run a very light diet, and then there are other times where we see very good value in Canadian heavies or heavies from Mexico or South America.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "But speaking more broadly, Gary, I think as you look at Iranian crude coming into the market, obviously, the more sour crudes that are in the market, I think it's certainly to Valero's advantage because we definitely have the ability to process it. And as Gary is pointing out, we always are optimizing the crude slate, Doug, as you know. But having more availability of sour crude, whether they be mediums or heavies, is certainly to our advantage in the Gulf.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you. I have two other quick ones, if I may, Joe. I guess the second one is also on macro. Again, I don't think you're aware. We've made no secret of our concerns over what we've described as exacerbated volatility on margins, and I want to get your perspective. It goes back to your earlier question on the seasonality of gasoline. As we see it, we're sitting with higher inventories of gasoline, and the cut on light sweet crude in the U.S. seems to be significantly higher. So I'm just wondering if you've got any view as to why we've seen such wide swings on gasoline margins in the winter for the last two or three years and whether you think that repeats again this year once the current maintenance period comes up. And I've got a quick follow-up, please.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "I think we've definitely seen increased demand with the lower flat price. Certainly there's seasonality to gasoline. The gasoline cracks have remained stronger longer than they typically do. But I think the things that we see in the market that are supportive of gasoline going forward is the price of gasoline in the Gulf now has opened up arbs for exports. So certainly in our system we're seeing a significant increase in the volumes we're exporting. Imports to the New York harbor have fallen way off, which is supportive of gasoline. Naphtha export economics have changed to where we're really not putting naphtha into the gasoline pool now. We're exporting naphtha to the Far East. We've seen FCC margins fall off some to where you'll see some sparing of FCC capacity, and then some seasonal maintenance. So I think all of those things we feel like are supportive of the gasoline markets going forward.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Right, but my point is that when refinery maintenance comes to an end, if you take the exports out of the equation, you'll think of those as a relief valve, if you like. Do you think the Gulf Coast and the U.S. in general is now oversupplied gasoline in the wintertime or not?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "Certainly if we run at very high utilization rates and aren't allowed to export, you could become long, but I don't think we see that that will happen.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. My final one, Joe, I guess this is really more for you. The big step up in the buybacks, whether everyone agrees or not, it seems that margins have been somewhat artificially supported by everything that's gone on this year, starting on the West Coast. But why would you choose to step up to such a big level of buybacks in such a seasonal sector, at least in terms of how share prices have typically traded in the past?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Doug, we had free cash flow available and we did what we said we were going to do, and it is what it is. I think as we look at this going forward, we laid out a target and we're going to hit it. We're not here to build cash. We're here to grow our business and to reward our shareholders. And we thought this was the right time to do it and it was the way to do it. And so that's what led to the timing. If we had had reduced margins this year, you probably wouldn't have seen us step up the target. But here again, we are owned by firms out there and individuals that are looking for a return and for us to use the cash prudently, and we think that's what we did.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "All right, I appreciate the answer, Joe. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question is a follow-up from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Brad, please go ahead.", "Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks, just a couple quick follow-ups. I was curious on CapEx. It appears that you are way ahead of the budget for 2015 based on the first three quarters. And it would be something like $1 billion in spending in the fourth quarter to actually reach the target. Is there a particular reason for that? Is it the crude topper spending ramping up perhaps, or why would you not be able to come in meaningfully below it?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes, for our capital expenditure guidance for 2015, we do remain unchanged at $2.65 billion. Now when we provide this guidance, just to clarify, we mean capital expenditures, turnaround costs, as well as investments in joint ventures. So September year to date, our total is $1.7 billion, so we are trending below the guidance. However, as you all know, we have an option to become a 50% owner in the Diamond pipeline, and we may exercise that option in this quarter.", "Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, got it. That's good color. Thanks for that. And then looking at the throughput guidance for the quarter, both Mid-Con and West Coast look to be maybe a little weaker than what we've expected. Is that just turnaround-related?", "R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering", "We don't really give forward guidance on turnarounds. But when we set the guidance volumes, we do take turnarounds into consideration. I think if you look in the aggregate, the guidance for this quarter is similar to the fourth quarter last year.", "Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, I'll leave it there. Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question is a follow-up from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Chi, please go ahead.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. I just want to follow up on the heavy crude markets. It looks like Canadian producers now, we know they have pipeline access all the way from Alberta to Houston, and it looks like the volume of deliveries have ramped up into PAD 3 to about 300,000 barrels a day plus pretty ratably year to date from Canada. How much of a structural change do you think this is with this dynamic on pipeline flows in? And how are you seeing Middle East and Latin American producers react on the pricing of their sours and heavies?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "Chi, I would say we've definitely seen greater availability of Canadian heavy in the Gulf. We ran record volumes of Canadian heavy in the third quarter. Really, the medium sour pricing seems to be what's setting the price of the heavy sours. All the heavy sour producers know they have to compete with an ASCI or Mars barrel in the Gulf. And so they price their barrels to be competitive on a quality-adjusted basis with that medium sour barrel in the Gulf. And the Canadian is certainly that same way.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Gary, do you prefer to run a Canadian heavy barrel through the cokers, or would you rather go with a Maya or a Latin America heavy?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization", "Each barrel presents their own operating challenges, so Lane may be better to answer that. But there are certainly some challenges with Canadian that we don't see with some of the South American barrels that we run. So I don't know, Lane. Do you want to add anything to that?", "R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering", "You did a fine job answering that. They'd love to run marshmallows in the cokers.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay, thanks. I appreciate it.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Take care, Chi.", "Operator", "And we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to John Locke for any closing remarks.", "John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations", "Great. Thanks, Ethan. We appreciate everyone joining us today.

In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we described in our filings with the SEC.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joe for a few opening remarks.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter presented us with challenging markets with gasoline and diesel margins under pressure for most of the quarter. The bright spot was the performance of our team, as we continued to operate safely and reliably. What I'd like to do this morning is take a few minutes to discuss our strategic initiatives that we believe will continue to drive long-term value creation and then share some color on what we are singing in the markets.", "First, at the core of everything we do is a relentless focus on safety and reliability. Our dedication and persistence here is what keeps our people and community safe, our operations reliable, our cash operating costs the lowest among the peer group. Having low-cost operations is a major advantage in our industry where product margins can be quite volatile. As a disciplined operator, we are able to run profitably in a lower margin environment as experienced in the first quarter.", "Second, we apply discipline and rigor, as we evaluate and execute investments that will grow the profitability and competitiveness of our business for many years. The strategic plan that was approved by our board of directors last year included $2.6 billion of capital spending for 2016. Approximately $1 billion was allocated to strategic investments to drive long-term earnings growth.", "Third, we are committed to delivering value to stockholders by making the right investments in our business and returning cash to our stockholders. We demonstrated this in 2015 when we delivered the highest total stockholder return among our peers for both Valero and VLP. We expect VLP to continue to be well positioned to execute its distribution growth strategy through 2017 despite volatile capital markets.", "We also continue to keep an eye on M&A. We review opportunities and we have a list of targets that we consistently monitor. We consider M&A a discretionary use of cash, so there's a healthy tension when evaluating M&A opportunities versus other alternative uses. Of course, we can't comment specifically on M&A, but we are diligently reviewing opportunities. For cash returns in 2016, which is made up of dividends and buybacks, we've extended our 2015 payout target of 75% of net income. In January, we increased the quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.60 a share, but we remain focused on maintaining a dividend payout at the high end of our peer group. We're confident in Valero's ability to fund investments in future growth and to meet its payout target.", "Lastly, let me share some color on the current market. Already this year, we've been in a lot of conversations about various market topics including gasoline demand resurgence, octane strength, diesel length, domestic crude supply, and crude storage levels. As you know, markets for Valero's feedstocks and products are dynamic. Our high complexity refineries, system flexibility, advantage locations, and low cash cost operations enable us to maximize earnings under challenging market conditions.", "On the crude supply side, we are seeing more medium sour crudes coming into the market. As a result, we are seeing healthy medium and heavy sour crude discounts. We also have greater access to domestic sweet crudes with the logistics build out in the U.S., allowing domestic production to clear the Mid-Continent region and reach the large Gulf Coast refining center.", "On the demand side, continued GDP growth and low product prices should continue to support demand. In the U.S., we are seeing gasoline demand continue to grow. We are encouraged by increased vehicle miles traveled and double-digit percentage increases in SUV and truck purchases in the U.S. and key countries around the globe. Distillate demand globally was good, albeit in the U.S. it's been fairly flat. While distillate margins were pressured near term due to unseasonably warm weather in North America and Europe, distillate demand in Latin America remains robust.", "Overall, we still have structural refined product supply challenges in South America and the developing countries, which we don't expect to be resolved in the near term. With our low-cost Gulf Coast refining presence, we have the ability to compete in markets all over the globe. We also have the opportunity to optimize our system and supply in the Atlantic basin with our refineries in Wales and Qu\u00e9bec City. In fact, we generated another quarter of solid distillate and gasoline export volumes.", "In summary, we still have significant crude supply, ample natural gas availability and growing global petroleum demand that's outpacing refining capacity additions. We don't see this changing anytime soon, so although the markets will be challenging at times, the longer term macro outlook remains favorable.", "So, with that, John, I'll hand the call back to you.", "John Locke - Vice President\u2013Investor Relations", "Thank you, Joe. Moving on to the results, net income was $495 million or $1.05 per share for the first quarter of 2016. Excluding an after-tax lower of cost or market inventory valuation benefit of $212 million or $0.45 per share, we reported first quarter 2016 adjusted net income of $283 million or $0.60 per share. This compares to $964 million or $1.87 per share for the first quarter of 2015.", "For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to page six of the financial tables that accompany our release. Adjusted operating income for the refining segment in the first quarter of 2016 was $695 million or $946 million lower than in the first quarter of 2015. Margins were pressured downward primarily due to weaker distillate margins given high refinery run rates across the industry, product inventory builds and unseasonably warm weather.", "Other headwinds on refining margins included narrower domestic light sweet crude oil discounts versus the Brent benchmark, low fuel oil and petrochemical product margins, and elevated costs for RINs credits. Low crude oil prices continue to drive slowdowns in North American drilling and production, which coupled with an excess of pipeline takeaway capacity in the Mid-Continent region led to tighter discounts for crude oils relative to Brent.

Refining cash operating expenses of $3.55 per barrel were $0.40 per barrel lower than the first quarter of 2015 mostly due to higher throughput volumes and lower energy costs.", "The ethanol segment earned $9 million of adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $12 million in the first quarter of 2015. The low crude oil and gasoline price environment challenged ethanol margins, but with the recent recovery in prices, ethanol margins had modestly improved to start the second quarter.", "For the first quarter of 2016, general and administrative expenses excluding corporate, depreciation were $156 million. Net interest expense was $108 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $485 million, and the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2016 was 30%. The effective tax rate was lower than the first quarter of 2015 primarily due to higher relative earnings contribution from international operations with lower statutory tax rates.", "Regarding our balance sheet, at quarter end, we had $7.3 billion of total debt and $3.8 billion of cash and temporary cash investments, of which $102 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt to capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 20%.

From Goldman Sachs, we have Neil Mehta. Please go ahead, sir.", "Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning, guys.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Neil.", "Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Joe, you made reference to seeing opportunities in the M&A market in your opening comments. Of course, recognize that you can't comment on anything specific but can you talk about either scale, large-scale or small-scale, or whether those opportunities are more midstream-focused versus refining focused?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Neil, I'll provide some color here in a second, but let me let Mike go ahead and speak to this.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, Neil, we're looking at the opportunities that are available to us both on the refining and the midstream side. We do have a target list as Joe alluded in his comments. Some of those are corporate-related, some of those are asset-related. So, I can't provide any more specifics than that at this point.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You know, Neil, when we look at these though, I mean obviously you want to try to find opportunities where you can buy good assets and where you can achieve synergies in it. And that's certainly true on the refining side. I'll just be honest right now, there's not a whole lot that's being shown to us, but we do have our target list and there are a few conversations that are taking place.", "Then on the M&A side, it's like Mike said, I think if you think in terms of the type of deal we're going to do, it's not likely going to be some kind of large corporate deal. It's not going to be a step-out deal, but it will be more asset-focused and perhaps in the context of a partnering arrangement with people that were looking at transactions or want somebody to share in their pipe. So nothing super hot right now, though.", "Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I appreciate that, guys. And then secondly, on the distillate market, you made a reference to the fact that it is tough out there in terms of the margins for distillates. And part of that was weather, but part of it seems to be both supply and demand for the product. How do you see that going forward through the balance of the year and then can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of the export market for distillate and if that's ultimately the flywheel that can help rebalance the market?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization", "Okay, Neil. This is Gary. Yeah, I think what we've seen on distillate, we came out of winter with a lot of overhang in distillate inventory as you alluded to. And then on the demand side, you get into March and demand was way off and we've certainly seen for the past several weeks, demand continue to creep up. We've seen some good agricultural demand begin to kick in and so we've trended to where we're now more towards the five-year high, actually last week above the five-year high. So I think some of this demand will help clean up the inventory.", "And then also, you talked about the exports. We're seeing lot of good opportunities to export distillate as well, so the combination of the two of those things, I think, will help keep domestic inventories in check. Moving forward, I think as flat price continues to rise, you'll start to see some recovery in the upstream sector, which should improve distillate demand as well. But really we'll have to wait and see if we have a more normal winter this winter and that'll be a key driver in terms of what happens with the distillate fracks moving forward.", "Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "All right. Thanks, guys.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Neil.", "Operator", "From Howard Weil, we have Blake Fernandez. Please go ahead.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil", "Hey, guys. Good morning. I was hoping to get a little color on your thoughts around the drop-down targets. I believe you have a $1 billion target. I think year-to-date you've done about $240 million, but just in light of kind of some of the challenges we're seeing in the midstream, can you just share your thoughts around how you're thinking about that $1 billion target this year?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, Blake, sure. This is Mike. Before we get into that target, though, let me start off by talking about the capital markets. VLP does not need to execute any drops to meet its 25% distribution growth through 2017. So VLP does not need to access the capital markets. That being said, we believe the capital markets, both debt and equity, are open for MLPs, particularly high-quality MLPs like VLP. The cost of issuing debt or equity, however, remains more expensive than historical levels.", "The good news was VLP is well positioned with strong distribution coverage and does not need access to the capital markets from this price environment. Therefore, we are going to revise our drop-down guidance to $500 million to $750 million. We can execute drops in this range without going to the capital markets. We are going to continue to prepare for $1 billion in drops and will be ready to execute $1 billion in drops if the capital markets improve.", "From a Valero Energy perspective, regardless of whether or not we drive $500 million or $1 billion worth of assets this year to VLP, this amount will not materially change our view on our payout guidance.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil", "Got it. Okay. Thank you, Mike. That's helpful. The second question and this may tie in a little bit with Neil's M&A question, but the amount of, I guess, capital returned to shareholders, $547 million, is well above your adjusted earnings, so you're obviously well on track with that net income target. Obviously 1Q is a little weak, so maybe you see some improving earnings going forward? But I'm just curious if you were to identify some M&A opportunities, does that materially change your thought on this 75% net income target?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I would only say that we would have to look at that at the time of the acquisition. I mean, if it was a huge acquisition that might require some equity, then obviously we'd have to rethink about the buyback target. But it's going to be \u2013 right now I'm going to say no, but depending on the size of it, it could.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil", "Got it. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "From Barclays, we have Paul Cheng. Please go ahead, sir.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, guys, good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Paul.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I think the first one is for Joe and maybe then for Mike actually. On the financial strategy, I mean are you guys actively looking at and evaluating opportunity on M&A? From that standpoint, Mike and Joe, should we be more maybe conservative on the bond shape and maybe put some of the free cash flow back on the cash so that you will be ready when the opportunities strike?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Our balance sheet, Paul, is very, very strong. We want to keep it that way, but it's very strong. I think right now rather than building cash, we're going to continue to look for opportunities to grow our business and our EPS.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And, you know, Paul, I mean you saw the cash balance that we've got. As Mike said, our leverage levels are very low. We came through a tough quarter with this balance sheet. So I think we are pretty well positioned and I would tell you, though, if there was a significant M&A transaction out there, we would do the right thing as you would expect us to do and perhaps build some cash before we executed the transaction.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. The second question, maybe this is for either Gary or Lane. In the first quarter, your system-wide margin capture rate versus your benchmark is about 62%. In the first quarter last year, it's about 70%, and your average in 2015, 2014 is about 72% and 67%. So, just curious that in the first quarter this year, there much lower margin capture rate. How much is related to just the different pricing environment in the macro fund and how much is related to more company-specific reason? Any kind of insight would be great.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization", "Hey, Paul, this is Gary. I can start with, I guess it's hard to go into a lot of detail on the capture rates here, so certainly invite you to follow up with Karen and John after the call, but on some high-level things, I can tell you in terms of volume variance, there really wasn't a negative impact on volume variance for refineries. Actually, we would show that the volume variance was slightly positive for the quarter. So, what you are seeing on the capture rates is all market-driven. At a high level, there's a few things I would point to. The higher cost RINs certainly had an impact on our capture rates. The butane differential, the gasoline was much more narrow in the first quarter than what we saw last year that had an impact on the capture rates.", "In the North Atlantic basin, when you look at our crude cost relative to Brent, the narrower Brent-TI arb impacted our crude cost most importantly at Qu\u00e9bec. Also the Western Canadian crudes, the Syncrudes were more expensive in the first quarter, so the volumes coming off Line 9, so we had a crude cost impact to our North Atlantic basin system. And the only thing that's really operationally we had the Benecia cat down on the West Coast for a planned turnaround, and so our capture rates there were down a little bit as well, but those are some of the real key factors.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Gary, can I have a quick follow-up. On the second quarter, your turnaround activity, is it focusing on the conversion unit or that is crude unit?", "R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering", "Hey, Paul, this is Lane. We don't give second quarter guidance with respect to what kind of capacity we'll have in turnaround, so.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "All right. Will do. Thank you.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Paul.", "Operator", "From JPMorgan, we have Phil Gresh. Please go ahead.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi, good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Phil.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "First question on the Gulf Coast, your crude slate clearly shifted more towards mediums. On your slide deck, you have given a range historically for heavies of about 24% to 37% over time, and you were at the low end of that range 24% in the first quarter. That's actually down year-over-year, so I know you talked about the medium and heavy discounts becoming available. Were there any one-time factors that led you to have actually lower heavies in the quarter or just generally how are you thinking about crude slate as we progress through the year?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization", "Yeah, Phil, this is Gary. A couple of things, the way we report our results, we have the heavy sour crudes shown, but we also have a category we show resids, and some of those resids are actually replacements for heavy sour crudes in our system. We run the resids through our crude unit, and so where the heavy sour crudes were down, actually the resids we processed were up. So there really wasn't a significant difference in the amount of heavy sour crude we ran in the first quarter.", "In terms of the range, some of the things that we talk about, it's not just the discounts that we are looking at, there is a rate lever associated with really pushing heavy sour crudes in our system. If we want to maximize heavy sour crudes, they generally mean we are running at lower throughput, so we have to look at the discounts and also where the crack spreads are, and then we do that optimization.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Got it. Okay. Follow-up question just on the M&A front. With respect to refining to the extent you are looking there, could you just remind us how you think about regionally where you'd want to be adding exposure?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I mean, if you look at areas that we feel that we could grow, okay, and I'm doing this from just historical looks at different assets and how the FTC might view something, the West Coast, California in particular, will be very, very difficult for us. We are not really focused there. The East Coast, we've exited and so we're not interested there. The Mid-Con, I think we would be good to go on transactions and we'd be interested in there and then of course U.S. Gulf Coast. And when we look at the acquisitions, we look at them from a perspective of where can we create the greatest synergies.", "And with the portfolio of assets that we have in the U.S. Golf Coast, we believe that we can create synergies around feedstocks and product movements there perhaps better than anywhere else now. So, that would be the U.S. side. If we go over to Europe, I think we'd be interested in assets in markets like the UK where we've got a presence today and we could bolt something on and support it out of the London office. We're not interested in a lot of the countries in Western Europe just because of the nature of the assets and then the issues that go along with owning assets in those markets. And then I really think from our perspective, the Far East is off the table. So, in a nutshell, the U.S. Gulf Coast would be interesting, the Mid-Continent of the U.S. would be interesting, the UK would be interesting, and that would be our primary focus.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. And if I could just sneak one last one in on RINs? Do you have what the actual RINs cost was in the first quarter of this year relative to first quarter of last year?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we probably do.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, $161 million versus $133 million last year.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Perfect. Thanks.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Take care, Phil.", "Operator", "From Wells Fargo, we have Roger Read. Please go ahead, sir.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Yeah, good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Roger.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "I guess let me jump into the gasoline demand, obviously positive comments to start it off. Now that we're getting into the early part of summer driving season, summer grade gasoline, how is the octane market shaping up? Are we seeing significant supplies, any shortages in any particular regions? And just how you look at that as we roll through the rest of the second quarter?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization", "Hey, Roger. This is Gary. I think we're seeing a very similar situation in regards to octane what we've seen the last couple of years. Octane's starting to get tight, so we saw the regrade in the Mid-Continent strengthen significantly. The premium regrade on the West Coast has also strengthened considerably in the last couple of weeks, so I think the industry's short of octane and we'll see similar regrades to what we've been seeing in the past few years.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "So, no reason to think there's any sort of surplus octane out there at all at this point?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization", "It doesn't appear that way to me.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up on your comment on the diesel demand side, underpinned by the agricultural seasonality. I assume that backs off somewhat as we roll into the middle of the summer. Do you see any other places in the market where demand has picked up or has at least solidified versus where it was in the wintertime?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization", "I think going forward the thing we're looking at is our exports. And so you look to us and yesterday the JBC global refining margin showed Northwest Europe simple capacity at like $0.23 margin, so it doesn't take diesel falling off much before some of that low complexity capacity has to cut and as they cut, it'll open up even greater opportunities for us to export our barrels moving forward.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. That's great. Thank you.", "Operator", "From Wolfe Research, we have Paul Sankey. Please go ahead, sir.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hi, everyone. I'm not quite sure what I was called just there and I'm not going to repeat it.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Paul, it's better than probably some of the things you've been called.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Thanks, Joe. Appreciate that.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Just kidding. (30:42) All right, Paul.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Joe, you came in as CEO very clearly talking about cash return, a big jump in the dividend. I'm not quite sure why today you're suddenly saying you're going to buy stuff. If I missed something, is that mostly for VLP that you're talking about or is this a change in tone? And further to that, the macro follow-up, it seems like we got a really good environment in terms of demand and everything else out there, particularly for you guys with the heavy/light spreads and stuff, heavy sour. Why are margins not better and is that related to oversupply, do you think, which would further underline that you wouldn't want to be growing in this market? You would want to be shrinking. Thanks.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "All right. Well, I'll go first. You know, Paul, I'd say M&A is something that we've had in our capital allocation framework for the last two years and that really hasn't changed. Now it seems like you and your peers are the ones that are interested in that perhaps more than we are. When we look at our approach to trying to drive EPS growth over the next three years to five years, it's really multifaceted and it includes growth investments in refining and midstream.", "We also look at M&A and we look at share repurchases and we've got a really good pipeline of refining projects that are under development. Now we don't want to get out over our skis, so we don't really discuss the specifics on these projects that are in development until we've gone further down the approval process. But we do have a bunch of great projects that exceed the 25% IRR hurdle rate that we've talked about and we'll try to do as many of those projects as we find. Midstream investments are of interest. They've got a lower hurdle rate, as you would expect, but they will drive earnings growth through optimization, so these are critical to us also. Then when we look at the discretionary uses of cash, M&A fits into that category for us.", "And really what I just want to communicate on that is that the assets that we would look at there, Paul, would be those that create synergy and would be accretive to the company. We've got a great portfolio today and we do have that tension between the use \u2013 the discretionary use of cash via this framework that we put in place and we are not going to do an acquisition, and that's why you've seen we haven't pulled the trigger, we're not going to do an acquisition if we believe it's more accretive to do a share repurchase. So anyway return of cash to shareholders hasn't lost its priority at all from our perspective. It's just we are looking at that, growth projects and M&A as a competitive use of funds. So, with that, Gary, you want to answer the (30:47)?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization", "(30:48)", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Well, I guess, Joe, just to quickly throw in a follow-up. You're still running with the share of net income target paid out, I guess?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Right. That's right.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Thanks.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "And then, do we think \u2013 are we oversupplied in this market? Is that why margins are not better for what should be seemingly a much better environment?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization", "Yeah, I think so. You have a couple of key factors. We keep pointing down the distillate side. The warmer weather in the United States and Northwest Europe certainly hindered these demands coming through the winter and so it created this overhang we are living with today. I think the other thing that happened is the combination of relatively strong frack spreads in December and January incentivized higher utilization than what we typically see. In combination, the strong carry in the market and refiners that typically aren't running high utilizations in December and January, running high utilizations and selling their product forward, so those things kind of all contributed to build some inventory and it will just take us a little while to work that inventory off.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Understood. Very quick follow-up. Could you just update us on the impact what you're seeing in Venezuela in terms of if there is impact there and what sort of lost volumes there are? And I'll leave it at there. Thank you.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Paul.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization", "Yeah, so, Venezuela was very important piece of our crude supply situation. We've had a very good longstanding relationship with PDVSA. What we've seen is we really haven't seen a decrease in oil coming out of the country. What we have seen is with some of the rolling power outages that they've had, that the grades of oil are changing so we are seeing a greater percentage of diluted crude oils and less of some of the synthetic crude oils into our system, but our system is robust enough to be able to absorb that, so we buy those barrels and continue to run them into our system.", "Operator", "From Simmons, we have Jeff Dietert. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "Good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Jeff.", "Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "Joe, in your initial comments, you talked about seeing more medium sours on the market and we are seeing that roll through the DoE statistics historically for January and February. I was hoping you could comment on some of the recent press releases that have highlighted increased supply coming out of Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and some of the other Middle Eastern countries. Are you seeing increases of volumes coming from the Middle East coming into the market?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Jeff. Let Gary answer this. He's in the market every day.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization", "Yeah, Jeff, so we certainly are seeing that. I think on the Iranian barrels, of course we don't run any Iranian barrels, but what we've seen there is kind of some rebalancing in the market, so some of those barrels are making their way into Europe and we're seeing some of the Russian Urals come back into the U.S. market that we haven't seen here for a while. And then, yes, we are certainly seeing a lot more Saudi barrels flowing this way. We had decreased our Saudi volumes, but as they continue to put barrels on the market and they are competitive, we are ramping those back up on our system as well.", "Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "And are you seeing a shift towards an increase in imported crude versus domestic crude? Just kind of confirming. U.S. Lower 48 volumes down 670,000 barrels a day from peak and imports increasing, it seems most of that is Middle East, LAM, and Canada.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization", "Yes, I agree. What you're really seeing is a substitution somewhat of domestic light sweet for Middle East medium sours. We've seen sometimes where the arb is opened to import foreign light sweets, but that doesn't seem open very long. Same way. There is an occasional pop where the market goes, where incentivized exports of U.S. crude, but again that doesn't seem to last very long. The big switch has been a domestic light sweet for a Middle East medium sour.", "Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "Thanks for your comments.", "Joseph W.

Just two questions. First on the gasoline margins, the realized margins between the Gulf Coast, Mid-Atlantic \u2013 or sorry, Mid-Continent, if I look at the markers for the quarter, certainly in the Mid-Continent, the diesel and gasoline minus TI margins were higher than the Gulf Coast gasoline and ULSD minus Brent margins, but the realized margins in the Gulf Coast are much higher, so I just want to make sure I understand sort of what's taking place there with the Gulf Coast realized margins being higher versus the Mid-Continent despite the product market being more profitable in the Mid-Continent, and I know you guys had some run cuts.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization", "So, are you looking on a comparative basis quarter-over-quarter or are you just...?", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "No. Just in the quarter between regions. The Mid-Continent gasoline minus TI crack was stronger than the Gulf Coast gasoline minus Brent crack, but on a realized basis, it was still much stronger in the Gulf Coast than the Mid-Continent.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization", "Yeah, so, I would say probably the key thing that contributed to that is that the Mid-Continent just had very, very high inventories. And so, in order to move product out over our wholesale racks, we were actually having to discount product in order to clear the refineries and so it lowered our realized kind of crack capture.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, that makes sense. And then on light/heavy differentials, it looks like recently, just in the last week or two, the differentials sort of narrowed a little bit. Just wondering what you're seeing there despite sort of the talk of more availability of heavy sour crudes in the market.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization", "Yeah, I think the thing that happened there is really the K and the Maya formula changed, and at the same time it changed, the Brent-TI arb came in and fuel oil strengthened a little bit, and so it really made it to where Maya isn't pricing competitive with medium sour alternatives or really even pricing competitive with Canadian alternatives into the Gulf, which tells me the Maya formula is going to have to change again and the Maya discount will have to widen going forward.", "Faisel H.

Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks. And then I am not exactly sure this is an M&A question specifically or more a broader U.S. market question, but it feels like the breakup of Motiva is potentially a significant development in the domestic downstream market. Kind of how do you assess these opportunities and maybe even the risk associated with that event?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, okay. I don't know that I've assessed it the way you're asking. I mean we understand that they had a partnership that they wanted to both exit and they decided to do that. I think Saudi is pleased with the assets that they got in the deal and Shell is pleased with the assets that they have in the deal, and that's really all we know about that one to be quite honest. I do not view this transaction, though, as a precursor to a whole series of other major similar type of transactions in the U.S., Chi. I just don't \u2013 we're not hearing it and we're not seeing it.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Do you think Aramco is looking to take more refining capacity here? And will the government even allow that, do you think?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I can't \u2013 I'd only be speculating and I really don't have an opinion on it. Again, I think they'd have to find something that was for sale if they wanted to engage and I just don't know if there's a significant portfolio of assets out there that they could get into.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Well, thanks, Joe. Appreciate that.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You bet. Sorry, Chi.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Yeah, no. It's...", "Operator", "From Cowen & Company, we have Sam Margolin. Please go ahead.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "So, on U.S. crude exports, you touched on it for a second, windows not open all that often. But you're still seeing some upstream companies talk about it. There've been a couple of press releases. Have you seen any effect? And I ask in the context of the Corpus Christi topper, which sounds like it had a pretty good result in the quarter and doesn't seem really affected by either diffs or single cargoes exiting the Gulf whenever temporary windows open.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization", "Yeah, this is Gary again. I don't think we've really seen any significant impact of the exports on any of our operations.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. And that's sort of like \u2013 so the topper performance is essentially in line, you think, sort of operating with expectations in the current environment? Are there any commodity factors that are dynamic that affect that, if it's not differentials?", "R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering", "Hey, Sam. This is Lane. We started up in December our funding investment decision, which was about $150 million of EBITDA. If you use 2015 pricing, it made about $200 million and if you look at the last quarter, we're estimating it contributed about $35 million. So it's in line with our funding decision, and then Gary spoke to the market on it, so that's where the project sort of fits.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Any other factors that are affecting it?", "R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering", "Well, you have commodity risk all over the place. I think when we analyze a project, the one that we always stare at the most is naphtha. The Gulf has long naphtha with crude in it backed out resid purchases and so we always have a keen eye on the placement of naphtha that's created due to both of these projects, both the Corpus Christi and the Houston crudes. That's where I would say the greatest commodity risk is.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks. And I hate to harp on M&A because I recognize the opportunity to give color is limited, but I just wanted to touch on something you said about the Gulf Coast and ask about any regulatory elements we should know about. It sounds if the FTC is sort of pretty generous with these market share requirements or if it would be a little tougher?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You know, Sam, I never really heard anybody use generous and FTC in the same context, but I would describe them as a very reasonable group quite honestly and we've had a lot of dealings with them over the years as we've done acquisitions. I believe that what they would look at not only for Valero but for anybody is your ability to restrict trade in a particular market. And because the Gulf Coast is so long and so oversupplied and the barrels tend to move throughout the U.S. and abroad, you're not going to run into a situation whereby having a more significant concentration in the Gulf Coast, you could run into a situation where you could manipulate markets, it just wouldn't be possible. So, anyway, I really don't think they'd have a problem with additional Gulf Coast exposure for Valero.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "All right. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "From Credit Suisse, we have Ed Westlake. Please go ahead.", "Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hi, guys. Good morning. A couple of small ones. Just on the comment you said seeing a lot more OPEC barrels coming this way, is that a recent change or is that just a general comment around sort of the first quarter and market conditions? I'm just specifically thinking about the failure of Doha and whether that has sort of brought any more assertiveness into the marketing of these barrels to you given you're a big medium and heavy consumer?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization", "I think we have seen a strategic shift that the Saudis have made an effort to regain the market share they lost to a lot of the domestic crude producers and they're exporting a lot more barrels to the U.S. Gulf Coast, and we certainly saw that in the first quarter and we expect it will continue.", "Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Just then on the Gulf Coast, I mean you've got these toppers coming up, so that's adding to capacity and yet your sort of guidance was just a little bit soft. I mean just maybe is it the startup of those CDUs within the quarter?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Throughput guidance.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Throughput guidance, yeah.", "R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering", "So, Ed, I'll take a stab at this. I mean John sort of alluded to it. There's an \u2013 they're \u2013 both of the crude units are running in \u2013 the Corpus Christi crude unit is running in the second quarter and the Houston crude unit starts up in the second quarter. All the rest of the volume guidance is related to other activities and with our market outlook and the capacity that we plan to run with.", "Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. And then on the RIN size, just we've obviously got the costs and we'll do the calculation, but are you drawing down any inventories? I mean folks are getting perhaps even more concerned about RIN prices into 2017 given the mandate and where your inventory position of the refining industry will be. Obviously there's an election between now and then, but maybe some color as to what \u2013 if everything was unchanged, what sort of inflation you might see in that RIN cost into 2017?", "Martin Parrish - Vice President-Alternative Fuels", "Yeah, this is Martin Parrish. I think a lot of it \u2013 there's quite a bit of stock to pull down on the RIN, so we'll see it and we still don't have clear sight of what's going to be called for in 2017. So I think right now it's a little early to say. It's been kind of remarkably stable for the last few months, RIN prices, so we'll see.", "Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "And then final small one, you mentioned that you thought the waterborne octane components have been cleared up at this point. Maybe just some extra color, I mean we do hear anecdotes of (44:30) cargoes floating around, which would make limited sense to me.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization", "Yeah. So we heard the same thing, that there was a lot of cargoes, especially parked off New York Harbor. Our understanding is a lot of that has actually come in over the last couple of weeks. And as I mentioned, we're actually seeing the premium regrade start to widen, which kind of contradicts this idea that there is all this octane laying around.", "Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Yeah. And typically it widens more in May, so we'll watch that closely. Okay. Thanks very much.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Ed.", "Operator", "From RBC Capital Markets, we have Brad Heffern. Please go ahead.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good morning, everyone.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Brad.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Joe and I guess maybe for Gary too, in the opening remarks, you talked about how strong export \u2013 or product export demand has continued to be. Can you dive a little more into that? Have there been any changes in terms of where that demand is coming from and I'm sort of asking about specifically in the context of what seems to be weaker Latin American growth?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization", "Yeah, Brad, this is Gary. So in the first quarter, we did 249,000 barrels a day of diesel. If you include jet and kerosene with that, we're up to 295,000 barrels a day. That was split with about 80% going to Latin America, 20% to Europe. During the first quarter, the arb to Europe was closed most of the first half of the first quarter. It opened back up and has remained opened, so I think you'll see a little more volume going to Europe but we're still seeing very good Latin America demand for diesel as well moving forward.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Thanks for that. And then maybe for Mike. Thinking about the cadence of CapEx, the first quarter number looked pretty light relative to where I expected it to be. And certainly on a run rate basis, it's not particularly close to the $2.6 billion annual guidance. Is there a reason to think that the CapEx is going to pick up throughout the year or are you guys running ahead?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Right now, the $2.6 billion is what we have in our forecast. On an annualized basis, obviously we're way short of that, but we're okay on the forecast.", "R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering", "Hey, Brad. This is Lane. I'll give a little color on that. I mean the first quarter's always a little bit of a challenge. You're coming out of the holidays and you have weather to contend with. And so the first quarter for us, at least seasonally, is always light with respect to our CapEx. We'll spend some \u2013 we'll spend more than the run rate \u2013 than that rate second quarter and third quarter, and then it slows down again in the fourth quarter. And so that's where I would say the seasonality of the CapEx has been for our company.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Thanks for that.", "Operator", "From Bank of America Merrill Lynch, we have Doug Leggate. Please go ahead.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Oh, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I was wondering if I was going to get squeezed in there or not. How're you doing, Joe?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good, Doug. You?", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Not too bad. Thank you. I got a couple; one micro and one specific. I guess it's a follow-up to Brad's question. Last year when margins, gasoline in particular, was extraordinary strong at the beginning of the year, European refiners were running pretty hard. And I guess that, that dynamic is changing quite a bit. Given your European footprint or your Pembroke exposure, I'm just curious as to what you're seeing there. Is the distillate market starting to tighten up a little bit, at least in terms of what your prior comments were about the potential for export reopening?", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization", "Yeah, so we've seen the arb to export diesel to Europe open since midway through the first quarter. It remains open today and we are seeing good demand for European quality distillate in our system.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So I guess what I'm getting at, are you seeing refinery runs \u2013 is that translating to lower production in the region? At least that's what we're seeing. I just wanted to see if it was showing up on your markets as well locally.", "Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization", "Yeah, so I think what you're \u2013 at least my view of where they are in Northwest Europe, the refineries that are cutting are primarily refineries that are producing fuel oil because fuel oil is so discounted today. Pembroke is a pretty high conversion refinery, so we're seeing production remain very high at Pembroke.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Two quick follow-ups, if I may. So the first one, I'm afraid, is M&A as well. Just very curious, Joe, you mentioned Europe. I mean European markets traditionally have not been anywhere near as seasonal or healthy, if you like, as the U.S. How would you characterize the opportunity set that you see there or was it just a passing comment?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, it's more of a passing comment. I would say very limited. But I don't want to tell you we would never look at a UK refinery and then we show up in some point in time and do it, and you remind me of it. But I mean, Doug, you know those markets. I mean frankly, we've said this for years that \u2013 and we got a gem in Pembroke. And back to your first question, all the diesel that's produced at Pembroke moves inland, most of the gasoline. And so we've got a fairly unique footprint there in that we're able to supply the domestic markets in Ireland in a very efficient way.", "So we really like that. We could find a similar type of asset in a market that was similar, okay, and when I say that, I really am thinking primarily of the UK. Well, I think we'd consider it. Now, are we having active conversations on anything like that? No. But would we want to move into France, Spain, Italy or the Med? The answer would be no. So it's more of a passing comment.", "But we tell you guys we're looking at everything that's out there and we do that because we're always looking for opportunities to continue to grow the EPS. But again, we're very pleased with the portfolio that we have and we can create significant income with it. So we don't feel desperate to do anything in that M&A market. Certainly, again, it's in competition for all the other good uses of cash that we have.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Unrelated, I guess my follow-up is for Mike. Mike, the tax \u2013 or the cash received for the drop-down relative to the price agreed. How should we think about the after-tax proceeds versus your slightly lower drop-down target?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I would think, I mean we're going to continue to look at each of the drops, as we come up on them in this course, as far as how we want the financing we do to mitigate taxes. I think it would probably be on this next drop similar of a cash tax \u2013 after-tax cash as (50:58).", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You know, Doug, looking longer term and this is just the reality of it, a lot of the logistics assets that would be dropped are going to \u2013 they got zero tax basis, and so I think for a long time when everybody was looking at 10-time multiples, 11-time multiples on these drop transactions with all that cash flowing back in, we were really overstating the actual cash that would be coming back into the sponsor, and so the reality of it is we are not changing the portfolio of assets that we have to drop. We're really looking at the drop structure and doing it as efficiently as we can. Again, Mike mentioned earlier that we think the capital markets are certainly there, but it's a little bit expensive to go to the public markets today. We don't have a gun to our head to do something because we've got the distribution covered for two years with the cash flow stream that we have today.", "And all the things that you mentioned earlier, I think we are in a very, very strong position here and we can take our time and time to market and be patient in doing this and whether we do $500 million or $750 million now and then we will start talking about next year what we are going to do, we are going to continue to grow the LP, we are going to continue to drop, I think we're just waiting to see if things don't improve a bit and certainly higher crude prices should take some of this pressure off if we see the crude markets move up and we should be in a good place going forward.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Appreciate all your comments, Joe, and your patience with all our M&A questions this morning. Thanks.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No problem.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Locke for closing remarks.", "John Locke - Vice President\u2013Investor Relations", "Okay. Thank you, Bianca. We appreciate you all for joining us today.

At this time participants are in a listen-only mode. And later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Locke, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thanks, Vanessa. Good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations & Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and several other members of Valero's senior management team.", "If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.", "I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under Federal securities laws. These are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Joe for a few opening remarks.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, our team again operated safely and reliably, and did a good job of capturing margin in a low, but improving margin environment. We also executed our projects well, completing major turnarounds and progressing on growth investments, while optimizing our portfolio.", "These actions enabled us to produce positive cash flow and to return a healthy amount of cash to stockholders. In the market, we continue to see solid product demand domestically and internationally. The sustained low price of crude oil and petroleum products, along with strong export demand, helped create a pull on domestic product inventories. We're also encouraged by the modest return of domestic shale crude production, which is good for diesel demand and crude differentials.", "On the downside, we continue to see negative impacts on Valero's earnings from exorbitant RINs prices. For the year, we expect to incur costs in the range of $750 million to $850 million to purchase RINs. At these levels, the expense is significant to our company and has our full attention.", "You've likely seen that we filed a petition with the EPA to address this issue. Our efforts are focused on moving the point of obligation, which we believe will not only level the playing field among refiners and retailers, but it'll also improve the penetration of renewable fuels, reduce RIN fraud, lower RIN speculation, and reduce costs for the consumer. We have had many constructive conversations with regulators and these conversations continue today. As you'd expect, we continue to work this issue aggressively.", "As I mentioned a moment ago, our refining operations were very good. We ran reliably during the quarter and experienced very little unplanned downtime. We completed major turnarounds at our Port Arthur and Ardmore refineries, which our teams planned very well and executed safely and successfully, and we will be wrapping up the restart process over the next few days.", "Our ethanol business performed very well, recording its highest operating income contribution since the fourth quarter of 2014. Our plants are the most competitive in the industry and are run by dedicated people. So it's great to see them again contributing to Valero's earnings in a meaningful way.", "Regarding strategic investments, we're pleased to have both our new crude units up and running. The Corpus Christi crude unit, which was completed late last year, and the Houston crude unit, which was completed in June, both ran well during the quarter.", "Turning to the development of our Houston alkylation unit, the project is in the engineering and procurement phase and on track for completion in the first half of 2019. The economics of this project look good, given the tight outlook for octane and it also positions us well for Tier 3 gasoline compliance. Looking ahead to 2017, we expect spending on capital investments to be similar to the budget for 2016, which was $2.6 billion.", "I also want to share an update on our portfolio. Effective October 1, we disposed of our Aruba business. We've been on the island and in the community for a long time and worked hard to produce a win-win for Valero and the Government of Aruba. In addition, the Government of Aruba secured a new operator who plans to invest capital in the site and operate it as a bitumen upgrader, which should have a positive economic impact on the community. We're happy for the people of Aruba and for the assets to have a renewed purpose on the island.", "With respect to Valero Energy Partners, the dropdown of the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal in", "September helped us achieve our dropdown target for the year. Yesterday, we announced the distribution increase of 5.5% for the third quarter, which puts us on track to deliver 25% distribution growth through 2017. Although we don't plan to provide dropdown guidance for 2017 at this time, we are comfortable setting the target for annual distribution growth for 2018 of at least 20%. You'll hear more from VLP on their call later this week, but VLP has excellent operations, is in great shape.", "And finally, despite significant turnarounds during the quarter and the low-margin environment, we generated solid cash flow from operations. So far this year, we returned 148% of net income to stockholders and we're well ahead of our 75% payout ratio target for the year. We're also extending our payout ratio target of at least 75% of net income to 2017.", "So with that, John, I'll hand the call back over to you.", "John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thank you, Joe. For the quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $613 million or $1.33 per share, which compares to $1.4 billion or $2.79 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Excluding an income tax benefit of $42 million, or $0.09 per share related to the Aruba disposition, third quarter 2016 adjusted net income was $571 million, or $1.24 per share. Please refer to the reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts that begin on page three of the earnings release tables.", "Operating income for the refining segment in the third quarter of 2016 was $990 million, which was $1.3 billion lower than the third quarter of 2015. Primary drivers of the decline were weaker gasoline and distillate margins due to elevated product inventories, lower discounts for most sweet and sour crude oils relative to Brent crude oil, and higher RIN prices.", "Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.9 million barrels per day in the third quarter of 2016, which was in line with the third quarter of 2015. Our refineries operated at 95% throughput capacity utilization, with major turnarounds that occurred at the Port Arthur and Ardmore refineries. Both refineries are currently in the process of restarting operations.", "Refining cash operating expenses of $3.63 per barrel in the third quarter of 2016 were $0.17 per barrel lower compared to the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to lower employee-related expenses and adjustments related to the Aruba disposition.", "The ethanol segment generated $106 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2016, which was $71 million higher than in the third quarter of 2015, largely due to higher gross margin per gallon resulting from lower corn prices.", "For the third quarter of 2016, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $192 million and net interest expense was $115 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $470 million and the effective tax rate was 18% in the third quarter of 2016. The effective tax rate was lower-than-expected and lower than the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to income tax benefit on the Aruba disposition and the favorable settlement of an income tax audit.", "With respect to our balance sheet, at quarter end, total debt was $9 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $5.9 billion. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 25%. We had approximately $5 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. We generated $863 million of cash from operating activities in the third quarter, which was after the impact of $176 million of unfavorable working capital changes, primarily a decrease in accounts payable.", "With regards to investing activities, we made $453 million of capital investments.", "Moving to financing activities, we returned $778 million in cash to stockholders in the third quarter, which included $276 million in dividend payments and $502 million for the purchase of 9.2 million shares of Valero common stock. We completed a $1.25 billion public debt offering in September, and in October we repaid $950 million of senior notes due in 2017. On a pro forma basis, after the repayment, our debt-to-capital ratio was 22%.", "Our Board of Directors approved an incremental $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization in September. And at quarter end, we had approximately $2.7 billion of repurchase authorization remaining. For 2016, we expect capital investments to total about $2.4 billion, which is slightly below our previous guidance due to lower turnaround costs and the timing of some growth CapEx spend.", "For modeling our fourth quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges. U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.58 million to 1.63 million barrels per day. U.S. Mid-Continent at 420,000 to 440,000 barrels per day. U.S. West Coast at 270,000 to 290,000 barrels per day. In the North Atlantic, at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day.", "Refining cash operating expenses are estimated at approximately $3.75 per barrel in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect cost attributed to meeting our biofuel blending obligations, primarily related to RINs in the United States, to be between $750 million and $850 million for 2016.", "Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.9 million gallons per day. Operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs, such as depreciation and amortization. G&A expenses for the fourth quarter, excluding corporate depreciation, are expected to be about $200 million and net interest expense should be about $150 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $465 million and our effective tax rate should be around 31%.", "That concludes our opening remarks. And before we open the call to questions, we ask that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. This will help us ensure that other callers have time to ask their questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And we have our first question from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thanks. Maybe if I could just ask \u2013 start out asking on payout and cash return to shareholders. Again \u2013 and this has been the case, I guess, over the course of the year, where you significantly exceeded your official payout target again despite a fairly challenging year. I mean, how do you think about managing this going forward? I know you reset the bar at 75% for 2017. How do you view the balance between returning the cash to shareholders and preserving optionality for growth projects that are \u2013 and (14:25) M&A, if necessary?", "Unknown Speaker", "Well, all of those options are part of our capital allocation. So we did set the target at, at least 75% for 2017. So going forward we feel like that's an appropriate way to go into the \u2013 appropriate rate to start the year with, and then we'll analyze that as we move through the year and adjust it as accordingly.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks. Then maybe one question on the product environment as we head into the winter. I mean, last year the industry massively overproduced gasoline through the winter, setting up a challenging position into 2016. Can you share your thoughts, as we head into this winter, on managing inventories of gasoline versus just for (15:16) balance as you shift to winter-grade gasoline and what role \u2013 I know on the last quarter we talked some about potential for economic run cuts into the latter part of the year. Do you still see that as necessary in managing inventories, or we done enough work at this point where you think you're okay?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, Ryan, this is Gary. I think that we will need to see some economic run cuts in the industry. If you look at what's happened in the market, Chicago has been selling off fairly sharply over the last week and we're starting to see inventories build in the Mid-Continent. So, typically, especially in that land locked region, the market is short product in the summer and becomes long product in the winter. And I think refineries in that region will need to cut to balance the market as we move into the fourth and first quarters.", "Elsewhere, I think a lot of what you saw last year in terms of refiners running high on utilization and producing summer-grade gasoline was really a function of the steep carry in the market. And certainly at least the Brent curve is flatter this year than what we saw last year. And I think as there's not as much carry in the market, it will go ahead and cause refiners to cut down on utilization and avoid some of the products build that we saw last year.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thank you.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thanks, Ryan.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Good morning, Roger.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Just a couple of questions I'd like to kind of hit on here. First as part of the capital allocation and something that's gotten hammered in some prior conference calls, so let's get out the tools again for this one. M&A and plenty of units appear to be on the market, not all, of course, would be interesting to you. But I was wondering how you're looking at the M&A market, and is that still something that seems attractive to Valero?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "Okay. Yeah, Roger, this is Mike. It is attractive. We're \u2013 on the capital allocation side it's definitely part of our strategy. We're interested in acquiring logistics assets that provide third party revenue or are strategic to our core business. And on the refining side, we're interested in assets that are high quality, globally competitive and advantaged location. So for us that primarily means the U.S. Gulf Coast.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "And any thoughts beyond the Gulf Coast of anything that \u2013 I mean, is there any real interest in moving beyond kind of your existing footprint further into Europe, anything like that?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Roger, this is Joe. I mean, if assets came into the market, we'd look. But I would tell you, no, there's nothing on the radar screen right now outside of what Mike described to you. I think if you look at our system, you see where we could produce the greater synergies and that would be the U.S. Gulf Coast, and so that is our focus.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Appreciate that, and then unrelated follow-up. You mentioned the improvement in U.S. drilling being good for diesel demand and for the differentials. Obviously, diesel demand happens quicker. Do you have kind of a rule of thumb that you use for rigs and diesel demand on either a \u2013 I don't know \u2013 I guess, a daily basis or anything like that?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Roger, this is Gary. I really can't \u2013 I don't have any insight into that at all.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Very interesting question, though.", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yes.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "We all looked at each other, Roger, when you asked it.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "All right. So I've stumped the masters for a change. Appreciate it, guys. Thank you.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "You got it.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey. Good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Good morning, Phil.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "First question is just on the capital spending for this year. Obviously, you've been running at an exceptionally low rate, even relative to your guidance for the full year. So wondering what the key drivers of the lower capital spending have been, and if there's something specific in the fourth quarter that would suggest such a high rate implicit in the full year guidance.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "Okay. The capital for 2016 here is, we've adjusted it for $2.4 billion. It's primarily due to lower turnaround costs than what we had anticipated. And then we have some timing on our growth capital expenditure spend that's being lower. It's really a timing issue, as John discussed in his notes. So some of that's being pushed to the future here.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then just maybe a second question on the balance sheet. With your leverage ratio at 22%, which is still pretty conservative relative to the 20% to 30% target range, if fundamentals remain challenging again next year like they were this year, should we think that you'd be willing to be similarly aggressive next year? Is there any reason that this year would be unique?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "Aggressive in what -", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "In terms of buying back well above your target.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "Oh. Yeah. I mean, what we do consider, in a lower earnings environment, the net income obviously is a little bit lower, but we do have quite a bit of depreciation in there. So we look at other factors as well as cash flow. So we'll look at our cash flow generating capabilities and all our sources of cash in paying out and buying back the stock.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "I guess my \u2013 the question would be, are you willing to add a little bit more leverage, if necessary, to continue down the path of buybacks?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "No, we would not. We would not lever up to buy back stock.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.", "Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Hi, Neil.", "Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Joe, can we get your comments on this RINs topic. Thanks for your comments earlier. But what do you think the political appetite is to actually change the RVO this year, and then from your dialogue and discussion with Washington to ultimately change the point of obligation?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, okay. So, it's very hard for me to comment on the political situation, so let me focus on the second part first. Okay? And I mentioned that the conversations that we've had have been very constructive. We've had conversations not only with the regulators, but also with the White House. And there is a clear acknowledgment that the structure of the current program isn't delivering the desired results. And so, these are smart people that we're talking to, and they're really trying to understand it and figure out.", "So, as an industry, let me just say this, the independent refiners, AFPM and certainly Valero, we're working with them to help them understand the issue, certainly as we see it. And there's a clear acknowledgment that we've got a situation that needs to be resolved.", "Now, as far as the political climate, you know what, we're couple of weeks away from the election. And although we would love to see something change this year, I don't know that we'll get that. But it's certainly receiving enough attention and it is being discussed, to the point where we believe that it's getting worked and that we should have some type of resolution and relief in the not too near future.", "Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I appreciate that, Joe. And the second is more specific to the quarter. It was a strong quarter, particularly in the Gulf Coast. Can you talk about what you think drove the strength of the captures despite the downtime at Port Arthur? And any of these factors that you would define as more one-time versus repeatable?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Neil, this is Gary. I think, first, we ran very well and that certainly contributed. When I look at the market factors, I would say the biggest thing I see is, we buy a lot of other feedstocks other than crude, a lot of VGO and resids. And if you look at the pricing of the VGOs and resids that we purchased in the U.S. Gulf Coast system relative to Brent, they were much cheaper than what we saw either last quarter or a year ago at this time. And I would say that was the biggest driver to the capture rates.", "Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "That's great, guys. Thank you.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thanks, Neil.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Good morning, Paul.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Joe, I hear you talking about the U.S. Gulf Coast as the desired M&A target region for you. But of course that Shell is also putting up their San Francisco refining system for sale and realistically not too many people will be interested in buying. So from an M&A standpoint, does it make it intriguing for you to look at that, given that you already have two refineries? Now if you add another one, you may get something that you benefit probably not as much as what you can get from the Gulf Coast, but at the same time the competition for the bid is probably much lower.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah. Paul, that's a very good question and let me just share this that when we have looked at our ability to acquire additional assets in California historically, we have been precluded. And it's more of a FTC issue for us than anything else. I think it would be very, very difficult for us to execute another refinery acquisition in California. Perhaps the West Coast would be something that would be viable, but I don't think we could get another deal done in California. So, it really hasn't been something that we've spent a lot of time talking about.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "So even after Tesoro get approval to buy Carson, you think that the whole FTC restriction is still being applied?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yes, I think for us it certainly would be.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I see. Okay. Second question that you do have a nice UK operation. Just curious that on the ground what have you seen in terms of the European demand? Are they \u2013 I mean, we have seen unseasonal uptick in the European refining margins. So is it driven primarily because people on the refinery downtime or that the underlying strength and the demand is better than people think?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Paul, this is Gary. I don't know if it was really tied to downtime or not, but we did see very good wholesale demand through our UK system. And our wholesale profitability certainly contributed to our results in the North Atlantic Basin.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "So, Gary, you think it's more demand-driven than supply?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "I really don't know that I see the data well enough to be able to comment on that, Paul.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I see. All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Good morning, Evan.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey, Joe. So, some encouraging comments this morning on the RFS and the RFS topic. Can you give us update on your lawsuits? Procedurally, where they stand? What are the key dates moving forward, just so we can at least follow how things have progressed on that more hostile front?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah. Hey, listen, Evan, why don't I let Jay Browning, who's neck deep in this thing just give you some color?", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Perfect.", "Jay D. Browning - Valero Energy Corp.", "The timeline is really going to be driven more by the process that Joe was describing. EPA's expected to finalize a rule, I believe, by the end of November. And the litigation will play out and there's lots and lots of players who are involved with that. So there is \u2013 at this point there's really nothing to put out there in front of you in terms of detail on timing that would be crucial to the process. I think other factors \u2013 the political process is more the driver at this point.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "So, I mean, litigation is kind of being used in that, I guess, negotiation or information awareness process at this stage?", "Jay D. Browning - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, I mean, the litigation is out there, but it is more or less used as a framework and as a last resort. Obviously, our preference would be for EPA to volitionally move the point of obligation of its own accord rather than being forced through the litigation process. But we've got the litigation out there just to \u2013 as a placeholder and a stake in the ground, if you will, just to let everybody know this issue is not going to go away.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. And November's approaching. My second question is more of a macro question. We look at global turnarounds for the industry, at least planned, as being much lower in 2016 relative to 2015 and that having been a major contributor to weaker sequential cracks (29:10) this year. You can see it and you've mentioned it in the higher utilization data. I know Valero \u2013 I know you guys plan turnarounds several years in advance, but can you give us any color on your expectations for planned maintenance into 2017, at least sequentially higher or lower, and any views on that potential normalization of turnarounds providing a better environment in 2017?", "John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, Evan, this is John. I think you summed it up. We really don't have kind of a forward view on turnarounds that we can share. I know there's resources out there where people can go and get views from contractors and what not, but I think our in-house view is we just don't have forward guidance on turnarounds.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. All right, guys. Thank you.", "John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thanks, Evan.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert with Simmons.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "Good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Hi, Jeff.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "Appreciate the guidance \u2013 or target on the 75% payout for 2017. I was hoping you could talk about some of the major factors that you expect to influence profitability in 2017. Some of the factors we're watching, Tier 3 implementation, CAFE standards, potential OPEC cuts. What do you see as the major drivers for 2017 margin environment?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "So, Jeff, let me go ahead and \u2013 that's one of those questions that, I mean, we just are going to kind of share musings on I guess. So, why don't I just see if Gary and Lane have any comments for you on it?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "I guess I'll start with the OPEC cuts, Jeff, that you brought up. So far, we'll know a lot more about what's going to happen there when they have their November meeting. But if you look at the proposed volumes of the cuts, it looks like the volumes are about the same as what Saudi Arabia typically burns in the summer for power generation. So I don't know that we'll see any real impact on exports even if they had the cuts.", "But overall, the world is still oversupplied with oil and we expect we'll see greater exports from Nigeria, Libya, Kazakhstan, Iraq, and Brazil. So we still feel like on the crude feedstock side, you're going have this competition between medium sour crudes and light sweet, where they're competing for available refining capacity, which will cause the medium sour discounts to be wide. And then with additional exports from Canada and South America on the heavy side, the heavies are going to have to compete with medium sours, and so we expect good discounts there. That's kind of a view of the crude markets.", "On the product side, I think we think that the gasoline market, as long as you're in this low price environment, you'll continue to see good demand response on gasoline. And then on distillate, we expect a little bit more normal winter weather in both the United States and Northwest Europe will help the distillate market along with some recovery and economic growth, and we'll see a little bit stronger distillate cracks going into next year. Lane, I don't know what else you -", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "The only thing I'd comment on is Tier 3. January 1 of this coming year is when Tier 3 really comes into effect. There are people like us who generated credits with our existing units under Tier 2, which put us in position not really needing to get all of our capacity up and running until 2020. But different people \u2013 or different companies and refineries are in different position with respect to that. So between 2017 \u2013 beginning of 2017 and somewhere in the 2020 timeframe you'll see these units start up. That will destroy octane, so you should see alkylate and the premium regrade strengthen throughout that period.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "Thanks. Secondly, if I could ask about your RINs guidance for the full year. We've lost our ability to track RINs prices on a regular basis, and I was hoping you could comment on where RINs prices are now. It would appear that there's either a price or a volume increase in the fourth quarter that would be required, given the first three quarters of expenses you've had to get into this $750 million to $850 million range.", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, yeah \u2013 no, Jeff, I think, look, what's going happen in the RINs prices going forward, we've heard a lot of RINs commentary about things that could affect the prices, so I think we have a forecast. We have a view. We set that out. It's a pretty wide range accordingly, right, $750 million to $850 million. You can see where our actuals have been through the year. But we just have to kind of stay tuned and see. We're not prepared to change it at this time.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, I mean, year-to-date we're at about $525 million is the expense. Second quarter was roughly \u2013 or third quarter was roughly $200 million.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "All right. Thanks for your comments.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "And, Jeff, just one thing. We're not trying to be resistant to giving you guidance on this. But if you look historically at where they've been, from 2011 to 2015, I think RIN price averaged like $0.33. Last year they were like $0.55 \u2013 $0.50 to $0.55. This year, obviously, they've been higher than that. And I think a lot of it comes down to where is the EPA going to set the RVO. And if they set a high RVO, where they're pushing us through the blend wall, I think we can all expect that we're going to have high RINs prices. And if they set it at a reasonable level that's achievable by industry, then I think we'll see it come off again. There's so many reasons that it's high right now, but it is clearly those with length are taking advantage of those that are short, and we're seeing that in the speculation in the market. So again, it's an unregulated market with not a lot of transparency. It is really very, very difficult to forecast.", "Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International", "Yeah, certainly opportunity for substantial volatility. I appreciate that. Thank you.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, so sorry, bud.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good morning, everyone.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Hi, Brad.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Gary, following-on on the OPEC question from earlier. I was curious specifically about Venezuela. I think it would be consensus that those are among the most at-risk volumes in the world right now. So I'm curious how much Valero takes from Venezuela, and also if you take any sort of net credit risk in your commercial activities with Venezuela?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, so I'll comment on \u2013 really our volumes are not consistent month-to-month. They vary up and down, and I'll let Mike comment on the credit.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "Okay. Most of the business that we have is with Citgo, but we really don't discuss our credit analysis and stuff with our various customers.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, got it. And then, Mike, I guess following-on on an earlier question about CapEx, maybe trying to attack it a different way. I think that year-to-date you guys have spent like $1.4 billion in CapEx. You've been doing like $450 million or $500 million a quarter. So that would imply like $1 billion of spending in the fourth quarter. Is there any reason why that would be the case? Why the spending would go up so much? I know in the past sometimes you've included like an acquisition or something in those numbers. Is that what's responsible for it?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "No, we don't include acquisitions in these numbers. I mean, it's the estimate that we have at this time. We've got the turnaround spend being finished here. And so that's the number that we've decided to give at this point. There's probably a little downside \u2013 or it will come in a little below that.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis with UBS.", "Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC", "Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow-up on the payout ratio there and maybe narrow it a little bit and focus more on the dividend. I think the goal earlier this year was to get that dividend higher, closer to peers or at least at the top end of the range. And I guess you're there right now. So, just curious your appetite to increase it from here as you head into next year and how that figures into your 75% ratio.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, we've already increased the dividend once this year. But if you look at how our history demonstrates, we would like to be in the position of increasing our dividend annually. And as you mentioned, our intention is to pay at the top end of the range, and so we'll monitor that and stay at the top end of the range as we move forward.", "Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. That makes sense. And then second question just wanted to follow-up on your comments around, I guess, export demand for refined products and maybe a few different angles here. I guess we're surprised that it's actually held up this strong, because we continue to hear about the bloated stockpiles globally, anecdotally here about Chinese gasoline cargoes hitting the East Coast of the U.S., and so clearly lot of product out there. And I guess I'm just wondering how sustainable that demand is, if you can give us some granularity on where that pull is coming from, and how much is maybe refinery outages in South America that maybe you can't count on to always be there.", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, this is Gary. I think we continue to see very good demand for gasoline into Mexico and South America. I think in the short term some of that is certainly driven by refinery outages, but we see good growth in that region and expect that we'll see continued exports into those regions moving forward. Certainly, the opening up of Mexico will also help us with our export business as well. Distillates we see good demand in both South America and the yard to Europe is currently open. So we see very good demand on the distillate side as well.", "Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. Appreciate the color. That's it for me. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez with Scotia Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil", "Hey, guys. Good morning. Nice results on the quarter. Gary, just following-up on that last comment on the exports, it looks like there was a pretty healthy decline quarter-to-quarter, and I didn't know if that's just kind of seasonal in nature, if the arb window simply closed or anything like that. I didn't know if maybe it was potentially reflective of weakness in demand.", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "No, Blake, I'll break it apart. On the gasoline side we did 93,000 barrels a day, which is down some, but gasoline typically follows seasonal patterns. While you're in driving season here in the U.S., we typically don't export as much and it's more a statement of the strength of the U.S. market rather than lack of demand into the export markets. ULSD we did 236,000 barrels a day. If you add the jet and kerosene, we were at 283,000 barrels a day. There it was more a function of the turnaround activity we had in the Gulf. The Meraux hydro cracker was down and then we had the Port Arthur turnaround. And so it just limited the availability of export quality distillate into our system, and that's why the numbers are down on the distillate.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil", "Got it. Okay. And then the second question. I realize you're not going to want to get into too much detail on guidance on this, but typically when we see a crude spike like we've see in this quarter, there tends to be a negative impact on the secondary product pricing and resid. And I'm just curious if you're kind of witnessing some of that in the marketplace. I guess, what I'm fishing around on is, should capture rates maybe suffer a bit quarter-to-quarter as a result of the rapid increase that we've seen?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Blake, you're correct. Normally you would see that. The one thing that's different for us is we've seen that propylene prices spike fairly considerably. So the strength in propylene in our system thus far has really offset the negative impact of the secondary products that we would normally see when flat price goes up.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil", "Good deal. Okay. Thanks a bunch. Appreciate it, guys.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning, everybody.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Good morning, Doug.", "Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "I appreciate you taking my questions. Hey, Joe. So, Joe, on the buyback, I guess dividend distribution, the 75% target. Given that you've obviously been running pretty well ahead of that, is there any consideration to either reconsider the absolute level or the balance between dividends and buybacks? And I've got a quick follow-up please.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, obviously \u2013 and I'll let Mike speak to this. But, Doug, obviously, we're always looking at that. And Mike mentioned earlier, okay, you use 75% of net income because it provides absolute transparency into what the number is, and that's one of the things that we use for planning purposes. Mike's also looking at his percentage of cash flow dependent on how things are there. And then again, we continue to look at the balance between the dividend and the buybacks. In our view, though, the dividend is nondiscretionary. The buyback is discretionary. And so we need to be very confident that we're going to continue to have cash flows and that we're going to be able to continue to manage the capital budget the way that the company's done over the last couple of years to be sure that if we increase the dividend, we're good to go. So, Mike, with that what would you...", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "I don't really have anything to add to that. I mean, the dividend is the commitment to the shareholder and that is our priority.", "Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "I guess, is there \u2013 maybe I don't want to belabor this particular point, but in terms of dividend growth, if you were thinking kind of mid-cycle earnings level for the company, is there an aspiration to have a dividend growth target on top of that, or are we just going to stick with the 75%?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, for now we're going to stick with the 75%, Doug. And I think we've answered it. We're not going get pinned down right now on announcing a dividend increase, that's for sure. But I think we're going go ahead and stick with the 75% for the time being and we'll continue to look at it.", "Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Okay. I appreciate that. My follow-up hopefully a quick one is, as the earnings mix changes a little bit, as you see more coming from the MLP obviously over time, what's the guidance on the tax rate going forward? Because, obviously, it's consistently been at a pretty better level, I guess, compared to what we would have expected. So, this run rate for the tax rate and I'll leave it there. Thanks.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, this quarter we had a couple of items that benefited our tax rate. Our guidance was 30%. We had the Aruba disposition and that provided, I guess, it was about 6% improvement on the tax position. We had the favorable settlement on an income tax audit. That provided about 4%. So those would have given us a 28% when you back those out. Our guidance was 30%. So we had a few minor things. Going forward, 30%, 31% looks like a good number.", "Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Got it. Thanks, fellows.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.", "Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Good morning. Maybe just to follow-on from Doug's question on the dividend in a different way. I mean, you are investing just under $1 billion of growth capital, which should provide some sort of uplift to EBITDA over time. I mean is one way to think about it is, you've got this net income payout and you're willing to sort of keep that flat, and then as this growth capital comes in, you could perhaps use that to drive the dividend higher? And then specifically, on that growth capital, I mean, talk a little bit about the funnel to maintain that $1 billion level and maybe the split between refining and logistics just at the very high level.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "On our capital, I think next year we're looking at similar to our budget for 2016, about $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion. $1.5 billion of that will be for sustaining and maintenance capital, about $1 billion or so for growth capital, and that will be split about 50%-50% between refining and logistics. So right now we're comfortable at the 75% target on the payout, so that's where we're at on that.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Ed, that was \u2013 your question was kind of a mouthful. But it was \u2013 it's hard to say that, okay, all the incremental income produced from growth projects is going go into the dividend. If we knew what margins were going to be in two months, if we were selling something where we could set the price and set the margin and just the only issue is how much are you going to manufacture, it'd be wonderful. But that's not the way this business functions. And because we've made the commitment to the dividend, we're very careful with it. We've also told you guys, we're not going to sit here and accumulate cash. And that's why we've gone ahead and exceeded the payout ratio target of 75%, because we've had stronger cash flows than we had anticipated. And so we've gone ahead and used the funds accordingly. We have a lot of discipline around the capital budgeting process, and you're not going to see that whipsaw significantly.", "So, it's not like Lane and Gary and Rich are running out trying to find another $1.5 billion of capital projects so that we can spend the money. So anyway, I think you should expect consistent performance from us on this. And, again, we will continue to look at the dividend and I would expect, as Mike said, that we would continue to try to increase the dividend. But we're not prepared to commit to it right now.", "Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay, and then the second one is, unfortunately, another follow-up on RINs. So do you think that the November ruling would actually deal with the point of obligation? And if they do deal with the point of obligation and say move it to the blending racks, what would be the impact on your RVO in total?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well...", "Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Because presumably you have a big impact, but just trying to get a clarity on that.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, I'm just trying to think through how to answer that. And I think I would rather not, because we haven't given any guidance on what our absolute RVO is. So giving you a number for it after the fact, but it would go down materially. So...", "Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "And then on the EPA \u2013 sorry...", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Go ahead, buddy.", "Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Sorry. On the whether this ruling at the end of November is actually going to deal with the point of obligation.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what their plan is. I would love to think that they were going to do it, but I think all we've got commitments from them on so far is that they're going to announce the obligations. It would be very nice if they would open up our petition to a rule making on it so that we could have some conversation around it. And as Jay mentioned, if they would do that, then I think we would see some effect on the RIN price. But I'm not been very good at trying to predict exactly what they're going to do.", "Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hi, everyone. Just if I could immediately follow-up while we're on the dreaded subject. Joe, did you petition as Valero because \u2013 why didn't the refining industry lobby petition as opposed to you guys doing it individually? Is that an evidence that's there's a split amongst refiners?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, okay. So first of all, we did it because it's a material issue to us and we're a large refiner, and we're going to do what's best for us. Secondly, the AFPM did also file and their petition is similar to ours to move the point of obligation. So it \u2013 your third question is, is everybody in the industry of a like mind on this? The answer would be no, and I think it depends on where you happen to sit. If you're long RINs with a more integrated system through retail, I think you're going be a lot more comfortable with the status quo. And if you're an independent refiner or a retail marketer that doesn't have the ability to move up the rack, then you're going to want to see this point of obligation moved.", "Paul, from my perspective, it's a very simple point of view. It is, you create a situation where the obligation and the point of compliance are two different points, and they shouldn't be. And so it's \u2013 by moving the point of obligation, obviously, we align the natural point of compliance with the natural point of obligation. And a lot of this speculation in the RINs market goes away. People will not be incentivized to build inventories of RINs to hold out for higher prices, to squeeze the shorts as we've seen. So anyway, I think I answered you, which -", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "You did. I think earlier in the call, Joe, you sort of said you thought it would be resolved. I guess, then subsequently you seem to be saying that you're not very good at predicting it and you're not sure what will come out in November.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "I think that it's going be resolved, but I do not know that it's going to happen before this election cycle happens. And then you tell me what the Obama administration's going to want to deal with between November and January. I can't predict that.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Something tells me it's not going to be RINs, Joe.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "(52:09).", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "If I could just ask about the CapEx. Actually you did define how much was growth, how much was maintenance. Are we assuming around $800 million of turnaround? I don't know if you said you didn't want to comment on that. I think that the guidance was originally maybe for $1 billion this year of turnaround and is being dropped. I'm sorry if I got the numbers wrong.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "Typically, our turnaround expense is $700 million to $800 million on an annual basis.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Yeah, so that's what you'll be assuming for next year then?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, I think that's fair.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "That's great. And I just guess the final one would be, the net income target that you've talked about, the fact that you're sailing over that, why don't you look at it just purely from a cash point of view? Because you said that, because of the strength of cash, you're paying out more. Wouldn't it be smarter or easier for us all to just use a cash-on-cash dividend target? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, we feel like that the net income is very transparent. There's a lot of things that flow through the cash flow item like working capital items and such that you could have wild swings on your cash flow generation, and so our preference is net income.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Got it. Can I have a final one?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Paul, that's four now. You'll get me in trouble here.", "Unknown Speaker", "Give him one more.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Okay.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "While I've got Lane. Could you just talk about the recent draw on inventories that we've seen, Lane, and imports of crude? What's your perspective on that somewhat surprising series of draws that we've seen? And I'll leave it there, I promise. Thanks.", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "Hey, Paul. I'll have to defer to my friend here, Mr. Gary Simmons, on that.", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah. Paul, so I think you see these Brent TIR swinging back and forth, and so what we get into is that TI gets priced to where some barrels leave the Gulf and then the arb comes back in and incentivizes imports. So what we've seen is, we saw some barrels leaving the Gulf. It's kind of imbalanced today to where St. James is marginally getting to the point where you would want to import barrels again. So I think that's what you've seen in the crude markets.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Cool.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Chi Chow with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Hi, Chi.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Hi, Joe. I appreciate your legal and policy change focus on the RINs. But are you specifically implementing any strategies right now to reduce your RIN purchase obligation through increasing terminal exposure, changing commercial arrangements, or any other measure?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yes. Yes to all of the above, and trying to continue to build the wholesale business. So we're looking at all those things. Those are the levers that we've got to pull, and then exports is the other one. And I think Gary and his team continue to look at the economics of exports with the RIN in mind, and so we're trying to manage our costs down every way we possibly can.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Does M&A focus on the midstream side? Is this a big priority, I guess, when you look at midstream growth position?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah. No, it's a priority. Obviously, we've seen a lot of things transact here and we've looked at a lot of things. But it is a priority for us, Chi. I think we'd like to \u2013 again, as we said earlier in the call, we'd like to find assets in a perfect world that had third party volume and supported Valero's core business, but either/or is good with us.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. And then second question, your refining OpEx performance is pretty stellar. I imagine low gas \u2013 nat gas prices are a part of it, but I suspect there's probably more to that. Can you talk about the company's efforts on the cost front? Gulf Coast, you're trending at $3.50 a barrel, which is pretty amazing for your complexity there. And also North Atlantic, looks like you're way down on OpEx relative to the past few years. So any comments on that end would be helpful.", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "Chi, I'm just going to be \u2013 I'm going to answer this in general. It's a core value for us to manage our expenses aggressively all the time, but we do that in light of being very reliable. One of the tenets of our operation is we believe we get to a lower cost business by making sure that we implement our liability programs, so we minimize big one-time events that can turn into very expensive expense events. And that's essentially the way we think about running our business.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Is there something specific in the North Atlantic? Because it really looks like it's been measurable on the production.", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "No.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks, Lane. Appreciate it.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thanks, Chi.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Margolin with Cowen & Company.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Hi, Sam.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "I wanted to go back to 2017 CapEx, if that's all right. The gated process to the capital program sort of sets up a possible scenario, where your growth CapEx number could be a lot lower than it has been this year or previous years or what you just mentioned for 2017. I guess, given the fact that the refining cycle has been challenging this year and it would have been hard for kind of people outside the fence to really easily identify a really good project in this kind of market. What is that \u2013 what would it take for the growth CapEx number to come down to a level that we haven't seen for a while? And then I guess that would introduce another list of possibilities on the return of cash side, and maybe if you could talk about how those two things are linked, too.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Do you want to talk about capital?", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "Sam, this is Lane. It's an interesting question. I wouldn't say that we have a complete shortcoming of potential projects. We have a strategic outlook, which we believe is we have \u2013 we believe that octane is going be in short supply going forward and we believe feedstock flexibility is something that we're always continuing to look at. I'm not going to say that there's not the possibility that somehow our growth CapEx will fall. But we have plenty of sort of small, fast hitting projects that compete in that space. You also got to remember, we have a strategic \u2013 we're strategically trying to get the right network (58:51) on our secondary costs through building those assets and dropping them into the MLP. And that's \u2013 as Mike alluded to earlier, that's about 50% of our growth CapEx for next year. So...", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, we \u2013 I mean, Sam, the fact that we're not out there talking about a bunch of capital projects just goes back to the fundamental principle that we're operating by, which was we don't talk about them until we're confident we're going to do the project. Again, we don't want to get out over our skis and over-commit, and then end up needing to back it down. So I don't think you should read anything into a lower capital number based on lack of opportunities that we're looking at.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then, I guess, just following-up on a comment you made in the introduction about some positive signals you're seeing in U.S. unconventional upstream. The new crude units position you pretty well for that inflexion. I remember in the first quarter you gave a result for the first one. I think it was $30 million of EBITDA, which sort of put you right on the fairway of guidance. But production wasn't growing \u2013 at the time production was declining in the U.S. So at this point can you catch us up a little bit on the performance and sort of establish whether we have seen sort of, I guess, proof of concept in those projects by this point?", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah. So, Sam, this is Lane again. Our for funding, or FID (01:00:16) EBITDA for those projects, for Corpus it's $150 million and for Houston it was about $130 million. And so in the third quarter, they both per unit contributed about $45 million a piece. So you can sort of look at the run rate and they're clearly in line with what our funding decisions were with respect to \u2013 on the EBITDA basis.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Fernando Valle with Citi.", "Fernando Valle - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'll keep it brief. Just quickly on the change in regulations, IRS regulations for partnership liability and disguise sale, does that impact your plans for dropdowns into VLP for next year at all? Did you have any impact on previous drops into VLP? Thank you.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "It does not have any impact on the previous drops into the MLP. It's not retroactive and it really has no material impact on our plans, on the EBITDA, the amount of EBITDA that we have to drop.", "Fernando Valle - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. But do you expect a major impact as far as the potential tax liability for VLO on dropdowns? Or it doesn't really impact on -", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "No, it's not material to the tax liability that we're already incurring.", "Fernando Valle - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And thank you. It seems we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to John Locke for closing remarks.", "John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.", "Okay. Thanks, Vanessa. Thanks everyone for calling today.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "And I will now turn the call over to your host, Mr. John Locke, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.", "Good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations & Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and several other members of Valero's senior management team.", "If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com.

Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Our team again delivered solid operating results and distinctive financial performance during a quarter where we saw heavy maintenance activity and soft margins. Our continued focus on safety and reliability in our plants has been key to our ability to capture the available margin.", "In the first quarter, we saw healthy domestic and export demand for refined products driven by low prices, seasonal weather conditions in North America and Europe, and a resurgence of domestic oil patch activity. Latin America also continued to be a strong source of demand for gasoline and diesel.", "On the crude supply side, we continued to see rig count increases in the U.S., particularly in the Permian Basin. As production ramps up and more domestic sweet crude makes its way to the Gulf Coast our refineries in the Mid-Continent and the Gulf Coast are prepared to capture the feedstock opportunities. While RIN prices have declined relative to 2016 there's still a significant headwind for the quarter. At this level, RIN's expense remains an issue for us, so we continue to work with regulators.", "Turning to our refining segment, in the first quarter we completed a heavy turnaround schedule at our Benicia, Texas City, St. Charles, and Meraux refineries. Our employees and contractors safely executed these projects. With the majority of our planned maintenance for the year behind us, we should be ready to capture available market opportunities.", "In our ethanol business, we had record production volumes for the quarter as higher ethanol prices and strong demand for ethanol exports supported production rates. Also in the first quarter, we invested $641 million of sustaining and growth capital, construction is progressing on the Diamond Pipeline with completion expected at the end of this year. Work on the Diamond Green Diesel plant expansion, the Houston alkylation unit and the Wilmington cogeneration plant is continuing as planned.", "Turning to our MLP, as we disclosed in our 10-K for 2016, we created a new VLP segment to align how we manage and allocate resources. Growth in our VLP segment is critical to Valero's strategy to optimize the supply chain.", "The third party acquisition of the Red River pipeline in January is a good example of VLP executing this strategy, which is focused on assets that are key to Valero's operations or that will supply third party volumes without taking on commodity risk.", "Lastly, regarding cash returns to stockholders, we paid $629 million in cash through dividends and stock buybacks. So, we believe we're in good shape to exceed our payout target for the year. This payout demonstrates the company's free cash flow generating capability even in a soft margin environment.", "So, with that, John, I'll hand it back over to you.", "John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thank you, Joe. For the first quarter, net income attributable to Valero's stockholders was $305 million, or $0.68 per share, compared to $495 million or $1.05 per share in the first quarter of 2016. First quarter 2016 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $283 million, or $0.60 per share. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to page three of the financial tables that accompany our release.", "Operating income for the refining segment in the first quarter of 2017 was $647 million, compared to $915 million for the first quarter of 2016, which has been revised retrospectively to reflect the new VLP segment. First quarter 2017 operating income was in line with first quarter of 2016 adjusted operating income of $652 million.", "Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.8 million barrels per day, which was in line with the first quarter of 2016. Our refineries operated at 91% throughput capacity utilization in the first quarter of 2017, which reflects turnarounds that occurred at the Benicia, Texas City, St. Charles, and Meraux refineries.", "Refining cash operating expense of $3.85 per barrel were $0.39 per barrel higher than the first quarter of 2016, mainly due to a higher level of maintenance activity and higher energy costs in the first quarter of 2017.", "The ethanol segment generated $22 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $39 million in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating income for the first quarter of 2016 was $9 million. The increase from the 2016 adjusted amount was primarily due to the higher ethanol prices and record production volumes. Operating income for the VLP segment in the first quarter of 2017 was $70 million compared to $43 million in the first quarter of 2016. The primary drivers for the increase in operating income are contributions from the McKee, Meraux, and Three Rivers Terminal and the Red River Pipeline which were acquired subsequent to the first quarter of last year. The Red River Pipeline operations, acquired in January, have been integrated into VLP and are performing as expected.", "For the first quarter of 2017, general and administrative expenses excluding corporate depreciation, were $190 million and net interest expense was $121 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $500 million and the effective tax rate was 26% in the first quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate was lower than expected, mainly due to a reduction in the statutory rate in Quebec and favorable settlements from several state income tax audits.", "With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $8.5 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $4.5 billion, of which $66 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt to capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was 24.1%. We have $5.4 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which $720 million was available for only VLP.", "We generated $988 million of cash from operating activities in the first quarter, excluding a working capital benefit of $151 million, net cash generated was $837 million. With regard to investing activities, we made $641 million of growth and sustaining capital investments, of which $245 million was for turnarounds and catalyst.", "Moving to financing activities, we returned $629 million in cash to our stockholders in the first quarter, which included $315 million in dividend payments and $314 million for the purchase of 4.7 million shares of Valero common stock. As of March 31st, we had approximately $2.2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.", "Our guidance for 2017 capital expenditures of $2.7 billion remains unchanged. This amount which includes turnarounds, catalyst, and joint venture investments consists of approximately $1.6 billion for sustaining and $1.1 billion for growth.", "For modeling our second quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.69 million to 1.74 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 440,000 to 460,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 285,000 to 305,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 455,000 to 475,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter to be approximately $3.70 per barrel.", "Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day in the second quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.39 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash cost, such as depreciation and amortization. We expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation for the second quarter, to be around $170 million, and net interest expense should be about $115 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $500 million, and our effective tax rate is expected to be around 30%.", "That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. This will help us ensure that other callers have time to ask their questions too. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And we have our first question from Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley.", "Benny Wong - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good morning, guys. You had some positive market commentary in your press release this morning. I'm just curious to hear your thoughts around product balances for refining runs (12:13) expected to pick up strongly, and where you expect the demand to come to meet that?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah. Benny, I think what we've seen is early \u2013 and I'll talk about gasoline first. Earlier in the year, we saw that gasoline demand looked to be down a little bit and when we looked at the data more specifically, you could see it was a lot weather related, especially on the West Coast, you had a rainy season which caused demand to be down. As we progressed through the quarter, our March volumes looked to be fairly consistent with what we saw last year. So I think we think domestic demand will be fairly consistent with what we saw last year, but we're seeing a stronger pull on exports than what we saw last year, particularly Latin America, there appears to be a good pull of gasoline into Mexico and South America.", "On the distillate side, really for the whole first quarter we saw slightly better distillate demand, some of that was due to a little bit colder weather. We've seen good agricultural demand and then as we start to see the upstream recover, we're starting to see a pull there as well, on the distillates. And then distillates exports are also strong, again same \u2013 we're seeing some exports to Europe, but mainly strong export demand into Latin America.", "Benny Wong - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Really appreciate that color. And just in regards to splitting of the VLP results, can we read into this as a signal to expect a lot more growth in dropdown activity in this area?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "You know, we don't provide guidance on our dropdowns as it relates to the VLP. We're in good shape. We do provide the distribution growth plans for the next two years, but we have high coverage rate at the LP, and so we're not going to provide any of the dropdown guidance.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "And Benny, I think, and John can talk a little bit too, he and Mike, we went through this process of trying to decide, did we want to go ahead and create the segment. We felt we needed to create the segment so that there was more line of sight to what it is, and then the question becomes, what do you put in the segment? We decided to keep it as clean as possible and just be sure that everybody had a line of sight to the fact that this is the way we manage the business, and we wanted it to be very clear and clean. So the portfolio of assets that we have at Valero that are still droppable, all of that EBITDA that's droppable into VLP is there, but we didn't want to cloud it by including that. So anyway, it's a pretty straight up segment.", "Benny Wong - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great, thanks for the color. Appreciate it guys.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.", "Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "Good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Good morning, Phil.", "Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "First question, just wanted to come back to Joe, your commentary on RINs. Do you view that the quarterly run rate here as a fair number for the full year? I think you're expecting a higher number when we were coming out of last quarter. And then just generally, your thoughts on what's happening right now, thoughts on the preliminary RVO standard point of obligation potential. I know there was a hearing going on yesterday where the U.S. Appeals Court was questioning the EPA's authorities, and suggesting Congress should be responsible for fixing the renewable fuel standards. So it seems like there's a lot of information out there.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah. Phil, that's a good question, and I'll let Gary talk a little bit about the RIN market, and then Jason can just give you an update on the regulatory front, if that's okay.", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "So, I think, we certainly saw, especially D6 RINs call off early in the year. We're not really ready to revise our guidance at this time. We're going to keep our guidance where it is, and we'll just see how successful we are on some of these things about moving the point of obligation and what happens to RINs.", "Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.", "And regarding the 2018 \u2013 regarding the timeline for releasing the 2018 RVO targets, we think they're going to try to hit the November 30th deadline. They're going to try to stay on target. To meet that, they need to push the proposed rule out by late May or early June. And on those oral arguments you mentioned that occurred yesterday on the lawsuit relating to the 2014 to 2016 RFS targets, we understand there were a lot of questions, and the judges were pushing the EPA on the grounds that they'd used to grant the waiver in their questions.", "I think they were kind of signaling that maybe the EPA could have used another ground which had been even more defensible than the one that they did. They based it on the inadequate domestic supply of biofuels versus causing severe economic harm. But we wouldn't read too much into the questions at oral argument. We do think the EPA properly issued the waiver when they did it and one thing that we would note is in the arguments and the questions from the judges, it was clear to us that our arguments at the point of obligation should be evaluated in setting the RVO numbers which was what we claimed in the case had some traction. The judges seem to buy into that, so we were encouraged by that.", "Now, on what we think is going to happen with the point of obligation overall. Kind of to give you an update on the process we're going through, the comment deadline on our petition to change the point of obligation was February 22nd. The EPA has now received all of the comments and they're receiving them. We think the majority of the comments that were filed are in favor of our position and with the new team at the EPA we're really hopeful. We think when they look at the facts we expect them to resolve this question in our favor. And on timing which is what a lot of people are asking, there's no specific deadline on the EPA. We think they're diligently looking at this and there's a lot of concern and urgency because of the harm the high RIN prices are doing to the refining sector, so we think it could be done in the next six months if they push it.", "Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, great, that's very helpful. I appreciate the color. Second question would just be on light-medium, and light-heavy differentials. We started to see some timing here in the second quarter which I presume is mostly due to the effects of the OPEC cuts starting to flow through. Is that consistent what you guys have been seeing out there? And generally how are you thinking about light-medium, light-heavy differentials?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah. I think that is consistent. We saw that when OPEC announced their cuts that there wasn't a big market reaction and I think a lot of that was we feel like there was a demand offset to the supply offset, so we had lower refinery demand with turnaround season and then they weren't burning as much oil, so there wasn't that much of an impact. And then we also think that a disproportionate amount of cuts went to the Far East and not to the U.S. market. As the U.S. has come out of turnaround season you're seeing a bigger impact of those cuts on the medium to light differential and I think where we are is we just kind of are waiting to see if really the OPEC countries are committed to our market or not. So far they've kind of sent the volume they want to send, but we got in last week where the differentials were to the point where economic signals were starting to point us to switch to a more domestic light sweet diet and back out the medium sour from the Middle East. What we've seen this week it's starting to widen back out, so I think they recognized that and I think they're committed to maintaining market share here and we've kind of seen a floor on that medium to light spread because you started to see refinery switch to the lighter diet and so this week it's improved about $0.50 from where we were last week.", "Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Right. Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey guys, good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Good morning, Paul.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I think this maybe for Gary, the first question. Gary, I believe you guys had mentioned you're spending about $350 million a month in the secondary costs outside of feedstock which means that (20:27) to bring either the feedstock or the crude or the product from pond to pond (20:31) and that is a major area where that you think optimization and improvement could be. Could you give us an example what could be done and how big is the magnitude. Are we talking a about potential 10% is the reasonable medium term objective of benefit or higher or lower and any kind of a number that you can share?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Paul, so it's really impossible for us to give guidance in theory because so much of what's rolled into this is outside of our control, so just to give you an example, freight rates play a big role in that overall $350 million of spend. Things that we're doing is renegotiating terminal deals that we have, making sure that our barge utilization is efficient as it can and so what we'll try to do is work with John. We have some dashboarding tools that we're using to measure our progress and we'll try to work with him to see if there's something we can share with you guys going forward, but I can't really give you a dollar target.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. A second one, Joe, in terms of the organic investment opportunity in the company, where do you see the biggest opportunity for the next, say, two or three years?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Paul, I think it's in the refining side of the business, in the midstream side of the business. I'll let Lane talk a little bit about the projects that we've got going on in refining and then maybe Rich wants to share a little bit about anything we got going on on the logistics side, but Rich don't tell them anything secret.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "We will keep it a secret here.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "I know you would, Paul. All right.", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "Hi, Paul, this is Lane. We still have a strategic outlook of what we think, we are always looking at our assets with respect to feedstock flexibility. And really there's two lines that we invest there. One is to look at the natural capital arbitrage as it sits in refining to make sure we can fill it out the way we'd like and make sure we have access to the right feedstock. The other way we invest in that is, here's Rich's area and that's getting connectivity to terminals or get docks with respect to getting the products out or the feedstocks in, so really when we think about feedstock flexibility, it's really the opportunity to invest both in refining and logistics.", "We also have sort of a long-term outlook that we think octane is going to be valuable and we're in the process of building our Houston alky, we're looking at other octane capability throughout our system and so that's really the other one. And the final one is we're building the cogens at both Wilmington and we're looking at one at Pembroke and this is in response to what we think that natural gas price where there's an arbitrage between how the utilities are going to provide power costs versus our ability to make it ourselves using natural gas.", "Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.", "Paul, this is Rich. Part of the organic stuff that we've got going on is we've been vocal about the Diamond Pipeline. That's gone through the DRB process and has full funding approval. We're about 40% complete on that. Going forward, the organic stuff that we look at kind of is supportive of Gary's $350 million of secondary costs which are pipelines and terminal expenses and we look at opportunities to organically grow into some of these markets and get around third-party costs. So Gary's secondary costs provide us an opportunity to look at organic projects. And again, we can't talk about those because they're still going through the gating process, but for this year the billion dollars of strategic capital, about 50% of that is for logistics projects to address some of Gary's secondary costs and we expect that that kind of thinking or that kind of strategic capital going forward would continue.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Paul, just more broadly on this. We've talked about the fact that we're interested from a strategic perspective in integrating more assets that go into the refinery and moving product out of the refinery. And that's not a short-term strategy that's a long-term strategy. Along with the other things that we're doing. Safety, reliability and environmental focus and then shareholder returns is the third component. So I think, the strategy that we've got in place today, certainly we have line of sight to the next couple of years, but it's a strategy that I believe works long-term. It allows us to continue to increase the value of the business. So we're very comfortable with it. And again, Rich and Lane are both developing projects, we scrub them hard and then we'll just see which ones we want to proceed with going forward. But the focus is clearly around the core business of refining and marketing and around ethanol.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hey, guys, good morning. This is (25:45) on for Doug.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Good morning.", "Unknown Speaker", "Earlier you mentioned \u2013 good morning. Earlier you mentioned still strong export into Latin America and I'm guessing that's probably due to still load utilization in the region. I'm just wondering if that's a sustainable trend or if you see that improving at any point this year?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah. So I think some of it is certainly related to refinery utilization in the region. And as mechanical availability has fallen off, it's opened the door for us to supply the market. But going forward in addition to that, we also see that there's some good demand growth trends that we're starting to see, particularly in Brazil, which had had negative demand growth. It looks like it's turned positive. So I think even as refinery utilization improves, you'll see demand growth in the region, which should allow us to continue to see that as a good export market.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. Second question just on the cash returns to shareholders. They came in above guidance in this quarter, when guidance is, obviously, 75% of net income. Just wondering what the fee considerations were in this quarter in regards to the buyback level. Was it cash flow, balance sheet cash, operating outlook? Any color would be appreciated and I'll leave it there. Thanks.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, yeah. You're exactly right. When we look at what our payout is going to be for the quarter, we do look at our expected discretionary cash flow that's going to be generated that particular quarter. We also look at our excess cash balance that we may have in determining what we want to pay out for that particular quarter. So for this quarter we paid out a little over 200% of net income, but when you look at our cash flow, excluding the working capital benefit, it's about 75% of our cash flow. And that's how we'll look at it going forward.", "Unknown Speaker", "Got you. Thanks so much for the color, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.", "Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse", "Yeah, just wanted to return to two conversations. One is the $1.1 billion of growth capital. I appreciate you don't want to talk about specifics, but do you think the top of the funnel of the opportunity set for that $1.1 billion is getting larger as the U.S. producers get back to work? Trying to think about how many years you have of projects identified to drive that self-help component of total shareholder return?", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "So, Ed, this is Lane. So, when you think about our capital budget, our talking numbers is we normally spend about $2.5 billion on CapEx a year. $1.5 billion of which is turnarounds and sustaining capital. It's really about $1 billion. So you can think about, I would say, a long-term run rate of $1 billion. And that's kind what we think that we naturally with our assets can manage well. And do sort of with our strategic outlook. We absolutely believe and already \u2013 I would say most particularly Rich's stuff is largely in the area of expanding logistics connectivity or refining operation and trying to run the sort of oil shale play. To the extent it would get bigger, we would certainly have a conversation and talk about whether we see a larger opportunity in that. But really our message is about $1 billion a year we're going to try to manage the business around.", "Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then I don't want to waste too many on policy, but I guess I should ask if we're going to have corporate tax plan coming out tomorrow. Not so much on corporate taxation, but on BAT, whether you've heard whether the oil industry would be exempt or what the latest is. What you're hearing on the BAT, border adjustment tax.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, hang on a second, Ed.", "Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.", "Sorry. Ed, this is Jason again. Yeah, we think the likelihood of the BAT being included in tax reforms declined substantially. It's definitely one of the more controversial aspects of tax reform. And with the difficulties the Republicans had with healthcare, we don't see them wanting to take on another fight or create another fight within the party, and the BAT clearly splits the business community. You have people for it and against it. So, for that reason, we think that's probably one of the first things they'll move away from as they try to move forward and get a win on tax reform.", "Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good morning, everyone.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Good morning, Brad.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey, Joe. Gary, I was wondering if we could follow up a little bit on the earlier OPEC conversation. I was wondering specifically about some of the Latin American heavy grades, if you've seen any sort of decline in availability? I know in the first quarter there were concerns about Maya availability. Has that continued, and maybe have you seen Venezuela volumes declining?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, so what we've seen, I guess, overall is, it does look like Venezuela's production has fallen off some. But their internal consumption for their refineries has kind of fallen off almost at a commensurate amount, so exports from Venezuela have been fairly constant actually. And then, we're seeing actually a growth in Brazilian production. So we're seeing more Brazilian barrels on the market. And then on the Maya question, we've continued to receive our contract volumes from Mexico fairly consistently.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Got it. And then maybe sticking with you, Gary, or maybe Lashway, on the Diamond Pipeline, obviously, we know the cost of the project. But I was wondering if you could give any color as to how it's expected to affect the laid-in crude cost at Memphis or any sort of EBITDA contribution for VLO that you can provide?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, so the way we view it, I mean, without giving too much specifics, today we're at a U.S. Gulf Coast plus Capline tariff to get a laid-in cost for Memphis' crude. And we believe that, with the Diamond Pipeline, we'll be at a U.S. Gulf Coast minus. And so it will be a significant change for the Memphis refinery. It's kind of hard to give EBITDA estimates, because you're kind of doing a market read in order to be able get that. But we believe it will have a significant impact on Memphis.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, understood. Thanks.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Sorry, good morning. Had the mute on there.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Hi, Roger.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. I guess, maybe going back to some of the questions earlier on the light heavy diff and where the narrowness of the differential incentivized going back to a light barrel. Thinking a little more forward, and using maybe a consensus expectation for light production in the U.S., Gary, where do you see your ability to run light barrels, if the differentials are favorable? Is that a 100,000, a 300,000, or potentially much higher than that, if the differentials are favorable kind of number?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, so we believe our capacity to process the light sweet crude is about 1.4 million barrels a day. So, if you look at our Investor Relations presentation, there's a pretty good slide there showing our ability to swing between grades. But overall, our total processing capacity is about 1.4 million barrels a day of light sweet capacity in the system.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "And over the past year, you've run closer to which level?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, I'm not sure on the volume. Do you know, Lane?", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, I think we've been more like 1.1 million or 1 million barrels per day. If you look at our history \u2013 historically, where we were, that was probably about the case. Since the last time we had really compelling economics to run light crude, we finished both of these topper projects at Houston and Corpus. So we are in a position to run more even than we did last time, so.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "And would we need to see substantially wider light differentials? And I'm kind of thinking LLS against Brent right now. Is that the right marker, or should we think more of a \u2013 it's an Eagle Ford or a Midland barrel at the Gulf Coast?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, so, you know the rule of thumb we always use is that the medium sours need to be discounted by 5% to your light sweet alternative. So, that's not 5% discounted to Brent. That would be a 5% discounted to whatever you're paying for Eagle Ford, and that's why last week, with where the medium sours were priced in the Gulf, our light sweet alternative favored going ahead and running light sweet.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay, great, thanks. And then my last question, just an accounting question. With the breakout of VLP, we saw a change in year-over-year refining margins. I think it's fairly straightforward, but we also saw a decline in reported OpEx of about $0.10. And I was wondering, is that tied to VLP, or is that something else that's going on?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "No, that is tied to VLP.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "All right, great. Thank you.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thanks, Roger.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Good morning, all.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Good morning.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Can I first ask just a relatively short-term question, which is just about your crude imports and how those are shifting, with seemingly not much impact from OPEC cuts. I just wondered if you could confirm that. Anything that you could add on Venezuela and Mexico would be interesting, would be part one.", "And then, to help you \u2013 give you some time to think, Joe, there was a mention there of a long-term bullish view on octane. I was just wondering how else you're thinking long-term about strategy? There's kind of a peak oil demand argument that's very widespread right now. Could you address really what you think the long-term challenges and opportunities are for Valero, in terms of how the market's shifting? Thanks.", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "I guess I'll start with the crude question. Really, the imports we're getting from Venezuela and from Mexico have been fairly flat. We're not seeing much of a change there. The big change really, on the medium sours we've shifted a little bit. We've seen more of an impact from both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on the medium sour barrels we import from there, and we backfill those with some additional South American grades and Canadian grades. And then recently, over the last few weeks, we have actually started at one of our refineries to maximize some light sweet and replace some of the medium sour we're importing there.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "So, Paul, on the strategy and I mentioned it earlier. I think the things that we're doing today and they're very much focused on making us the best refining and marketing operation out there, and I believe that, based on the independent surveys that we really are the best, but we continue to raise the bar for ourselves and try to drive it forward. Again, that's not a short-term activity. That is a long-term activity that we'll continue to do going forward. Now, if you think long-term about the markets, okay, and the demand for our products more specifically, you say, well is U.S. demand going to continue to grow going forward? I think our forecast would be that in the next five to ten years you might see a slight decline in gasoline demand in the U.S. Diesel will be determined by economic activity, and so we'll just see how that goes. But as Gary mentioned earlier, we are seeing decent diesel demand, and a lot of that is being driven by the increase in activity that we've got in the E&P side of the business.", "If you think longer term and you think about where demand is going to grow, everything we read is that, globally, you're going to have increased demand for all of our products. And so our focus will go beyond the U.S. borders and we'll take a look at opportunities to increase our market presence in different international markets, and one of the things that Rich and his team are focused on are establishing a footprint in some of those markets so that we have better access to them on a rateable basis.", "So, I don't think you should expect us to shift the strategy materially going forward. Clearly, midstream growth is something we're focused on. Continuing to improve our refining and our renewables operation is something we're focused on. And then we've talked in the past about the possibility to take some of the streams that we're producing today and high grade them by legging into the petrochemical business. That's something that's probably a little bit longer term, but it is something that we're actively looking at these days and trying to figure out what is a way for us to enter that type of business, boiling the frog rather than diving in head first and see if we can create another earnings stream for the company.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Understood, Joe. I mean, one of the obvious responses to potential threats is ongoing operational improvements that you've talked about. How much more do you think you can do in terms of the utilization which we've seen steadily rising for you guys? And the operational costs, how much further do you think you can drive those down? And I'll leave it there. Thank you.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, Paul, I'll let Lane talk about that a little bit.", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "As Joe alluded to, I mean, using common metrics, we're sort of in our own space with respect to availability, but we continue to try to get better because when we look at our entire portfolio, not all of our assets are first quartile mechanical availability, whereas many of them are. So we can always work on the ones that aren't. And we have great programs to get us in that area.", "In terms of costs, the real cost focus is what was talked about earlier, that's in our effort to reduce secondary costs. And Gary talked about it. It's through commercial efforts to negotiate and use our size to negotiate better and then let Rich figure out places where we can build assets that will directly allow us to essentially charge ourselves the cost of that and ultimately move those into droppable assets into the MLP.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Thank you very much, everyone.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thanks, Paul.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil", "Guys, good morning. Long time no see.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "How are you doing, Blake?", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil", "Good. Question for you, I think probably for Mike on the tax rate. It just seems like the past few quarters have continuously come in below expectations. I know you gave a guidance for 1Q, but I'm just trying to get a sense of maybe, I guess, the Quebec piece of it probably feels more sustainable. So any thoughts around that continuing to trend lower than what we've seen historically?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, I guess I would \u2013 how I would characterize that is we do have a few audits that are underway and that we don't know the exact timing on when those will be settled. So, here, this past quarter we did settle a couple of our state audits favorably which resulted in a reversal of some reserves, which then lowered the tax rate. So I think our 30% number is a good number. Unless we have some of these other events occur that allows us to lower the rate.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil", "Okay. Fair enough. The second question is on the CapEx budget. I know you kind of tackled the growth piece of it, but mine is on the sustaining capital part. $1.6 billion. I know that includes some tier compliance and I guess I'm just wondering, as you kind of get through that this year, is there an opportunity for that to move lower into the future? Or should we just be thinking of always kind of some type of compliance that's going to land in there, so it's really the $1.6 billion is probably a good number go-forward?", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "Blake, this is Lane. I'll answer this in a couple of ways. One is I would say we believe and the guidance we've given is more of about $1.5 billion, of which I would say $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion is like truly sustaining capital. Somewhere around $200 million to $300 million is what we think normally is sort of regulatory spend that is not \u2013 we sort of put into the sustaining capital but it's not like we're \u2013 we're not rebuilding our assets or maintaining them, it's something that we're having to do due to regulatory things. We're a little bit higher this time due largely to Tier 3. Our Tier 3 spend is about $500 million, of which much of it will \u2013 we'll continue to spend up until the time that we have to be in compliance which is January 1st of 2020. And the bulk of it \u2013 really the bulk of that spend will be in 20018 and 2019.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great, thanks. Maybe you've touched on this a couple of times, maybe one follow up on midstream growth opportunities. Can you characterize a little bit the environment for, I guess, for growth opportunities and returns that you're seeing on that side of the business? I mean, I think we've seen \u2013 we continue to see midstream operators take skinnier economics in order to compete in some regions. And those are certainly in areas that have (43:55) kind of crude transport in some of the more popular growth basins, which I think you guys have generally avoided up to this point. But, as you think about your opportunities to deploy incremental capital, are you seeing downward pressure on returns in those types of businesses? Any thoughts on dynamics in that part of the business would be great.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Ryan, let me just try to be sure we're clear. So, there's two things we're looking at, right? One, are the organic growth projects that we're doing. I would say that we're not reducing our return thresholds on our organic growth projects in the midstream part of the business, and we kind of target, whether it be a drop or whether it be an organic growth project, we want to be like a 12% pre-tax IRR regardless, okay? Now if you're thinking in terms of M&A and the valuations that we're seeing on midstream assets, I'd say that they're pretty doggone aggressive, okay? Rich, you want to -", "Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, no, the bid asking is very wide and it depends on how aggressive people want to be on this. I mean, we're always interested in looking at these opportunities, given that they be strategic for Valero. But today we would say, it's like Joe said, it's very aggressive right now out there.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, I mean, you saw -- Ryan, you saw the recent deal that was done around Navigator. And I don't know what the rate of return might be on that, but it was a very aggressive bid, it seemed.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "So, I guess we should expect you guys to be more focused on organic opportunities than inorganic, is that safe to say, at least in the near term?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "No, I wouldn't say that. We're going to continue to do what we've done and Mike runs the M&A group here. I mean, we're going to look at everything that's out there and try to make a determination. In a perfect world, we'd find a bunch of assets where we can earn the types of returns who want to do the deal in VLP and it would provide some kind of strategic synergy for Valero Energy also. And we evaluate it looking at it both ways. We have probably liberalized our strategy around VLP a little bit. Historically, I've said that we look at the projects from Valero Energy's perspective first and then decide if we can or can't do it at VLP. And I would tell you that still is the primary motivation, but we are looking at transactions now that would be somewhat more third-party that the user of the asset would be a third-party, but it would bring value to Valero in some way. So, we're adjusting our perspective as we go.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay, great, thanks. That's very helpful. And then maybe one more on payout, and I realize that you've already touched on this a few times, and it seems to come out every quarter, but how do you think about your willingness to expand the balance sheet to returning cash to shareholders not just on a quarterly basis because I realize there's volatility around that, and fourth and first quarters tend to be particularly weak, but your willingness to expand the balance sheet, outspend cash flow to buy back stock on an annual basis over the course of the year? Is that something you're willing to do on a more sustainable basis and at what point is leverage a limiting factor?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, I don't think we would be \u2013 we wouldn't lever up a material amount to increase our share \u2013 or we wouldn't lever up at all to increase our share buybacks. What we do look at, like I said, as we look at our discretionary cash flow that we expect to earn for the next quarter and the next couple of quarters, we balance that with our capital requirements that we have, and the other things that we have in place that we have to cover, debt service, whatever it is. So we are forward looking in that. Our plan is not to hoard cash, however. And our plan is to remain competitive with our peers and payout, but we would not lever up our balance sheet to return cash to shareholders.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Fernando Valle with Citi.", "Fernando Valle - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hi guys, good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Good morning.", "Fernando Valle - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "My question is back on the organic expansion, and if you would consider growing in wholesale in Mexico following the liberalization in the market? And there's been a strong pull of gasoline of late. Is that an area where you'd consider growing the wholesale business?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yes.", "Fernando Valle - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Is it a place \u2013 given the succinct answer, is it a place where you're currently exploring opportunities for growth? Have you made any advancements already, or still very early?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, okay. I told Rich I didn't want him revealing secrets, right? But, no, obviously we're looking at it. I mean, we sell \u2013 Gary, you sell a lot of barrels into Mexico today, okay? And I think everybody out there is going to be looking at Mexico as a growth opportunity. And it's certainly one that is very logical for us to pursue. And so, I think you should assume that it's something that we plan to be involved in. And not only Mexico, but other Latin American countries also.", "Fernando Valle - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Fair enough. Great, thanks, guys.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "You bet.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Margolin with Cowen and Company.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hey, good morning. How's it's going?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Hi, Sam.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "So, my first question is about crude exports from the U.S. They've been rising really rapidly, and it's a little bit surprising that you would think, as exports grow, the exporter would have to give up price, but you don't really see it reflected in the markers that we have access to, at least, in the Gulf. And so maybe these exporters have other commercial things underneath the marker? But just generally, how do you see this playing out? Most people believe that exports need to keep rising. Is it eventually going to be reflected in the prices that are offered broadly to domestic refiners, or is it going to be something where the point of these exports is to keep those markers stable, and basically domestic refiners wouldn't get the same advantage?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, Sam, this is Gary. I think you're going to continue to see volatility in the markets. And so we see that the domestic markers get a little strong and then weaken again, and you see imports come and then you see exports rise again. We've been very active exporting to our refiners in our system. We've been exporting to Quebec for quite a while now, and in the first quarter, we exported volume to Pembroke, and ran our first Permian Basin barrels in the Pembroke refinery, and saw good economic advantage to do that.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess, this is sort of a follow up on Ryan's question about the capital structure. Valero is making a lot of investments to address third party costs and increase reliability and flexibility. The effect is kind of to bring the range of earnings through the cycle higher, on sort of a continuous basis. So, just to piggyback on kind of what Ryan was asking in a different way, does that allow the company to sort of support a little bit higher leverage? The industry exited a period of deleveraging recently, and I wonder if some of these investments that bring long-term advantages could lead to debt maturing, or reversing even?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Sam, I'll let Mike speak to the levels of leverage, okay? But I mean very clearly what we're trying to do is create higher lows and higher highs in our EPS. And we really like to distinguish ourselves as a company that is able to produce earnings in challenging margin environments. And I think we've demonstrated that over the last several quarters. So, the kind of the self-help focus is something that we're just going to maintain as part of what we do going forward. Whether it allows us to achieve higher levels of leverage. I mean, Mike?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, I guess theoretically, you could say that would be the case. However, we have provided a debt to cap range of 20% to 30% that we're comfortable with. Maintaining our investment grade credit rating is very important to the company, and a debt level within that range, we think, we do that.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "You bet.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Chi Chow with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Great, thanks. Back on your feedstocks. Can you talk about, how does running more light crude in your system impact yields, capture rates, or anything else from a process standpoint? And specifically, are you seeing any issues with the reported high API gravities of the incremental barrels coming out of the Delaware Basin?", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "Hey, Chi, it's Lane. So it just really depends...", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Hi Lane.", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "...certainly, in our Mid-Continent refineries, there's times that we can be \u2013 the lighter part of our refineries get constrained by these higher APIs. And then there's times where the gravity comes back in line, and we're off (53:37). And we have a longer term view that these crudes are getting lighter. We look at the same data, I'm sure, that you are, so we hit those constraints. (53:46) Now, with that said, we don't hit those constraints quite as much in our Gulf Coast refineries, because we have a little more flexibility in finding other feedstocks and crudes to blend with these things to make sure that we're always up against that constraint. So it's a little easier to optimize around these lighter crudes than it is in the Mid-Continent.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks. I guess, in looking at the Gulf Coast results, your index, the Valero index for the region was up, I think, $2.35 a barrel year-over-year versus 1Q last year. But the realized margin in the quarter was up only $0.35. Was that short fall in capture mainly due to the planned maintenance, or is there something else going on there?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Chi, this is Gary. I would tell you the biggest impact we had was really on the heavy feedstocks we bring into the system compared to the Maya marker that moved quite a bit, so our heavy feedstocks were more expensive relative to Maya marker. And some of that was just Maya was much more competitive in the first quarter than what we either saw in the first quarter, what we had year-over-year.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Gary, but I think you said that you're not having problems on Maya delivery, but that the pricing has tightened up. Is that fair...", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well \u2013 yeah, the Maya pricing and deliveries were fine, but the other heavy sours that we're buying versus the Maya pricing was not as competitive in the first quarter as what we've seen previously.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Is that trend \u2013 do you think that will continue? We saw that Pemex has tighten up the K factor on Maya for May, so...?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, we see that come and go. There's times where Mexican crude is very competitive and times where they kind of fall where they're not. So, that's why we kind of have a diversified strategy on pulling the South American grades and Canadian grades. And it looks like it has come in some already. And I would expect that to come in and continue to come in.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Great, thanks for your comments.", "Operator", "And thank you. We now have a follow up question from Paul Cheng with Barclays.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey guys. Any kind of a rough estimate in terms of the opportunity cost loss in the first quarter due to the planned and unplanned outages?", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "Hey, Paul, this is Lane. So, our planned outages in the first quarter was \u2013 the opportunity cost was $231 million. So as you've heard us talk, we've had \u2013 it was a fairly heavy turnaround quarter. In terms, of unplanned outages it was about $40 million.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And this is not just an expense, but also you're including the loss profit that the way how you guys calculate, right?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Loss profit and expense?", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yes, it includes expense.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Very good. Thank you.", "Operator", "And thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to John Locke for closing remarks.", "John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.", "Okay.

With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations and Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and several other members of Valero's senior management team.", "If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com.

There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Joe for a few opening remarks.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report that we completed another quarter where we ran our refineries very well at high rates, and also delivered good financial results. Our low cash operating cost and highly reliable operations, combined with our advantage footprint focused on the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Mid-Continent, enabled us to achieve positive earnings and free cash flow generation, despite the choppy margin environment. As always, our team's primary focus is on safety and reliability, and we continue to deliver distinctive operating performance, but remain committed to improvement. As such, we're extending our participation in OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program to more of our facilities.", "Moving on to the refined products markets, we're pleased to see a rebound in distillate demand, in addition to the strong gasoline pull by domestic and export customers. Downward trends and product inventories and structural shortages in the primary export markets for the U.S. Gulf Coast provide an encouraging backdrop as we move into the second half of the year. On the crude supply side, we're seeing the impact of the OPEC cuts on the medium and heavy sour discounts, but increased U.S. drilling activity and crude production have supported attractive domestic sweet crude discounts relative to Brent in the second quarter. As a result, we switched our refining system to a maximum light crude slate in June. With current market conditions, operating a system with flexibility to process a broad range of feedstocks is very beneficial.", "Turning to capital allocation, we continued to execute very well on our capital program during the quarter. The Diamond Pipeline and Wilmington cogeneration plant are both on track for completion this year. Construction is continuing as planned on the Diamond Green Diesel expansion and the Houston alkylation unit, and we're looking forward to seeing the additional earnings contribution from all of these projects once they're complete.", "We continued demonstrating our commitment to stockholders by returning $658 million through dividends and stock buybacks in the second quarter. At this pace, we believe we're well positioned to exceed our payout target for the year.", "Lastly, on the topic of public policy, we get a lot of questions seeking our perspective on the many initiatives being worked on by the Trump administration. While it's difficult for us to speculate on the range or probability of potential outcomes, we're pleased with the emphasis that President Trump and his administration have placed on the energy sector, and their willingness to discuss the issues.", "So, with that, John, I'll hand the call back to you.", "John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thank you, Joe. For the second quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $548 million, or $1.23 per share, compared to $814 million or $1.73 per share, in the second quarter of 2016.", "Second quarter 2016 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $503 million, or $1.07 per share. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to the financial tables that accompany our release.", "Operating income for the refining segment in the second quarter of 2017 was $959 million, compared to $1.3 billion for the second quarter of 2016, which has been revised, retrospectively, to reflect the VLP segment. Second quarter 2017 operating income was in line with second quarter 2016 adjusted operating income of $902 million.", "Refining throughput volumes averaged 3 million barrels per day, which was 192,000 barrels per day higher than the second quarter of 2016. Our refineries operated at 96% throughput capacity utilization in the second quarter of 2017, despite an external power failure at the Benicia Refinery that caused an abrupt shut down and unplanned maintenance.", "Refining cash operating expenses of $3.51 per barrel were $0.10 per barrel higher than the second quarter of 2016, mainly due to higher energy costs in the second quarter of 2017. The ethanol segment generated $31 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2017, compared to $69 million in the second quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter of 2016 was $49 million. The decrease from the 2016 adjusted amount was primarily due to higher energy costs and strong industry ethanol production.", "Operating income for the VLP segment in the second quarter of 2017 was $71 million compared to $52 million in the second quarter of 2016, mainly due to contributions from the Meraux and Three Rivers terminals, and the Red River pipeline, which were acquired subsequent to the second quarter of last year.", "For the second quarter of 2017, G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $178 million, and net interest expense was $119 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $499 million, and the effective tax rate was 26% in the second quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate was lower than expected mainly due to the favorable resolution of an income tax audit.", "With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $8.5 billion, and cash and temporary cash investments were $5.2 billion, of which $88 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt to capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was 24%. At the end of June, we had $5.4 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which, $720 million was available only for VLP.", "We generated $1.8 billion of cash from operating activities in the second quarter. Excluding a working capital benefit of about $700 million, net cash generated was $1.1 billion.", "With regard to investing activities, we made $461 million of growth and sustaining capital investments, of which, $63 million was for turnarounds and catalysts.", "Moving to financing activities, we returned $658 million in cash to our stockholders in the second quarter, which included $312 million in dividend payments, and $346 million for the purchase of 5.4 million shares of Valero common stock. As of June 30, we had approximately $1.9 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. Capital investments for 2017 remain on track for $2.7 billion of total spend. This amount, which includes turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments, consists of approximately $1.6 billion for sustaining and $1.1 billion for growth.", "For modeling our third quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.65 million barrel per day to 1.7 million barrels per day, U.S. Mid-Continent at 445,000 barrels per day to 465,000 barrels per day, U.S. West Coast at 280,000 barrels per day to 300,000 barrels per day, and North Atlantic at 440,000 barrels per day to 460,000 barrels per day.", "We expect refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter to be approximately $3.80 per barrel. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.9 million gallons per day in the third quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.39 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs, such as depreciation and amortization.", "We expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, for the third quarter to be around $190 million, and net interest expense should be around $115 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $500 million.", "That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. This helps us ensure all callers have time to ask their questions. If you have more than two, please rejoin the queue as time permits.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And we have our first question from Phil Gresh, with JPMorgan.", "Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Morning, Phil.", "Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "First question, just on the quarter itself, in terms of the situation at Benicia. I know there's been some press about this. I was wondering if you could just elaborate on it a little bit. What would you quantify as lost opportunity cost from it? It sounds like you're back, up and running, but just if you could clarify that as well.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, Phil, this is Mike. We did \u2013 yeah, we are back, up and running. The opportunity is about \u2013 it's over $100 million in this loss. Using $100 million can give you some perspective; that would equate to about $0.16 per share. So, our second quarter earnings should have been around in that $1.40 range.", "Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And we're back up and running at this point?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yes, we are.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yes, we are.", "Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Got it, okay. Okay, second question is just on the capital spending. It feels a lot like last year, where you're trending well below the $2.7 billion number and kind of run rating closer to about $2.2 billion. So, is there anything big, specifically in the second half, we should be thinking about from a turnaround standpoint, growth capital standpoint, that would lead to a big pickup?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "I mean, our guidance right now is still $2.7 billion. We are trending a little bit below that. We have the completion out of the few of the projects that Joe talked about in his comments. So, we'll be reviewing this as we go throughout the balance of the year, and see if we need to give any updated guidance.", "Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thanks, Phil.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Paul Cheng, with Barclays.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, guys, good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Morning, Paul.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Two questions that maybe I don't know whether it's Gary or whether Lane is here. In your refining system, you've been doing phenomenally well for the last several years. Utilization rate is up, and more reliable. So, why not that realistically should we assume that this is as good on a sustainable run rate that you may be able to achieve or you actually think that the sky is the limit, and you will continue to be able to push it upward?", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "Hi, Paul, this is Lane. I'll take a stab at it. We obviously, always focus on reliability. Even though we know we outperform our peer group in this space, there's always room for improvement. We have a whole portfolio of 14 refineries. Some are absolutely excellent in the area of reliability and some not so much. And so, we can continue to work on those and get better. But, that's really what we're focused on is trying to be reliable. And through reliability, we think it's the path to lower operating costs, because we minimize the one-time event. So, there's still upside with respect to our reliability over the long haul. I mean, I think the area that we continue to really focus on is improving our turnaround duration. That's really the sort of the last \u2013 our cost structure is great. We just want to get \u2013 that's the area that we think we can work on. So, essentially, try to do these \u2013 expanded to raise the interval between turnarounds and execute on time and certainly be a very predictable on that.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And if you could quantify, say is it going to be another 1%, 2%? Any kind of range that you can help?", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "I'd have to get back with you on that, Paul. I don't know that we can \u2013 I don't know that we have estimated a range for that. The measure we use internally for our reliability is a Solomon indicator for mechanical availability, and I would say it's probably on the order of 0.5% to 1% probably improvement is still in front of us.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. The second question is for Joe. Joe, it's a little bit of the curveball. The last month or so, we have heard the number of countries in Europe, such as in UK and France, talking about, by 2040, they would stop the sale or ban the sale of the gasoline and diesel car. Just curious that in the board that when you guys are looking at that, is that a threat the board actually spend a lot of time at all? Or that you think say another 20 years to 30 years out is just way too premature to really thinking too much on that?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Paul, last year, at our strategic planning session, we met with the board and talked about the long-term viability of fossil fuels. So, the products that we produce. And every analyst that we read believes that, and people are doing 20-year outlooks, they all stated that we were going to see continued demand for gasoline and diesel fuel into the extended future.", "This news, I believe that you're talking about, I guess, we saw it a couple of days ago, yesterday or day before, on the EU moving away from fossil fuel vehicles by 2040. And it's not a surprise that things like that get proposed. But it's so far out on the horizon and so many things change that it's not something that we would change our strategy today to try to deal with.", "Jason, is there anything that you'd add to that?", "Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.", "I'd just add \u2013 kind of echo what you said. Specific to the UK announcement, it seems like they're really focusing on improving their air quality, specifically fighting nitrogen dioxide emissions. And 2040 is a way out. I mean, it's hard to say what pollution control or other technologies could evolve during that time, which may lead to different policy actually being implemented by the time you get to 2040.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "So, Paul, just to summarize, I think it's not an issue that we believe is material enough right now that it's something that we need to alter strategy or visit with the board extensively about.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Spiro Dounis, with UBS.", "Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Just want to start off with Mexico. I believe, we've seen some headlines suggesting that maybe they already made or are in the process of getting permits there, expanding into Mexico and the wholesale market. Just wondering if you could provide anything on that front.", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, I can, this is Gary. We are looking to build upon our current supply relationship with Mexico, as opportunities for product demand growth appear to be there. We believe our refineries are well positioned to allow us to be the cost advantage supplier into Mexico. We are in the final stages of securing a major supply arrangement in Mexico, but we have certain confidentiality obligations that prohibit us really from talking about it at this time.", "We're working on some pretty exciting things, and we'll be able to share our Mexico strategy with you in the near future.", "Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC", "Totally understand. I appreciate that color. And second, Joe, you mentioned the RFS, and the fact that you're encouraged just purely by the fact that the administration is willing to listen. I guess, I'm just wondering for sort of gauging our optimism on some sort of relief, is that really the only thing to be excited about, is that they're actually listening? Or do you feel like real relief is something we should expect maybe November or sometime next year?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Boy, that's really a great question. Why not let Jason take a crack at this, and then we'll see if there's anything to add.", "Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.", "Sure, yeah, this is Jason again. One thing that happened recently were the proposed RBOs were released by the EPA, and they were generally what we were expecting. We're pleased to see the reductions in the cellulosic and advanced targets, which seem to be more in line with the volumes that are actually being produced. Regarding the RIN prices, the RBO really didn't change our outlook for what we foresee on the horizon.", "On the volume side, we still have a 15 billion gallon conventional ethanol target, which has the industry butting up against the blend wall. And the blend wall is a real challenge in light of vehicle warranty, equipment compatibility and other issues. One positive note was, EPA did mention in the proposed RBO that they would be looking at possibly using their reset in the future, which is encouraging. That's a tool they have at their disposal. We also still have this broken structure with a disconnect between the point of obligation and the point of compliance. There're still very long parties and very short parties, and we think this is contributing to the high RIN prices, which are costing consumers billions of dollars a year.", "We are still hopeful the EPA is going to address the point of obligation. Our petition is still outstanding and the docket is still open. And these high RIN prices really aren't benefiting corn farmers or ethanol producers. It's just the RIN-long parties. They're not leading to more ethanol blending because the parties who control the blending are benefiting from the high RIN prices. So they just have no incentive to push to the blend wall. So, we're hoping this is a situation we can get addressed.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "We have been continuing to work this very actively, and really the administration has been very receptive to conversations around this. They are trying to do what's right and to fix broken processes. And so, we remain hopeful that point of obligation is dealt with properly, and we also are hopeful that the EPA uses its authority to adjust the RBOs to be sure that the blend wall doesn't become a chronic problem going forward.", "Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. Really appreciate the comprehensive answer. Thanks, guys.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brad Heffern, with RBC Capital Markets.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hi, everyone.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Morning, Brad.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Morning, Joe. You or Gary, I'm just wondering your thoughts on if we see sanctions on Venezuela, what the impact on Valero's crude sourcing could be. Do you think that there will be difficulty securing heavy volumes? Or is it only going to be a price effect, if there is a price effect? Any color there would be great.", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, Brad, this is Gary. We've had a longstanding, very good relationship with PDVSA and they've been a good crude supplier to our system. The way we view any potential sanctions is, it really just creates some inefficiencies in the crude market. So, the natural trade flow for a lot of Venezuelan production should be to the U.S. Gulf Coast. If sanctions were imposed, those barrels will continue to flow. They'll just flow to other markets, and then we'll have to buy barrels away from other markets to supply our system, which will cause the cost of the heavy crude to go up some. It's really impossible for me to speculate how much the cost impact that would be.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Thanks for that. And then, Joe, I feel like we kind of have this conversation every quarter. But you guys continue to come in far above the payout target, and I think that you've come in above it ever since you've had the payout target. So, is that just an artifact of being in a lower crude spread environment right now that the earnings are depressed, but the cash flows aren't? Or is there a time in the future when we could see that target move higher?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, I mean, that's a good question, too. We are producing significant amounts of free cash flow, and we've been consistent in using the capital allocation framework that we've got in place to help guide our use of cash. The one thing that we've shared is that we don't have an intention to continue to build huge stockpiles of cash, because Mike's got the balance sheet in a place where with our low debt to cap, if we wanted to do something we could do it.", "So, I think you should anticipate that we're going to continue to execute similarly to what we've done in the last several quarters. We always evaluate share repurchase versus dividends, and we would like to be in a position to continue to increase the dividend going forward. But to the extent that we have free cash, we're going to use it.", "Mike, anything you'd add to that?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "In addition to the payout target, we do look at, I mean, obviously, our operating and financial results, our cash flow, our cash position, and then competing uses of that cash. So, the target is just one thing that we look at. And Joe said, our plan is not to hoard the cash, but we're going to continue to invest in our business, and then also buy back shares, if that's the best alternative.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Appreciate the answers, guys.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thanks, Brad.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Paul Sankey, with Wolfe Research.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hi, good morning, everyone. This is kind of maybe not a follow-up, but maybe should have been a prequel to the previous question, Joe, which is about where you think we are in the cycle. Because, the way I see it, oil has settled around $50 per barrel, and looks like that kind of down the strip. Your earnings have been fairly stable. We've mentioned that you've been doing a great job of paying out cash.", "I guess one exception might be the OPEC cuts and whether that changes things. And the other thing I wanted to sort of address, and this is a bit convoluted, but also how you see seasonality now. And then, to be specific, to start you off, you said you maximized out your light crude consumption. Could you just specify or remind us what that number is?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "You bet, Paul, and I'll let Gary take a crack at this.", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Okay, to start with, on the light processing capability, we now say we can run about 1.6 million barrels a day of light sweet crude. In the second quarter, we were a little below 1.4 million barrels a day, so about 88% of our capacity was utilized in the second quarter. The third quarter, we'll see that trend up a little bit more. Some of it has been, some of the domestic medium sours have still been economic to run, and that's why we're not completely at 100% of our capacity in the system.", "On the discussions on margins, we tend to look at a mid-cycle case. And our view is that where current margins are, they're below mid-cycle. The gasoline cracks are good, slightly above mid-cycle. But the diesel cracks have been fairly significantly below our mid-cycle case. As we move forward, our view is that the diesel cracks continue to improve, as global demand growth causes those balances to tighten. And then, certainly, when you look out further, the IMO bunker spec change, in our mind, has a significant impact on diesel consumption and will cause cracks to be fairly strong as you approach 2020.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Yeah, how do you define mid-cycle then?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "So, everyone does that differently. We have a period that is from 2009 through 2015 that we use. That average over that period is what we call our mid-cycle.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay, that's understood. And so, I guess you're a bit below. Would you be anticipating, therefore, higher oil prices? I mean, crude prices going forward.", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yes, we think crude prices will go up. I think that the efficiency gains in the upstream kind of caps how high they need to go, but we certainly see where crude prices will go up some from where they are today.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay, great. That's helpful. Thanks. And, Joe, if I could \u2013 again, speaking of people saying we seem to ask this every quarter, but if I could just roll back, you seem to be talking about cash in and cash out is how you're looking at the company. But you've got this net income target. Could you just square the circle one more time for me on the payout potentially of net income against the company, which seems to be more planned on cash in, cash out? Thanks.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, Paul, I think we said, we look at both, right? We use the 75% of net income as the target, just because it's such a transparent metric. But when Mike and John are looking at our repurchase strategy, and really the use of cash in general, in setting that target, he looks at multiple metrics, right.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "I mean, if you look at it on a cash flow basis, excluding the favorable working capital that we had this quarter, the payout is at 60% of our cash flow. That was for the second quarter.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Yeah, it's been great for you guys. I mean, if you look at the multiple, assuming that you're below mid-cycle it makes sense, but you've nevertheless seen quite a material expansion in your multiple, I think, as a result of your strategies. So, congrats, I guess. Thanks, guys.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thanks, Paul.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Neil Mehta, with Goldman Sachs.", "Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning, guys.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Hi, Neil.", "Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "So, you guys have a unique perspective on what's happening from a global oil demand perspective given how far your barrels travel. Obviously, there was concerns about demand earlier this year, with the IEA reporting demand sub 1 million barrels a day in the first quarter. Second quarter looked very, very good. I just wanted to get your perspective, over the last couple months and then also looking forward, where do you see oil demand tracking? And, geographically, where do you see pockets of strength?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, Neil, this is Gary. We continue to see domestic demand as strong, and then a real pull into the export markets. As the U.S. Gulf Coast basis is stronger during driving season, you don't see that so much on gasoline. Although, we still saw a pretty good pull of gasoline into Mexico and South America. Then, on the diesel side, we saw very high diesel demand into the export markets. We exported 281,000 barrels a day of diesel during the quarter, which was a record for us, and we're really not seeing that fall off much as you move forward.", "So, this time of year is typically where diesel demand bottoms out, seasonally, and so the fact that we've been able to continue to pull diesel inventories down, at a period where demand is at its lowest, kind of sets up what could be a very good heating oil season this year.", "Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "That's great, guys. Then, the follow-up question is just on RINs here. I think your guidance is $750 million to $850 million. Given where the D6 RIN has moved, and even frankly, the D4 as well, is it fair to say that you're going to be on the upper end of that range?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, I think that's fair to say, Neil. Unfortunately.", "Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "All right. Yeah. All right, guys, thanks. Thanks again.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "You bet.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thanks, Neil.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Blake Fernandez with Scotia Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil", "Hey, guys, good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Good morning.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil", "I realize we didn't get tax guidance for next quarter, but I was hoping you could maybe just give us an update on the status of this income tax audit. I guess I'm just a little worried if this finally rolls off or comes off, we're going to have like a rapid reversal in the taxable income.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, the tax rate, we've had some favorable adjustments the last couple of quarters that has lowered that tax rate. But, why don't I try to give you guidance for the year. So, for 2017, we do expect our effective tax rate to be about 28%.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil", "Okay, so, on a full year, 28%.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, let's try that.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil", "That works.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Blake, you were listening, you missed the tax guidance.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "We had a bet on that, whether anybody would notice.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil", "I thought maybe John just skipped it, so.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "But we've been so accurate.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil", "The second question I had for you is kind of a follow-on to Paul's question on the light sweet. So, it sounds like you're kind of at 88% of your capacity in 2Q, and that's trending up in 3Q. I guess, is the view that that will continue ramping up as lower 48 volumes ramp up? And I presume, once we've exhausted the system, assuming Valero is kind of a proxy for the industry, presumably we'll have more exports. Are you planning to kind of participate in that? Or is that an opportunity for you?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, Blake. So, I guess the way I would say, certainly in the near future, we expect to be maximizing light sweet, and it's somewhat tied to U.S. production. But, to me, the real change would probably be more tied to when the OPEC barrels come back online. As the OPEC production comes back online, the differentials widen back out and we start pushing some mediums and heavies back into our system.", "In terms of your question on the exports, our primary focus is putting the most economic crude dye in front of each of our refineries. So, our exports have really been focused on getting barrels to Pembroke, in Quebec. As exports continue to grow, we could decide if we want to venture into selling to third parties. But right now, our focus has just been getting it into our own system.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil", "Got it. All right, thanks, guys.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Doug Leggate, with Bank of America.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Morning, Joe. Morning, everybody.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Doug.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Joe, I want to hit on this light crudes question as well, if I may. I hate to beat a dead horse. But I'm just kind of curious, from a macro standpoint, what has triggered this change recently. It might seem pretty obvious. But Saudis and OPEC's comments about cutting exports to the U.S., directionally, is that the thing that has prompted you to do this? I'm just curious what the catalyst was, given the OPEC theoretically cut at the beginning of the year. As a quick follow on to that, hopefully John doesn't count this as my second question, when you're running light sweet crude, what does that do to your operating costs, given you're not running the upgraders? I guess, less than you'd normally be.", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "All right, I'll answer the first part, and then Lane answers the operating cost portion. Really what we saw is, when the OPEC cuts were announced, you really didn't see much of a market response to that announcement. So, the medium sour differentials and the heavy sour differentials remained wide enough that that was the economic barrel to put in front of our system. Had the cuts have gone on longer, longer, the medium sour differentials have come in and the heavy sour differentials have come in such that the most economic barrel to put in front of our refineries is the domestic light sweet. And so, that's what we've done. And the change there kind of started occurring in the second quarter. And even in the second quarter, you saw the domestic medium sour still economic. But now, if you look at the MARS versus MEH type spread, or TI in Houston; it strongly favors running domestic light sweet. And so that's where we're headed, and I think we'll be there until the OPEC production comes back.", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, Doug, this is Lane. In terms of the incremental operating cost or light versus medium or heavy, I think at a reportable level, it's not very measurable. I mean, I don't think you would see a change in our operating costs, based on our crude mix.", "Where it would show up, if we run more or less barrels. And so, to the extent that, at some of our refineries when we go light, like at Port Arthur, we actually run more barrel, because our coker fills up later. So, on an OpEx basis, you might actually see our OpEx go down. But, it's a little bit by refinery by refinery whether it would show up. I sort of believe you wouldn't see it in aggregate. We wouldn't \u2013 it wouldn't be a reconciling item for us.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "That's helpful. I've actually assumed it would be an incremental positive, given your coker comment. But \u2013 so, my follow up and, John might note, sort of for the record, my second question. But my follow-up, I guess with a bigger, a larger light slate, you're going to see a larger gasoline cut coming out of that. And I want to wrap a couple things together here with the dynamics of U.S. demand. Your project queue, as it relates to somewhat limited growth capital with your discipline and so on, I'm just wondering where the whole export strategy fits for products in Valero's strategy going forward. In other words, is that something we could see you swing to a more aggressive investment to basically avoid RINs and maximize your gasoline margin and all the rest of that? I'm just kind of curious how that fits. I'll leave it there. Thank you.", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, so I guess the first question on whether running the lighter diet increases our gasoline make, I would say it's not significantly different as we go lighter. A lot of our gasoline production capacity is maxed out. And so when we go lighter, we end up exporting naphtha. And then, on the export strategy, we want complete flexibility to take our finished product to the highest netback market. And so that's certainly been our strategy, and we'll continue along that path. And if that's selling domestically, that's great. But if we can get a higher netback putting the barrels on the water, then we want the flexibility to be able to do that.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "And Doug, just on the capital piece of this. So, we are working projects aggressively that facilitate our ability to be very efficient in the export of products. And it's just, unfortunately, a little bit premature for us to give you any insight into that. But I think that you should expect there to be more communications on this over the next several weeks, as we firm up some of the things that we're working on.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "That's terrific, Joe. Maybe we can do it on beer and a sausage and you can tell me about it over that.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "You're on. I would look forward to it.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks a lot. Take care. Bye.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thank you. Bye.", "Operator", "And we have our next question from Chi Chow with Tudor Pickering, Holt.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Great, thank you. I might have missed this, but could you provide the product export volumes by product in 2Q? And related to that, can you talk about the dynamic on the slack capacity on the Colonial Pipeline? And is that related to the exports? And how will that trend going forward in the back half of the year here?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Hey, Chi, this is Gary. So, on gasoline, we did 88,000 barrels a day during the second quarter. Most, all of that went to Mexico and South America. Diesel, we did 281,000 barrels a day. And then, if you combine the kerosene, it was 326,000 barrels a day. That went about 75% to South America, 25% to Europe. And so, then, on your question on Colonial, we've seen the economics of shipping on Colonial have been challenged for quite some time now, and it really is tied to the exports. So, historically, what you saw happen is, as U.S. Gulf Coast started to become long on product, the bases got weak, and you had an arb to ship up to New York Harbor on Colonial. What's happening today is that the length in the Gulf has been pulled to the export market, and it kind of keeps the U.S. Gulf Coast basis a lot stronger, such that there isn't an economic incentive to ship on Colonial.", "The other factor that comes into play here is the Jones Act freight. And so with Jones Act freight coming off, you can put finished product on a Jones Act vessel and bring it around to the harbor, and it's within a penny of what it costs to move it on Colonial. So, that also has been a factor that's come into Colonial coming off allocation.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Gary, I guess what you were saying back to the netback question. You are getting a higher netback on exports then is that what's implied versus shipping on Colonial?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yes, that's right.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Okay, thanks. Second question is more a strategic in nature. Yes, Joe, regarding the company's long-term investment strategy, many of your Gulf Coast competitors and I'm pointing to specifically Exxon and Motiva, have announced absolutely huge capital programs, $18 billion to $20 billion predominantly to integrate downstream into petchems. Do these announcements influence your thinking at all, from a competitive standpoint, on the long-term strategy of sticking to refining, primarily in the Gulf Coast?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, I mean, Chi, it's a good question. And it doesn't change our strategy. We've talked in the past about a petrochemical strategy, and it's it really not as dramatic or as significant as you might be thinking. Currently, we produce a number of petrochemical streams. Products like propylene and BTX. And the strategy that we're talking about here is really to capture more of the margin available from those petrochemical stream where it makes economic sense to do so. The investments associated would be related to any additional processing, and then logistics to store and transport these products. We have no plans to deviate from our capital allocation framework, and decisions to allocate capital to these projects will be based on the expected project returns within our notional capital budget.", "So, although these guys are investing in these major petchem projects, that's really not our plan or our focus. And we do continue to have a focus on improving our refinery operations. We have a focus on integrating from the wellhead into the refineries, and from the refineries out, so that the margin that's captured in the movement of products and crude is something that we capture rather than paying to somebody else. And so, I don't think that you should worry that you're going to wake up one day and we're going to be announcing that we're investing in a mega billion dollar petchem complex. It's just not on the radar screen for us.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Are any of these incremental petchem projects in the CapEx budget at this point?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "They're still in development, and we've got placeholders for them.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "So, again, I don't think you should expect that we're going to deviate materially from this 2.5 to 2.7 number, going forward.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Got it. Thanks, Joe. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Justin Jenkins with Raymond James.", "Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I guess maybe a couple on midstream from me. So, obviously, there's a lot of competition there and some pretty high asset valuations. And, Joe, I know you've said in the past that recent transactions have looked a bit aggressive, and really I appreciate the answer to Blake's question on light sweet. But really would the interlink with the refining footprint in VLP and maybe the synergies there be enough to justify a higher multiple for building or buying assets?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, I think if you're going to buy assets, you're going to have to be prepared to pay a higher multiple. I mean, that's just where the market seems to be today. And, so, building them has really been where we've had a great deal of focus. I mean, we're looking at assets that are in the market for sale today, but we always compare it to the alternative uses for cash. Relative to exports, Rich, you want to give any update?", "Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah. Relative to the exports on the crude side, we're looking at a couple projects at Corpus and at Port Arthur to increase the ability to export crude. We've got, as Joe mentioned earlier, we've got some projects that are in the development that we'll be able to share more in the coming weeks, but that will significantly increase the ability to increase product exports. So, we're focused on getting that flexibility for Valero.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, but, Justin, we really like the idea of the organic growth projects, where we have a great deal of control over the investment profile and the project execution.", "Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Yeah, great. I appreciate that response, guys. And maybe \u2013 not sure how far I'm going to get with this one, but with the contested terminal acquisition in California, anything you can share there, in terms of what you expect, and in terms of how that plays out, and what it would mean to have in Valero's hands going forward?", "Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah. This is Rich again. So, we really can't provide anymore additional details than what's kind of been in the press release, other than the FTC allowed the transaction to go through, and the Cal AG has intervened. And that's kind of where it's at right now.", "Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Figured that was the case, but had to try. Thanks, guys.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "You bet.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Good morning, guys.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Good morning, Faisel.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Just a couple questions. First of all, just on the working capital, the $700 million benefit. What caused that? Because I guess some of the companies that are reporting are seeing working capital draws.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, in our instance, a little over $400 million of that was due to reduction in inventories. And then we had about a $250 million increase in the crude expenses. So, some of that's going to be timing, obviously, where we will be paying off those expenses.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay, got you. And then just on the projects that you guys have in development, but not in execution. I guess this potential, I guess, $1 billion in EBITDA, when do you have to start to go to FID on these projects? Because, you've already got some projects in execution that are in 2019, and you're talking about a potentially large number as you go into 2021. So, at what point do you have to start making decisions on some of these projects, whether it's octane enhancement or the supply chain into Mexico?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Faisel, the way, and Lane can talk in more detail about this, but the way that we work our projects, we look at the target for the year. And we've got a fairly dynamic approach to doing this, where Lane's engineering staff will work the projects, and then we review them periodically to see which ones we want to continue to proceed forward and to invest capital in. And so, it's not like we look at everything in the first quarter, second quarter, third quarter. We're looking at them throughout the year. Any color you want to add to that?", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "The only thing I would add is, we do have a strategic view. We invest in projects that we think increase our ability to meet what we consider to be higher octane requirements in the future. We like the idea of small, sort of quick-hitting projects that give us more feedstock flexibility, because we think we're particularly good at that. And, obviously, we \u2013 we have a strategic view to capture more of or pay ourselves for our own secondary costs, and there's a lot of projects in this. We just have made the decision to be careful about communicating more around the timeframe of where we do have an FID decision versus just sort of \u2013 we're trying to say, conceptually, this is how we view the world. Trust us that we have plenty of projects that fit into that space and we're going to execute them rateably, and on a predictable basis.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "And so then, when I think about the $1 billion annually through 2021, and then the illustrative number of 1.2 to 1.4, So is it right to say that that gets you to your 25% IRR? Is that the way to think about it?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, so the way that we've talked about this, is we wanted to illustrate the fact that we did have attractive growth projects in place. And so, half of that capital is deemed to be refining projects, which have the higher 25% return threshold. Could be 24%, could be 28%. But they're typically in that range or better. And, on the logistics side, we know that those tend to be lower-risk projects, and so they tend to have lower return thresholds. And so that's where we use kind of a 12% to 15% threshold for. And that capital is split 50/50 between those two categories. And if you just extrapolate out where that would take you, you get to your $1 billion to a $1.2 billion of incremental EBITDA resulting from a capital program that would be executed every year for the next five years.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay, got you. And this is the last question. The open season on Keystone XL, are you guys still committed to take capacity to that line? And I guess especially given some of the issues going on in Venezuela, does that make it more important?", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, I think we remain committed to the line, and we think that the U.S. Gulf Coast with the high complexity refining assets is best home for the growing production of Canadian crude. So, we're working a number of commercial options to continue to support that Pipeline.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thanks, Faisel.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Yeah, good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Morning, Roger.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Well, most of this has been hit, but I guess maybe following up on the recent comments. One of the questions here on the export terminals in Port Arthur and Corpus. Recent headlines, the LOOP would be considering the possibility of exports, and I believe you've got an interest there.", "So, how does that fit into the overall process? Does it change anything you would do? Or is it just a longer term enhancement?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Roger, this is Gary. I think what we understand is being contemplated at LOOP, at least in the short term, is a fairly small capital investment that will allow limited exports out of LOOP. We think around the neighborhood of 50,000 barrels a day, which in our mind is not really significant in terms of impacting the overall capability. But that's exactly what we're doing, is we're evaluating the existing logistics and the volume leaving, and when those logistics start to become taxed, then we can look at adding to those, either through what Rich talked about at Corpus or Port Arthur, as those opportunities become available to us.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Take a little while to fill up a VLCC at 50,000 barrels a day?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, it's exactly right.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "All right, and then kind of getting back to some of the macro questions here. We've seen the northern or let's call it the Atlantic market, product market, tighten up quite a bit. Nice inventory draws here, and in Europe. Given that we've had really high throughputs here, what do you kind of identify as what's helped us see the market change from kind of Memorial Day to the 4th of July period? It didn't appear to be lower run rates here or in Europe. So I was just curious, did we see bigger product draws into markets that are harder for us to identify? I'm thinking Africa or anywhere else. Or was it just demand picked up?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, I think it was a combination. So, we certainly saw an increase in demand from the first quarter to second quarter domestically. And then we've seen a big pull into Mexico and South America that's really helped us create the inventory draws.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "All right. I appreciate the help. Thanks.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thanks, Roger.", "Operator", "And at this time, we have no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to John Locke for closing remarks.", "John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.", "Okay, thanks, Vanessa. We appreciate everybody joining us today.

There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. What I would like to do before we discuss our quarterly financial results is to talk about the hurricanes, and how proud I am of our Valero team, and the energy industry as a whole, for the way we responded to these natural disasters.", "Hurricane Harvey's path touched almost all of Valero's Gulf Coast refineries. It made landfall just northeast of Corpus Christi, before proceeding inland to just east of Three Rivers near Victoria. The storm then reversed course, short of reaching our headquarters in San Antonio, and moved eastward along the Texas Gulf Coast to the Houston/Beaumont/Port Arthur region, where it stalled and dumped 50 inches of rain in the span of four days, before continuing into Louisiana, and ultimately moving inland and dissipating.", "We shut down our Corpus Christi and Three Rivers refineries prior to Harvey's arrival, and reduced rate at our three plants in the Houston and Port Arthur area, eventually shutting down Port Arthur due to flooding. Our team worked hard to get these plants safely back up and running, and we only experienced extended delays at Three Rivers and Port Arthur.", "Hurricane Irma had a less direct impact on our refining operations, but our commercial team and business partners worked tirelessly to prepare for and restore the supply chain as soon as possible. While our operations have returned to normal, we recognize that people and communities affected by the storm are still recovering, particularly those along the southern Gulf Coast and in the Houston and Port Arthur areas. In response, Valero provided financial assistance, meals, water, shelter, fuel, and other support to employees and their affected communities during the storm and the recovery.", "One of the things that I was most encouraged by, was the display of the American spirit and our determination to help each other during these times of need. From the efforts of the dedicated employees fighting back the onslaught of torrential rain and rising flood waters, to all those Gulf Coast residents who banded together to rescue their neighbors and help with recovery and cleanup, it was a defining moment. An event like this shows the efficiency of the supply chain in the refining and energy sector which, frankly, is not fully appreciated on a day-to-day basis.", "To think that the epicenter of the refining industry on the Gulf Coast could take a direct hit from a Category 4 hurricane and keep supply disruptions as short lived as they were was impressive. I applaud our employees, our local, state and federal government officials, and all of our business partners who worked closely with us on the front lines to return the supply of our fuels to affected communities.", "Now, despite the hurricane impacts, we're pleased to report another good quarter of results for the company, which John will share with you shortly. Last quarter, I mentioned that we were extending our participation in OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program to more of our facilities. I'm happy to report that our St. Charles and Memphis refineries were awarded STAR status by OSHA, distinguishing Valero as a refining company with the most OSHA VPP STAR sites. These are noteworthy achievements for Valero that demonstrate our focus and commitment to safety and reliability.", "Moving on to the markets, overall, we're pleased to see margins improving compared to last year. This improvement is primarily due to continued strong domestic and export product demand, as well as ample supplies of crude, notwithstanding the impact of the OPEC cuts on the medium and heavy sour discounts. Our system's flexibility allowed us to shift our feedstock diet to maximize domestic sweet crudes and capture wider discounts versus Brent.", "We continue to adhere to our disciplined capital allocation strategy, and also made progress on our growth investments. We expect to complete the Diamond Pipeline and Wilmington cogen projects within the next two months, and we're eager to see the incremental earnings contribution from these projects beginning in 2018.", "Construction also continues on the Diamond Green Diesel expansion and the Houston alkylation unit, and we recently announced the Central Texas pipeline and Pasadena marine terminal projects.", "Lastly, with regard to returns to stockholders, we returned $600 million through dividends and stock buybacks in the third quarter. This results in a 58% pay out of adjusted cash flow in operating activities year-to-date. So we're well-positioned to exceed our target range of 40% to 50% for the year.", "So with that, John, I will hand the call back to you.", "John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thank you, Joe. For the third quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $841 million, or $1.91 per share compared to $613 million or $1.33 per share, in the third quarter of 2016. Third quarter 2016 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $571 million or $1.24 per share. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to the financial tables that accompany our release.", "Operating income for the refining segment in the third quarter of 2017 was $1.4 billion, compared to $934 million for the third quarter of 2016, which has been revised retrospectively to reflect the VLP segment. The increase from 2016 is attributed primarily to higher gasoline and distillate margins, and wider discounts for domestic sweet crudes relative to Brent crude, partly offset by higher premiums for residual feedstocks, and narrower discounts for medium and heavy sour crudes versus Brent.", "Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.9 million barrels per day, which was 33,000 barrels per day higher than the third quarter of 2016, despite Hurricane Harvey related impacts. Throughput capacity utilization was 92% for the third quarter of 2017.", "Refining cash operating expenses of $3.71 per barrel were $0.17 per barrel higher than the third quarter of 2016, mostly due to higher energy costs in the third quarter of 2017. The ethanol segment generated $82 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2017, compared to $106 million in the third quarter of 2016. The decrease from 2016 was primarily due to lower margins, resulting from higher corn and lower distillers grain prices.", "Operating income for the VLP segment in the third quarter of 2017 was $69 million, compared to $56 million in the third quarter of 2016. The increase from 2016 was mainly due to contributions from the Meraux and Three Rivers terminals and the Red River pipeline which were acquired in September 2016 and January 2017, respectively.", "For the third quarter of 2017, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $229 million, and net interest expense was $114 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $497 million, and the effective tax rate was 30% in the third quarter of 2017.", "With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $8.5 billion, and cash and temporary cash investments were $5.2 billion. Of which, $116 million was held by VLP.", "Valero's debt to capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was 24%. At the end of September, we had $5.1 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which $720 million was available for only VLP.", "We generated $1 billion of net cash from operating activities in the third quarter. Excluding the negative impact from a working capital increase of $315 million, cash generated was approximately $1.4 billion. With regard to investing activities, we made $565 million of growth and sustaining capital investments, of which $73 million was for turnarounds and catalysts.", "Moving to financing activities, we returned $600 million to our stockholders in the third quarter. $309 million was paid as dividends, and the balance was used to purchase 4.2 million shares of Valero common stock. As of September 30, we had approximately $1.6 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.", "We continue to expect capital investments for 2017 to be $2.7 billion, with approximately $1.6 billion allocated for sustaining the business, and $1.1 billion for growth. Included in the total are turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments.", "For modeling our fourth quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.65 million to 1.7 million barrels per day. U.S. Mid-Continent at 410,000 to 430,000 barrels per day. U.S. West Coast at 265,000 to 285,000 barrels per day. And North Atlantic at 465,000 to 485,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be approximately $3.90 per barrel.", "Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 4 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. We expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation for the third quarter to be around $215 million, and net interest expense should be around $115 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $495 million. Lastly, we expect RIN expense for the year to be between $800 million and $900 million.", "That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. This helps us ensure other callers have time to ask their questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. And we have our first question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi, thanks. Good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Morning, Roger.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Joe, I guess let's dive in on everybody's kind of favorite refining, non-refining topic of RINs here. Obviously, some news has flowed through, both positive and negative, in the last time we talked. And I'm just curious, if we think about there's the RIN expense number, and then there's obviously some magnitude of recovery you're able to achieve. Can you give us any guidance on kind of how that flows back through, what you've been able to do to mitigate the expense, and then maybe what you can do forward? And let's assume there isn't going to be a meaningful policy change in the next 12 months.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "All right. Well, fair enough. The number that we would share on the actual RIN cost is the $800 million to $900 million. So I won't speculate on how it affects the marketing volumes and so on. But what I will tell you is, I think you can see it from the release. We're continuing to invest in assets that allow us to blend more and to export more. So we've got a very strong focus on logistics and on the wholesale market expansion.", "Now, relative to this policy situation, Roger, this RFS fight is far from over. As you'd expect, those that are enjoying this windfall are aggressively defending their positions and we have a counter view.", "Why don't I let Jason just give you some insights into our perspective on what's occurred, and then maybe where we go.", "Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.", "Okay. Yeah, this is Jason. You all probably saw this letter Administrator Pruitt sent to these Midwestern senators, here in the last week about potential changes to the RFS that the EPA was looking at. In the letter, he said they decided they weren't going to move the point of obligations. They weren't going to lower the biodiesel volumes under the notice they were looking at, and they weren't going to grant export RINs, which is another idea they were looking at. Of course, we are disappointed in how this went down since it looks like political pressure resulted in short circuiting the policy review process. Now, that's just not good government. It's one thing to have a full balanced review of a proposal and decide it's not the right thing for the country, and it's another to be bullied and abandoning the analysis midstream, which is what it looks to us what happened this time.", "Still the White House, the EPA and Congress have all acknowledged that high RIN prices are a problem for the refiners. This is not the way the program is supposed to work. So, they're going to continue to get pressure until we get the situation addressed. We're going to continue to pursue our legal, regulatory, and legislative options, as are others, and we're going to keep up the fight.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks. I guess maybe changing tact just a little bit. Other big issue, if you look out there is a pretty big difference in some of the light crude pricing, particularly thinking WTI, Midland or Cushing, relative to Gulf Coast prices. Can you give us an idea of how you are able to take advantage of that along the Gulf Coast, or maybe sort of a net crude pricing you are able to achieve through some of your marketing and pipeline access?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, Roger, this is Gary. I guess, we've raised our capacity to run light sweet crude. So, we're now about 1.6 million barrels a day of light sweet crude processing capability, with the addition of the toppers in Corpus and Houston. In the Mid-Continent itself, we have 300,000 barrels of refining capacity between Ardmore and McKee, and the Diamond Pipeline, which will start up in December. Then puts Memphis with competitive access to that Midland Cushing market as well, which gives us about 500,000 barrels a day of equivalent Mid-Continent refining capacity. In addition that, we've worked very hard to secure logistics to give us competitive access to Midland and Corpus, and also competitive access to Midland and Cushing at our Houston refineries. And we've also added Line 9, which gives us exposure to that Brent TIR.", "So, a lot of this work that we've done on logistics over the past several years, we feel like puts us in great position to be able to take advantage of that light sweet, sweet differential.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from are Spiro Dounis with UBS Securities.", "Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Joe, I just want to start off here. Valero has been a strong steward of capital over the last few years, and it just seems like the market is really starting to recognize your tight belt on spending and strong capital return. But I can't help but notice the large cash balance, low debt levels, strong currency and share price now. It just screams like maybe you should be investing here. So, just wondering, do you think like you are reaching the point where a pivot to maybe more spending makes sense, whether it be refining midstream, or expansion up or down the value chain?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, I mean, Spiro, that's a good question. I think you understand the way we look at the use of capital. And we do have a strong cash position. We do have a strong balance sheet. Acquisitions are very opportunistic, as you well know. And we look at everything. To have an effective acquisition for Valero, it's got to be one that there's synergy involved in. And so, that's one of the primary considerations. We have a great portfolio of assets today. So, we're not compelled to do something just because of where we find ourselves. And then we always evaluate the returns that we could achieve with an acquisition or a growth project with that of buying back our shares. And, frankly, we still feel that we're undervalued at the price we're at today. So that competition for the use of what we would deem to be the discretionary cash flow, remains.", "So, I think you'll see us continue to look at opportunities as they present themselves. I think that you can expect that capital projects will continue to percolate up, and if the returns are there for those projects, we're going to do them. But I mean, nominally, our capital budget is going to be in this, $2.7 billion to $3 billion range. That's just what we feel that we can execute effectively. And if, for some reason, we find some very interesting projects that would increase that number going forward, we've told you guys that we'll make our case with you on why it's a good idea. Anyway, I think what you should expect is a bit more of the same going forward.", "Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC", "Fair enough. Fair enough. And then maybe just general comments around the market here. I think you've got refined products supply lower than it's been in a while, and as you head into winter time here, I don't think we've seen distillate this low in years. And I guess, historically, that kind of what's led to a ramp up in gasoline production too early in the spring. So maybe just as you look into 2018, the setup right now from an inventory standpoint, is it the surprise you? Are we looking at things being better than what you expected maybe earlier this year?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, I think even pre-hurricane, you saw typically during that time period, you see some pretty good builds in distillate and distillate inventories were flat or even falling even before you had the hurricane effect. So, then when you had the supply disruption, it's definitely put us in a very good position in terms of inventory heading into the winter, the heating oil season, with much cold weather at all, I think we're in for a very strong distillate season. And then I think the point you made is accurate, the last several years, distillate hasn't been strong enough to really force refineries into the max distillate mode, and it's kind of created a gasoline build heading into driving season. But this year, it looks like with the strength in distillate, refineries will operate in a max diesel mode, which will help avoid the gasoline build and should be supportive of the gasoline crack next year.", "Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC", "Appreciate the color. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, guys. Good morning, everybody. I've got \u2013 I'll take my full quota of two, if I may. Joe, the RIN question from earlier, I wonder if I could just add a bit of follow-up to that. What are your options to mitigate your RIN exposure? I'm thinking exports, retail, other things you can do, if this is going to drag on a bit more, because it looks like the RIN guidance, the cost guidance has ticked up a little bit from what you had previously. So I'm just wondering what your response will be now that that line of potential resolution appears to have stalled for now?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, no, Doug, that's a great question. And I think if you look at the projects that we've announced, okay. You look at the pipeline that will take products into the market area, we're going to own a terminal, it'll allow us to blend. We're aggressively expanding our wholesale marketing business. And then the terminal at Houston that we've announced with Magellan is going to allow us to export more product.", "We don't have our heads in the sand on this, by any stretch of the imagination, and we will continue to develop projects which allow us to deal with this issue. Again, though, Doug that being said, I think this fight is far from over. There's a clear realization, as Jason stated, not only at the White House and in Congress, but also with the regulators, that the RFS as it is structured today is broken. And it's not achieving the objectives of the legislation when it was implemented. And so there will be changes, and we'll continue to deal with it strategically, with the things we can control, and we'll continue to deal with it legislatively and from a regulatory front, to try to come up with some type of a reasonable solution to this. But we are doing what we can, Doug, to try to mitigate this expense.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. I will wait to hear what you've to say on that on a future date. My follow-up is really, I guess, you kind of snuck this one out at a third-party conference, resetting the payout ratio to cash flow, and I really got to commend you guys for doing that in terms of the transparency, but my question is, basically, to get the full benefit of that, one would imagine that it resets your dividend yield, to some extent, that's already happened. But now that you're where your share price is trading, you've obviously been very cognizant about when to do buybacks, and what's really at the back of my question is, assuming we get a corporate tax reduction, one would imagine that your corporate cash flow is going to take another step higher through the cycle, what is your current thinking on the buyback versus dividend split as you go forward? And with this reset in the target, are we likely to see greater emphasis on dividend growth going forward now? I'll leave it there. Thanks.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thanks, Doug.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "Okay. On the reset of the target, I do not think that really affects our absolute dollar payout, but going forward, we're just going to provide it from a \u2013 with a different metric, we'll provide the guidance versus the different metric. You know, in regard to the dividend, our current plan is to review the dividend for increases annually, and to pay a dividend at the high end of our peer group range.", "Regarding share repurchases, they will be funded from our excess cash flow. So as we generate excess cash flow, we'll compare the repurchase with our alternative uses of cash, and if the repurchases is the best use then we'll repurchase some more shares.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "I don't want to take up my quota here maybe, just an observation, your yield is now trading in line with ExxonMobil, just to put it in context which one would suspect that dividend growth gets rewarded in the relative yield of the share price, I guess, is what I'm saying. Just an observation, but I appreciate your answer and, yeah, I like the moves. Thanks a lot.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thanks, Doug.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBS Capital Markets.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good morning, everyone.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Good morning, Brad.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Joe, morning. You've obviously announced this new Mexico terminal sort of partnership, can you talk through sort of what having that terminal gives you that you didn't have before, as it relates to selling into Mexico?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Hey, Brad, this is Gary. We have secured a long-term deal that gives us access to deepwater marine terminal in Veracruz, Mexico. From there, we can supply inland terminals in Puebla and Mexico City. So we expect that to be in operation sometime in the first quarter of 2019. In addition to that, we continue to ramp up our cross-border volume to supply the market. And we're also exploring other opportunities to supply to some of the other major population centers. At this time, we're not ready to communicate any of those opportunities. In addition to all the work going on in logistics, we are also engaged with a number of retailers and distributors regarding wholesale volume to supply both branded and unbranded volumes to them.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "So, Brad, I mean there's really two benefits, right? Number one, we sell barrels into Mexico today. This provides us with a footprint and the opportunity to capture additional margin on those barrels. And then it provides the opportunity to grow. It's a market where consumption is growing. Same is true with other parts of Latin America. And that's why we continue to look to those also. And then, of course, you get the other benefit. You have a RIN related benefit associated with securing those markets and exporting more into them.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. That's great color, guys. Thanks. And I guess maybe sticking with Gary, just on the Venezuela front. Obviously, you guys are big buyers of Venezuelan crude. I've heard a lot of anecdotes recently about quality declines there, and just general difficulty as it comes to payments. Any color you can give there about how you guys are thinking about Venezuela as a source going forward would be great.", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Sure, our volumes from Venezuela have been fairly consistent. We certainly see the struggles that they have. Some of that shows up in the load windows. It's difficult to get the load windows, but we've been getting the volume, and we have seen some degradation in quality, but the commercial terms that we have on our contracts with Venezuela have price deducts that go along with those qualities. So we really haven't seen any problems as of yet.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Thanks all.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Hey, Paul. Are you there?", "Operator", "It seems that he has dropped. I will move on to the next question. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, guys, good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Morning, Paul.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Joe, two questions, maybe the first one will be for Gary, actually, for the Diamond Pipeline, when is that going to start up, and when the linefill going to be? What are the tariffs that we're talking about on there?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah. So Diamond Pipeline, we'll be doing linefill in November and we expect the pipeline to be in operation in December. To kind of get an idea of the economics today, we supply Memphis from the Gulf, and it's really an LLS plus pipeline tariff. When Diamond is in service, it will be Cushing or Midland TI plus the Diamond tariff. So it really is that WTI to LLS spread that you would look at. Today that spread is around $6.30.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "So Gary, should I interpret what you say is that the tariff will be about the same as that from the Gulf Coast up to Memphis today?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "No, There's a little difference in the tariffs, but it's not too significant.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And that when you're getting the oil from Cushing on the WTI (29:51) the Gulf Coast, are we going to see any yield difference or any things that we need to take into consideration in addition to the LLS, WTI spread?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, we'll have a number of grades that the \u2013 one of the reasons we like Diamond is it gives us access to a number of different crude grades and certainly, depending on what crude grades are economic at the time, there can be a yield shift associated with the crudes.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. But that's not in your base economic?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "No, it's not.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. A second one, Joe, on the IMO 2020, does Valero have any plan or expect to launch refining CapEx projects associated with that to shift your yield?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Why don't I let Lane and Gary weigh in on this.", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "Paul, this is Lane. So we obviously are looking at that and we have a view. Our existing assets will clearly benefit from that regulatory change, and we have several big projects that are in our gating process. We're not in a position to talk about them publicly, but we definitely understand that'll change the market not only for fuel oil, but we believe that the replacement fuel will be diesel. So, you'll see a fairly positive economics from that sort of resid to diesel spread. So, yes, we are looking at projects to take advantage of that.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Is there any timeline link that you guys may come to a FID decision, or any kind of timeline you can share?", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yes, we will get to some FID decisions in the first half of next year. Maybe even as early as the first quarter of next year. We just got to go through our gating process and get the engineering done. And so, it'll be sometime next year when we would provide a little more clarity to everyone as to what we're deciding on and what we're going to invest in.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And would those be in the, say, $1 billion, $1.5 billion kind of project? Or will it be much smaller?", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "All very excellent questions, but I think I've probably said about as much as I can.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay, fair enough. Thank you.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Paul, that was number three, okay?", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "We love talking to you. We'll get out there with it soon enough though. And Lane answered it properly.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you.", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thanks, Paul.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.", "Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yes, hi. Good morning. I suppose I'll ask one more question a slightly different way there on the back of Paul's question which is, this range of CapEx that you've generally talked about, this kind of 2.5, I guess it's $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion type of range. Would any of these projects be big enough that it would influence that, or do you still think that you're generally going to operate within that range over the next few years?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "No, I don't think we're ready at this point in time to tell you that we're going to jump above that range. And the projects are material, but it goes into the discipline around selecting the ones with the best rates of return that position us best to grow in the future. And so, that's our focus. Projects take several years to construct. And so, even if it's a $1.5 billion project, you're talking $500 million, $600 million a year. So, I don't think you should expect that you're going to find us jumping to $3.5 billion to $4 billion of CapEx.", "Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Right. Okay. That's helpful. And then, certainly, I can appreciate all of your comments about the efforts on the Gulf Coast. I thought I'd just ask about where Valero is at in terms of, as we entered the fourth quarter, were there any residual effects anywhere in your system? I guess, I'm thinking maybe Port Arthur, or would you say you are fully back up and running by the start of the quarter?", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, Phil, this is Lane. So Port Arthur would have been the refinery that had the biggest lingering effect going into the fourth quarter, but our operations are back to normal as of now, so.", "Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then last question for Joe. Joe, you've talked about this $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion of project EBITDA that's going to be coming over the next few years. $300 million to $400 million of that's in execution phase. So, can you talk \u2013 Diamond is coming, Wilmington is coming, Diamond Green Diesel, how much should we expect in 2018 uplift, run rate basis?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah. Why don't John give you some insight there.", "John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, Phil, so we've got Diamond Pipeline and Wilmington cogen that's coming up. We have given that slide 13 in our deck, so you can have a longer term view of expected EBITDA. We really don't break it down by year, so we don't have specific guidance on those two that you can expect next year. But you can kind of triangulate on the IRR thresholds that we've given in the slide deck, and use the base cost for those two projects to get a ballpark, depending on your price assumption.", "But what we have done in the past, and you can see in the slides on the toppers, was do a make good after there's some time where they operate, and we can kind of see what they are contributing. And I would think, for larger projects, we would continue to do that.", "Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "So, would the run rate of the $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion generally be fairly linear over this next five years, more broadly?", "John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, we don't have guidance on if it's lumpy or smooth, but as the projects come online, we'll look at it and talk about them a little bit. That's really all we can say.", "Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez with Scotia Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.", "Hey, guys, good morning. Question for you. I was hoping to clarify on this VLP drop of $508 million. Can you clarify how much of that is going to be financed in the form of units versus cash? Basically trying to figure out how much cash is going to actually land on the balance sheet in 4Q?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, hey, Blake. This is Joe. Donna is going to give an answer to this.", "Donna M. Titzman - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, so, the net cash inflow to VLO for that should be a little north of $400 million. There will be some unit take-backs, but it'll be relatively small and less than $50 million.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay, great. Thank you. And then, Gary, back on the previous question on shifting toward maximum distillate yield. I don't believe you stated this, but I was looking at your 3Q levels, and it looks like you were running about 38% distillate yield. I'm just curious, is that kind of the upper end of what you think the system can do or, I guess, how much flex do you have there?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "We generally say we have ability to swing about 5% of our yield slate. I would say, for the third quarter, we weren't in a max distillate mode for a good portion of the quarter. So, I think that's kind of the amount of flexibility you will see in the yields.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.", "And you think that's indicative of kind of industry? So, in other words, there may be another 2% or 3% or so ability to kind of flex more toward distillate going forward?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, I would assume most people are similar to us.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.", "Got it. Thank you.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thanks, Blake.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.", "Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Good morning, team.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Good morning, Neil.", "Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "The first question was around the product export market. I just want your guys' perspective in terms of where ultimately the barrels are going, and the outlook for product exports as we roll into 2018 here?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "This is Gary. The third quarter, we did 88,000 barrels a day of gasoline exports, and we did 251,000 barrels a day of diesel exports. I think, especially on the diesel, you definitely saw some hurricane impacts. Prior to the hurricane, we were over 300,000 barrels a day of diesel exports. And then, certainly, with the hurricane, those volumes dropped.", "November, you know with November trade, we saw wide open arbs to go both to South America and to Europe. December trade, it looks like certainly a big pull again to Latin America. For the first few days of December trade, the arb Europe has been closed, but our traders expect it to open up. So we don't really see that there will be much of a material difference in export demand. In fact, we expect it to grow, as we see growth in South America.", "Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "I appreciate. And then the follow up, Gary, just on Brent TI. So you talked about how the system is switching to maximize lights, but do you have any views in terms of what's driving it this wide? It seems like LLS is very firm here. Houston pricing is actually relatively firm. It seems like there's a congestion or bottleneck around Cushing, but any color, as folks who are in the market in terms of what's driving the differential as wide as it is, and then just kind of how you are thinking about that spread going into 2018 as well.", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, so, I think what you're seeing in Brent TI is really a combination of factors. It's strength in Brent and weakness in TI. So, the strength in Brent, you've seen a pull from Asia of North Sea barrels, and you've seen good refining margins in Europe, and so it's pushed the Brent contract into backwardation. And then on TI, you've had weakness, and some of that was driven from the hurricanes. You had decreased demand for TI with refining capacity down. And then the hurricanes also hindered our ability to export the crude.", "Following that period, now you've had a period where you have some Mid-Continent refineries and turnarounds. It looked like, at the peak, 400,000 to 500,000 barrels of refining capacity that's down, and so it begun to stress the logistics a little bit. So the MarketLink line and the Seaway line are both under proration, and so it's really then caused this weakness in TI.", "So, certainly, it'll improve some as Mid-Continent refining capacity comes back online. But as we continue to seek production growth, I think, you'll see that pipeline tariffs are meaningful again, and we would expect to see a little bit wider Brent TI through next year.", "Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Thanks guys. I appreciate the time.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Chi Chow with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Thanks, good morning.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Hi, Chi.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Interesting development on Capline last week. Can you talk about the company's interest in possibly locking up line space on a potential reversal of that line, into St. James and Meraux and how are you thinking in general about the long-term mix of Canadian heavies into your Gulf Coast system?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, Chi, this is Gary. It's really difficult for us to be able to comment because at this stage, we're not sure what's going to feed a Capline reversal. They said 300,000 barrels a day. We're not sure what feeds it. In general, though, we have connectivity into Memphis through Capline, so a reversal gives us more optionality at Memphis. And then I think if it is Canadian heavy, it gives us more access to Canadian heavy at our St. Charles refinery, which is a positive as well. But at this stage, it's just too early for us to really comment on anything we would do with that.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Well, does the Capline reversal change your support at all for Keystone XL moving in? I mean, you can get barrels into Patoka off Keystone. And how are you thinking about that?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, we're still supportive of Keystone XL. To us, it's the most efficient way to bring the barrels in. But we'll see what happens with that and then what happens with Capline.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And on Latin American heavies, you talk about Venezuela, but certainly there's the declining production throughout that region. How do you think that plays out longer term on availability of Latin American heavy into your region and how does that influence Maya differential longer term?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, so I think you see some decline in South America but we see Canadian heavies continuing to ramp up, and so I think some of the lost barrels that you have from South America will be replaced by additional Canadian heavies. We certainly see that while the OPEC cuts are in place, that the quality differentials can be narrower. But when you get the OPEC barrels, you'll see wider differentials, and then as you move closer to this IMO 2020 date, we think that the quality differentials will be very wide during that period of time.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay, thanks. And maybe just one general question here. Joe, you talked about the hurricane impacts and supply chain efficiencies in your remarks, but is there any way you guys can get more fuel into Puerto Rico to help those people out? By all accounts, there's still a shortage of everything and it just seems like we need a private sector to step in and take a lead here to help out the situation there. Thanks.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Chi, that's a really nice thought. I mean, we have provided financial support into Puerto Rico, as well as Mexico after the earthquakes. And then, of course, as a result of the hurricanes here. And from a fuel supply source, Gary.", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah, we certainly can look at it. I can't say that we've had any calls for fuel, but I'll look into it, Chi.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "But we sure wouldn't hold it back.", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "No.", "Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Yeah, well, thanks for those thoughts. Appreciate it.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Jenkins with Raymond James.", "Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. I guess maybe a couple on midstream from me, so last quarter we talked about M&A versus organic growth and, Joe, I appreciate your response to an earlier question. And you mentioned how much you prefer maybe the organic side given control of development and certainly seen that with investment or the announcements you've made in September. But I guess, I'm curious with the difficulties playing out in midstream stocks lately, and maybe the relative strength of VLP if maybe you see things looking better for M&A.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, I mean, look, what we've seen \u2013 when we participated in the M&A market around, let's just say gathering systems, seems like they're still at pretty lofty multiples, okay? So then you get into, is it better to try to buy something like that or is it better to go ahead and do the development yourself? So obviously, we've seen plenty of opportunity to strengthen our system, both for Valero and for VLP by doing the organic projects. But, Rich, is there anything you'd want to add to this?", "Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.", "It's basically what you said, the assets, the transactions that we see are trading north of 20-time multiples and we've got a good inventory of organic projects. And we've got the EBITDA upstairs, the dropdowns. So acquisitions are part of the growth strategy, but right now we've got a lot of good stuff at much more attractive multiples. But we do look at all this stuff.", "Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay, appreciate that, guys. And then maybe thinking on the financing plan for the two midstream JVs announced in September, do you think we could view it more like Diamond where we build it at VLO and drop into VLP, or is there a thought to get VLP involved sooner? And I'll leave it there. Thanks guys.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, and Donna may want to speak to this. But I mean, I would say that generally our ultimate goal here as VLP grows is to be able to allow it to be able to do its projects and its acquisitions on its own. Today, Valero still has absolutely no problem providing what \u2013 I won't call it financial support, but being on point for taking the asset and adding it to the drop inventory. Anything you'd add?", "Donna M. Titzman - Valero Energy Corp.", "No, I mean, right, so as soon as VLP can get to that size and scale to take this on, to take that negative cash impact on itself, we're certainly looking forward to doing it that way.", "Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Understood. Thanks, everyone.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thanks, Justin.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. Maybe just a couple of quick ones. On run rates, your run rate guidance, in terms of volume throughput into 4Q is relatively in line with our expectations, but I think there's been some talk of deferrals of turnaround activity and maintenance activity into earlier next year to take advantage of the opportunity. I mean, are you seeing any of that across your portfolio or as you look broadly across the industry, do you have expectations for turnaround activity, I guess deferrals now or what it means for next year's maintenance period in February and March?", "R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, Ryan, I'll start with the last question. We don't really give forward views on where we're going to be in the first half or even next year on our turnaround and not really on the industry. What I will say is that we deferred our McKee turnaround in the Mid-Continent for about two weeks to help get in the better contractor situation and supply situation, and so that was really just a two-week delay. We did move out a catalyst change in our LCO hydrocracker at Houston into next year. And that's pretty much the extent of our deferrals. We didn't have a lot of turnaround activity in the Gulf Coast going on or the Mid-Continent for that matter going on in the fourth quarter of this year.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great, thank you. And then maybe just one more quick one. In third quarter, I believe your feedstock was, I think you ran about 52% sweet. You were at 48% sweet last quarter. Prior to the start-up of Diamond, is there any additional flex in the mix to run additional sweet and get closer to the 1.6 million barrels of capacity or is that about max?", "Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, if you look at the way we ran in the third quarter out of that 1.6 million barrels a day of capacity, we utilized about 85% of that. In the fourth quarter, certainly some of the underutilized capacity that we had was the result of the hurricane, so that capacity is back online. But with the heavy Canadian discounted to Houston TI barrel by 15%, economics are really pushing us towards the heavy at some of our plants, and then light sweet after that.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thank you.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thanks, Ryan.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Good morning, guys.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Hi, Faisel.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hi. Two questions. First, the decision to take back a small number of units in the VLP transaction, was that a function of the current market conditions for MLPs or was it just a function of you guys have $5 billion of cash in the balance sheet and you don't need to take back the cash?", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "The decision to take back some of those shares was largely to mitigate some of our tax exposure on the deal.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay, okay, got you. And then just, I guess, following up on that. The current cash balance of over $5 billion, no matter how much stock you buy back and how much you increase the dividend, the balance still remains. So I just want to understand your philosophy around that.", "Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.", "That's a good thing.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Yeah. Faisel, I mean, that's a good question. I take it your question is what are we going to do with all the cash. We're going to continue on the path we're on, and as I said earlier, we think our shares are undervalued. So the capital allocation framework that we've put in place has worked very well for us. We do \u2013 Mike mentioned we look at the dividend. I don't think we're at the top on where we're going to have dividend payouts going forward. And then we, again, a significant transaction, we chew up some of the cash. So again, we've told you in the past, our objective is not to hoard cash and just sit here with a ton of cash on the balance sheet. We're going to put it to work and we'll do it through the context of the capital allocation framework.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. And when you say that an acquisition could chip some of the cash away, is it you've tried \u2013 you've looked for stuff and you just can't make it work or is it just the timing is not right?", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "Well, even with a lot of cash, it doesn't make sense to overpay for something. And when we \u2013 we have a very disciplined approach to looking at acquisitions. And as Rich stated, on the logistics side, 20 times multiples seem to be a little bit rich when we can do organic growth projects around logistics at much more attractive economics. Granted, the run rate is longer, the lead time is longer, but the result is much, much better for our owners than it would be if we overpaid for something. So patience isn't something maybe that we're all blessed with, but we're trying to do so and to continue to drive growth, but do it in a reasonable way.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thanks, Joe. Appreciate the comments.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Good morning. The latest drop looks to be a bit of a lower multiple than historical. Is that driven more by perhaps higher maintenance CapEx on the assets, or the higher cash component? Is that an issue? And do you see multiples starting to stair step down for ensuing (51:49) drops relative to what you've done in the prior years?", "Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.", "So the combined multiple for the most recent drop is not out of line from our prior drops. It's in that 8.5 time to 9.5 time multiple, and so I wouldn't attribute any higher maintenance or any capital associated with these assets. They're high quality assets. They're \u2013 again, remember, we solve for a IRR pre-tax for these dropdowns, and the multiple just kind of rolls out. So we're in that 12% to 13% pre-tax IRR on these drop downs, but there's nothing funny going on with the maintenance or CapEx associated.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "I'm sorry. I may have just misunderstood the press release. Is the combined EBITDA $84 million?", "Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.", "No, it's $60 million.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Oh, okay. I apologize.", "Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.", "Okay.", "Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.", "No, problem, Craig.", "Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.", "Thanks, Craig.", "Operator", "And thank you. I see no further questions in queue at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Locke for closing remarks.", "John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.", "Okay. Well, thank you, everybody.

Well 2017 was certainly a tale of two halves. In the first half of the year, we saw a gradual but steady improvement in margins from the low levels of 2016.", "The return of global economic growth created strong product demand and, on the supply side, our flexibility allowed us to optimize our system away from the OPEC supply constraint in crudes to capture more margin available on Canadian and domestic crude supply. In fact, we processed a record 1.4 million barrels per day of light crude during the fourth quarter.", "In the second half of the year, catastrophic weather-related events accelerated the decline in industry product inventories to below five-year averages, brought national attention to the complexity and inefficiency of the U.S. fuel supply chain and renewed appreciation for the critical role that products play in the lives of families and communities.", "In December, to the delight of many, our nation\u2019s lawmakers passed unprecedented tax reform.

And then the further declines in Venezuelan production and what that\u2019s meant along the Gulf Coast for heavy access.", "Gary Simmons", "Hey, Roger, this is Gary. Yeah, we\u2019ve seen difs move quite a bit. I'll start with Venezuela. Although production has been declining in Venezuela, our volumes have remained fairly constant versus our term contracts.", "We attribute this to the fact that although production is declining, refinery utilization is down in Venezuela and so it's kind of keeping exports available to us.", "On the crude dif side, we\u2019ve seen some pretty good swings. Obviously, the Western Canadian market is very discounted. WCS and Hardisty this morning is $34 under Brent. And then I think some of the turnaround activity and cold weather in the Gulf has caused the medium sour market at least in the U.S. Gulf Coast a week in some with asking operating close to 580 off of Brent.", "So, seeing pretty good quality discounts. It doesn't seem to be quite keeping with either the Western Canadian or the medium sour values that we're seeing in the Gulf today.", "In terms of access, we have good pipeline access really for our Houston area refineries where we don't have as good access as to St. Charles. St. Charles has a lot of capability to process Canadian barrels but we don't have a good way to get it there.", "And so, we are starting some barge operations from our Hartford terminal where we\u2019ll barge some heavy Canadian into St. Charles which will start in February.", "Roger Read", "And on the rail side, are you seeing the kind of balking from the rails in the US that we\u2019ve seen out of some of the Canadian rail companies? Thinking of the term contracts here.", "Gary Simmons", "Yeah, so what we're really seeing is just that there's not the availability of locomotives in order to move the trains. So real wide arb and great economics to ship crude by rail, but you don't have the power to move the trains.", "Some of that is the trains have been in grain service and so we see some things that we think could open up some more movements of crude by rail. We're planning to ramp up our volumes through our Lucas terminal to Port Arthur, but so far, it\u2019s been very limited.", "Roger Read", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Gary Simmons", "Thanks, Roger.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. ", "Doug Terreson", "Good morning, everybody.", "Joe Gorder", "Good morning, Doug.", "Doug Terreson", "I wanted to get your updated views on the likely market impact of some of the new environmental regulations that are set for the next few years which seem pretty meaningful to me, meaning between Tier 3 sulfur and IMO 2020, my questions whether you feel the US and global refining industries are making adequate enough investments to satisfy the new rules.", "And then second, how margins for the key products such as the octane sources, fuel oils and crude oil spreads are going to vary. And finally, how Valero\u2019s positioning for these changes. So, there's really three parts. Is the industry ready? Two, what happens to spreads? And, three, how you feel Valero is positioned for these new regulations?", "Lane Riggs", "So, hey, Doug. It\u2019s Lane. Actually, I\u2019m going to start with your last one first.", "Doug Terreson", "Okay.", "Lane Riggs", "Valero is very, very well positioned for certainly IMO. We have a lot of coking capacity and a lot of resid destruction, so we have a lot of pre-investment for that regulation change. And, secondly on that point, the interesting thing about this regulation change is it\u2019s trying to add grassroots capacity in this space of resid destruction.", "It\u2019s very expensive. So, I think you\u2019ll see the industry do what it can to debottleneck existing units in terms of laying out a lot of capital for the big grassroots unit. That\u2019ll remain to be seen. But it is expensive as compared to some of the other profit units.", "And with respect to Tier 3, it\u2019s in our strategic view. Tier 3 is going to destroy a lot of octane. Where we are versus the industry, we think we\u2019re better positioned. We\u2019re only going to -- we\u2019re going to spend -- our total spend in this space is $470 million is where we think we are today.", "We\u2019ve still got about $200 million in front of us. We\u2019ve spent about \u2013 the rest of it is behind us still, but we feel like we\u2019re in a really good position with respect to Tier 3 as well.", "Doug Terreson", "Okay. And you guys want to just make a couple of points on IMO 2020? Or should we wait till we get closer, or?", "Lane Riggs", "Well, in terms of likelihood, or?", "Doug Terreson", "Well, not so much the likelihood. I mean, it feels like it is going to happen, but what do you think it\u2019s that meaningful? And what the key market implications are? Do you have a view there too?", "Lane Riggs", "I\u2019m sorry. So yes. So, I started there. I think absolutely, the fact that we are a heavy coking refinery and resid destruction. Like I said, we are very well positioned for. And that regulation is going to cost 3% to get very displaced in the world.", "Doug Terreson", "Sure.", "Lane Riggs", "I think everyone is trying to figure out exactly how our industry and the shipping industry is going to try to solve this issue, but it will definitely widen as you don\u2019t run 3% and you probably reuse fuels that are a sub 2 distillate.", "You\u2019re going to see that driver, which is the driver for coking and other resid destruction between resid and diesel widen out. And I think that\u2019s the market impact. Gary, you want to add anything on that?", "Gary Simmons", "No, I think that\u2019s\u2026", "Doug Terreson", "Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Joe Gorder", "Thank you, Doug.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Paul Cheng", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "Joe Gorder", "Good morning, Paul.", "Paul Cheng", "Joe, maybe just one to clarify. When you guys are saying that the adjust operating cash flow 40% to 50%, how do you define as just operating cash flow?", "And also, that if in the event the operating cash flow, however way that you decide, is much better than you expected, should we assume the incremental cash will end up that coming to the shareholder, so you will end up that exit that range? Or that it would be used for other purpose like the debt reduction or maybe increasing the organic CapEx?", "Joe Gorder", "You bet.", "Mike Ciskowski", "Yes, Paul. This is Mike on that. How do we define that? Its net cash provided by operating activities on our cash flow statement, and then we back out the working capital impact.", "Paul Cheng", "Okay.", "Lane Riggs", "And then the second part of the question was on, assuming we have additional free cash flow, what are we going to do with it?", "Gary Simmons", "Right. I mean, as Joe talked about in his opening comments, we\u2019re still going to pay out the 40% to 50% as our target, and this increase in discretionary cash flow will just compete with the nondiscretionary.", "Lane Riggs", "Paul, we put in place several years ago that capital allocation framework, and we\u2019ve adhered to it. And I think perhaps the best forecaster for what we\u2019re going to do going forward is our history. We\u2019ll retain enough cash to be sure that we\u2019ve got the liquidity in the business to do the things we want to do.", "And to the extent that we end up with surplus cash, I think it\u2019s a fair bet that we\u2019re not going to sit on it. So, again, I think history probably speaks well to what we would probably do going forward. We\u2019ve been pretty consistent in that now for some time.", "Paul Cheng", "Okay. My second question is, is Diamond at full capacity right now? And that if we\u2019re looking at that, what is the incremental margin to Memphis? And comparing to, say, in the fourth quarter, how much is Diamond that you are running? And also, that whether you can give the same number on 9 to Quebec City in the fourth quarter? And what you expect in the first quarter? ", "Lane Riggs", "Well, you're a magician.", "Paul Cheng", "We try.", "Gary Simmons", "You want to go ahead?", "Lane Riggs", "Yeah. ", "Gary Simmons", "I take the first of those four questions. ", "Lane Riggs", "The Diamond Pipeline started up kind of late-ish November. We had a very good start-up, and the line has run extremely well since coming online. December was our first full month of operation, and in December you're really looking at in terms of the economic benefit is that spread between WTI and LLS.", "In December during our first month of operation, that spread was $5.33 a barrel. January, it remained wide. So, in January, that spread between WTI and LOS averaged $4.18 a barrel. So that kind of gives you an idea of the economic impact that Diamond is having on our system today.", "Line 9 similar with the wide Brent TIR. We're seeing very good economics through line 9 as well. So, I don't have exactly where that spread was in December and January, but on a prompt basis, line 9 barrel beats an alternative by about $1.20 a barrel. ", "Paul Cheng", "But, Gary, do you have that throughput warning that you're shipping from line 9 into Quebec City in the fourth quarter and what you expect in the first quarter?", "Gary Simmons", "So, we don't give guidance on that. We are utilizing our full capacity that we have available to us.", "Paul Cheng", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.", "Doug Leggate", "Thanks. Good morning, everybody.", "Joe Gorder", "Good morning, Doug.", "Doug Leggate", "Joe, I wonder if I can touch on the cash distribution. Obviously, the reset towards cash flow is really giving a lot of clarity to the market, and I think you've been awarded for that.", "But it does mean that you're buying back shares at pretty much the all-time high in stock price whereas the tax cut obviously resets what are the margin is the low point for your cash flow at the bottom of whatever we think the cycle is now.", "So, I guess what I'm really trying to get to is how much is too much of a buyback in terms of do you have a limit as to where you would slow down the buyback and skew back towards a more sustainable dividend? Obviously, you've already done that. I'm just wondering how much further you think that balance has to go? And I've got a follow up, please.", "Joe Gorder", "That's a fair question. Mike, do you want to take a crack at this? ", "Mike Ciskowski", "Yeah, we have increased as we did just recently our dividend. So that will take up a bigger piece of our 40% to 50% of the target. Now, as our taxes is reduced through tax reform, this amount of available cash flow will increase, and it will -- we'll continue to evaluate that through our capital allocation process as Joe talked about. And it will compete with growth investments and M&A and cash returns.", "Joe Gorder", "Doug, when you think about it, I mean, and this has been a consistent question that we received for several years. Are we buying back shares at 50? Is it too high? Are we buying back shares at 60? Is that too high? And here we are we find ourselves kind of in the mid-90s and is that too high.", "Frankly, I think our view would be that we remain undervalued, and the paradigm on independent refining is shifting. We are much more focused certainly Valero is on producing free cash flow and maintaining capital discipline around the use of funds.", "And to the extent that we continue to throw off significant amounts of free cash flow, we're going to have the opportunity to continue to buy back our shares and create higher lows and higher highs in the stock price. ", "So, if you ask me personally, if I think we're overvalued today, I would say the answer is no. And do I think there is upside in the stock price, I'd say yes. And as a result, I think that you should expect that we're going to continue to balance out our payout with repurchases.", "Doug Leggate", "I appreciate the answer. I know it's not an easy one to answer. But I guess we also view that you're kind of shifted to be on S&P 500 yield stock, and I think the dividend for what it's worth probably gets rewarded. But that is our take.", "Anyway, I appreciate you taking the question. My follow-up is we just had the marathon call before you, and Gary made some really interesting comments I thought about the prospects of getting a RIN resolution by the spring. RIN costs for both diesel and biofuel and ethanol have both come down, it seems.", "I'm just wondering if you could share your thoughts. Do you share that kind of optimism on a timeline, and if so, what's your best guess on how it plays out from here? ", "Joe Gorder", "That's a good question. Doug, Jason Fraser is here, and he runs policy and strategic planning. He's been obviously neck-deep in this particular issue, as have I. And we'll let him share some insights on that. ", "Jason Fraser", "Yeah, hi. This is Jason. Things have definitely heated up and received an increased focus here in the past few months, especially with the PDS situation. That dramatically showed how badly the RFS reform is needed. So, let's help shed some light on it.", "We also do have the two efforts going within the Senate now with Senator Cruz trying to get the Midwest senators to sit down and discuss a near term solution for higher RIN prices, and a solution that would also benefit all producers.", "We also have Senator Cloridon who has been working very hard and over a long period of time with stakeholders and other senators to try to come up with long-term legislative reform. ", "So, I didn't hear his comments, so I don't know about his specific Timeline, but there does seem to be more urgency and visibility and effort around this area in the past couple of months. So, we're more optimistic than we have been. Things are looking better. ", "Doug Leggate", "Jason, do you think that's - do you think, Jason, that's the reason why RIN costs have really come off a bit in the last couple months? Or is that more seasonal?", "Joe Gorder", "Gary may have more of a view on the market, but that's got to be something effecting it. There's a risk and there is also the EPS has kind of signaled that they're looking at the smaller refiner exceptions, and there's been a lot of discussion of that.", "If they were to grant those, that could end, not reallocate them to other obligated parties, which is what we think they would do. They would not redistribute that mandate. That would have a negative effect on RIN prices too. So, there are several things floating around. But, Gary, I don't know if Gary has a view beyond that. ", "Gary Simmons", "No, I see it the same way. I think any time you read something in the press on potential regulatory changes, you see people that are hoarding RINs, start dumping them in the market figuring that they may be hoarding RINs that aren't worth much in the future. ", "Doug Leggate", "Appreciate the answers, guys. And, Gary, I guess, Joe, we'll see you and Gary in New York in a couple of weeks\u2019 time. So, thanks for your time. ", "Joe Gorder", "Thank you, Doug.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis with UBS. Your line is now open. ", "Spiro Dounis", "Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just was hoping for comments on the M&A environment for refining assets, specifically here. I think there were a few assets on the block last year and 2016, and it seems like a lot of them got pulled just due to really bid-ask spreads between buyers and sellers.", "Curious if you're seeing that as still the case? And does your renewed optimism on the refining outlook and tax reform change any of the calculus on valuation for you? ", "Mike Ciskowski", "Okay. Yeah, this is Mike. Tax reform does change the economics a little bit on the M&A. We would have the ability to deduct a purchase price of the PP&E in year one. And so, we are in the process of updating our analysis on various potential targets. ", "Joe Gorder", "But I don't know of anything in the marketplace today that is really for sale, or that's of interest. So, and you're right. I think the bid-ask spreads not only on refining assets, but on logistics assets also, it's been pretty broad. And as you guys know, we tend to take a look at everything that is out in the market, and then we have a target list of things that we particularly track that we'd be interested in.", "And it just hasn't come together in a way that has allowed us to execute something that we would be pleased with. So, we'll continue to watch it, but there's just nothing there right now. ", "Spiro Dounis", "Got it. Got it. And then just on Mexico, I was wondering if you could update us on the progress of the project there? How it's progressing? And maybe along that line I believe that project was kind of a stepping stone for you into Latin America, and so I guess when do you think you would be able to expand on that position? ", "Rich Lashway", "This is Rich here. The facilities are in the progress of acquiring the land for the inland terminals, and their crews should be handed over to who is going to be doing the construction for us here in early February.", "We expect that all of the facilities would be up and running in the first quarter of 2019. That's kind of on the operational side. Maybe Gary wants to share a little bit on the marketing side. ", "Gary Simmons", "Yeah, so I think for us you'll see the ramp-up in penetration into the wholesale market after the terminal comes on. And, yes, we are looking at a lot of different opportunities in Mexico and South America. And we don't really have anything to communicate on that at this time. ", "Spiro Dounis", "Understood. Appreciate the color. Thanks, everyone.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC. Your line is now open.", "Brad Heffern", "Good morning, everyone.", "Joe Gorder", "Good morning, Brad.", "Brad Heffern", "Just a question on the new Alki project and the old Alki project, I guess. I mean, so now your two marquee CapEx projects are both Alki, and a lot of your peers have been more focused on the distillate side of the barrel. So, what\u2019s the thesis there?", "Is this the Tier 3 octane destruction, like you talked about? Or is it just octane demand increasing over time? What makes you pursue that side of things?", "Lane Riggs", "Okay. So, Brent, this is Lane. So, you hit up on the first part of it. We\u2019re optimistic about the requirements in the industry to meet octane for gasoline, and it\u2019s obviously two things are happening there. One is tier 3 is destroying octane.", "Two, the autos, their trajectory is to require more octane that helps them with their emissions compliance. The other part of that is we\u2019re just, we have a view that NGLs are going to be long, and that\u2019s all a function of the shell play that\u2019s out there. You have all these export facilities, so even as a floor you\u2019re going to have NGL exports to the world. That\u2019s a little different position.", "So, at the end of the day, it really is sort of a butane to high octane gasoline spread that we\u2019re bullish on. And we think both these projects fit into that strategic view.", "Brad Heffern", "And then our position on diesel, Lane? Gary?", "Gary Simmons", "Well, the way I feel, with diesel, we\u2019ve have made big investments to make diesel. We\u2019ve built two big hydrocrackers, if you remember. And we sort of \u2013 and that was the similar view. It was our NG. It was basically our gas to liquids viewpoint, cheap natural gas a function of shell play making diesel, which is really the world fuel.", "We\u2019ve invested a lot of money in that area, and so we aren\u2019t really \u2013 going forward, that\u2019s not really what we\u2019re focusing. We\u2019re not focusing on trying to make more diesel unless it\u2019s your construction.", "Brad Heffern", "Okay. Got it. Thanks for that. And then shifting to California, it\u2019s seeming more likely that the QMD out there if they don\u2019t ban hydrofluoric acid there\u2019s going to be a lot of mitigation procedures required. How are you guys thinking about the potential CapEx spend at Wilmington? And how likely you are to pursue that as an avenue?", "Mike Ciskowski", "Well, we absolutely are. We feel pretty good that all stakeholders are working out there to find the right viable solution for how to mitigate HF in that area. And we are working with the South Coast to get there.", "And we obviously, depending on how that all works out, we either will or won\u2019t make the right investment, the total investment to meet that to comply. But we\u2019re very optimistic that everybody involved will get to the right place.", "Brad Heffern", "Okay. Thanks all.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez with Scotia Howard Weil. Your line is now open.", "Blake Fernandez", "Hey, guys. Good morning. Sticking on the West Coast theme, the margins really collapsed into the second half of the quarter, and maybe this is a question for Gary, but I\u2019m just curious if you have any thoughts on what was driving that.", "It seemed relative to the rest of the country. It was significantly weaker. I know Torrance was back up and running, but any other thoughts on that?", "Joe Gorder", "Yes, Blake. I think historically you see that weakness in the West Coast in the fourth quarter. This was a little more severe than what we generally see. I think you touched on some of it. Refinery utilization was high. You were in high RVT season, so you had butane kind of swelling the gasoline pool.", "And then a little bit softer demand with some of the weather issues on the West Coast. I think all that drove to the weakness that you\u2019ve seen. Moving forward, we have a little bit of turnaround activity going on.", "And then already in Los Angeles, we switched to summer grade gasoline. The Bay will go to summer grade in another couple of weeks, which will help slow supply into the market and start to bring inventories back into balance.", "Blake Fernandez", "Great. Okay. Thanks. And then this may be a question for Mike, but on the tax reform, obviously given that you have some European operations, I was just curious given the $5 billion of cash, should we be thinking about any impacts as far as repatriation and any benefits on that?", "Joe Gorder", "Yes. We do have some cash, both in Canada and the UK, and we could bring that back if we need to. But our cash position here in the U.S. is adequate, and so we don\u2019t need to bring it back at this time.", "Blake Fernandez", "Got it. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Justin Jenkins with Raymond James. Your line is now open.", "Justin Jenkins", "Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I guess, Joe, I\u2019m sorry to beat a dead horse here as I think you\u2019ve been pretty clear about capital allocation, but I\u2019m curious if the lower tax rate affects anything as it relates to strategy for VLP, whether it\u2019s drop-downs or the mix of growth spending? Any thoughts here?", "Lane Riggs", "Mike, you or, Rich, you want to talk to it? Or Donna?", "Joe Gorder", "Yes, go ahead. Or on the drop-down, I mean, are you \u2013 I guess it remains to be seen how that \u2013 the tax reform, obviously, it just happened in December, and how that\u2019s going to affect the drop-down activity. The multiples are market-related, and so we just don\u2019t know for sure how tax reform will affect those multiples.", "Lane Riggs", "Well, Mike, and then if you\u2019re doing a drop-down, you\u2019ve got a related-party transaction. And is the treatment on that different than an acquisition from a third party?", "Donna Titzman", "If you\u2019re talking about full extension?", "Lane Riggs", "Yes.", "Donna Titzman", "Yes. So normally from a drop perspective, you need expenses would not be allowed because Valero and VLP are related parties. In regards to third-party acquisitions, VLP would likely not elect that because it does create some significant fluctuations from year to year in the allocation or calculation of remedial income to the public unit holders.", "So, bonus depreciation has been available for many years and yet, generally, MLPs do not \u2013 have not chosen to take that. I\u2019m not sure if that answers your question, but.", "Justin Jenkins", "No, that\u2019s perfect. I appreciate that. And then maybe just shifting gears here, following up on Roger\u2019s question on access to the Canadian crude, can you talk about the pipeline projects that are in the queue? I\u2019m thinking along the lines of Keystone XL. And then how that might fit into VLO\u2019s overall strategy?", "Lane Riggs", "Yes, so obviously we were big backers of Keystone XL and believe it\u2019s a great project as it kind of brings that heavy Western Canadian oil to the high complexity U.S. Gulf Coast refining system, and direct access to our Port Arthur refinery, so we\u2019re excited that that project\u2019s moving forward, and it will certainly improve our access to the growing production in Western Canada.", "Justin Jenkins", "Perfect. Thanks, guys. I\u2019ll leave it there.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Low with Redburn. Your line is now open.", "Peter Low", "Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two, please. The first is just on your West Coast operations. Do you see any synergies there between those refineries and the rest of the portfolio? And would you ever consider in the future to just exit that region?", "And then, secondly, just can you provide an update on your proposed doubling of capacity of Diamond Green Diesel? I\u2019d be interested to understand what Valero\u2019s primary motivation is with DGD? Is it the returns the project makes on its own right? Or rather that it can help mitigate your own biofuel blending costs? Thanks.", "Lane Riggs", "All right. Peter. Well on the West Coast, I mean, there\u2019s some synergies, but largely limited synergies I would say between the West Coast and the rest of the Valero system. That being said, it\u2019s a good operation. We have good management and it is a great option on strong West Coast margins when we experience them.", "So, it\u2019s part of our portfolio, it cash flows, and so we don\u2019t have any interest to divest ourselves of it. Now, as far as DGD, Martin, do you want to\u2026", "Lane Riggs", "Yes, on Diamond Green, we have a project underway to go from 160 million gallons a year to 275 million gallons a year. That will start up in the third quarter. We\u2019ve also talked about a second expansion from 275 to 550.", "That final investment decision will be made in 2018 and it will stand on its own rights. We\u2019ve looked at that as the JV, and we look at the cash that that throws off and decide what we\u2019re going to do. So that\u2019s how we\u2019ll decide there.", "Peter Low", "Thanks.", "Lane Riggs", "Thanks, Peter.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Phil Gresh", "Yes. Good morning. Just a clarification on the tax reform; you gave the 22% effective rate. Was curious if there was additional savings you\u2019d expect from the bonus depreciation benefits, et cetera, from a cash basis? Whether a percentage basis or $1.00 basis? How you think about it? ", "Joe Gorder", "Okay. Yeah, on the reform. What we did was we pro-formed our 2017 results, and we had $3.2 billion of pretax income. We wanted to determine the change in our tax provision as well as the cash taxes, so we assumed that all available capital in 2017 was available for full expensing. ", "So, in regard to our income statement, the tax provision would be lower by approximately $230 million or $0.50 per share. On the cash side, our cash taxes, our U.S. cash taxes would decrease by approximately $400 million based on those assumptions. And then when you include the repatriation tax to transition to the Territorial system, the savings would be $350 million.", "Phil Gresh", "Okay. So just to clarify. If we're looking at your CFO year-over-year, it would be the $350 million number. ", "Joe Gorder", "That would be correct. ", "Phil Gresh", "Okay. Great. Thanks. Second question is just on the OpEx. In the fourth quarter, you came in well below your expectations, and then in the first quarter your guidance is quite a bit higher. I mean, is that just simply nat gas cost and throughput? Or anything else that would stick out in terms of why you were so much better in the fourth quarter and the slip in 1Q? ", "It's Philip Lane. Primarily the difference between our turnaround activity from fourth to first quarter. ", "Phil Gresh", "Okay. Got it. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. ", "Paul Sankey", "Good morning, all. ", "Joe Gorder", "Good morning, Paul.", "Paul Sankey", "Back to the dead horse, I'm afraid, Joe. I'm just wondering if you can revisit the possibility of paying down debts. I know there's possibly the argument that it would lower your cost of capital and keep your multiple expanding, which it seems to be doing.", "And I guess that follows into the second part of my question, which is to where do you think we are relative to mid-cycle. I kind of think that's the answer on whether or not you should be thinking about doing more debt paydown and maybe less buyback. Thank you. ", "Joe Gorder", "Okay, Paul. So, you want to start with the second part of this first? ", "Lane Riggs", "Yeah, so I think, in terms of where we are relative to mid-cycle. When you start the year 30 million barrels below on distillate inventory, the distillate market looks very strong. And I think where we have been relative to mid-cycle, we've been below mid-cycle largely because the diesel cracks have been softer.", "I think you'll see significant strengthening in the diesel cracks, and you'll begin to pull above mid-cycle margins as we move through the year. ", "Joe Gorder", "And, Mike? Do you want to talk about debt? ", "Mike Ciskowski", "I guess on the debt we're at 23 percent debt-to-cap which is the low end of our range. And so, we don't have a lot of maturities upcoming. None so far in 2018. And so, I guess I just really hadn't thought much about paying debt down at this time. ", "Paul Sankey", "That's very clear, guys. Can I just go back to the mid-cycle? Sorry, were you saying that you think we're above mid-cycle right now?", "Joe Gorder", "I think we have been below mid-cycle, but you'll start to transition to a period where we'll be above mid-cycle moving forward. ", "Paul Sankey", "Yeah, okay. As I said, it's kind of a follow up. Thanks very much, guys.", "Joe Gorder", "Thanks, Paul.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley. Your line Your line is now open. ", "Joe Gorder", "Benny, are you there? ", "Benny Wong", "Hi, guys. Sorry about that. Just figuring out how to use the phone still, I guess. Hi, guys. Hi, Joe. ", "Joe Gorder", "Hey.", "Benny Wong", "Quick question for you. I guess this is more on the regulatory front, so this might be for Jason here. Just in regards to the CAFE standards that are coming up to going through the mid-term review. I think you're expected to have an outcome in April. Just wondering if there is any thoughts of anything you guys are looking for coming out of that?", "And if you see any efforts - if there are any efforts to roll back efficiencies, would that be held up if California doesn't want to get on side?", "Jason Fraser", "Okay. This is Jason. We're of course happy that Trump has reopened that midterm evaluation. The EPA I think is going to meet that April 1st deadline. The administrator is very firm on meeting these obligations. So, we think there is obligation to lay in it.", "We understand they've been having productive conversations with Memphis and California. Everyone would prefer to have one national program. All those certainly prefer that. And I think the EPA's trying to work with what they can. We did see -- it looked like the majority of the autos had used credits from past years to meet the EPA standard for 2016.", "So that tells you that this is something that definitely needs to be looked at, these ever-increasing numbers. If we're starting to have trouble at 2016, I believe the EPA said that they would have enough credits to keep themselves open until 2021.", "So, we're hoping this process will end with some levelling off of the standards as a reasonable number, but the market allows you to sell cars that people actually want and is sustainable.", "Joe Gorder", "Well, it's encouraging that they're allowing the midterm review to be completed. I mean, the previous administration aborted the process kind of in mid-stream and the fact that you're reassessing it, it shows that the autos are doing a good job of communicating their situation to the EPA and the other regulatory bodies.", "So, it will be interesting to see what happens. And this conversation on CAFE dovetails into the conversation around octane and the comments that Blake made earlier. So, it's an issue that needs to be resolved, and it needs to be resolved in a reasonable way unless we're going to start dictating to US consumers what it is that they can buy.", "Benny Wong", "Great. Appreciate the color. And just in regards to the Appalachian unit, just wondering how much did the new tax environment impact that decision, if any? And if there's any projects in your portfolio that maybe weren't that attractive before that may be a little more interesting now in the new environment?", "Joe Gorder", "So, the octane, it wasn't like it was on the fence with respect to our hurdle rates. Again, we use hurdle rates primarily as a way to focus the organization on - we first start with a strategic view and then we look at these projects in the context of our strategic view, and we use these hurdle rates to kind of get us to ensure that we at least minimize our commodity risk involved.", "So that's the long answer to say, no, the tax regulation didn't change how we were going to think about the Appalachian unit. And that same answer sort of pertains to how we view strategic investment in general.", "So, it remains to be seen. I'm not - I think, again, we've said time and time again we'll use our free cash flow to go through our asset allocation model and we'll just see how it all works out.", "Benny Wong", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Joe Gorder", "Thanks, Benny.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Neil with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Neil Mehta", "Good morning, team.", "Joe Gorder", "Hi, Neil.", "Neil Mehta", "Hey, Joe. A question - and again, I asked you this a couple weeks ago but I'm still trying to get my head around it. I'm trying to figure out what the new normal is for Brent WTI. Now, obviously it's a fluid number and we'll blow through it on the way up and the way down, but we try to frame these things in terms of transportation economics usually.", "So how do you guys think about, when you think about the outcomes for like a normalized Brent WTI spread, what are the lags from an economic standpoint that kind of frame what you guys think of as a new normal?", "Gary Simmons", "Hey, Neil. This is Gary. The way we look at it is that with incremental production coming online in the Permian and in the Cushing region, you're beginning to push the logistics assets getting to the Gulf. And so, you're really looking at a spot or walk up tariff which, today, is $3.00 to $3.50 to get to the Gulf.", "And then a Cushing barrel, or a DSW barrel, when it gets to the Gulf generally has about $1.00 quality differential. So that moves you from this $3.00 to $4.00, $4.50 and then you have about another $0.50 to get it on the water. So, we kind of viewed it anywhere in this $4.50 to $5.00 range is kind of what we believe is a sustainable Brent TI spread.", "Neil Mehta", "Yeah, we were getting to a similar outcome. One question we had was around just once you get to the water, are there any limitations around crude export capacity or constraints just logistically? Just curious as people who are doing it whether you see any, especially if the US continues to grow at this pace over the next couple of years, do we run into a wall at some point?", "Joe Gorder", "Well, we may at some point. I don't think we feel like the logistics are limiting today. What you do see, even with the ARP where it is today, you start to see people charge higher and higher premiums for dock access. So today that $0.50 number I quoted is more like $0.90 cents if you want to get to the water as people see the wide ARPs.", "Neil Mehta", "Thanks, guys.", "Joe Gorder", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line Chi Chow with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open.", "Chi Chow", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Joe Gorder", "Hi, Chi.", "Chi Chow", "Hi. Regarding product export, it looks like you guys are still going pretty strong in the fourth quarter there. But do you see any risk ahead out of the Gulf Coast?", "For instance, do you expect the market to change at all with reports of PMX really progressing on sorting out its own operations?", "Gary Simmons", "Chi, this is Gary. I don't think we see anything that's significantly different in terms of Mexico or South America. One, we think it's going to take PMX longer to get the improvement in refinery utilization than the numbers that they're quoting but then you're also seeing good demand growth.", "So even if refinery utilization improves, we think that demand growth will outweigh that improvement refinery utilization and we'll still see strong export demand into those regions.", "Chi Chow", "Okay. Great. Thanks, Gary. And then on the Mexico strategy, a couple questions. What's the term on the agreements you have with IEnova on the three terminals and also for Fairmax on the rail services?", "Joe Gorder", "It's 20 years on the Fairmax and it's less than that on the IEnova so it's half that. We have the option to extend these contracts. ", "Chi Chow", "Okay. Great. And do you see any risk to the momentum on energy reform down there on what might transpire from the upcoming presidential election?", "Joe Gorder", "Yeah, I mean, we're watching it pretty carefully. We don't know any better than anybody else what might be the potential outcome of their election. I did read, though, this morning that there hasn't been a direct statement by the opposition party that they would undo the reforms and if there was an attempt to try to do that, it would be very difficult to execute. So, Jason, do you have any other color on that?", "Jason Fraser", "That's right, Joe. The elections are coming up July 1. It is a big election in Mexico. The concern you see voiced most is about Mr. Lopez Obrador's views on energy reforms, the policies in favor of them.", "And we have always been told it's very, very hard to undo these now that they're in place. It's basically does change their constitution. And we think people - and there was a lot of short-term pain when this first started getting rolled out, but we are confident people will figure out this is really the best long-term interest of the Mexican economy that he's going to prevail.", "Chi Chow", "Do you think Lopez's comments are just campaign rhetoric or do they actually believe some of the statements he's put out there?", "Jason Fraser", "Gee, we don't know.", "Joe Gorder", "It's hard to tell.", "Jason Fraser", "We don't know.", "Chi Chow", "Okay. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it.", "Joe Gorder", "Thanks, Chi.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kristina Kazarian with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Kristina Kazarian", "Hi, guys.", "Joe Gorder", "Morning.", "Kristina Kazarian", "A number of the pipeline companies have talked about building pipes from Permian to Corpus. Could you maybe talk about your thoughts about potentially committing to long-term capacity on a pipe like this given your refining footprint now in the Gulf Coast and maybe even potentially partnering with one of those companies to take an ownership stake in one of those pipes and how you think about something like that?", "Joe Gorder", "Sure. Kristina, this is Rich. Currently, there's a lot of open season projects going on right now Epic and, Buckeye and Magellan have got projects going on from the Permian to Corpus or to Houston.", "We don't have any binding commitments with anybody. I mean you know us we're always looking at logistics opportunities that can reduce our secondary cost or provide third-party revenues, but it's interesting. But we're not committed to anything.", "Kristina Kazarian", "Okay. And does that mean lack of interest at this point or just haven't decided on since there are so many options?", "Joe Gorder", "There's a lot of options, and we're just - we're looking at them. The good news is, right, that's just going to mean there's more crude coming into Corpus for the Corpus refinery. So that's always a good thing when there's excess pipeline capacity coming into the markets where we can grow our refining capacity.", "Jason Fraser", "Well, there's not a lack of interest on our part.", "Joe Gorder", "Right.", "Jason Fraser", "I mean, you just evaluate your options against the other options and what benefit it brings to not only DLP but also to Valero Energy, so we'll continue to look at them. But I think Rich's point is we're looking at them, but we haven't made any commitments today.", "Kristina Kazarian", "Okay. And then a longer term one maybe on the other side of some of the questions you guys asked earlier around M&A, with a lot more capital in the refining space, do you think there is chance that you see other bidders out there in the market that might make you guys think about potentially considering selling some noncore assets, if you were to get increased interest across the space?", "Jason Fraser", "Well, we don\u2019t have any noncore assets. Okay? So that\u2019s the first part of that. I would say you may see more M&A activity as a result of this, but we also talked earlier about bid-ask spreads being very high. I would suspect that it wouldn\u2019t take long for a seller to figure out that he could extract a premium, based on everyone\u2019s new situation under tax reform. And so, the prices will adjust.", "So, we can probably work ourselves into a thesis that said there\u2019s going to be a lot more activity, but buyers and sellers are both aware of the same facts, and so I don\u2019t know that a whole lot\u2019s going to change at the end of the day.", "Kristina Kazarian", "All right. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Ryan Todd", "Good. Thanks, guys. Maybe a couple quick specific ones. Can you share your thoughts on what you think the status is of the biofuel tax credit extension? Whether you made any assumption on its inclusion or exclusion in your numbers? And whether it would offer upside to the $350 million pro forma or theoretical tax savings for 2017?", "Joe Gorder", "Jason, you or Martin want to talk about it?", "Jason Fraser", "Yes. He\u2019s just saying it would create upside. Are we going to get it? And would it create upside.", "Gary Simmons", "Yeah, I mean, we do think the legislation that would bring the blended tax credit out has just been called up and delayed in the government funding immigration situation. We do expect it to be passed retroactive for 2017 and extended through 2018. At the end of the day, it's just got caught up in all the Washington drama right now.", "We don't think it's going to get changed to a producer\u2019s tax credit. That may be something that\u2019s revisited going forward, but everybody involved seems to see with everything going on. They just need to try to keep the current wall and get that passed for these two years and look at talking about subsequently changing it on out into 2019. So, we think it's going to happen. It's just a question of when.", "Ryan Todd", "And then its value to us?", "Joe Gorder", "It\u2019s of significant value to us for the JV. It\u2019s $1.00 a gallon retroactive, right? So, it\u2019s $160 million. So, it\u2019s significant.", "Ryan Todd", "Okay. Thanks. And then maybe one other specific one. There\u2019s been quite a bit of recent weakness in fuel oil spreads, particularly on the high sulfur fuel oil spreads recently even above and beyond what I guess we would expect seasonally.", "Can you speak to the way you think the drivers is of that? Is it a function of fundamentals? Is it a front-running of the IMO trade? Or too early for that? Or any thoughts around that? And then your potential to potentially capitalize on lower feed stock costs?", "Joe Gorder", "Yes, I think it\u2019s probably too early for any of the IMO impact to be seen in the market. I think what you\u2019re seeing, though, is globally countries are beginning to put in infrastructure to able to import LNG, and then they ban the burning of high sulfur fuel for power generation.", "And so, you\u2019ve seen that transpire in a couple countries, and as those countries roll off and stop consuming fuel, you see weakness in the markets. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen recently happen in the market.", "Ryan Todd", "Okay. Thanks. And is this something you can capitalize on within the portfolio? Or relatively insignificant in the scheme of things?", "Joe Gorder", "No, it very much is. High sulfur fuel oil has a significant input, impact on the heavy sour crude prices. And so as high sulfur fuel gets discounted, we generally see wider quality discounts which benefit us greatly.", "Ryan Todd", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Joe Gorder", "Thanks, Ryan.", "Operator", "Thank you. And that does conclude Q&A for today. I\u2019d like to return the call to Mr. John Locke for any closing remarks.", "John Locke", "Okay. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call. If you have any additional questions or didn\u2019t get a chance to ask, please just give us a call at the Investor Relations team.
