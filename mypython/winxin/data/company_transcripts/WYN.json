(NYSE:WYN) Q4 2016 Earnings Call February 15, 2017  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Margo C. Happer - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Analysts", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC", "David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Dan Wasiolek - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "Operator", "Welcome to the Wyndham Worldwide Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. I will now turn the call over to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Margo C. Happer - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO, and Tom Conforti, our CFO. Before we get started, I want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K filed February 12, 2016 with the SEC.", "We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. Corresponding GAAP measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP are provided in the press release and the tables to the press release, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at wyndhamworldwide.com. Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thanks, Margo. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. I'm going to start by discussing some 2016 highlights and our expectations for 2017, and then Tom will provide you more detail on the quarter and our guidance for this year.", "As you saw from our release, 2016 was a solid year for our company with earnings growth and free cash flow generation both in line with our commitments. These results reflect strong execution, careful expense management and continued disciplined capital allocation, offsetting higher loan losses and unfavorable foreign exchange rates.", "Based on our performance, our long-term growth prospects and our consistent free cash flow, our board of directors has approved a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend to a targeted annual payout of $2.32 per share.", "Regarding our outlook for 2017, we expect EBITDA growth of approximately 3% to 5%. Our long-term goal for the compound annual EBITDA growth remain 6% to 8%. However, we expect 2017 to be below that range, primarily reflecting flat to modest EBITDA growth at Wyndham Vacation Ownership for the following reasons: First, we plan to aggressively accelerate new owner growth this year. New owner sales are lower margin than upgrade sales, but critical to the long-term health of the business. Each new owner yields an estimated $20,000 in lifetime EBITDA, including finance income and resort management fees, creating long-term growth with some of annuity-like components.", "Second, we offset unanticipated increase in loan loss provision this year, with reductions in variable compensation, which creates a $30 million cost headwind companywide in 2017, largely at Wyndham Vacation Ownership. It is worth noting that absent this headwind, we would be within our target growth range in 2017.", "Finally, we're modeling a higher provision for loan loss, based on a higher percentage of sales financed and continued pressure from defaults. For the past six years, our compounded EBITDA growth rate is over 8%. I am confident, we will return to our 6% to 8% EBITDA growth target in 2018 and the confidence for that in 2018 and beyond is based on the following: First, our Hotel Group has significant opportunities despite a lower growth RevPAR environment. We opened over 60,000 rooms and grew our Hotel portfolio to over 8,000 hotels in 2016. That's nearly 2 hotel openings every day. Our pipeline increased 16% to over 138,000 rooms. We opened hotels in six new countries, bringing our total country count to 77 and creating a great platform for long-term growth.", "We're improving the overall quality of our system. We continue to terminate rooms that fall below our standards and we're adding higher quality hotels. Customers are seeing it and owners are seeing it. This shows up in our customer surveys, TripAdvisor scores and J.D. Power scores, which showed strong regional and brand gains in 2016.", "Rounding out our hotel transformation and future growth is our investment in technology platforms. Our new cloud-based property management system, coupled with revenue management and new cloud-based reservation system will make our franchisees more profitable, supporting their bottom-line and our value proposition.", "The second reason I am confident in the future growth is our improved top rated industry leading Wyndham Rewards loyalty program. This touches all of our businesses. Wyndham Rewards is the best hotel rewards program as ranked by U.S. News and World reports. Engaged loyalty members stay more and spend more. We added nearly 5 million members to this program last year. It's not just the frequent guest program; Wyndham Rewards gives us tremendous cross business potential. This past year, Wyndham Rewards became the first loyalty program to include Vacation Ownership and Vacation Rentals properties. Wyndham Rewards members now have close to 30,000 redemption options and the opportunity is significant, who else but Wyndham can give you over 120,000 places to stay around the world. The third reason for my confidence is Wyndham Destination Network, which had a great fourth quarter and full year and is perfectly positioned for the rise in the experiential traveler.", "Through our network, we offer Vacation properties to a growing group of travelers who are seeking unique accommodations from a company they trust. Last year, we sent nearly 14 million people on vacations of their dreams. In 2016, we increased the size of our network by over 8%. We had a 9,000 Vacation Rental Properties; we expanded RCI, our Vacation Exchange Network by adding 76 Vacation Ownership affiliates and a 171 Vacation Ownership Resorts. We now have over a 121,000 properties in over a 110 countries across six continents.", "In 2017 Wyndham Destination Network will continue to invest in distribution technology, accelerate the integration of our Wyndham Rewards Program, increase the utilization of cross-branded inventory and continue the development of next generation of RCI ensuring continued growth well into the future. Our Destination Network helps set Wyndham worldwide apart as an integrated hospitality company with one of the most diverse portfolios in the world.", "The fourth reason I'm confident in our future is that we are recharging our Wyndham Vacation Ownership business, which is already an absolute powerhouse. Let me put that into perspective. While the business had some challenges in 2016, gross VOI revenue exceeded $2 billion. That's a first for any developer in the history of the timeshare industry and double the size of our nearest competitor. We opened 6 new resorts bringing the total number to 219 across 32 U.S. states and 7 countries. We conducted over 800,000 timeshare tours through a 113 sales sites sourced primarily through top guests, our community marketing programs, and alliance partners. These efforts helped us bring roughly 33,000 new owners into the system, an increase of 10% over 2015 and close to 25% of those consumers were under the age of 40. So, we know that timeshare product has broad appeal.", "As you know in November, we announced Franz Hanning's departure. Franz was instrumental in building Wyndham Vacation Ownership into the four cities to-date and we thank him for his 34 years of success. We are making great progress in our search for the new leader of this business. During the search process, I've been serving as interim CEO. I'm more excited than ever by the opportunities I see in Vacation Ownership. As I mentioned earlier, our primary focus this year will be on dramatically accelerating new owner growth to ensure long-term success of this business.", "Our goal is to bring over 40,500 new owners into the system this year. That's a 23% increase from 2016. As I mentioned earlier, these owners contribute great long-term EBITDA beyond sales, including financing income, which will support higher EBITDA growth in 2018 and beyond.", "We'll focus on key markets such as New York and Chicago and we have some exciting plans for new centers as well. We recently opened a mixed-use resort in Clearwater Beach, Florida and have signed an agreement in Austin, Texas, an urban market highly desired by our owners.", "Earlier I mentioned the cross business potential of Wyndham Rewards. This is especially compelling as it relates to Vacation Ownership. We believe that the majority of new owner tours at our hotel branded timeshare competitors are sourced through their hotel loyalty and related channels. We are underachieving in this area and are focused on connecting our Hotel and Vacation Ownership brands through Wyndham Rewards and other hotel channels. This is a great growth opportunity for us.", "So, to sum up, we expect to make real progress on our many growth initiatives in 2017. Our unmatched distribution at every price point makes Wyndham Worldwide unique in the hospitality industry, with a focus on asset-light fee-for-service business models, our suite of brands that have grown into category leaders; we are making bold moves today to meet the needs of tomorrow's travelers.", "Simply put, we aim to make travel more accessible to more people to travel to more places than any other hospitality company in the world. Wyndham Worldwide is beginning its second decade embracing the needs of the everyday travelers like no one else.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom to walk you through more details on the quarter results and what we expect in 2017. Tom?", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everybody. As Steve noted, 2016 was a solid year for Wyndham Worldwide. Adjusted EBITDA increased 6% over the prior year or 7% excluding the impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions, consistent with our long-term compounded annual growth rate target of 6% to 8%.", "Our overall fourth quarter financial performance was in line with our estimates as well, with adjusted EBITDA increasing 16%. For the year, we generated $782 million of free cash flow, which included a reduction of $48 million in operating cash flow related to foreign exchange. This was up from $769 million in 2015.", "In addition, our plan to modestly lower down payment targets to creditworthy timeshare customers reduced free cash flow by another $55 million. However, it's a very short-term use of cash. Let me remind you why. First, the loans are monetized in a conduit facility shortly after origination at an advance rate of approximately 60% and then several months later placed into a term securitization, effectively monetizing the receivables at about a 90% rate. This monetization takes place outside of our definition of free cash flow. Our public company timeshare peers include the securitization proceeds in their definition of free cash flow.", "During the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of stock for $150 million. We reduced our weighted average share count by 7% year-over-year. In addition, we've repurchased 956,000 shares for $75 million so far in the first quarter of 2017. We have a long track record of returning cash to shareholders. Since our spinoff a little more than 10 years ago, we've reduced our diluted share count by 48% by repurchasing 113 million shares for $5.1 billion at an average price point of $45.47.", "Now, let's take a look at the fourth quarter performance of each of our business units. At our Hotel Group, revenues increased 1% and adjusted EBITDA increased 8% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting higher franchisees and growth in Wyndham Rewards credit card program. Growth in revenues was offset by the loss of pass-through revenues from two managed hotels that are no longer in our system.", "Systemwide global RevPAR increased 2.7% in constant currency and on a same-store basis in quarter four, reflecting modest growth in most major international regions, and a 110 basis point unfavorable impact from domestic and Canadian oil markets.", "Domestic RevPAR increased 2.9%, reflecting both higher room rates and higher occupancy. Performance was particularly strong in the South Atlantic region, due in part to Hurricane Matthew, offset by an 8% decline in oil producing regions. Excluding these oil regions, domestic RevPAR grew 3.7%. It's worth noting that we saw continued improvement in the oil regions throughout 2016, which started down 28% in the first quarter.", "Net system size grew 2.9% year-over-year, as we continue to manage net growth against our goal of improving the overall quality of our system by adding higher quality rooms and terminating substandard properties. Room growth is supported by a development pipeline of over 138,000 rooms. That's a 16% increase against 2015.", "Now moving on to Destination Network which ended a strong year with a solid fourth quarter. On a currency-neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, revenues increased 3% and adjusted EBITDA increased by $9 million to $52 million.", "In addition to strong top line growth in vacation rentals, adjusted EBITDA benefited from lower expenses, and the recovery of legal costs primarily incurred earlier in 2016. At RCI, exchange revenues increased 1% in constant currency, reflecting modest increases in revenue per member and average number of members, which benefited from continued growth in the Americas.", "Vacation rentals revenue for the quarter increased 5% in constant currency and excluding acquisitions. A 5.3% increase in transaction volume reflected continued benefits from our dynamic pricing initiative, which typically results in higher occupancy from more efficient pricing, especially during off-peak travel weeks. Transactions also benefited from capacity increases as our brands continue to expand both in existing and new markets. Transaction and unit growth was strongest in our UK-based Hoseasons and Denmark-based Novasol brands. Average net price per rental was flat.", "At our Vacation Ownership business, total revenues for the fourth quarter were flat and adjusted EBITDA increased 10%, reflecting lower costs due to expense management and reductions in variable compensation.", "Gross VOI sales were flat reflecting the closure of four sales offices due to our previously discussed restructuring efforts and the temporary closure of 14 sales offices due to Hurricane Matthew. Results reflected a 0.4% increase in VPG, offset by a 1.5% decrease in tour flow. VPG growth was adversely affected by sales mix with proportionally higher sales to new owners. As Steve mentioned, growing new owners is priority number one for our timeshare growth strategy, but these sales generate lower VPG than upgrade sales. As it relates to tours, tour flow would have been up approximately 1.5% if not for the closed sites that I just mentioned.", "The number of new owners increased 8% in the fourth quarter and 10% for the full-year 2016 to nearly 33,000 new owners. The provision for loan loss was $86 million, an increase of $22 million, but that was in line with our expectations. Defaults increased $18 million to $84 million, also in line with our expectations.", "Corporate expenses declined $13 million due to expense management initiatives including a reduction in variable compensation. Net interest expense declined by $3 million. Although our overall debt levels were approximately $300 million higher, as planned, proportionately more of our borrowings were through our lower cost commercial paper and term loan facilities. Depreciation increased $4 million as expected, resulting from new long-term technology projects coming into service.", "Now, let's turn our look to 2017 and to review guidance. We're going to post our full guidance details to Investor Relations website following the call. We expect revenue and EBITDA of $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion and $1.41 billion to $1.44 billion respectively. As usual, we're most comfortable with the midpoint of the ranges. We acknowledge that the implied 3% to 5% EBITDA growth range is below our 6% to 8% long-term compounded annual growth rate target but we believe this to be a one-year event for the reasons that Steve touched on earlier.", "We expect to return to our target growth rate range in 2018, as we will lap the variable compensation headwind. In addition, the timeshare business is expected to benefit from the new owner strategy and interest income increases from higher financings. The Hotel business is expected to benefit from improved system quality, branding initiatives and technology platforms that will be completed this year. And the Destination Network business will benefit from continued strong momentum in our Rentals business.", "Today's guidance is based on foreign exchange rates as of the end of January 2017. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.90 to $6.10. This is based on a diluted share count of 108 million shares, which per our standard guidance practice assumes no share buybacks in 2017. I would note that many analyst models do include some level of share buybacks.", "We expect depreciation and amortization of $263 million to $268 million. That's up approximately 6% over the prior year as additional capitalized technology projects come online. Many of these projects had long build-out periods and were held on our balance sheet until completion. We expect this spike in our depreciation growth rate to be a 2017 event with more normalized growth in 2018 and beyond.", "We expect net interest expense of $134 million to $138 million that's approximately 6% higher than last year as rates on our variable debt are expected to rise in our status quo case and we expect to have higher debt outstanding though still within our investment-grade target leverage ratio range.", "Please note that we will likely term out up to $400 million of our short-term borrowings and have a $300 million 2.95% note maturing in March. Depending on the scenario, these refinancings could increase our interest expense by $6 million to $10 million above our current guidance range in 2017.", "We expect a consolidated tax rate of 36.6%, 80 basis points higher than 2016. That increase primarily relates to decreased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. We expect Corporate expenses of $118 million to $124 million, which would be flat to 2016.", "Now, let's take a quick look at guidance for each of our business units. Starting with our Hotel Group, we expect revenues of $1.33 billion to $1.37 billion. We expect room growth of 3% to 5%, and global RevPAR to be flat, or flat to up 2% in constant currency, reflecting the latest industry forecast. We expect the Hotel Group adjusted EBITDA will be $410 million to $420 million.", "At Destination Network, we expect revenues of $1.64 billion to $1.68 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of $405 million to $415 million. We expect the average number of exchange members to be flat, and exchange revenue per member to grow 1% to 3%.", "We expect Vacation Rental transactions to grow 7% to 9%, and average net price per rental to decline 3% to 1% or be flat to up 2% in constant currency. For Vacation Ownership, we expect revenues of $2.9 billion to $2.98 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of $710 million to $730 million that's relatively flat to 2016. Our key top-line metrics, gross VOI sales is expected to grow approximately 7% to 9%, reflecting tour growth of 6% to 8%, capturing the expanded tour expectations related to our new owner growth goals that Steve touched on earlier. We also expect VPG to be flat to up 2%.", "The increase in our new owner target will have a dampening effect on VPG. Our timeshare guidance assumes a provision rate of 18% to 20% of sales, due to a higher level of financings and continued pressure from defaults.", "Our neighborhood target for 2017 free cash flow will remain at $800 million. As always, keep in mind that there can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter or any given year, so we view the $800 million number as a neighborhood target rather than exact figure. Our longstanding capital allocation philosophy is to invest our free cash flow in the business where opportunities warrant, and then return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Absent M&A opportunities, you can expect we'll return at least $600 million to shareholders this year through share repurchases. In addition, based on the board's decision to increase our annual dividend to $2.32 per share, we will return approximately another $250 million to shareholders through dividend payments.", "Now, turning to the first quarter, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.08 to $1.11. Remember that we don't budget prospective repurchases into our guidance. Interest expense, and depreciation and amortization will be slightly lower than the quarterly average implied run rate.", "Keep in mind that the first quarter comparisons will be particularly difficult as we will be lapping some nonrecurring benefits from 2016 at Wyndham Destination Network and Wyndham Vacation Ownership and we're expecting lower EBITDA from our owned hotel in Puerto Rico due to the impact from the Zika virus. We expect the provision for loan loss to be consistent with our 18% to 20% full year guidance range.", "And with that, I will turn the call back to Steve. Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thanks, Tom. In closing, let me reiterate that we have a wide range of initiatives underway and our teams are working with energy and focus to drive strong growth, profitability and free cash flow. As always, you have my commitment that we will remain disciplined in deploying our capital to drive shareholder value. Thank you all again for joining us with the call today and thank you for your continued support and confidence in our company.", "And with that, we'll take some questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Thank you. We'll go first to the line of Joseph Greff. Please go ahead.", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Good morning, guys.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Good morning, Joe.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Good morning, Joe.", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Steve, with respect to filling Franz's spot in Vacation Ownership, can you talk about the progress in that search, and then maybe focusing on that search. How important is the new person having public company or public company timeshare experience?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Sure, Joe. The search is going very well. It's in line with our timing expectations. We've seen some great candidates and we continue the process of meeting people and doing second interviews. So I would say, I'm very pleased by the interest in the opportunity, but also with the quality of people that we're seeing.", "And the second part of the question is a interesting way of asking the same question you asked last quarter about the spin I guess; very, very clever way of doing it. The answer is, it's important that somebody has public company experience, I'm not saying that we're looking for someone necessarily who's been a public company CEO. But certainly as the board has directed me, we want to keep our optionality open. So we want to be able to bring somebody in who is capable of leading an organization, if that's what the board chooses to do. But that's again, not making any more statement than I made last time about how the board is looking at all of its options and will continue to do so.", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you for that. And then with respect to the loan loss provision, what you did in the 4Q and what you are talking about in your outlook for 2017 is in line with what we are expecting. Can you talk about how much of that is being driven by, I would say, mix versus how much of it is, these third parties contributing to that? And then where are you in trying to find a way to remedy the third-party impact of things here?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Well, Tom, you want to take the metrics and I'll talk about what we're doing.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Sure. Joe, for 2016 about one-half, a little less than one-half of the incremental increase in provision came about from what we'll call third-party activity. And Steve, he then asked about the steps that we're taking.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yeah, what are we doing? Well, we're doing a lot. I mean, I don't think that you can say that you've seen great results from everything we're doing. But let me just step back for one minute, Joe. This is not just a WVO issue, this is an industry issue and I'm not saying that every business in our industry is seeing it, but a majority of them are. And, in fact, ARDA, our industry association has been relatively active in trying to better understand the situation and organize efforts so that we are addressing it.", "In the end of the day, we don't make excuses, we make commitments, we deliver on them and we own this as being an issue that we can do better with by having more frequent and better communication with our owners. If we had super happy owners, they wouldn't default even if somebody were giving them an inappropriate pitch. So we need to make sure our owners understand the value of what they have. And they do because the majority of them are very happy or thrilled with the product and use it extensively. But there's a small number that are prone or I guess suspect to be being given a pitch. And so, we need to do a better \u2013 susceptible I meant. So, we need to be better at communicating with our owners, and we do own this issue and we will improve on it, and when we do, you'll see improvement in that provision number.", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. And then my final question. Tom, you mentioned 3% to 5% net rooms growth for 2017 at the midpoint, it's a bit better than what you've done the last bunch of years. How much of that is a function of you're at the point now where the removals are plateauing, or dare we say, moving in the other direction?", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Joe and Steve, you'll probably want to weigh in on this, but it's probably more of a reflection of how much our pipeline has grown over time. I think that's really the impetus for having a slightly more bullish perspective on our prospects for 2017. But Steve, I don't know if you have anything you want to.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yeah. I attended a kickoff meeting for our franchise development group a few weeks ago now, and there's tremendous excitement. I mean the fact is, Joe, there may be some that's because we're not going to have to terminate as many, but more importantly, we have given fantastic tools to our development team to sell, and that includes the various technology initiatives that we have. And the results we're seeing and as I mentioned, we're not only seeing TripAdvisor and J.D. Power increases, but we're seeing incredible increases in Net Promoter Scores and I don't know if that's a phrase. [technical difficulty] (33:25)", "I'm not sure if you're familiar with Net Promoter Score, but it's a way of judging how consumers view our company. And we saw really strong Net Promoter Score improvement in 2016. So I think we've got a lot of momentum that's building up in that business. And I'd say, that's more the reason than the lack of terminations, quite frankly.", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Good enough. Thanks so much guys.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "All right. Thanks, Joe.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to the line of Chris Agnew from MKM Partners. Please go ahead.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "Hey. Thanks very much. Good morning.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Nice of you to change your last name, Chris.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "Yeah. I must have spelled it incorrectly. Also wanted to touch on timeshare first. And fully aware that the value of a new owner is much greater over the lifetime, but since you pointed it out, can you highlight what the margin delta is between new and existing timeshare owners in the first year?", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "It's about a 4 to 1, Chris. And it all comes down to really one component that's different, which is there's a lower close rate on new owners, which means that we have to spend more marketing funds to get them. I mean, that's really the big difference. It's about a 4 to 1 margin ratio differential between an upgrade and a new owner.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "Got it. And given the commentary you had about 2017, and the loose commentary around 2018 coming back closer to your long-term targets. Should we expect that 2017 sees a big push for new owners and then that dissipates in 2018? Or was it just that you keep at the same level and you start to benefit from the sort of longer tail as you mentioned on the lifetime benefit from these new owners.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "No, Chris. That's a great question and I may not have been real clear with that. No, we're looking at roughly a 23% increase this year, and then I would expect to see more of an increase going forward. We're not going to be backing off of our new owner growth. And for those who are not as familiar with our story, back in 2006, 2007 and 2008, we were doing 1 million tours a year, and we were closing more new owners than upgrade owners. When the financial crisis hit, we changed our business a bit to accommodate for the ABS markets being closed and we swung more towards upgrades.", "The fact is, we've been moving back towards new owners, but quite frankly not at the pace that I think we need to. So, we're ramping that up. And the organization is 1000% behind it. They're excited by it. As I said, I've been serving as interim CEO, and they are, without exception, people are very excited about the refocus on new owners, and bringing new people into the fold. So no, I would not anticipate that we ramp up and then ramp back down.", "I think the real big difference in the growth 2018 and beyond is, we're not having to face this variable compensation headwind that we have, which as I said is about a $30 million headwind this year. And our portfolio will continue to grow as we sell more new owners, and as we're lending a little bit more to those owners, and that will give us some more interest income spread. So there is several things that are built into that confidence in the growth. And all of our businesses have such terrific initiatives going on right now that I feel that we're really in a good place.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "Thank you. And if I could squeeze one little last one. Tour flow guide of 6% to 8% in Vacation Ownership, can you share some color on the first quarter and any seasonality or comp issues we need to be aware through the year? Thanks.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Sure, sure. While there certainly is seasonality to our tour flow and Q1 is usually the lightest kind of quarter for a variety of reasons. So, I would not expect the tour flow in Q1 to be up to that 6% to 8%, but over the year, we will get there. In part that's because we're just opening some new sales offices. We shut down some sales offices at the end of 2016 if you recall, I think about six or seven sales offices and we were hit by Hurricane Matthew. So we're kind of ramping back up from that, but you will see definitely an increase during the year. We've got a lot of different initiatives that we have in place to drive that, not just the opening of the Clearwater Beach sales center or the Austin sales center, but also change in our marketing approach in New York, changing some things in Chicago and in Southern Florida, and also ramping up in Las Vegas.", "So we have a number of different initiatives that we're going after. But I would say that that is going to build as the year goes on and that's also a reason that I'm feeling good about continuing to grow into 2018 because we're really changing kind of the mindset. And the mindset is not just the mindset that the organization has, but also the mindset of compensation. So we've changed some of our comp programs to focus on new owners, which will help us achieve those goals at the sales level.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "Excellent. Thank you.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Sure. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Hey, good morning. Thank you.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Good morning, Patrick.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Just talk a little bit about inbound international travel. Since the Trump immigration executive order's been sort of a fiasco, have you seen any hiccups in inbound international and particularly in your Orlando area?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Oh, interesting. So, you're asking Orlando, so you're asking?", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Well.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Timeshare side.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "It could be, yeah. Let's talk about timeshare but then everything else.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Okay. We're really not. We're not seeing any impact from it. Obviously, we don't see a lot of tours on the timeshare side from those seven countries. We don't have linguistics in every country down in Orlando or in any of our sales centers. So we would not necessarily be touring people from the countries that have now been put on the, or were put on the frozen zone. So we have not seen anything. And frankly, our whole philosophy as a business is inviting everybody in. So we have a very broad view of the world traveler that we bring into our hotels and into our timeshare.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Two more questions. The first is in your quest to make new owner sales great again, you talk about being aggressive in marketing. Just a little bit more color on exactly what that means, What you'll be stepping up as far as your marketing or anything new, creative efforts in that regards.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yeah, I'm not going to have a hat made up for it though, Patrick, just so you know. No, the change is really more on the marketing side than anything. It's not in our sales process because we've got very compliance-driven sales process that we do with our podium presentations and everything. It's really on the marketing side. And last year we generated about 800,000 tours. We're going to obviously generate more than that this year. Part of it is just where are those tours coming from and how are we deploying the resources we have, which includes our sales people, to address those tours that are coming in. So really, it's just a bit of a shift in the focus on marketing to new owners. And, as I said, the organization is embracing and excited by the opportunity.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. And then just a last question here. For the fourth quarter, the G&A run rate was well below the $30 million to $35 million sort of historical run rate. Just to be clear, was that due to the decrease in bonus payouts?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yeah, largely, that was it, Patrick. Yeah.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you. That's all. Thank you.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yeah. And, Patrick, just going back to your other question. One thing that I mentioned in the script that as you were asking that last question I thought about was, we are putting a big focus on Wyndham Rewards and on our Hotel Group and in driving more tours from that area. As I said, I think we underperformed there. We have big opportunities, particularly as Wyndham Rewards has improved, and frankly, the technology in the Hotel Group is improving to provide better transfers and better opportunities. So we're super-excited about that.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Jared Shojaian from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Hi, Jared.", "Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC", "Steve, you talked about pre-financial crisis, you guys did more new owner sales. So I guess I'm wondering, is 60%-40% still the right mix on upgrade sales versus new owners or are you reevaluating that with the management change? And then where will you be at year-end 2017?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "It's probably a pretty good broad guidance on it, Jared. I think that the focus will be on driving new owners, but we're not deemphasizing upgrades because we still have a ton of people. We have 900,000 members in our system. They're coming in to visit with us. And they want to hear what we're doing and how we're improving our network. So we'll continue to talk to them, we'll continue to sell upgrades.", "And as we add more new members, it gives us a new pool of people to talk to about upgrade as well. So I think that probably 60%-40% is a pretty good estimate of where we'll be at. And if anything, over time, we may see that go more new owner, but that's probably a pretty good estimate.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Hey, Jared, it's Tom. Let me just give you just a little perspective on 2016 where we ended up. About 45% of our tours were upgrade and 55 were new owners. Yet our revenue for 2016 was still 66%-33% upgrade/new owners. So to get to 60%-40% would show a bit of a realignment from where we ended 2016.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yeah. And I think, Jared, you were asking kind of the long-term view, right. That was your point?", "Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC", "Right. That was my question, but also at year-end 2017, I mean, presumably you're not going to be at 60% by the end of 2017 or is that your expectation?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Not going to be at what percent, Jared, sorry.", "Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC", "60%.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "60%. Probably not. We're probably going to be more between 60% and 65%. I don't want to get too precise on it because we could do better in our close rate in new owners and all of a sudden new owners are up. So we're targeting something that's between 60% and 65%, but again, this is not a precise science, and I'd be thrilled if it were higher. It means we're closing at a higher rate and that's a good thing.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yeah. We're heading to 60%, but we may not get there in 2017.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yeah.", "Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. So based on those comments, it sounds like you're going to have the mix headwind again in 2018 and probably 2019 and who knows how much further out. But I guess the question is, why do you feel confident with 6% to 8% growth going forward, if 6% to 8% has been the historical longer-term number that you've hit when you've had growing higher-margin upgrade sales helping that mix? So I guess now if you don't have that, you actually have the opposite occurring. Why do you feel like you can still get 6% to 8%?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Well, I'd say there's a couple of things, and Tom may want to add on as well. Clearly, we're going to have an increase in interest income going forward because our portfolio is growing and that'll add some. And, as you're all aware, interest income and interest expense for the ABS financing flow through above our EBITDA line for the timeshare business. So that certainly helps grow it.", "The other thing is we were dealing this year and we think we're going to deal with in 2017 to a smaller degree the provision pressure that we've seen. And so that is something that we've been dealing with that I don't think is a long-term systemic issue of having a growing provision. I think we may have a higher provision than we've had historically. Who knows whether we'll return to the old levels that we had.", "And then the third I would think is really that in 2017 we're not going to be dealing \u2013 in 2018 rather \u2013 we're not going to be dealing with this pressure of lapping our variable compensation, which is not an insignificant item. And we feel it's absolutely appropriate given the fact that we think every one of our associates should have an opportunity to earn a target compensation at the level that they're expecting. And for good performance, that should absolutely be the result. Is there anything else, Tom that you'd...", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "I'd just say, look, 2016 was an interesting year, Jared, because it really was \u2013 if you look at the reason why the business didn't reach the goals that we had set, it had everything to do with provision. And so reduction in bonus payments were used to offset that. Had it not been for this extraordinary provision movement, the business would have had a familiar year to us.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yeah.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "It would have good revenue growth and so sometimes, these provisions have a pretty volatile effect on earnings. But absent that, when you look at the rest of the performance of the business, it was a familiar performance level for us.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yeah. And absent the variable comp in 2017, we'd be right at the growth levels that you're accustomed to. So I don't think it's any sort of a stretch. It's in how you build your program and build the business, Jared.", "Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Thank you. And if I could just sneak one quick one in. You touched on the possibility of a timeshare spinoff, I guess, the possibility of that. But what prohibits a sale to a competitor as another option? Would you just be faced with a big tax consequence or is there something else that I'm missing?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Well, I mean, yes, we'd have a big tax consequence, frankly, for all of our businesses because our basis is not all that high. You'd have to have a willing buyer who's interested in buying a business unit. So we don't preclude anything, quite frankly. That's just our model as we look at all opportunities. As I said, the board asked me to produce optionality for the business and for the shareholders. And so that is kind of the model that we're living under. But we would have a significant tax issue if we tried to sell a particular business unit or part of the business unit.", "Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to David Katz from Telsey Advisory.", "David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Hi, good morning, everyone.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Good morning, David.", "David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "I wanted to ask about the Hotel business and I appreciate your commentary and perspectives about it. But one of the observations we make about other branded hotel companies is \u2013 and I know you touched on it just a little bit about forcing out underperforming owners, but we've seen other companies go through a more formal process of reestablishing a brand and a new set of standards and along with that having a really meaningful campaign toward upping the level of specific brands. Have you contemplated that with any of the larger brands that you have at something just a little bit more meaningful than what you've done so far?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Well, two comments on that, David, and thanks for the question. The fact is, I think, before you were covering us we went through that with Ramada. We did a complete redo of the Ramada program, took about 30,000 rooms from that system and reset it. We do focus on the brands. Just in 2016, we've kind of re-imagined what all the brands look like and what they should feel like. In that regard, we also develop new prototypes for the brands that are driving more new construction for the brands. So we do a lot for it.", "To hit a reset button and completely wipe out of brand is a dramatic step to take, and I'm not saying that we're thinking about doing that. We think that we've been successful in moving the needle by just kind of holding very firm to our quality standards and terminating properties that don't hold up to those standards. And we'll continue to improve the brands and we'll continue to focus on adding more attributes for those brands but I don't think that we're going to be looking to do a complete reset.", "David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "So if I can follow that up, Super 8 and Days Inn, all right, which are the two that are larger than Ramada, have they gone through a Ramada like cleansing, if you will, or repositioning as you describe it, when was the last time they did that?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "No. I wouldn't say that they have. They have gone through periods of refreshing, and changing things up and redesigning the properties and changing standards but we do those things all the time for our brands. So, I wouldn't say there's been a \u2013 we haven't hit the reset button on any of those brands. Those brands are very powerful. Days Inn and Super8 are two of the most powerful economy brands in the industry.", "David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Right. Okay. I appreciate the answers. Thanks for taking my question.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Sure.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thanks, David.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey, good morning thanks for taking the questions.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Hey, Stephen.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Good morning.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Just a follow up on the Wyndham Rewards as you mentioned a few times as being a key tool to drive multiple segments. As the program has continued to grow with relatively recent improvements, are you seeing any difference in the type of customer that you're attracting or how they leverage the loyalty program and how does that customer compare with the typical timeshare customer?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Great question. The fact is we haven't seen a big change in the type of customer taking Wyndham Rewards but we have seen a change in the way they use Wyndham Rewards. Historically, the Wyndham Rewards program, which was not a powerful loyalty program, it was more of a rewards program. People would use their points to get things like Home Depot cards and it was more focused on what they could get short-term.", "There has been a dramatic shift in that towards using our product, which is the whole purpose of a loyalty program. So, I think the reset that the team did there was brilliant. It's got a lot of attention, it's been ranked very highly. But more importantly, it changed the way people use the program. So, yes, we are seeing a dramatic increase and I don't have numbers to quote to you right now, but a dramatic increase in the usage of our product, our Hotel product versus people using the points for something outside of our ecosystem. And so there is another question there as well?", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Well, I guess, a follow-up of what percentage of tours outsourced from Wyndham Properties or that can be identified as Wyndham Rewards members and how do they overlap with timeshare?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "The short answer is too low. It's an area that I think we have enormous room for improvement. We don't drive a lot of our tours from our Hotel Group, which we should and which we will and doing a redo of Wyndham Rewards was one step in that process, having technology improvements is another step in that process. So, we're doing the things we need to, to make that a more effective tool for us.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "That's great. Thanks. Then one last follow-up if I can. Just a lot of the focus has been on separating out the businesses, but certainly with the Wyndham Rewards, it sounds like there's more opportunity to connect them. If you think about the M&A environment more broadly, how do you evaluate acquisitions, specifically maybe in the hotel space versus growing organically and has that changed?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Well, we'd like to do both. We will continue to grow organically. But in M&A, it's all about the opportunity, and then the valuation that that opportunity is presented at. We're very disciplined as we've said numerous times, as we've shown. We're not going to do a deal just for the sake of adding more brands or more units. But we do look at everything that comes out, and if it makes sense, we'll take advantage of it. We think that we have a unique capability of moving a brand more than anyone else. So, we will look at every brand that comes on the market.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Fair enough. Thanks so much. Best of luck.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thanks, Stephen.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Harry Curtis from Nomura. Please go ahead.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet", "Hi. Good morning.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Harry.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet", "I wanted to go back to your comment. I was interested on the timeshare side that you referenced to sourcing the hotel channel. Can you give us, for new customers, can you give us a sense from a historic perspective of to what degree you've used that as a resource?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "We've used it, but as I said Harry, we just haven't used it effectively and as efficiently as we should. And part of that was system constraints that we had that we're resolving, and part of it was just the focus, quite frankly. It is getting a lot of attention right now and it will become a bigger part of it.", "I don't know what others do. We hear rumors of what other companies do in their connection to their hotel brands. We do not achieve anywhere near what we understand others are doing and we think that's a result not of the demographics of our hotel customers, because they are exactly the right demographic, but it's more a focus and attention to driving new owners. And we used to do better in fact in our call transfer and other programs, but when we started to shift the focus to upgrades, we kind of lost that muscle and we're rebuilding that muscle now.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet", "And my follow-up question is in reference to your tax rate. It's still early in the discussion about lowering corporate tax rates, but if that does happen, have you guys spoken about what you would do with the incremental free cash flow, whether it would be applied to growth or returning cash to shareholders?", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "I don't think it would change.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "No, it wouldn't change at all. Tom said it wouldn't change. It wouldn't change. We would love to find more opportunities to grow the businesses, and if we could, we would have been investing in them as long as there's an adequate return, which is how we always view our capital allocation. But absent those opportunities, it would be sent back to shareholders.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet", "Very helpful. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to the site of Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and good morning.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Good morning.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Just quickly and I think this is just more kind of housekeeping than anything else, but the free cash flow growth year-over-year looked like it was up may be 1%, 1.5% or so relative to 6% growth of EBITDA. Tom, you mentioned $55 million headwind to free cash flow from lower down payments. Is that at least partially responsible for the disconnect between those two items?", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "I'd say, it was foreign exchange, and the higher financing that we're doing. So those are two things, but you know Carlo, our view on the higher financing is it's a short-term use of cash. We're not building brick and mortar. We're taking the cash; we're recycling it. That was my explanation. In a matter of months, we're recycling it and we're getting cash back. It just doesn't hit our definition of free cash flow. It falls into financing on the cash flow statement, which is not part of our definition of free cash flow. So, it's just a definitional explanation really.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Right. Okay. I understand that. So, as I try and kind of look at 2017 guidance, and I look at your Vacation Ownership margins, and it looks like at the midpoint they're down maybe 100 basis points or so with respect to your guidance. When I think about everything going on in the business, it looks like loan loss provisions have been guided up a little bit. You're going to increase the mix of new owners, which as Steve I think mentioned earlier, are basically one-fourth the margin power of an upgrade sale. You have this variable compensation headwind. I'm just trying to understand how you keep the margins that tight, I mean, as in only down kind of 100 bps year-over-year. Does that mainly come from inventory sourcing? And maybe if you can give a little snapshot of what 2016 looked like from an inventory sourcing point of view.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Carlo, it doesn't have anything to do with inventory sourcing. I think our COGS is in a pretty tight spot as it is, meaning we have a very good COGS rate. And most of the downside is coming from the two issues that you raised which is bonus, we hope, will be achieved and therefore it will erode margin and then the higher emphasis on new owners. Offsetting that will be some of the improvement in VPG. In tours, we still have growth and upgrade assumed in our numbers. So it isn't as if upgrade is declining. And we have a small margin increment, positive margin increment with consumer finance, our consumer finance business as well. But those are the components that we see now. I think we're projecting about a 130 basis point decline in 2017 based on the guidance that we've given you, a 130 basis point decline, again, most of it coming from bonus and new owners but being offset in part by other items including consumer finance.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. And then just on that $30 million, the headwind. Could you just explain a little bit more of the mechanics of that in 2016? And is that just simply targets weren't achieved so those bonuses don't get paid? Your guidance assumes targets for next year or are the targets for next year to achieve and hence you would bring that back?", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yeah. Exactly, that's the way it works. I was we have a base bonus assumption for every employee who is bonus eligible and we reestablished that base level in 2017. And in 2016, we paid out below that base level and that's what the headwind that Steve described is.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Dan Wasiolek from Morningstar. Please go ahead.", "Dan Wasiolek - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the pipeline growth that's picked up the last several months or really through 2017. So you already mentioned the technology in cross sell momentum that's benefiting that. But any particular brands or regions that are seeing particular strength that's aiding that pipeline growth?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Pipeline, probably international would be the largest, if you're looking at regions. China has been a big contributor to that, but we've also seen growth in Europe. And I think that's it. I mean for the most part, I don't want to overplay our pipeline situation because as largely a conversion company, we do a lot of very quick conversions of an independent hotel into one of our brands. So pipeline for us is helpful because it shows probably an increase in new construction at somewhere around the world and that's mostly in Europe, I mean, mostly outside of the U.S. but I wouldn't read too much into that.", "Dan Wasiolek - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Okay. And then just maybe a one follow-up you mentioned, as far like gauging the strength of brands from J.D. Power and TripAdvisor metrics, wondering if you can maybe provide some, I guess, metrics with regards to RevPAR index for brands and which brands are kind of performing above that and below that? Thanks.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yeah. We have not given RevPAR index by brand or by region or by anything else. That's kind of a level of detail quite frankly that I think it would be impossible for us to keep up with. So, we obviously use that internally and we've seen increases in our indexing. But there is domestic, international issues, so there's a lot going into that. So, I wouldn't hold your breath waiting to see that information.", "Dan Wasiolek - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Okay. Understood. Thank you.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Sure.", "Operator", "And we'll take our final question from Michael Millman from Millman Research. Please go ahead.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "Thank you. You talked about in the past what was going on in the oil regions. Can you talk about what you're seeing, what's the trend you're seeing this year in the oil regions? And secondly, regarding Vacation Rental, can you talk about what, if any, concern you have about the tremendous technology strength at Expedia and price line they seem to have and the amount of money that they're spending there, if you can expand that as well? Thank you.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Mike, it's Tom. I'll answer the first question, which was the effect of oil regions. We started the year first quarter of 2016, the oil region was down almost 30%. In the fourth quarter, that number dropped \u2013 the effect dropped to 8%, and in January, so far, we've seen sort of a similar effect as we did in the fourth quarter. So, at this early point, there doesn't seem to be any significant shift from that 8% level at least in the first quarter of 2017. Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yeah. And as per the OTAs and their advertising levels and driving rental volume, they've been around as has the HomeAways, Airbnbs and our Europe rental business just marches on. There's something we said for trust and confidence in where you're renting. Your vacation is a very important part of your annual activity, and there is a tremendous level of comfort with our European brands, or with the Wyndham brand in the U.S. So, we feel comfortable and confident. We've seen the growth. We've seen the growth despite massive overspending above our levels by others. So we feel very good with our positioning.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Sure. Thank you, Mike. All right well. I think Erica said that was the last question. So I will thank everybody for joining us, and we look forward to talking to you on the next call.

Of course, the goal underlying these initiatives is growth in a socially responsible manner and strong results for shareholders.", "Now let's take a deeper look into the operations of our businesses. In the Hotel Group, we launched our first umbrella advertising campaign for our 12 brands, and it is already showing strong results with a goal of driving more consumers to wyndhamrewards.com.", "Growth in our loyalty program member base results in increased site visits, which generates higher bookings and revenue for our franchisees. Since we launched the ad campaign in May, wyndhamrewards.com bookings have increased almost 20%.", "We also continued to update our 12 brands to enhance their appeal to guests. Last quarter, I mentioned the new prototype for our Hawthorn Suites brand. Our work on Hawthorn is a part of a larger effort to develop new prototypes across the hotel brands to drive new construction deals and conversions. Our teams developed these prototypes to revitalize the brand experience for guests, while reducing development costs for franchisees. We analyzed many factors, including franchisee and hotel guest feedback, construction costs and competitive set comparisons. Through this process, we determined that the current Hawthorn Suites product might be, in certain circumstances, too big and too expensive. The new prototype rightsizes the product and repositions the brand as a more limited service, extended-stay product, which will better meet the demands of its customers. It saves up to 40% for the developer and sets this hotel up for success.", "We also have new prototypes underway for Days Inn and Super 8. While both brands target similar demographics, their customers are actually quite different. Days Inn stays are often booked in advance for family vacations, usually for a week or more. New Days Inn properties will reflect the bright and optimistic essence of the brand, with a residential feel geared for families.", "Super 8 is a more of a trusted roadside place where you'll pull over for the night, often without a reservation. The new Super 8s are designed to make people feel welcome with a high level of comfort, a sense of community and some design flair. Because while you only may be staying one night, it should be an enjoyable experience that will make you want to repeat that at your next stop.", "By more clearly differentiating these brands, we're working to avoid commoditization, and we're giving developers another reason to choose our brands over others.", "We are also rolling out new prototypes for Wingate, Baymont and Microtel. So speaking of which, last week, Microtel by Wyndham was once again ranked #1 in guest satisfaction in the economy/budget hotel segment by J.D. Power.", "Our prototypes are designed for new construction, but have direct application for our many conversions and renovations. We work to apply key elements from these plans to existing product. Through these initiatives, Wyndham Hotel Group is continuing to enhance our brand's value proposition for both franchisees and consumers.", "Now moving to Exchange & Rentals. When an investor ask us about our Vacation Rental business, there is often a comparison to the internet listings in rent-by-owner sites such as Airbnb. We are the world's largest professional manager of vacation rentals, with a diverse portfolio to meet the needs of virtually every traveler. The keywords are \"professionally managed\".", "Like many rental companies, we'll list our properties on the Internet, primarily through our own proprietary websites, and at times through some of the listing services. But what differentiates us is the high level of service we provide to our property owners and guests. We typically manage the entire process. We offer the homeowner a turnkey experience where we do all, from advertising, booking and billing, to home cleaning and maintenance. We manage all the interactions with the consumer. We provide guests a professional experience from a trusted brand with a long history of strong service delivered by on-the-ground local staff that not only handle the reservations and key transfer, but are available for any issue, whether air conditioning breaks on a hot summer nights or severe weather is on its way.", "For example, this recent July 4 weekend, Hurricane Arthur hit the Outer Banks of North Carolina where we now manage 575 properties. Prior to the storm, our on-site staff prepared our rental homes to minimize damage. After the event, we immediately notified owners regarding any damage and began making repairs. Our team worked into the night, and within 6 hours of the evacuation order being lifted, our properties were ready and every guest was checked in. The result: only 11 of our rental properties were damaged beyond our ability to immediately repair, and we were able to relocate those guests to alternative properties. Overall, only 2 parties who were offered alternative accommodations canceled their rentals. This is what we mean by professionally managed.", "The Wyndham Count On Me! service commitment provides the peace of mind that we stand behind the rental experience from beginning to end.", "And of course, we also have great product. Our unique -- one unique example is our largest European rental brand, Landal GreenParks. Based on a philosophy of \"bringing the outside in\", Landal's parks are usually located within nature, frequently well off the main roads, in the woods or near mountains and lake settings. Since opening their first park in 1954, Landal has grown to over 70 managed and franchised locations with 12,000 rental units, generally bungalows with a living area, kitchen, bathroom and up to 6 bedrooms. Landal serves over 2 million visitors a year, primarily in the Netherlands and Germany. Our guests love the concept, and park occupancies average almost 80% during the peak season. With great products such as Landal GreenParks and a strong service commitment, we are confident that we'll continue to expand our professionally managed Rental business into the new markets and grow the business overall.", "Before we move on, I'd like to take a moment to express our sympathies to those affected by the tragic loss of Malaysian Flight 17, including the many families in the Netherlands where Landal is based. Our hearts are with them.", "Now turning to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. We are always looking for the most efficient ways to attract new owners. New owners are coming from an increasingly wider range of cultural backgrounds and demographics, demonstrating the broad appeal of the timeshare product. About half of our new owner tours are sourced through our community marketing programs and alliances, which put the WVO product front and center in vacation locations. We focus on partners whose customers match our timeshare owner demographics. These partners share our commitment to truly knowing our customers and providing great experiences for them. We set our teams up on-site where they engage and offer tours to potential customers who are already likely to have an interest. One great partnership for us has been our long-term relationship with Caesars Entertainment, where we're currently at 7 locations in Las Vegas.", "Another example is our alliance with Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville, which resulted in Margaritaville Vacation Club by Wyndham. This alliance provides a large, loyal, fun-loving customer base with a demographic profile that's great and strong and similar in many ways to timeshare owners.", "In sales now, the first Margaritaville resort will open next year in St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands. We expect significant tours in from Margaritaville channels through joint marketing activities, including tie-ins with Margaritaville restaurants. Of course, we're constantly exploring new alliance opportunities as well, and we have some exciting new relationships in the works.", "Other new-owner marketing programs include our Discovery program and our Owner Referral program. Through our Discovery program, a potential owner is invited to enjoy owner benefits for a trial period before making their decision to become a long-term owner. The WVO's Owner Referral program provides current owners with incentives, such as bonus points or show tickets, to invite a friend or family member who may be interested in purchasing a timeshare to visit our resorts. The power of word-of-mouth endorsements from a family member is made even more compelling when combined with an opportunity to experience the product first hand.", "Wyndham Vacation Ownership and Wyndham Hotel Group also continue to collaborate in marketing our timeshare product directly to our hotel customers. A great example is our call-transfer program, where interested customers are transferred to a timeshare representative at the end of a call with the Hotel Group. These customers are predisposed to travel and are already engaged with our company through our hotel brands and Wyndham rewards, making them great candidates for timeshare purchase with us.", "We cast a wide net, but it's also efficient and informed. We target our marketing and conduct credit prescreening before every tour. The majority of our sales centers provide bilingual and multilingual representatives. For example: we have Japanese-speaking associates in Hawaii, a popular destination for Japanese tourists; and Portuguese-speaking associates in Orlando, which is popular among Brazilians.", "And now let me turn the call over to Tom for details on the quarter's results.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'm happy to report another strong quarter, with revenues up 7%, adjusted EBITDA up 9% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 19% year-over-year. As Steve noted, results reflect continued strong execution and performance across all our businesses.", "In the Hotel Group, revenues were up 8%, reflecting higher RevPAR and growth in the Wyndham Rewards program. Adjusted EBITDA for the business increased 12%, largely due to the RevPAR increases.", "Domestic RevPAR increased 8.8%, led by the strength of our Days Inn and Wyndham brands. System-wide RevPAR increased 5.6% due to adverse currency impacts and continued growth in the lower-RevPAR markets outside of the U.S. Specifically, international RevPAR was down 1.8%, primarily reflecting high growth in one of our lowest RevPAR markets, China. Now if we were to exclude China, international RevPAR increased almost 3%.", "Year-over-year, system size increased 2.4%, reflecting a 24% increase in global room openings, reflecting robust development efforts. We've also introduced our brands into new countries, including Howard Johnsons in India and Ramada in Belize and Panama.", "Our pipeline at quarter end stood at 970 properties and nearly 117,000 rooms, up 4.2% over last year. 67% of our pipeline is new construction and 50% is international developments.", "In our Exchange & Rentals business, net revenues were up 7% and adjusted EBITDA up 2% for the quarter. If we were to exclude foreign exchange and acquisitions, revenues were up 3% and adjusted EBITDA up 1%.", "Exchange revenues were flat in the second quarter with an increase of 1.7% in average members, offset by a 1.8% decline in exchange revenue per member. Member growth was driven by improved retention and growth in new members in North America and Latin American regions. The revenue per member decrease was the result of the growth of club membership in North America, which have a lower propensity to transact, and also a decline in Latin American member rentals.", "Now looking at Vacation Rentals. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies and acquisitions, revenues were up 6% for the quarter, reflecting a 4.9% increase in rental transactions and a 1.2% increase in the average net price per vacation rental.", "Transactions were largely driven by growth at our Landal GreenParks business and our Novasol business, which is based in Denmark. Pricing benefited from the strength in higher-price accommodations at Landal and our U.K.-based James Villa Holidays business.", "Our Vacation Ownership business had another strong quarter, with revenues up 7% and adjusted EBITDA up 15%. Revenue increases were due to higher net vacation ownership interest sales.", "Gross VOI sales were up 3.1% year-over-year, reflecting a 1% increase in tours and a 1% increase in VPG, plus higher telesales volume.", "Net VOI sales were up 10%, reflecting higher gross VOI sales and a lower provision for loan loss. The improved provision was supported by a 15% decline in defaults from the second quarter of 2013.", "Second quarter sales to new owners were strong. Year-to-date, we've added almost 15,000 new owners to the system, a 7.4% increase over the same period last year.", "On the ABS front, we completed our second-term securitization transaction of the year on July 16, with the issuance of $350 million of asset-backed notes.", "The Sierra Timeshare 2014-2 was comprised of $277 million of A-rated notes and $73 million of BBB-rated notes. The notes had coupons of 2.05% and 2.4%, respectively, for an overall weighted average coupon of 2.12%. The advance rate for this transaction was 91%. We continue to see great results on these securitizations.", "Now moving to corporate. Net interest expense was down for the quarter, primarily due to a $3 million benefit from a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap, which we implemented in July of last year and the reversal of a reserve for value-added taxes.", "In the first 6 months of 2014, free cash flow was $695 million or $5.39 per share, up $41 million from the first 6 months of last year. Now we ask that you don't get ahead of us on this. Our cash flow seasonality is more front-end loaded as the rental business continues to grow. Remember that in this business, we generally collect cash from the consumer when the trip is booked, usually in the first and second quarters; and we typically pay the homeowner at the time of the stay, usually in the third quarter.", "In addition, we expect higher payments of cash taxes, as well as higher CapEx and inventory spend in the second half of the year.", "Our ongoing free cash flow target remains approximately $750 million. However, as you know, there can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter and in any given year. So we view this as a neighborhood target rather than a precise figure. Remember that we identified some headwinds this year, including a higher cash tax rate and higher spending for timeshare development.", "In the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares for a total of $170 million, a slightly higher pace than in the first quarter. As a reminder, our capital allocation strategy is to invest strategically in growing our business, coupled with returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Our current expectation, based on investment opportunity, is to repurchase at least $600 million of our shares this year. Our remaining share repurchase authorization as of the end of yesterday was $311 million, and we will seek approval for additional repurchases from our board when appropriate.", "Finally, let's turn to guidance, which will be posted on the website after the call. As you saw from the press release, we're raising the bottom of our adjusted EBITDA range by $15 million and the top by $5 million to a new range of $1,230,000,000 to $1,245,000,000. Adjusted earnings per share guidance goes up $0.11 with a new range of $4.34 to $4.44 per share. Average weighted shares for the year are expected to be 128 million shares, down from 130 million shares.", "We've made some slight modifications as well to business unit and corporate EBITDA guidance. We've also tightened our ranges on D&A and interest expense. And we've brought our tax rate guidance for the full year down to 36.5%. Again, all of this will be posted to the website after the call.", "For the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.59 to $1.62, and a diluted share count of 127 million shares. Remember, our guidance assumes 0 share repurchases going forward, while some analysts assume additional repurchases in their models. As a result, there are differences in per-share metrics between our outlook and some analysts' expectations.", "And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve. Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Tom. Next week will mark our 8-year anniversary of listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Before opening the call to questions, I'd like to take a moment to comment on our performance since that time.", "Our strong operating results, execution and growth have driven significant increases in revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow. Between dividends and share repurchases, we have returned nearly $4.2 billion to our shareholders. Our total shareholder returns since listing, including dividends, is more than double that of the S&P 500. And we still have a long way to go. We see great opportunities ahead to generate growth and value across all our businesses, and we remain keenly focused on capitalizing on those opportunities.", "And with that, Shirley, we'll open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "One of the things that stood out to us in the 2Q in the Vacation Ownership segment was the improvement in the loan loss provision. Last 3 quarters, it's been in that 15%-plus to 16% range. Can you talk about what your expectation is a going forward in the back half of this year on that line?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Joe, our guidance is -- or our outlook for loan losses, what we've thought from beginning of the year, which I think is around 16% to 18% of gross VOI. So that isn't changing. Although, I have to say we're quite encouraged by the default, trends that we see, a sign that our folks in Orlando are really managing that aspect of the business nicely. The business made a number of changes back in 2009-2010 to elevate the FICO score profile of our buyers. And so we're at the point now, I think, where we were was before 2008-2009. So we are in a good spot. We're hopeful that we'll continue to see improvement because of the fundamental changes that the business made a number of years ago. But it's hard for us at this point to judge how much better things will get. But we are optimistic for sure.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Great. And then a second follow-up question. Steve, maybe you can just talk about your views on Wyndham potentially participating in large-scale M&A in the sector, maybe I'll ask it that way. I know historically you've been focused on more tuck-in acquisitions. But if you can give us your thoughts on that, that would be appreciated.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Sure, Joe. Actually, we've been focused on tuck-in acquisitions because that's what's been available. We never really said that we would only do one size deal. We said we would continue to look at transactions. We commented that what we saw in the marketplace were basically tuck-in acquisitions that were available. So that is -- you are absolutely right, that has been kind of our focus because that's what's been available. We look at just about everything. As you know, our DNA is -- has a lot of M&A in it, because that's how we were built. Of all of our brands, there is only one that we actually started ourselves. The rest of them, we have acquired. We started the Wingate, but all the rest of them, we've bought over time. And so we would continue to look in particularly the hotel and the rental business for areas to make acquisitions. Size is only relevant in that it kind of determines how we structure a transaction. And so it's really, it's a matter of looking at what's available out there. And we'll continue to look at big deals, small deals, any deals that makes sense for the shareholders, we are all in this together.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.", "Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of questions. First on the Vacation Rental business. Can you just talk -- I know it's hard to do, but can you just talk about almost like same-store sales versus adding more units? Because it was very strong this quarter, and it's always difficult for me, sitting where we're sitting, to see whether it's because there is just more demand from European consumers, primarily, or whether you are consolidating and getting more and more units into the system. Both are good, but just would be interesting to hear. Second, just following-up on Joe's question on the reserves and the reversals. I just think maybe you can just explain holistically how you've looked at this. Because to me, you were over reserving and taking away, essentially, earnings a few years ago, and now it's coming back as that business is coming in better than expected. And I think I just like to understand that. And then finally, again, similar to what Joe asked on the consolidation opportunities. On the Vacation Rental side, in particular in the U.S., what's the strategy there? Can you consolidate the U.S. Vacation Rental business and turn that into another big growth opportunity for yourself?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay. Well, you hit a lot of topic there, Steve. We'll try to hit them maybe in the order that you asked them. Starting with the Vacation Rental business. We do try to give information to give some direction, but you're absolutely right, it's tough for you to see all the detail and, frankly, the minutiae that we look at. We do give you the Vacation Rentals' transactions and where we see it coming out, and that's, we give guidance of between 4% to 6%. That includes acquisitions. So it includes any activity that we've done last year or earlier this year to acquire businesses. If you looked at it on a same-store sales basis, you would see an improvement in rental transactions, you'd see an improvement in pricing as well. So it's a little bit of both. I would probably say, I'm just trying to think of the detail that I've looked at, it's probably right now more price than volume. I think I would characterize it that way, price than volume. Does that sound right? Yes. Maybe pretty equal. So it's not like one is running way ahead of the other one, but both of them are contributing right now to our growth. We do show the numbers without acquisitions when we show EBITDA for that business unit, though. Don't we? I believe we do. We break that out.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "We did for the Rentals business.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes. So you can see. We give it to you so you can strip out acquisitions, but it is both factors contributing to it. And if you want more information, we can probably talk through how we can get some of that for you. On the reserve side, and Tom may want to add to this as well. You are absolutely right. There was a period of time when the reserve was running actually higher and significantly higher. And if you remember, because I certainly remember saying at the time how I was frustrated that, that wasn't turning around more quickly, because all the great things that, that team had done down in Orlando and out in Las Vegas to improve our credit profile of the buyers wasn't reflecting in a better reserve. But we knew that it was coming. But the way that the accounting works is, it takes some time for the reserve to turn. At the same time, we were hit at one point with that cease-and-desist problem that we talked about, which kind of exasperated the downturn. And we've -- basically, we've wrestled out one to the ground and got that one put behind us. As Tom said, the group down in Orlando and out in Vegas deserve real kudos for what they've done, which is basically changing the model that we sell timeshare with to a very forward-looking, intensive, understanding who the buyer is, whereas we used to just sell to almost anyone because we knew we could take the timeshare property back and resell it, if we needed to. But now we're doing a lot more work which is improving it. So while we've recovered, as Tom said, to kind of a level of loan loss provision that we had before the downturn, in my opinion, we should be better than that because the way that we're credit-scoring and credit-testing our buyers is better than it was back then. And the third one was on...", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Was on North American rental strategy.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "North American rental strategy. We will continue to look at deals in North America. We think there is an opportunity to roll it up and basically do what we've been doing, but also, very importantly, is to expand in the markets where we already have a presence. Because just doing acquisitions, in my opinion, is not enough. We have to do acquisitions; by doing that, plant a flag in a market with a Wyndham branding on it and then grow within that market. I feel that we should be able to, basically, go into markets, plant a flag and then get a lot of market share, because I don't think anybody else can do what we can do in a marketplace. So that's our -- the direction that we're headed in. A lot has to get in place in order to make that happen. And we're working on systems. We're working on bringing on the right people to make that all happen right now. But that is our goal for that North American rental business, which is not dissimilar to what we did in Europe starting in 2003, and now we've got a very large, terrific business over in Europe that is very predictable, extremely well managed and is delivering on all cylinders. There were a lot of questions there, Steve. Hopefully I hit most of it. Tom, do you have anything else or...?", "Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "No, I think you've covered it all. Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Agnew with MKM Partners.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "The exchange business, just wanted to ask. You're sort of seeing -- are you seeing any pressure from corporate accounts to reduce the fees on that side of business?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, the simple answer is yes, and the more evolved answer is, yes, we always have. Because any customer that we have is going to ask us to provide our service at a lower cost. That's just natural. So, of course, there has been that effort. The fact is, we have consistently added services that we provide to our corporate customers. So we're not just saying pay us the same thing and we'll give you the same service. We're saying, we think there is a good reason that you should be paying us the same or even more, because we're providing more. And that is really our goal at RCI is to become not only the leader, which we already are, in timeshare exchange, but also continue to be on the leading edge of innovation and providing more services to the consumer as well as to the corporate customers. In the end of the day, the corporate customers, be it Wyndham Vacation Ownership, or Disney, or Hilton, or any of the big corporate customers, what they want is, they want to service their consumers. They want -- Disney wants to have wildly happy customers that own Disney Vacation Club. And it's our job to help them do that. And if we can do that, it's a win-win for both of us. They have happier customers. Their customers buy more timeshare, bring friends in to buy more timeshare and become loyal to the Disney brand, or the Hilton brand or whatever brand they may be servicing from. So the answer is: yes, they do, but we are providing more service, we believe, to be able to support that -- are looking to maintain or increase our revenue. I will say that we are very mindful of our corporate relationships. We value them greatly and spend a lot of time working on them. We also spend a lot of time looking at kind of the phasing of when relationships are coming up for renewal and generally stay ahead of it, so that we don't have a lot coming at any one time because you are always in a negotiations, particularly with large customers. They have a more power than small customers do, quite frankly, which is natural. And so we're very mindful of that, and the team does team a really, really terrific job.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "And maybe a follow-up to that. Are these -- how often do these renew? Are they annual or multi-year? And any particular large corporate relationships that we should be mindful of renewing in the -- over the next 12 months?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "They're multi-year. There are corporate customers coming due almost every year, probably, I would say. I'm just thinking about the schedule I look at. I would say, on average, there is 2 corporate accounts coming due every year, some larger than others. And so, yes, there are ones coming due this year. We work to get ahead of it. And usually, we're renewing before the year that they actually come due. So we're staying well ahead of it. And we have great relationships. And as I said, we value those relationships dearly and make sure that we're doing whatever we can to make our customers even better with their consumers.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions here. First one concerns your Lodging business. Certainly, I'm sure you're well aware there's been a lot of speculation about possible acquisitions. On the flip side of that, would you ever consider spinning out your Lodging business to a separate company? And the reason I asked that, it appears to me that the valuation multiple that you're getting on your business, somewhere around 10 to 11x multiple of EBITDA, is significantly less than what I see is your closest competitor choice. So would that ever -- in addition to the acquisitions, any thoughts on possible spinning out of businesses?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, we look at everything, Patrick, and we discuss all options with our board, but I would not hold your breath waiting for us to break up the company. As I've said in the past, I don't see a compelling argument. A banker can tell you that, yes, you'll get this incredible value creation if you split up, but I'll also find 15 case studies that show that creation has not been -- more value has not been created by splitting a company up. So I don't see any compelling reason. I think the most important thing would be that you take your multiple for our hotel business and with more and more [ph] choices, because at the end of the day that's -- I mean, you're kind leading that charge out there, man, and you're telling people what you think the value is. So I agree with you that we are undervalued, but there's not much that I can do about that. We set the E, we do not set the P. The street sets the P, and all we can do is continue to perform and continue to deliver the results. And that's what we will continue to do. But I don't think that the answer to that is either splitting up or selling off pieces of our business.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Great. And then one other question concerning the Hotel business. When you think about acquisitions, would purchasing a hotel management business be a priority in the scheme of things? Certainly, you're very deep into franchising, but management side is really small right now. Would that be a priority in the acquisitions?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes. Again, Patrick, we look at everything that's in our world. And we have acquired some property management businesses on the timeshare side. Essentially, Shell Vacations that we bought was a large property management company that we've brought in. So we have resort management more on the timeshare side. On the hotel side, we have a very good property management group that manages several properties. It's not a ton. And could we be better in that area, and larger? Yes, but it would have to be a very unusual deal that would put us in a position of wanting to increase the size of that business. Because bear in mind, people aren't going to come to us to manage a Marriott property. They're going to come to us to manage a Wyndham property, and we generally want to manage in the upscale sector. So you're talking about managing one brand, which is the Wyndham brand. And we have manage quite a few of those already. Could we do more? Yes, we need to grow more on the Wyndham side and we will continue to push into that, but I don't think the answer to that is M&A. But we'll continue to look at any transaction that's out there that makes sense.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And one last question here. And correct me if I'm wrong. I believe you still own the Wyndham Bonnet Creek. Do you see that as a long-term holding? Certainly the transaction market has bounced back and we see much more liquid than when you first built it a couple of years ago. Thoughts on that?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes, that is something -- again, we look at that on a frequent basis. That property is performing very well for us right now. And yet, it has not yet reached what we feel in the market is the appropriate level of stabilization to kind of achieve the kind of value that we think we should be getting for that asset. It's a very unique asset. Again, Patrick, you've been to it, I believe. It's situated within 2,000 units of timeshare. So it's a very, very unique asset. Would we sell it if we got the right price, if somebody knocked in the door and said, here is the price and the price meets our expectation, we'd be willing to sell the property. But we are not actively marketing it now. I don't think we'll be actively marketing it in the near term, but we'll continue to look at values. We'll continue to look at the performance of that property and once we think it's the right -- that we can achieve the right price, we may consider selling it. But if we sold it, we would continue to manage it. We'll be -- they will continue to be in our portfolio of managed properties for the foreseeable future, for more than the foreseeable future, because I don't see us, with the uniqueness of that location, ever removing it from our management control.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "And is there a rough book value of that asset, if you can disclose?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "We never disclose that number. I think it's...", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes, I think it's north of $100 million. I'm not sure of the exact number, but...", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Okay, ballpark, $100 million. That's fine.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nikhil Bhalla with FBR.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Steve, just when I look at the tour flow in the VOI segment, that seems to have been at the lowest pace, and, like, last several quarters it was up only about 1%. What may be behind that? Is there a seasonality issue? Is there something else going on? Just if you can provide some color on that?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes, I think -- I don't think there is much there, frankly. I don't view it as being anything unusual. We are pushing for new owners to come into the program, so we did increase our new owner tour flow. And we haven't, in fact, increased the number of new owners we've brought in this year versus last year. I don't think there is anything else unusual in that. We're managing for -- again, we manage for EBITDA in that business and EBIT production. And sometimes, tour flow can be up or down, VPG can be up or down. But the bottom line is, what is that business unit producing, and we're thrilled with how that business unit is producing. So I don't think there is anything to be read into a 1% increase versus a 3% increase. We still have, for the full year, a 2% to 5% tour flow increase. That is high, frankly. The top end of that is very high. We don't give up on the hope of getting up into that range or in the high end of that range. But I think it's unlikely based on what we've seen for the first 6 months of this year. But we continue to strive for great performance there.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And just touching a little bit upon the new versus the upgrade sales in the VOI segment. I think you recently mentioned something about that 35% of sales today are in -- are to new owners, 65% are basically upgrades. How do you see that ratio turning over time? What do you think it could get to maybe 1, 2, 3 years from now?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, I think if anything, it probably will continue to move towards a little larger percent of new owners over time, if I looked out a couple of years, because we need to continue to bring in new owners so that we have a pool of people to sell upgrades to. And as I've explained before, that's kind of the way we build our sales plan at WVO. We look at what we want to achieve overall for the enterprise, and then we look at what do we need to bring in order to be adding new members to the owner base that will provide growth for the future. And that's the starting point. And then after we figure out the new owner members that we need, we then look at, \"Okay, now how much do we need in the way of upgrade sales in order to reach our sales targets and our EBIT goals for the year.\" And so we really start it all with the number of new members that we need. And think that will continue to be the goal. That will continue to be the push, doing things like Margaritaville by Wyndham. That program, which I don't know if we've ever talked about it, that program only sells new members and we will continue to add new members through programs like that. And so if you are a current owner and you want to get into the Margaritaville by Wyndham area, you're going to have to buy new. You can't just upgrade what you have. You have to buy a new owner position within Margaritaville by Wyndham. And the same thing is true if you're, obviously, a new owner coming in, you buy new as Margaritaville Club by Wyndham. So we do things to focus on that new owner base, and that is an important element of their strategic planning.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Over the next couple of years, do you see this ratio going 50-50?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "No.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "No, I don't think so. I think that would be a very, very large move and probably unlikely. Remember, we are -- we have a very large base of owners. It's over 900,000 owners now. And those owners are more profitable for us to sell to them than to sell to new owners. Selling new owners is more costly. We need to do it because we need to keep building our base, but it is a more expensive sale for us, lower margin sale. So no, we -- I don't see it going to 50-50. If we're at 70-30 or 65-35 right now, it could move up a little bit, but it's not going to be all the way up to 50-50.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Just a follow up on a couple of things. First on the provision. I'm just wondering what you've built into your guidance for the rest of 2014. Do you think that it stabilizes at this lower rate, or are you probably looking at somewhere back in the 16% to 18% range? I'm just trying to get a sense of what you expect to stabilize the level to be.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes. We're holding to our full year provision guidance of around 16% to 18%, more likely to be closer to 16% than the 18%.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "All right. And then it's, not sure what you can say about how compelling a potential transaction might be as far as using your balance sheet, your strong balance sheet. Where do you think -- Steve, where are you in the, and the board vis-\u00e0-vis, on how much leverage you will take on if there were a truly compelling, accretive and strategic opportunity out there?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, Harry. As I've said in the past, our goal is to remain investment grade, and actually on the bottom end of investment grade, and that is our targeted credit metric. And as you know, we've taken on more debt over the years to buy back stock and do other than make acquisitions and have kept ourselves at the bottom end of investment grade. If there was something that was incredibly strategic and a terrific opportunity, would we ever consider moving off of that and doing something that would take us below investment grade? The answer is yes, because we never say never to anything. But, having said that, we would only do it if we saw line of sight to get ourselves back to investment grade. Because I think that having flexibility in this industry, as I've said before, I think, gives us a great advantage. As you said, we have a really strong balance sheet. We can do just about anything we want right now, and I think that's an important strategic advantage to have in the marketplace. And I think we will continue to try to strive to maintain that level of investment grade. But we don't need to build up our balance sheet with a bunch of cash. We don't need to pay down debt and move up from BBB-. We can sit right where we are. But to go below would require something that is really, we think, very unique and is kind of a strategic game changer for our business.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And just as a quick follow-up on that. You use the term \"line of sight\". Does that imply maybe a 1- to 3-year timeframe to get back to investment grade, or might you consider sort of 3 to 5?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes. You know me, Harry. My vision isn't really good. I wear glasses. My line of sight is probably a little bit shorter than other people. So the 1 to 3 is probably more like what I would think about as line of sight. But again, we're not talking about anything specific. This is just kind of theoretical. And to your point, Harry, it's a very -- you've phrased your question well, have we and the board talked about it. Because I have a very active board with some terrifically bright people who are constantly questioning and pushing what we're doing and how we're going to achieve continued growth over the next 5 to 10 years, and obviously, M&A is part of who we are. So they costly want to be updated and involved and make sure that we're looking at everything. So we have a great, engaged group.", "Operator", "At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the speakers.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay. Well, thank you all very much for your time and attention today. And I just have one other reminder, and that is to remember to tune in to the Wyndham Championship, August 14 through 17, broadcast from Greensboro, North Carolina. We look forward to seeing you there. But also, enjoy the rest of your summer. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Before we get started I want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward looking information that is subject to a number of risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-Q filed May 7, 2009, with the SEC. ", "We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these measures to comparable GAAP measures is provided in the tables to the press release and is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.WyndhamWorldwide.com.  ", "Steve Holmes", "As we are approaching our third anniversary as a public company and we are pleased to report that the diversified resilient business model we described three years ago has performed as we expected despite difficult economic conditions. Wyndham Worldwide delivered second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.41 at the top of our guidance. These results were achieved despite $0.04 of unfavorable net foreign currency impact and another $0.02 of higher interest expense resulting from our May 2009 debt issuances.", "A combination of operating efficiencies, technology enhancements and focused cost savings delivered the strong performance in the second quarter and contributed to the over 200 basis point lift in our adjusted margins. In addition, cash from operating activities was $249 million for the quarter compared with $111 million in the second quarter of last year. Excluding any contingent liabilities our 2010 target of $500 million of total cash flow or $2.70 per share remains in place.", "Let me take you through the performance of the business units beginning with the Hotel group. Revenues were down 13% and EBITDA was down 19%, primarily due to expected industry wide RevPAR declines and lower other franchise fees. Given the environment we believe our second quarter results were solid. Our worldwide and international RevPAR were down 15% and 18% respectively in constant currency. Domestic RevPAR decreased 14% from year ago compared with a 20% decline industry wide.", "These results reflect overall demand weakness offset by the strength of our portfolio distribution. With almost 75% of our domestic portfolio in the economy segment, which is outperforming the industry as a whole right now, we have been able to mitigate a good bit of the industry\u2019s pricing pressure and capture a significant share of market demand.", "We believe we are also benefiting from the consumer taking shorter vacations, more often at locations on an Interstate or in small metro areas as opposed to fly to urban or resort locations. This travel pattern fits well with our domestic portfolio distribution as more than half of our properties are located in these areas.", "To help our franchisees and owners manage through this environment we have put several programs in place. We\u2019ve implemented a new call transfer program where property direct reservation calls are transferred to our professionally trained reservation agents at one of our call centers. The program has shown strong reservation conversion rates as well as higher ADRs then what is typically achieved on property. ", "We\u2019re offering third party leasing options for property management system upgrades and critical FF&E items. We\u2019ve also intensified negotiations with key suppliers to help drive savings to our franchisees. We\u2019ve deployed a greater percentage of our advertising dollar budget online which is where we feel these dollars can make the largest impact for our franchisees and owners in this environment.", "In the second quarter we opened 12,200 new rooms, down slightly from a year ago but strong in this environment. The increase in conversions from independent brands we experienced last quarter continued in the second quarter. Smith Travel Research reported a 20% RevPAR decline for independent hotels so it\u2019s no surprise that more operators are seeking a strong brand name with access to a full scale distribution platform.", "With the breadth of our brand portfolio from upscale Wyndham resorts to budget Knights Inn we can easily find the solution for most hotel owners. We are also able to offer existing franchisees options when they are looking to trade flats.", "We ended the quarter with over 590,000 hotel rooms. The development pipeline includes approximately 111,000 rooms of which 41% are international and approximately 20% are Wyndham branded, reflecting strong traction and our commitment to these two important growth areas.", "Over 350 owners, managers, and staff recently attended the Wyndham Hotel\u2019s and Resort Conference at the Rio Mar in Puerto Rico where we announced that the brand\u2019s footprint would be expanded by affiliating it with the mid-scale Extended Stay Hawthorne Suites. The affiliation is designed to reach a broader consumer base and leverage marketing, sales and training, creating a combined Wyndham brand that will encompass close to 350 hotels and over 150 vacation ownership resorts totaling 71,770 rooms and units.", "We further solidified our leading position in China this quarter by surpassing 30,000 rooms and adding China Southern Airline, the largest Asian airline to our loyalty program. We\u2019re also very excited about opening our first managed hotel in China, the 588 room five star Wyndham Xiamen hotel. We have a solid pipeline of high quality assets and a number of new initiatives that we are just getting off the ground which will continue to strengthen this brand.", "Of course, focusing on quality customer service and satisfaction is always important. Just this week Microtel was ranked the highest in guest satisfaction among the economy hotel chains by JD Power for the eighth straight year. Much to our delight the Wyndham Hotels and Resort brand moved into second place in the upscale hotel segment up from ninth place in 2008.", "Now turning to vacation exchange and rentals. Group RCI delivered extremely strong second quarter results and continued to innovate on the technology front, launching several new web based innovations aimed at increasing web share and reducing costs. Excluding the net effect of foreign currency impacts, Group RCI revenue was relatively flat, while continue cost reduction efforts drove a 30% increase in adjusted EBITDA. On a reported basis declines in the Euro and British Pound relative to the dollar resulted in revenue declining 11% compared with the prior year. Yet adjusted EBITDA was up 7% primarily due to these cost saving efforts.", "In the Vacation Exchange business second quarter revenue was relatively flat on a constant currency basis and down 6% on a reported basis. Member growth was 3% reflecting the addition of the Disney Vacation Club earlier this year. The average number of members excluding Disney was relatively consistent with the prior year and in line with expectations, as our member retention rate for the second quarter of 2009 was 97% consistent with last year.", "Growth in average members was offset by a 4% reduction in annual dues and exchange revenue per member in constant currency. The reduction in revenue per member primarily reflects the impact of clubs where members also have the option to exchange within their club network. While those clubs reduce our revenue per member metric RCI benefits from incremental subscription and other ancillary revenues earned from club members and our time share developer partners.", "The decline in revenue per member was partly offset by higher transaction fees as we increased pricing for call center transactions while holding web prices constant to encourage members to transact with us on the web. RCI continues to add new developer affiliates to its network signing more than a dozen new affiliations since the end of the first quarter. ", "RCI was very pleased to sign multi-year agreements with Country Heights Palace Vacation Club of Malaysia whose resorts include the award winning luxurious Palace of the Golden Horses in Kuala Lumpur. Also with Fairmont Resort Properties of Canada signing up and with Sea Links Golf and Country Club one of Vietnam\u2019s leading luxury golf resorts which became RCI\u2019s first affiliation in Vietnam. These affiliations reflect our commitment to offer our members the best vacation options around the world.", "Building on the first quarter launch of RCI TV and dramatically extended digital photography RCI took the search experience to a new level in the second quarter. RCI members can now search exchange and rental options simultaneously. Affiliate and member feedback from their online experience with these innovations has been extremely positive. ", "These efforts continued to increase web share with North America web rental and exchange transactions for the second quarter reaching 42% and 27% respectively, up 14% and 11% each compared with last year. This shift in transactions to the web reduced call center costs by approximately $2 million compared with the second quarter of last year. ", "In Group RCI\u2019s rental business, second quarter revenues were up 5% on a constant currency basis and down 10% on a reported basis. Transaction volumes were up 2% reflecting the benefits of the Easter holiday occurring in the second quarter this year compared with the first quarter last year. With notable strength in our Landal GreenParks business.", "We also saw a significant increase in rental bookings in June focused on high season summer inventory as consumers who had postponed vacation decisions finalized their plans. In constant currency average net price per rental was up 3% in the second quarter of 2009. Online share for the European rental businesses reached 53% of transactions up four points compared with the second quarter of last year.", "Our European rentals businesses continued to successfully add new rental properties. Of note in the second quarter our Novasol Danish business signed an agreement to be the sole rental representative for a new 375 unit Holiday Park in Germany called Tropical Island. The park, which does not require any capital investment from Novasol or Wyndham Worldwide, will feature a water themed central facility surrounded by holiday cottages that will be available beginning in late 2010. Novasol was selected by the developer due to its strong marketing and brand presence in Northern Europe.", "Looking forward, Group RCI is well positioned to deliver results within original guidance for the year. While we anticipate further benefit from cost efficiencies from our restructuring we will begin to lap savings that started in Q3 of last year. In the upcoming months we will continue to introduce new technology innovation to drive transactions to the web and reduce costs, increased efficiencies and improve customer experience.", "Now let\u2019s turn to our Vacation Ownership business which continued to perform well following significant changes to its business model at the beginning of 2009. Tour flow is tracking to plan and sales efficiencies exceeded our expectations with volume per guest up 17%. Both close rates and pricing are strong. A higher percentage of our tours are buying our product and we are now discounting. All the while we are increasing the FICO score of our buyers and requiring more cash down. ", "Consumers clearly understand the value proposition of our flexible point\u2019s based time share product, especially in this environment as is evidenced by no softening in demand for time share among our targeted customers. When touring our properties visitors witness hundreds of families enjoying vacations and as our well seasoned sales professionals will tell you purchasing a time share today is about protecting future vacations and this resonates strongly at the sales table.", "Our points based product provides greater flexibility then the traditional fixed week products as it enables our owners to take multiple shorter vacations at a variety of locations throughout the year. Visibility is well match current consumer behavior and our owners appear to be taking full advantage of our model. With second quarter 2009 resort occupancy running about 80% slightly higher then the second quarter 2008 even with the addition of over 650 new units since that time. Our advance reservations are also running at levels comparable to last year.", "We continue to broaden our travel options and in late June we added the Wyndham Canterbury in San Francisco to our portfolio of more than 150 resorts. This 115 unit resort is located within walking distance to historic Union Square. Our robust urban portfolio now includes approximately 20 resorts in major metropolitan destinations throughout the United States, Canada and Australia and is particularly well suited to the shorter stays enabled only through a points based system.", "As we continue to execute within this very challenging environment we seek to further leverage the strength and scale of our business by capitalizing on available real estate assets in the marketplace. After several months of careful analysis and development we believe we are uniquely positioned to successfully launch a fee for service time share model with little or no capital deployment on our part. Our new asset affiliation model is designed to provide a turn key solution for developers and/or banks in possession of completed unsold unused condo or hotel inventory.", "WVO would use its existing sales and marketing distribution channels to sell already constructed inventory for a fee as points based Wyndham time share. Consumer loan originations that occur in conjunction with these sales will be funded by the original developer or bank in possession of the inventory or another third party.", "The consumer becomes a new Wyndham time share owner and we obtain resort management contracts at these properties. With multiple deals in the pipeline we expect to announce our first applications of the model later this year. If successful, we will aggressively pursue additional opportunistic deals afforded by the market environment.", "Finally, you may recall that our Wyndham Vacation Resorts brand recently launched an enhanced club product called Club Wyndham Access. The launch has been very well received by our prospective customers. This new product has many enhancements including consistent maintenance fees, ease in deeding and inventory which is completed prior to deeding to the club and sale to consumers which effectively eliminate deferred revenue.", "We anticipate this will result in less complexity and volatility VOI revenue recognition and related earnings. Especially as we fully transition our Wyndham Vacation Resort sales program to Club Wyndham Access.", "In summary, we are very pleased with how this business is quickly and effectively responded to the challenges of this economy. We have a number of innovations underway which are designed to fine tune the business model and drive non-capital intensive growth. We remain confident in the ability of the VOI business to perform through the balance of the year and beyond.", "Now let me turn the call over to our CFO, Gina Wilson", "Gina Wilson", "As you saw from the press release this morning we reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.41 reflecting particularly strong results in Group RCI and continued strength in vacation ownership efficiencies against the backdrop of a difficult lodging environment. Second quarters revenues benefited from a $37 million roll in from deferred revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting, compared with the $5 million reduction in the second quarter of 2008. ", "The net year over year impact was a benefit of about $20 million in EBITDA. We expect little if any impact from percent of complete deferred revenue from 2010 which will be important for you to remember as you model next year and which will make 2010 revenue and EBITDA comparisons more difficult.", "As Steve mentioned overall margins were strong supported by our continued cost containment efforts which we expect will deliver savings of approximately $170 million in 2009. As I\u2019ll elaborate in a moment, we are reiterating our guidance for 2009 revenue and adjusted EBITDA despite a volatile economic environment. Based on a significant increase in interest expense from our recent corporate borrowings we expect adjusted EPS will be in the lower half of that range.", "Now let me walk you through the second quarter 2009 results in more detail. Revenue and EBITDA in the Hotel Group reflected a difficult economic and operating environment although our RevPAR performance continued to outperform the overall industry average. Lodging margins were down from last year reflecting the impact of lower franchise fees primarily driven by RevPAR declines as well as lower transfer and termination fees. ", "We are reducing our RevPAR guidance for 2009 down to 12% to 14% for the year. While we believe we are seeing signs of RevPAR stabilization we are seeing continued international weakness and we now expect that it will take longer for the declines to moderate. In addition, the second quarter benefited from the timing of almost $3 million in marketing expenses that we expect to reverse in the second half of the year.", "Room growth continues to reflect a slower start then we expected with openings taking longer to occur. Based on this trend we expect to be at the lower end of our room growth guidance range of 3% to 6%. We\u2019re adjusting revenue and EBITDA guidance in lodging for the full year 2009 by $50 million and $10 million respectively to a new revenue range of $670 to $710 million and an EBITDA range of $190 to $220 million.", "Now turning to Vacation Exchange and Rentals. Group RCI\u2019s reported results included $2 million pre-tax and restructuring charges. We\u2019re now finished with restructuring activities that we started in the third quarter of last year. As Steve mentioned, excluding the net impact of foreign currency Group RCI revenues for the quarter was relatively flat while adjusted EBITDA increased 30% compared to the second quarter of 2008.", "The net impact from foreign currency movements in Q2 2009 reduced reported revenues by $31 million and EBITDA by $12 million compared with the prior year. Adjusted margins improved approximately 350 basis points reflecting the restructure related savings and continued cost control. RCI benefit in the second quarter from a full quarter of these cost containment efforts and we don\u2019t expect this trend of margin improvement to continue through the remainder of this year since we began to realize some of those savings related to cost containment in the third quarter of 2008.", "Additionally, RCI\u2019s exchange revenue benefited from members transacting earlier in the year then in prior years which was tied to the June launch of technology enhancements. We believe this pulled some transactions forward from Q3 into Q2\u201909. RCI\u2019s drivers are tracking to plan and there\u2019s no change to our guidance in this segment.", "Now let\u2019s turn to our Vacation Ownership business. Sales and EBITDA were again ahead of plan. Excluding the impact of deferred revenue margins improved approximately 200 basis points. As Steve discussed, pricing and close rates remain strong with VPG up 17% this quarter. We expect this trend to continue and are increasing our VPG guidance to 10% to 15% for the year up from our previous guidance of 5% to 10%.", "We are increasing WVO\u2019s revenue guidance by $50 million to a range of $1.75 to $2.05 billion and EBITDA guidance by $10 million to a range of $335 to $385 million. On the consumer financing front the provision for loan loss was $122 million consistent relative to gross sales plus the impact of deferred revenues since the fourth quarter of last year.", "Write offs in the second quarter were at 3.43% of the loan portfolio, also relatively consistent and the securitizations continue to perform within their expected tolerances. We continue to see some good trends in the portfolio as delinquency and default rates have stabilized since the fourth quarter of last year and we\u2019ll keep watching it closely.", "We continue to make great progress in executing on our plan to generate additional cash flow within the Vacation Ownership business. During the second quarter we successfully increased our average down payment in North America to over 20% up from 12% a year ago. Cash generated at the time of sale increased 55% and we financed 56% of VOI sales in the second quarter compared to 66% in the second quarter of last year. Additionally, the weighted average FICO of our 2009 second quarter borrowers was 735 points compared to 708 in Q2 of last year.", "We closed a $225 million term securitization in May. The advance rate was 54% and the coupon was 9.79%. These terms are similar to the conduit and therefore are earnings and cash flow neutral. In addition, we closed a $50 million term securitization in June with a coupon of 9%. We were pleased with the execution of both of these deals providing further evidence that the term securitization market is improving.", "We also completed the renewal of our secured revolving credit facility in Australia used to support our Vacation Ownership operations in the South Pacific. This facility is appropriately sized for our current sales plans and the final advance rate and funding costs were within our expectations and reflected in our guidance.", "Finally, regarding new accounting rules that may affect asset backed issuers including those in the time share industry. We\u2019ve received a number of questions regarding the potential impact of FAS 166 and 167 which will require the consolidation most securitizations on balance sheet. Wyndham Worldwide brought its securitizations on balance sheet in 2003 and we expect absolutely no impact to our earnings and no change to our financing reporting or operations related to the proposed rules.", "On the Corporate side we issued $250 million of senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 9.875% and $230 million of convertible notes with a coupon of 3.5% during the quarter. These offerings enhance our capital structure by shifting some short term maturities to mid-term maturities. We used the net proceeds to reduce the principal balance outstanding on our revolving credit facility. The net incremental GAAP expense in 2009 is approximately $25 million which will bring full year interest expense to approximately $105 million and reduce our adjusted EPS for the year by approximately $0.09.", "The full year impact in 2010 will be approximately $45 million or $0.15. GAAP rules require us to recognize interest expense on the convertible securities at the effective interest rate of the senior unsecured notes which is 11% rather than the cash coupon rate. The incremental cash interest expense is approximately $15 million this year and $27 million next year.", "We generated net cash from operating activities of approximately $249 million in the second quarter of 2009 compared with approximately $111 million in the prior year period. We had approximately $840 million of capacity on the corporate revolver at the end of the second quarter in 2009 compared with approximately $290 million as of 12/31/2008 reflecting the use of proceeds from the senior unsecured and convertible notes and a portion of the free cash flow to reduce to revolver balance.", "We remain well within our debt covenants which require consolidated leverage ratio of less than 3.5 and an interest coverage ratio of more than 3 as defined in the debt agreement. At the end of the second quarter our consolidated leverage ratio was 2.1 and our interest coverage ratio was 25.3 so we have plenty of room on both covenants.", "The tax rate for the quarter was, as expected, 44% reflecting a true up of a deferred tax asset related to our non-cash compensation from restricted stock units. We expect the full rate to be approximately 39% as the rate in the third and fourth quarters return to lower levels. ", "To increase transparency and give you a better understanding of the economics of our business we\u2019ve added revenue details to table four of the press release. I\u2019d like to take a minute to highlight one of the lines in that table, our Vacation Ownership Property Management Services, which provides ongoing management and reservation systems, resort operations, comprehensive financial services, quality assurance and more to 800,000 plus time share owners and 200 home owner associations.", "This important component of Vacation Ownership business which operates on a fee for service model is a stable and predicable source of income which will account for approximately 20% of total revenues in \u201909 and margin in excess of 10% for WVO. ", "Again, we are reiterating our 2009 revenue, EBITDA and EPS guidance ranges although based on the higher interest expense from the senior unsecured and convertible notes, weighted average shares of $181 million and the economic environment, we now expect to be in the lower half of the EPS range. We\u2019ll post the full guidance to the website right after the call today.", "In the third quarter we expect EPS of $0.53 to $0.57 assuming a $25 to $35 million benefit from the roll in of deferred revenues in Vacation Ownership and a weighted average share count of 182 million shares. We expect the fourth quarter deferred revenue in Vacation Ownership to be $40 to $50 million.", "Before turning it back to Steve I want to tell you how proud I am of what Wyndham has accomplished during these last three years, especially this last year. I have enjoyed working with my colleagues here and all of our other constituents including those of you listening today. As you know, I\u2019ll be at the company for a while longer but expect that this will be my last earnings call at Wyndham Worldwide. I look forward to following the company\u2019s progress as a shareholder and offer my best wishes to the entire Wyndham Worldwide family and to all of you.", "Now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Steve to wrap up.", "Steve Holmes", "I really want to thank Gina for many contributions to Wyndham Worldwide. She was instrumental in many of our successes during the past three years including our transition to public ownership and establishing robust financial and technology platforms to support our future growth.", "Now let me go ahead and answer questions some of you may have as we\u2019ve gotten this question before. We\u2019ve retained Chris Colder, a Specialist in CFO recruitment and we are actively engaged in the search process.", "Before we open the lines to questions I\u2019d like to make a few closing comments. While there are some modest signs of improvement in the economy and the capital markets have stabilized a bit, visibility for the economy and our business continues to be limited and there is still a lot of debate about what the eventual economic recovery will look like.", "As a result we\u2019re continuing to manage the business with a focus on efficiency, flexibility and liquidity and always with an eye towards being in the best possible position for the recovery. I believe this approach is serving us well in all of our businesses, in our Hotel Group, our value oriented hotel brands are allowing us to outperform tiers and RevPAR. ", "In our Group RCI business we continue to improve the customer experience and reduce transaction costs by driving more and more transactions through the web. In our Vacation Ownership business we completed two receivable financing transactions this quarter and are introducing innovations designed to fine tune the business model and drive non-capital intensive growth. ", "Our recent employee opinion survey results indicate that our associates are more engaged and motivated than ever. Even during this difficult economic climate our associates remain energized and proud to work for Wyndham Worldwide. Together we are focused on delivering shareholder value both in the near and long term.", "With that we\u2019ll open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Joe\u00a0Greff \u2013 JP Morgan", "Joe\u00a0Greff \u2013 JP Morgan", "Looking at the second quarter and seeing the nice results in volume per guest can you help us understand that a little bit better, is that concentrated in a few markets, is it geography, is it a greater percentage to repeat buyers or is it just a mix shift in that you guys are going after higher quality, more credit worthy customers? ", "My second question if I can have a follow up on this question here, regarding the fee for service vacation ownership business model, the asset affiliation model, can you help us understand sort of what the economic are to you broadly for the resort management contract associated with that business?", "Steve Holmes", "On the improved volume per guest which just as a reminder we also saw in the first quarter of this year, I think there are a number of factors contributing to it. Remember we took our sales volume down intentionally when the credit markets kind of seized up and we decided to lower our sales pace. When we did that we did have to shut down unfortunately some offices which frankly were profitable offices but which in some cases didn\u2019t have the highest productivity. I think we\u2019ve benefited in part by removing some of the weaker offices.", "Having said that the fundamental results within same store offices is also very impressive and its up. I think is really a matter of a very focused effort to make sure the consumer\u2019s understanding this flexible point based product we have and matching it up to exactly what they\u2019re looking for. So we did see close rate increase which is the number of tours coming in that end up buying and we saw an increase in that as well as increase in pricing. ", "Both of those I think are attributable to maybe a more focused effort for the sales organization and a continuation of our ability to show the consumer how this product meets their lifestyle. That\u2019s really fundamentally it, it\u2019s a great execution. I think that there may be some lift due to, as you pointed out, that our FICO score increased but we\u2019re also asking people to make larger down payments. Our down payments are in the range of 20% now and that\u2019s a significant increase from where we were a year ago or even six months ago. I think its terrific execution at the time share business.", "With respect to the fee for service model, our asset affiliation model, the way the economics work is we will work with a developer or a bank if a bank has taken over for a developer and we will become their sales and marketing arm. For that we will receive a sales and marketing fee that will cover our costs to market the tours to come in and to execute in selling the product and paying our sales force.", "That will be basically our main profit center from this activity. As opposed to having revenues for the total sale of the product and the cost of the product that we\u2019re selling we will receive a sales and marketing commission. In addition then as you point out we will have the property management of the resort as they become Wyndham vacation resorts properties. For that, the economics are very attractive, we do make a profit on that, as we pointed out, we\u2019re breaking that out now on table four so people can see it clearly. That will be the profit that comes out of the property management side.", "In addition, just a third piece of it is for the loans that are generated even if we\u2019re not holding those loans or doing the securitizations its anticipated that we will be loan servicer. Those are owners who bought our product, we want to make sure that we maintain the relationship with them and we are set up with a just world class loan servicing operation out in Las Vegas that we will lever to service those receivables as well. So that\u2019s kind of the third line of profit from this venture.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Will Truelove \u2013 UBS", "Will Truelove \u2013 UBS", "My first question is regarding the GAAP franchise fee of $117 million in the second quarter. I appreciate the additional disclosure on the revenues but I couldn\u2019t figure out by look at the lodging or some of the other breakouts exactly how you get to $117 million from the various buckets. My follow up question would be the club concept in filling time share. Will that standardize the sales process and perhaps lower your marketing expenses going forward?", "Steve Holmes", "We\u2019re happy to get back with you in reconciling numbers that you have specific. Off the top of my head I think that the once piece that probably is not broken out separately that we have some other franchise fees, other fees that include the Wyndham Rewards fees that we get when we issue Wyndham Rewards points. We\u2019ll come back with specifics if there\u2019s anything else. My guess is its just kind of another category or miscellaneous category. It would include the Wyndham Rewards fees.", "With respect to the club concept, Club Wyndham Access does provide some greater consistency in the sales process by one of the things it creates a consistent maintenance fee across the entire club. This club concept is somewhat similar to what we\u2019ve had in World mark for quite some time, it was the way that product was designed years ago and it just makes it a little bit easier at the sales table to be selling something that always has the same maintenance fee regardless of where the product happens to be located that\u2019s just one of the features.", "I don\u2019t know that it will necessarily reduce our marketing costs. We have a very, very focused concerted effort at driving down our marketing costs, that\u2019s one of the opportunities that we think we will capture and that we know we\u2019ve begun to capture by using the Wyndham brand as the umbrella brand for our time share business.", "Whether it\u2019s because we have a product that is maybe a little more consistent at the sales table or it\u2019s because the marketing is focused by using the Wyndham brand we would try to drive down those marketing costs and we try to see some benefit. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll be able to define for you which is which.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Patrick Scholes \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Patrick Scholes \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "With all of the restructuring and downsizing in the Vacation Ownership business over the past year how should we begin to think about what 2010 EBITDA is going to look like for that segment?", "Steve Holmes", "We would expect to maintain the savings that we achieved through the restructuring so we would expect that our base cost of G&A and the other costs that were cut down, sales and marketing will stay down at that lower level because it\u2019s anticipated that our sales pace will not go swelling back up to $2 billion. We\u2019re assuming that we\u2019re going to stay around the $1.2 billion maybe grow it more moderately going forward.", "The one thing that won\u2019t be repeated that Gina mentioned in her comments was we do have deferred revenue that we\u2019ve recognized this year and I think for the full year it\u2019s in the neighborhood of $170 to $190 million. That won\u2019t be repeated next year, that revenue piece won\u2019t be repeated next year because we\u2019re moving to this non-deferred revenue model that we\u2019ve developed. I think that\u2019s probably the larger impact on 2010.", "We have not yet given guidance for 2010 because we\u2019re just not there yet, there\u2019s not enough visibility into the future. We don\u2019t want to be making that call right now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Woronka \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Chris Woronka \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "We\u2019ve always kind of talked about how you eventually plan for a recovery in the time share business and I\u2019m just curious as to whether this new affiliation model may be kind of replaced with some of the ground up development or the hard CapEx that you\u2019d have to put in. If that\u2019s true I guess the other part o the question is how much inventory you still have an maybe how much months or years of supply you think that is? Just trying to get a sense of how this is all going to balance out over maybe a three to five year period?", "Steve Holmes", "Three to five years is a lifetime so I\u2019ll try to address it but I don\u2019t know that I can show that kind of precision that far out. Our plan, which we\u2019re still holding to, is that we\u2019ll spend less than $100 million on inventory spend in 2010, that\u2019s what we stated before; we\u2019re still living to that goal. With that spend we have enough inventory to get us through 2010 and into 2011. ", "The asset affiliation model which is really levering somebody else\u2019s assets and really creating an environment where there are frozen assets on the books of developers and banks where they\u2019re having to pay the cost of carry right now by paying taxes and maintenance. We can move those assets for them and shift them from non-performing hard assets into interest paying receivables for them. That process will not require capital on our part or if it does, very little capital. There may be some amenities that we feel need to be added to make the product really work for our customer. It will be limited in its nature.", "Depending on how much of our business can shift to the asset light model we\u2019ll determine in 2011 through the future how much inventory we\u2019re going to need to develop. We, in the past, were developing inventory to move ourselves to Club Wyndham Access and to fuel a 20% plus growth rate, as you know in 2007 and the beginning of 2008. We won\u2019t be back there because we don\u2019t anticipate ramping this business back up to a $2 billion business any time soon.", "Our anticipation would be that we\u2019ll continue to grow the business for efficiency, run the business for efficiency, definitely run it for cash flow and we\u2019ll decide what that spend looks like based on how the asset affiliation model works and what we see is the future growth beyond 2011 for that business.", "Chris Woronka \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "On the lodging side we have talked about potential brand acquisition opportunities. Do you feel like the capital markets in your company\u2019s liquidity are at a point now where you might be comfortable taking a look at something if it looks really attractive?", "Steve Holmes", "Our liquidity is terrific, as we\u2019ve said, as Gina mentioned, we did the senior note financings that gave us a little bit more of a mid-term maturities to our debt so we\u2019re very comfortable on the liquidity. With respect, do acquisitions make sense at this time. The fact is you can\u2019t really try to forecast opportunity. We don\u2019t know what will become available, when it will become available and at what price and how attractive it is. ", "Could we do something now? Presumably we could. I don\u2019t think it would be a large transaction but if there was something that was of the right size for us that we thought we could really deliver at an attractive creation multiple for us and would add to our portfolio there would be nothing stopping us from doing that right now. We\u2019re not out hunting and looking, we\u2019re basically, as we always are in the market evaluating opportunities and looking to see how we can grow our business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research Associates", "Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research Associates", "More questions on time share, could you compare profitability both up front and lifetime for new customers or new acquisitions compared with existing acquisitions? Related to that, give us some idea of how much of the sales are now going to existing versus new? ", "The second question is when you look at some of the numbers we\u2019re seeing that there\u2019s very substantial benefits from the current system it looks like even though sales are down financing is up 5% income, cost of VOI is down 60%, property management fees were up 12%, ancillary revenues were up 15%. Is there very short lived or can this continue?", "Steve Holmes", "Let me get a little bit of clarification, the first question when you talked about new acquisitions versus existing are you talking about product that we\u2019re acquiring or building?", "Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research Associates", "No, I\u2019m talking about the customer.", "Steve Holmes", "We had probably slightly more existing customer sales then new sales this quarter. I think we were just around 60% of selling to existing customers. I think the last time we reported I want to say we were around 50% or 55% so its up a little bit, not a whole lot. The cost of selling to an existing customer the profit on that is the higher profit because you don\u2019t incur as much marketing expense. You still have marking expense but its not quite as high so that is helpful to the mix and frankly I think that may have been part of the question that Joe asked in the first question, I may not have gotten around to that part of the answer.", "To the second piece which is breaking the pieces of the Vacation Ownership business and looking at it and looking at various elements of growth. There are pieces in this business model and that\u2019s part of the reason we created table four, that I\u2019m not sure everyone appreciated which was the very, very stable property management businesses that we have where we manage those 140 resorts around the world. ", "That is a profitable business for us; it\u2019s a very stable part of our portfolio and as the time share sales component shrunk from $2 billion down to $1.2 billion that component did not shrink so it became a larger portion of the overall profitability of the time share business. That will be a larger piece going forward. Its kind of like the property management and hotel but its actually more stable because its not driven by revenue its just driven by how many units, how many resorts you\u2019re managing.", "With respect to consumer finance I think the reason that consumer finance was up is probably because the portfolio has been growing over the last several quarters and we continue to see the portfolio grow and we\u2019re adding to it. I would expect that to moderate over time as we level off our sales at the $1.2 billion range but also as we take in more cash at the time of sale which obviously means we\u2019re financing less a the sales table.", "Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research Associates", "The property cost was down about 60% is that simply you\u2019ve taken in the deferred revenue?", "Steve Holmes", "There are a couple of things in there. One its impacted by the fact that we aren\u2019t selling as much so we took our sales pace down which is a portion of it. It\u2019s also in part the product that\u2019s been put into it, the different developments that we have and the assets that we put into it. Also we do, and I think we\u2019ve walked through this before, when we have loan losses we have a recovery for the loan losses that run through our cost of sales which also impact. There are a number of factors going into it.", "I think from a business perspective the way to look at it is we\u2019re maintaining a 25% or less cost of sales when you look at it on a project by project basis which has been our target and we continue to execute on that. In an environment where product cost is basically real estate has come down and our pricing hasn\u2019t gone down to the consumer I would expect that over time to go down if we got back in the market buying inventory. We may not be buying as much inventory due to our asset affiliation model.", "Operator", "I\u2019m showing no questions at this time.", "Steve Holmes", "Thank you very much and thank you all for joining us today and we\u2019re looking forward to discussing our next quarter with you on the next quarterly call. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "That concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Wilson - EVP and CFO", "", "Analysts", "", "William Truelove - UBS Research", "Joseph Greff - Bear Stearns", "Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs", "Michael Millman - Soleil Securities", "Jake Fuller - Thomas Weisel Partners", "", "", "", "Operator", "", "Good morning and welcome the Wyndham Worldwide Third Quarter 2007 Earnings Call. Throughout today's presentation, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "", "I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Steve Holmes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Wyndham Worldwide. Sir, you may begin.", "", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "Thank you Rosie, and good morning and welcome to the third quarter 2007 Wyndham Worldwide conference call. With me today are Gina Wilson, our Chief Financial Officer and Margo Happer, our Investors Relations Officer. Thanks for joining us.", "", "Before we started, I'd just wanted to remind you there our remarks contain forward-looking information that is subject to a number of risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking information. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K, filed March 7, 2007, with the SEC.", "", "We'll also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures which are discussed in the press release, and which Gina will touch on, in her comments. The reconciliation of these measures to the comparable GAAP measures is provided in the tables to the press release, which is available on the Investor Relations section of our website, at wyndhamworldwide.com.", "", "As you saw it in the press release, we had another strong quarter. We delivered our fifth straight quarter of solid results as an independent company, with reported earnings per share of $0.65 and adjusted EPS of $0.75. We continued to successfully execute our growth strategy, leveraging the Wyndham brand, expanding internationally and acquiring new customers.", "", "Let me review our results. The Hotel Group continues to strengthen its position as an integrated international franchise and management company with a platform for sustainable growth, based on a full spectrum of well-defined brands. Results in lodging were right in line with our plan, with revenues of $211 million and EBITDA of $70 million. We continue to make good progress on our strategic initiatives, which includes building our strength in the economy in mid-scale segments, leveraging the upscale Wyndham brand, and expanding our international presence.", "", "We continue to drive value to our franchisees through strong brand management and enhanced marketing programs, as evidenced by RevPAR gains that consistently outperformed our peer set. System-wide RevPAR for the third quarter of 2007 increased 5.6% from last year, and comparable RevPAR was up 6.2%. Overall system growth is steady and we are on-track for net room growth around 2% this year. That said, we are below our target for weighted average rooms, principally due to timing issues. It's taking us a little longer than we had anticipated to complete permitting, QA [Quality Assurance] and other issues in international regions, and as a result we are experiencing some shifting versus our prior expectations, as to when these properties will come into the system. However, we are confident in our ability to reach our long-term goals. These properties will open just a little later than we had originally expected.", "", "Deal flow in the quarter continue to be solid, with a 174 contracts signed and the pipeline is strong, with over 104,000 rooms, of which 45% are new construction. Interest in our brands continues to grow, as evidenced by a 22% increase in our pipeline, since this time last year.", "", "We continue to grow the Wyndham Hotel and Resorts brand. We had a number of recent Wyndham openings, most notably in Panama City, Panama where we now have a 300 room five star luxury hotel in the heart of Panama's financial district; In Cozumel, Mexico where the 400 room Wyndham Cozumel Resort and Spa became the first Wyndham on the Island; and in Princeton, New Jersey, where we opened the Wyndham Princeton Forrestal Hotel & Conference Center, with 360 guest rooms and 60 meeting rooms.", "", "We have also lead the Hotel Resort portfolio, adding 11 new properties for a total of 23 resorts in some great locations like Acapulco, Cozumel, Puerto Rico, St. Thomas, St. Maarten, Puerto Earache [ph] and the Bahamas. Our resort portfolio now offers significant variety to effectively compete in this segment and remains a key focus of the Wyndham brand strategy. We recently held a conference for Wyndham owners, managers and prospective clients, where we outlined a three-pronged strategy to continue our expansion efforts, to improve guest satisfaction and to enhance brand value through a new marketing plan targeting GenX customers. We saw a dramatic increase in attendance since our last conference, which was late in 2005, shortly after we acquire the Wyndham brands.", "", "The conference was held at the Wyndham Rio Mar; the crown jewel of our development efforts this year, which now includes a recently opened Timeshare's sale office as well. The Wyndham brand pipeline continues to strengthen, more than doubling in the past year and now represents close to 25% of our total pipeline. We believe that we are in excellent position to increase the global footprint of this brand. We are also making progress on the hotel management front.", "", "RevPAR increased 14.3% at company managed hotels, demonstrating our ability to bring value to the system and drive better performance for the property owners. Despite the delays in openings that I mentioned earlier, our international expansion remains firmly on-track. International deals represent 30% of the pipeline. We continued to enjoy rapid expansion in China, a market that the World Travel and Tourism Council has predicted will become, the second largest travel in tourism economy in the world by 2016, and where we already have more hotels than any other U.S. hotel company.", "", "One indication of the value of Super 8 brand in China, is Aetos Capital announce in late August that it would invest up to $50 million in Tian Rui Hotel Investment Corporation, the master franchise of Super 8, to accelerate hotel development in China. This will give Tian Rui and us, the ability to expand and accelerate the growth of the Super 8 brand in this important market from a very strong base of 54 hotels open right now, and 40 under development.", "", "Now, turning to the vacation exchange and rentals; Revenues and EBITDA at Group RCI were $336 million and $103 million, slightly below our expectations. While we are pleased with growth in the number of new exchange members, annual bills and exchange revenue per member was dampened by the timing of mix of exchange deposits versus last year, primarily reflecting the lapping effect of some marketing programs, which resulted in high interval deposits in the third quarter of 2006. While there are no fundamental changes in the trends of this part of the business, we believe, we have some opportunities to improve the business by further leveraging our growing membership base, improving inventory management and better utilizing customer service, to boost exchange transactions.", "", "As we reported earlier this year, we launched an enhanced version of our Points product which is showing early positive results. Many of the enhancements are Web based. We're actively working on the best use of technology and the Internet across the business, as a means to increase inventory utilization, enhanced customer satisfaction and ultimately improved margin. We're in the process of testing a new member rental platform that will rollout in November, and it's a significant improvement for the current site. We expect it will help us manage inventory more effectively and help members understand the breadth of what RCI has to offer.", "", "Another exchange area that's been expanding is in luxury exchange product. Our registry collection leverages the global growth trends in fractionals and private residence clubs. The registry collection exchange program is the industry's first and largest global exchange network of luxury vacation accommodation. It includes high-end vacation ownership resorts, fractional ownership resorts and condo hotels around the world. We now have more than 120 affiliates, 9 of which were signed in the third quarter, at which our beats [ph] are more than 24,000 registry collection members can exchange. Today the pipeline consists of over 200 projects throughout all regions.", "", "In the rental business, overall performance was strong driven by higher net price per vacation rental up 14%, which was supported by mix and favorable currency translations. We booked approximately 360,000 transactions up 1% from last year. The Novasol and Landal brands continued their strong performance, while the UK business saw some softness from the unusually severe summer rains in the UK.", "", "As we told you on our last call, expanding our rental capability is a core Group RCI strategy. We have a strong and growing base in Europe where rentals account for close to 25% of the vacation accommodations and we are looking to grow the rental business in the Americas region as well. To maintain growth and bringing leadership to the rentals category in the U.S, we need to further invest in and expand our rental capabilities. To that end, we recently formed a strategic alliance with LeisureLink, a premier provider of online distribution for vacation rental properties. The agreement with LeisureLink will increase the online presence of our global condominium and vacation rental inventory via new channels, including online travel agents such as Travelocity, Orbitz and Expedia. The relationships help lays a strong foundation to build a U.S. rental platform.", "", "As you saw in the press release today, Ken May, the President of Group RCI is leaving the business to pursue personal interest. Ken's vision has been instrumental in shaping RCI, I want to personally thank him and wish him well in his future endeavors.", "", "Finally moving on to vacation ownership; revenues and adjusted EBITDA at Wyndham vacation ownership were strong at $671 million and $117 million respectively. Gross VOI sales were up an impressive 15% from last year's third quarter, reflecting solid gains in both sales efficiencies and tour flow. This business remained strong and we continue to be pleased with its performance. As we've been saying, for quite some time now, we like the Timeshare segment for two reasons, growth and resiliency, and we've seen and continue experience growth throughout 2007 as evidenced by strong results in all three quarters.", "", "Moreover, our customers continue to value their ownership, as evidenced by increased occupancy rates in 2007 versus the prior year. Our owners are out there, they are traveling and they are traveling to our locations. This business continues to meet our expectations of delivering solid results and growth.", "", "A big part of our success is the Points system. As we told you in previous calls, Points are an important sales tool. But they also play an important role in our inventory management and development. Because we sale Points-based products, we believe we are well equipped to match sales demand through available inventory. The locations where we develop our Timeshare product are based on owners' preferences, but sold through sales offices throughout the country. Sales are largely independent of physical inventory locations. We can sell our Points-based products from more than 100 offices worldwide, enabling us to better meet customer demand.", "", "Another part of our success is due to our scale and flexible product offerings, which enable us to understand the market as defined by our owners and to anticipate their travel aspirations. For example, many of you may have seen recent press coverage about the popularity of water parks. We saw this trend emerging several years ago and began planning. Nowhere is this trend more apparent than at Glacier Canyon in Wisconsin Dells, which welcomes more than 300 million visitors per year and now supports nearly 1 billion in traveler spending. We recently opened a 102 unit Wyndham Vacation Resort there, the only vacation ownership property located within the complex. The Wisconsin Dells Resort is a one of a kind property that features access to three indoor water parks with more than 200,000 square feet of water activity, as well as several outdoor water parks and other year around activities. Driven by high owner interest for the area, we have already planned for a 99 unit expansion at that resort.", "", "Another hot area for vacation ownership is urban resorts. We entered the urban market in 2000, when we opened our 88 unit property in Alexandria, Virginia. We are now a leader, the leader in this market, with an established portfolio of urban resorts located in San Francisco, Seattle, San Antonio and New Orleans. We have additional projects underway in San Francisco and Prince George's County, Maryland and others are in the planning stages. Urban locations have become popular with our owners as the model fits new travel trends with shorter visits made possible with our Points-based product. This allows owners to split a traditional week of Timeshare in the multiple smaller increments. Not surprisingly, these resorts have some of the highest occupancy rates and some of our most efficient sales offices in our system.", "", "Of course, our destination markets continue to perform well, and we saw particular success in Orlando, Myrtle Beach and Atlantic City. We are constantly seeking to leverage our portfolio and we have the skill to opportunistically build the portfolio. For example, we recently acquired 100 finished vacation ownership units at the Emerald Beach Resort in Panama City Beach, Florida and entered into an agreement to purchase 156 additional units. The new location complements four existing Wyndham Vacation Resorts properties in nearby Destin, Florida, which have always been extremely popular among our owner base and this will provide them with even more vacation options along the Emerald Coast.", "", "On the consumer finance side of the business, the portfolio continues to perform well, and as you saw for the press release today, we have priced a $455 million term securitization, as well as renewed an upside to conduit to $1.2 billion from a $1 billion. Gina will tell you the details of these financings.", "", "Before turning the presentation over to Gina, I wanted to reiterate our optimism about the opportunities ahead. With almost half of our revenue generated from franchise fees, property management fees, membership fees and exchange fees, combined with our international diversity, Wyndham Worldwide is a well diversified and financially stable hospitality company. We made significant progress once again this quarter against our fundamental growth strategies. In branding, we are leveraging the Wyndham brand to grow in the high-end hotel segment and improve vacation ownership sales and marketing efficiency, as well as looking for more ways to leverage our marketing dollars.", "", "In geographic expansion, we are developing and expanding in new destinations, as well as adding inventory to strong existing growth areas in all three businesses. And with customer acquisition, we continue to strengthen and diversify marketing channels through innovative partnerships and across business unit synergies.", "", "Overall I am pleased with our execution, particularly on the domestic front against the macroeconomic backdrop that obviously has been unsettled for several months now. We are closely watching the potential impact of any ripples from the credit crunch or of the slowing economy on our businesses. However, Wyndham's fundamentals are intact. We have a resilient business model and we remain optimistic. Our focus on the leisure traveler along with the diversity of our businesses and our global footprint are key differentiators that I believe position us well against our peers, even in the difficult economic environment.", "", "I am proud of our global team, confident in our strategy and the soundness of our business model for the long-term. Now let me turn it over to Virginia to go through the financials.", "", "Virginia M. Wilson - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "", "Thank you Steve. Let me take a few minutes to go through our results, and then we will take your questions. First in lodging business as Steve mentioned and as you saw from press release, RevPAR growth was in line with our plans. Our largest brands, Super 8, Days Inn and Ramada, which together make up 70% of our portfolio on the domestic side, continue to post domestic RevPAR gains above their competitive sets.", "", "Domestic RevPAR growth in our economy brands, Days Inn and Super 8 increased 6.1% and 5% compared to industry segment growth of just 3.1%. Worldwide, Days Inn's RevPAR was up 7.2% and Super 8's RevPAR was up 6.1%. Ramada increased domestic RevPAR by 8.4% well ahead of its competitive set, and Ramada worldwide RevPAR growth was equally impressive at 11.5%. Performance is pretty solid across all domestic regions with Days Inn particularly strong this quarter in the Midwest and Pacific and Mountain regions, with RevPAR gains in excess of 8%. Super 8 too showed strong growth in the Pacific and Mountain regions as well as in the Northwest with RevPAR gains over 7%. And Ramada grew its RevPAR in the Northwest region in excess of 10%.", "", "These three brands also enjoyed occupancy gains in excess of their competitor sets, particularly Ramada, where occupancy grew 130 basis points versus a 20-basis point reduction in mid-scale with Food & Beverage segment, and in Super 8 where occupancy grew 120 basis points, versus a 20-basis point increase across the economy segment.", "", "Out top five international markets, Canada, Great Britain, China, Germany and Mexico, accounts for over 80% of our international portfolio. We saw strong growth in these key markets with Canadian RevPAR up 10%, Great Britain up 13%, China up 7%, Germany up 15%, and Mexico RevPAR nearly doubled. We've added some disclosure to the release and tables to help you track franchising margins. If you exclude margin neutral items from revenue; specifically property management reimbursable, and marketing and reservation revenues including trip rewards, the franchising margins for the third quarter is about 70%, inline with the year ago, as we continue to invest in the business internationally and in building the Wyndham brand.", "", "So looking at the full year plans in lodging business, as Steve mentioned, system size is growing in line with our expectations. Terminations are according to plan, but openings are a little bit behind schedule. So we would expect to end the year below our estimates on weighted average rooms. Nonetheless, we continue to expect system size to increase by about 2% for 2007. Revenues, EBITDA, margins and RevPAR are all tracking to plan for the year.", "", "Now moving on to vacation exchange in rentals; Steve covered the highlights, so I just like to add a few additional points. This quarter reflected a slight reduction in ancillary revenues versus 2006, consistent with repositioning some of our international consulting services. As you saw from the press release, EBITDA also included marginally higher costs consistent with increased rental and incremental investment in IT infrastructure. Also included is about $4 million in severance expanse. Our CR remains on-track regarding our margin expectations for the year.", "", "Now let's turn to vacation ownership; we were pleased to be able to announce a $455 million term securitization, as well as the renewal and upsizing of the conduit facility to $1.2 billion, which closed yesterday. Hopefully these new financings will moderate any concerns in the market about our ability to effectively monetize the receivables generated by our timeshare organization. On the term deal, here at 2007-2, our weighted average spread over LIBOR was higher than our May, 2007 transaction. However due to reductions in the related benchmarks the all-in cost at 5.85% was less than 30 basis points over the previous transaction. This translates into a P&L impact of approximately $1 million in 2008.", "", "We are pleased with our ability to continue to secure favorable financing terms in this environment. Despite the recent instability in financial markets, particularly in the ADS and conduit markets, we were able to renew and upsize our conduit. We believe that this a testament to the performance of our program over time, and the underlined loan quality, as well as the confidence of the members of our banking group. We were able to add an additional $200 million of capacity in this facility in the most difficult market for these product types in recent memory. Like the term deal, this renewal priced wider than last year's facility, very much in line with current market conditions. Assuming that we use about half of the conduit over the course of its term, the average cost of funds would increase about 10 basis points. We have considered this pricing on both the term deal and the conduit in the 2008 guidance reflected in the press release today.", "", "Our portfolio remains healthy and all indicators are stable. We don't see any early warning signs among the many metrics that we track on a regular basis. Gross VOI sales, tours and volume for guests were strong again this quarter and we expect the business will end the year very well. As we've previously discussed, our Points system in our sales model, provide us with flexibility to sell inventory from multiple locations, and 2007 timeshare sales have been terrific. However we need the inventory to be at various levels of completion to recognize earnings for GAAP purposes. Remember from last quarter's call that we stated that increasing deferred revenue in the second half was expected to reduce GAAP revenues. We expect to see that in the fourth quarter, which will reduce GAAP revenues by about $25 million and EBITDA by $13 million, which equates to almost $0.04 per share.", "", "We expect to see increased deferred revenues in 2008, based on the projected pace of sales in construction and a number of our developments, which is also reflected in our 2008 guidance. Please remember that for Q4 '07, and 2008 you'll be able to see the strength of our timeshare sales and marketing programs in the gross VOI sales metric, that is again before the GAAP accounting deferral calculations, as shown in our drivers table.", "", "Continued growth in contract receivable portfolio over the last 12 months contributed an additional $16 million in consumer finance revenues, which contributed in additional $7 million in spreads in the third quarter of 2007 compared to prior year. This improvement is despite slightly higher average cost of funds and higher average securitized debt balances, as we continue to improve our leverage rates. Remember that increases in securitized debt shifts interest expense above the EBITDA line.", "", "Now moving on to some corporate matters; adjusted corporate EBITDA excluding separation of related costs as well as legacy matters, was $40 million, slightly lower than expected, due to slow hiring of employees principally. We expect to continue ramping up corporate expenses in the fourth quarter and estimate that our normalized run rate will be about $17 million to $19 million reported ahead into 2008.", "", "Our cash and borrowing levels at quarter end reflect the growth in our business and the modest level of share repurchases made during the third quarter. Capital spending and cash flows are tracking to plan. Separation and related expenses are tapering off as expected. Contingent liabilities related to the separation from pendent along with the previously disclosed Q3 increase in the litigation reserve now stand at approximately $391 million, with related assets of $65 million at September 30, 2007.", "", "Now turning to guidance; there is no change in the overall company guidance for the year. While revenues and EBITDA for Group RCI are trending below our expectations this year, the balance and diversity of our business model, mainly continuing performance form both lodging and vacation ownership as well as lower than expected corporate costs, put us in a position to reaffirm overall guidance for 2007.", "", "We reaffirm revenues of $4.34 billion to $4.48 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $845 million to $860 million, and adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.02 to $2.13 excluding separation-related costs as well as legacy matters, assuming of full year diluted share count of approximately $184 million.", "", "Fourth quarter adjusted EPS guidance is $0.44 to $0.46 per share, excluding separation-related costs as well as legacy matters, based on approximately a 180 million diluted shares. For 2008, we expect revenues of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $920 million and $945 million excluding legacy items.", "", "And now, I'll turn it back to Steve to wrap up.", "", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "Thanks Gina. So in summary, we reported another strong quarter of performance and we continue to see tremendous opportunity in our businesses. We are very focused on executing against our strategies, and we look forward to providing you with additional details at our Investor Day in New York City on December 11th. This concludes our prepared remarks. So Rosie, we can open the lines for questions.", "", "Question And Answer", "", "Operator", "", "At this time we'll take questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Mr. William Truelove of UBS.", "", "William Truelove - UBS Research", "", "Hi guys, good quarter. I have a... I want some clarification on just a couple of things. First on the deferral of revenues; every year you have... given the way timeshare accounting works, do you have some deferral revenues? Is this an unusual amount of deferral revenues, so the $0.04... how much, given that you going to have deferred revenues again next year, how much that $0.04 that happens in the fourth quarter this year really needs to be added to the 2008, given that this continues? And second one, can you give a little more details about the all-in additional costs to --", "", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "I am sorry the additional cost to what? Will?", "", "Virginia M. Wilson - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "", "I think we've lost you.", "", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "I think we lost Will. But to his first question on the deferred revenue in general, adding here as well as, if I miss anything, we always do have deferred revenue. That's the nature of a product that's so that is in the development pipeline. So you've got percentage of completion accounting. At the end of 2006, we had about $25 million of deferred revenue. At the end of 2007, we'll have about $50 million, we think of deferred revenue, which means that we build about $25 million of deferred revenue this year and we think most of that... we now see, most of that will be in the fourth quarter. That is a very small number compared to $2 billion of overall sales. We do expect to have some VOI deferred revenue in 2008. We're working through all of our modeling right now, of what we think that will look like in our Investor Day. We will spend some time walking through our development program, what's coming on when so that you will have a better visibility of it for each quarter of 2008 and where we think the year will end up.", "", "William Truelove - UBS Research", "", "Great thanks. Can you hear me now?", "", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "Was there a second part for that question Will?", "", "William Truelove - UBS Research", "", "Yes can you hear me now?", "", "Virginia M. Wilson - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "", "We heard only the part of that all-in, and then you got cut off. So I am not sure I heard the rest of it.", "", "William Truelove - UBS Research", "", "Can you hear me now?", "", "Virginia M. Wilson - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "", "Yes.", "", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "Yes.", "", "William Truelove - UBS Research", "", "Okay, great. Yes, I was talking about the term facility, the additional $1 million of all-in cost of 2008, and the 10 basis points is far lower than what I think many people are anticipating given the current credit market. Can you talk about a little more color, the underlying benchmark changes and why is only million dollars for next year given all the different current credit market? Thanks.", "", "Virginia M. Wilson - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "", "I think the easiest way to sort of understand it is the underlying benchmarks both on fixed and loading [ph] have gone down. The cost to hedge has not been nearly as high as we might otherwise have expected. So even though the spreads have increased, the baseline has gone down and the all-in cost for the term facility, as I said, was 5.85%. Little bit higher than the last one we did in May but certainly within what we think is reasonable cost to continue to access that market. On the conduit, I really think what we have been able to accomplish is to demonstrate to a wide variety of banks over an extended period of time, how reliably our performance in the receivables is. Not to say that each of the banks didn't have a significant sort of credit decision to make, given all of the other commitments that they are being has to make in the market, but we think that we have done a real good job in sort of making sure that people understand what they are committing to.", "", "William Truelove - UBS Research", "", "Great. Thank you so much.", "", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "Sure.", "", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Mr. Joe Greff of Bear Stearns.", "", "Joseph Greff - Bear Stearns", "", "Good morning everyone. Steve, you talked about net growth coming in a little bit less or I guess coming a little bit less within a couple of quarters due to some issues, can you just tell about where sustainable net growth rate is and sort of what's incorporated at this point for 2008?", "", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "Well, just to be clear on the delays, because sometimes it is a little confusing. Our system size is going to come in around 2% we think, growth year-over-year. The problem is when you're looking at this average... weighted average number of rooms, as we open something in December versus November that has an impact on our weighted average number of rooms. So actually it's more just a weighted average number that's kind of toppled in the peg based on the timing of the openings. We think that the growth overall, Joe, go to your second part of the question, is above the rate that we've been growing in 2007 and again, our plan is toward the Investor Day is going to layout where we see that coming out for 2008 specifically. We haven't given specific guidance on that yet, but we will give guidance on our room growth expectations for 2008. And if I can ask you to hold off to that and get specific on it as we want to give everybody the same information.", "", "Joseph Greff - Bear Stearns", "", "Great, thank you.", "", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Steve Kent of Goldman Sachs.", "", "Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs", "", "Hi Steven Kent. May be just again on sort of Joe's question about sort of the unit growth potential; one thing that I'm struck by is that, it seems that some of the unit growth is coming from some of the higher RevPAR performing brands. And could you just give a little bit of some discussion on that, and how you see that laying out over the next 12 to 24 months, that's my first question?", "", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "Okay, well we see a lot of a lot of enthusiasm for the Wyndham brand. As I mentioned in my comments, the meeting we have done in Puerto Rico at the Wyndham Rio Mar, was a very, very well attended and 300 people versus a 100 people a couple of years ago when we had a meeting and there is a high level of enthusiasm for that brand. So clearly we gone through this transitional period with Wyndham, where we knew we are going to loose a lot of properties, resolve kind of within our modeling is what we thought would be in place after we bought the brand from Blackstone, and we are stabilizing now. And I think you are right, you will see growth in some of the higher RevPAR areas, such as Wyndham and Wingate and I think Days Inn will also be big grower for us going forward. Having said that, we are still adding product to Super 8 and Days Inn, which are just terrific strong brands in economy sector and we are adding products in some of our other brands as well. So it's a mix but, I think you are right, you will see a little bit higher RevPAR product waiting, coming in over the next couple of years.", "", "Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs", "", "And then separately on just timeshare trends; I think Gina said that when you look at some of the metrics, things look still very, very good. Was that Gina, were you referring more to the flow of people coming in to buy timeshare or were you also referring to the quality of the timeshare loans, meaning default rates, account receivables etcetera are inline with your expectations?", "", "Virginia M. Wilson - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "", "I think it's both and when I... metrics that we follow on a regular basis, we have an extensive volume of things that we watch both on new loan creation as well as the performance that we loans that we've granted over an extended period of time. And I would say stable performance in the existing portfolio, good trends and new loans being created.", "", "Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay. Thank you.", "", "Operator", "", "our next question comes from Mr. Patrick Thourot [ph] of J.P Morgan.", "", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Hi, good morning. Just one more follow up on timeshare tour. When I look at year-over-year road of timeshare tour flow growth, it looks like it's been decelerating from the first half of the year. How are things looking so far for you in the fourth quarter, specifically in October with timeshare tour flow?", "", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "They are looking strong and it's a small sample. We're used to looking at a couple of weeks of activity or few weeks of activity but it's looking strong. I think one thing you have to consider Patrick is that the third quarter is our largest quarter for tour flow and tour flow somewhat dependent upon the number of sales people you have at the location to run the sales operation. So I think what you see is the fact that we've the ability to push the growth through both existing sites as well as new sales offices that we've opened, that we're driving the first and second quarter to the degree as we've talked about. The other thing is that we did establish within our roadmap by Wyndham in-house sales offices that have collected more tours. Those in-house sales offices are the ones that are after resorts which previously the world markets that was known or trend less in world markets by Wyndham, did not have those sales offices. So we have that ability. Those are some of the new sales offices that we've opened. So we opened them towards the second half of last year and you're seeing some of... a little bit of that lapping going on. But some of it is just a sheer volume that we do and the size of the sales force.", "", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Great, great. One or two more questions here; one thing that I noticed that you sold, you had a $7 million gain on sale of [ph] vacation ownership properties and because you have changed your development plans. Now since you have bought those properties, what have you seen that's changed that would make you want to sell them? It's kind of interesting because some competitors, who are looking for properties or in need of properties whereas Wyndham is actually selling some of them.", "", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "Well those properties are properties that were purchased during our purchase of Aquabest back in 2005 I think or 2002 excuse me 2002 and we tried to integrate as many as we could of those properties into our system based on a variety of factors, locations, quality, the general demand for the product and we determined that some of them which had available inventory were no longer a good fit with our with where our sales plans were focused on and where our demand indicators were. It doesn't mean that they are not very valuable for somebody else in the market, who is focused on a particular market, but it didn't fit into our overall plans. So we preferred to kind of reallocate that capital in the areas that we thought better fit our program.", "", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Great my last question, just quickly on Ken May's departure. Were there any charges or any impact on your fourth quarter EPS from, any severance charges?", "", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "No we took that hit in the third quarter.", "", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Okay, thank you. That's all.", "", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "Thanks", "", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Mr. Michael Millman of Soleil Securities.", "", "Michael Millman - Soleil Securities", "", "Thank you. Can you talk about timeshare availability and break that down between completed construction, underconstruction, and planned?", "", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "Let's see. We break down land and the various components if we do in the...", "", "Virginia M. Wilson - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "", "The components will be in a footnote to the 10-Q when we file it. Mike, it will be the same as what you had for prior quarters.", "", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "Yes, I don't think you will see that it has shifted significantly from where we were before. From the beginning of the year, you did have the fact that we did buy some land that we've reported previously. So our land number will be up a little bit, but I think you will see that the other factors are pretty much in line with where we were before.", "", "Michael Millman - Soleil Securities", "", "Actually, I am looking for not what those were, but what they will support in sales?", "", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "I am sorry didn't hear that question Mike, could you repeat that?", "", "Michael Millman - Soleil Securities", "", "For example, in your completed buildings, what's the sales potential existing sales potential in the completed buildings and the buildings under construction and in the non-constructed?", "", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "Well from a very simplistic basis if we have a $1 million of completed inventory that's complete and sitting ready for sale that should produce roughly $4 million of VOI revenue, because we wanted the cost of sales that's around 25%. So I guess simplistically if you want to look at our finished products sitting on the shelf, you would see it... it would have the earnings... the revenue potential about four times what's sitting on the shelf. Obviously, the land and the uncompleted still has work to do in order to get it to a firm and a completed state, but that's the way to look at the completed piece.", "", "Michael Millman - Soleil Securities", "", "When we look at the completed piece do we know how much has already been spoken for, and what I am really looking for is the potential?", "", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "Well, anything that is sold then flows through the P&L as cost of sales. So if it's, as you say, spoken for, it would already have flowed through the P&L.", "", "Michael Millman - Soleil Securities", "", "I will have to follow this up later. Second question, is there some mix change in the volume per guest sequentially was down. So again I was wondering if there is just the sales mix change that is resulting in the numbers looking like they are down?", "", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "No, we had a strong BPG. I think I don't have the numbers at hand but I think that we generally have highest quarter a little lower BPG and we did in the prior quarter. It's just the nature of the gist when you're selling more and more product through your pipeline, the busiest seasons tend to be down a little bit. And looking at last year, it was flat last year.", "", "Michael Millman - Soleil Securities", "", "Yes it's been up in the last three years and was down this year.", "", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "Yes, I just I would take no significance from that. I think it's a balancing act with BPG because you look at the, tour flow that you're coming in, your close rate, there's a lot of factors that go in to that but, I would not put any significance on that trend.", "", "Michael Millman - Soleil Securities", "", "Right thank you.", "", "Operator", "", "[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Mr. Jake Fuller of Thomas Weisel.", "", "Jake Fuller - Thomas Weisel Partners", "", "Hey, guys it's very helpful to get the sensitivity to changes in the underlying costs on the receivables. How about the sensitivity to any changes in the underlying deep operates of the portfolio? What would... can you give us a sense of quantification how that might impact if you see changes there?", "", "Virginia M. Wilson - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "", "Jake we haven't got the number are at our finger tips here, and I think what we have seen over many, many years is the default curves really haven't changed much even as the economy has cycled up and down. We concernedly look into that and see whatever we want to provide a little bit of that sensitivity information at Investor Day.", "", "Jake Fuller - Thomas Weisel Partners", "", "Then I guess this is from a broader standpoint and it sounds like accounting is the answer but the so would myriad for the last couple of quarter have really throttled back. Their earnings guidance were actually driven by changes in their country outlook. What are you doing differently how are you managing your business differently to avoid the same issues?", "", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "It's really kind of a fundamental difference that we have been trying to articulate since we spun off, which is our timeshare business is a true Points-based product, it's a real travel currency. And we can sell that product from multiple locations. We don't have to be sitting at the resort where the product is in order to sell it and we can be building product not where necessarily our sales offices are, but where we have high demand from our owner base. It is an extraordinarily flexible product that has allowed us to perform as we performed this year and we maintain our outlook in the 2008. The other thing that I will say is when we spun off and we went around meeting with investors, I took some flak, we took some flak for the investment that we were making in timeshare and at the time I was saying this is a high growth business, we need to be fueling this and in fact we had frankly not been putting enough inventory into the pipeline previously, so we did spend to build this pipeline. We are now harvesting the benefit of that we made over the last several quarters to make sure that we have adequate inventory, and that is why we locked up parcels of land in places like Las Vegas and Puerto Rico and Orlando to make sure that we have that growth prospect in the planning phase.", "", "Jake Fuller - Thomas Weisel Partners", "", "Great, thank you.", "", "Operator", "", "Our last question comes from Mr. Bob Thomson [ph] of Advantage Capital.", "", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Hi guys, thank you. Just a couple quick questions; in terms of the securitization in the conduit, is that process giving easier going forward? I mean like right now versus a month ago or six weeks ago?", "", "Virginia M. Wilson - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "", "I would say it's a little spotty. As the news for the third quarter is coming out on the financial performances, some of the financial institutions who are most active in this market, we tell you each of the individual institutions need to make its own decision about where its going to deploy its capital and we just feel as if the ability to issue in this market and get commitments from very strong financial partners is part of what we've been able to demonstrate about the quality of the program that we run.", "", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Okay. And is there a level of pricing or liquidity in terms of what would be your backup plan if we ran out period as a market where we basically can't get financing for four to six weeks? What's the backup plan?", "", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "Four to six weeks will not be a problem. We have this conduit facility which is now been upsized to $1.2 billion. That's pretty sizeable considering that we do one or two financing, term financings a year to take it out. So, some years we've only done 1 term financing. This year we happen to do, actually did three but two large ones. And so I don't think that that question of the disrupted market for a period of time of four to six weeks would create any issue. Fortunately and this is an important factor, fortunately the way we report our earnings related to our portfolio is we report it as we receive it, as we get the cash in from the interest income we report the interest income, and we report the interest expense as we pay it out. We do not a report a gain on the sale, when we do the securitization. So we are not wed to doing it at one particular time and telling you of we didn't get securitization done, therefore our forecast for the fourth quarter is off or whatever it might be in the planning stage. We do it when we see the market is right for it. And to you third question, we would be talking on August 4th about this, because that's when the crunch was probably the most severe. It would have been a lot more difficult to get it done, just because everybody's attention was directed in other locations. The fact is that we still had a great dialogue going on with our lenders and the banks who helped us through this during that time and so we maintained a high level of confidence that we will be able to get this financing done as well as the expansion of the conduit.", "", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Okay and another question on RCI, do you have a good management depth there? Do you have a prospect in mind for taking over?", "", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "We have a great team and I actually spent the last month or so traveling around to Middle East and up to London to meet some of our team.

We don't comment on M&A activity or decision that were making other than the say that we saw there's a whole lot of support behind Knights Inn and we think it's a great brand", "", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Okay, and I will one more last question any other... what are some more of them the main metrics you watch for possible slowdown and what actions if we do get into recession next year, what other... what things do you differently?", "", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "Yes, there is obviously... you go in to our cost cutting mode if you see the revenues starting to lag out in the to the future and you might change some of your short term planning on projects that you working on. Having said that if you look at timeshare which the largest contributor to our earnings, and timeshare has done well during ups and downs in the market and has shown resilience, which is again why we like that business so much. The other businesses I'll remind you are 60% of our earnings are driven by fee-based free for service businesses. So we're much less much less impacted by downturn than if we were the owner of the hard assets and we were subjected to risk of those lower margin-type businesses. So we've shown in the past that we grown earnings during difficult time, during the Persian Gulf War in 1990 and we performed very well. And I think, we feel confident that we have got the attributes within our business model to weather any storm if one should occur.", "", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Okay, nice quarter.", "", "Stephen P.

Throughout today\u2019s presentation, all lines will remain in the listen-only mode.", "Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a Question & Answer Session. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations of Wyndham Worldwide. You may begin.", "Margo Happer", "Good morning and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2007 Wyndham Worldwide Earnings Conference Call. Joining us today are Steve Holmes, our CEO, and Gina Wilson, our CFO.", "Before we get started, I just want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking information that is subject to a number of risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially than those expected or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10K on March 7, 2007, with the SEC. We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The information of these measures to a comparable GAAP result is divided to the play book in the press release which is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.wyndamworldwide.com. Steve?", "Steve Holmes", "Good morning and thanks for joining us. As you saw from the press release, we had another strong quarter delivering the results that we said we would with no surprises. Looking at the full year, we achieved double-digit, top and bottom, line growth and made significant progress against some of our strategic goals.", "You will notice that our adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2007 did not grow as rapidly as it did in the first three quarters of 2007 and I\u2019d like to address that for a moment up front.", "As we expected, this reflects some tough comparisons with the fourth quarter of 2006. In our timeshare business, as we had anticipated, we had an increase in deferred revenue at the end of 2007. We also had a phenomenal fourth quarter of 2006 as the timing of revenue related to the change in GAAP accounting for the timeshare rolled into the end of 2006.", "With the hotel group, we had a net increase of marketing expenses in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to 2006 which impacted that segment\u2019s EBITDA. And with Group RCI, we were comparing 2007 with no meaningful international consulting contracts to 2006, when in the fourth quarter we recorded some significant time track revenue.", "Again, all these comparative factors were worked into our plan for 2007 and we delivered right on our expectations. Excluding the year-over-year noise, momentum across the company is strong and we are looking forward to continued strong performance in 2008.", "Of course, what everyone is focused on is what we\u2019ve seen in the current market place and what we see looking forward into this new year. As I\u2019m sure you noticed we are forming the guidance given in our Investor Day on December 11th. We continue to believe that our business model solidly positions us, even in a tough wreck environment because we have a global portfolio of diverse businesses and brands and our concentration in the midscale on economy segments play well in uncertain economic times. And we have multiple revenue sources and more than half of our revenue generated from fees related to services.", "Overall, our business continues to perform very well. That said, we are watching consumer sentiments and stresses in the overall economy very carefully. The resiliency and nimbleness built into our business model makes us optimistic that Wyndham Worldwide can continue to perform and grow and generate substantial long-term value for our shareholders. Now let me review our results.", "The Wyndham hotel group had a great year with 10% revenue growth and 6% adjusted EBITDA growth. Fourth quarter lodging results were in line with expectations and reflect our ability to execute against our key strategic initiatives: Leveraging our strength in the domestic economy and midscale segments, growing the upscale Wyndham brand and expanding our international presence.", "RevPAR grew 5.3% in the fourth quarter of 2007 versus the same period last year. We ended the year with overall system revPAR growth of 4.4% and comparable revPAR growth of 5.6%. Our Super 8 and Days Inn brands outperform their competitive set with domestic revPAR growth of 5.6 and 4.2% respectively compared to just 2.4% growth for the economy segment. A good portion of Super 8\u2019s revPAR performance resulted from occupancy gains in excess of the industry average. Super 8 also was the top rated economy hotel brand and number 24th overall in Entrepreneur Magazine\u2019s 2007 ranking of the best franchise businesses.", "Our Ramada brand also enjoyed domestic revPAR growth well in excess of its competitive set. Ramada ended the year with domestic revPAR growth of 8.3% versus just 3.8% for the midscale with food and beverage segment. These three brands, Ramada, Super 8 and Days Inn, collectively represent over 70% of our US lodging portfolio. The performances of these brands illustrate our focus on product improvement, franchisee education and training, and the power of our loyalty program.", "There\u2019s been much speculation and concern regarding the US economy and the lodging cycle. One of our advantages, especially on a slowing economy, is that we have a diverse-like business model so our sensitivity to any one business driver is muted. For example, a 100 basis points change in revPAR would only have the a $2-3 million impact on EBITDA and that assumes no cost-cutting initiatives. So general discuss where we are slightly lowering our expectation for revPAR to 3 to 5% from 4 to 6% in light of the macro economic environment, we remain comfortable with our financial guidance. Our lodging platform is a franchise and management business with dependable and consistent cash flows. We\u2019re not as exposed as owners managing hard assets with an inflexible cost structure.", "Turning to franchise development, in the fourth quarter of 2007, we opened approximately 19,000 rooms. We grew our overall system by 1.4% in 2007 which reflects a 15% increase in our international presence and an 8% increase in our Wyndham brand system size. Our pipeline remains robust with over 105,000 rooms in the pipeline, representing a 15% increase over last year and reflecting continued strong interest in our brands.", "The Wyndham Hotel and Resorts brand is over 20% of our pipeline and another 40% represents international properties. By statistics, approximately 45% of our pipeline is new construction. We are now beginning to see the impact of our rebuilding efforts for the Wyndham Hotel and Resorts brand. We have strong growth in the first three quarters of the year and in 18 properties in key markets, such as, London, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and New Orleans.", "In the fourth quarter we opened properties in Newark, New Jersey, Portland, Maine, Cosmo, Mexico, which is a luxury boutique resort that represents Wyndham\u2019s first grand bay new construction property. And we opened another new one in Panama City housing one of the largest casinos in Latin America.", "Internationally, we have increased our footprints significantly. With 15% growth in system size this year, we now have presence in over 60 countries. In the fourth quarter alone, we added hotels in key cities like Seoul, Shanghai, Beijing, and Bucharest.", "Over three-fourths of our international lodging portfolio is in Canada, China, the UK, Germany, and Mexico. Countries world brands have enjoyed revPAR growth of almost 19% in the fourth quarter and more than 10% for the full year.", "We also proudly announce that Super 8 hotel in China has been appointed by the Beijing organizing committee for the games of the 29th Olympic ad as a number of the Beijing Olympic Village accommodations service management team.", "We are pleased with our strong revPAR performance, significant developed momentum and the opportunities that lay ahead of us, specifically, with respect to the potential international expansion and our growth plan for the Wyndham Hotel and Resorts brand.", "At Investor Day in December, Peter Yesawich and his Ypartnership research predicts that even if the travel market slows down, business in leisure travel will continue but with renewed focus on value. We are confident that our broad selection of products, locations, and price points will continue to meet the needs of travelers looking for high value in leisure and business travel.", "Now turning to Vacation Exchange and Rentals. For the year, RCI revenues and adjusted EBITDA both increased 9%. Results for the fourth quarter are in line with our expectations with revenues off 5% and EBITDA down 5%. Both metrics were dampened by the impact of international consulting and other revenue in Q4 of 2006. It was not repeated in 2007. Excluding these items, the underlying base business EBITDA grew.", "In the exchange business, growth in the average number of exchange members continue to be stable, up 5% versus prior year in Q4 and the full year of 2007. However, annual dues and exchange revenues per member was relatively flat for the full year and down 3% in Q4, reflecting the timing and mix of exchange deposits versus last year which resulted in higher inventory deposits in the fourth quarter of 2006.", "In December, we launched a new web-based US member rental platform that is a significant improvement over our prior offering and includes links to Google Maps. Early results are positive with online member rental bookings, increasing 59% during the month of January versus last year. More broadly speaking, we are building our internet capabilities in the exchange business to improve the overall member experience and drive transaction revenue, while at the same time, benefiting from lower cost.", "During the last few months, I have met with many of our timeshare development partners and what I\u2019m getting from them confirms what we see in our own timeshare business, which is that the timeshare business looks strong. Of course, our timeshare developer relationships are the life blood of the exchange business and I\u2019m pleased to say we ended the year with good results for developer affiliations, completing approximately 40 affiliations in Q4 for a total of approximately 115 for the year. Our affiliates consistently renew their multi-year agreements with RCI at a rate of about 99%.", "In the rental business, overall performance was strong in Q4 driven by a higher net price for vacation rental of 9%, excluding favorable currency translations which was supported by mix and pricing, as well as, the conversion of two Landal parks from franchise to managed parks.", "Landal\u2019s success is due to favorable local trends coupled with continued improvements in shoulder season space management. Our Novasol business also grew and benefited from its southern European destination expansion, as well as, an improving economy in Germany.", "We continue to expand our rental capabilities outside of our strong and growing base in Europe. To our recent agreement with LeisureLink, we will increase the online presence of our global condominium and vacation rental inventory via new channels including online travel agents, such as, Travelocity and Orbitz.", "In Q4, we made progress towards putting this alliance into operation and expect to begin selling and expanding our use of this distribution channel in the first half of 2008. We will put our building blocks in place in 2008 and look forward to further positive momentum in 2009.", "Now turning to our Vacation Ownership business. 2007 was a spectacular year with gross annual VOI sales up 14%. Our reportable drivers were not only up across the board, but set new records in every category. We saw more perspective buyers last year than in any time in our history and we converted these prospects with greater efficiency and higher transaction sizes than ever before.", "We added over 1,500 timeshare units to our portfolio through on-going development of resorts Orlando and Gatlinburg, among others, and opened multiple high-profile properties in several key expansion markets, including San Diego and Oceanside, CA; San Antonio, Texas; West Yellowstone, Montana; Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin; and Panama City, Florida.", "In addition, we\u2019ve now solidified our pipeline for future developments with several projects now under way in major destinations like Washington, D.C., National Harbors, San Francisco and Anaheim, CA; Steamboat Springs, Colorado; Kauai, Hawaii; as well as, a planned next year\u2019s project at the Wyndham Rio Mar Resort in Puerto Rico.", "It\u2019s worth mentioning that all of this was accomplished during a year long transition period for this business as we worked to rebrand and realign our extensive sales and servicing operations under the new Wyndham flag, including an existing portfolio of approximately 145 resort properties. As a result of these efforts and those of our hotel divisions that I discussed earlier, 223 hotels and timeshare resorts now fly a Wyndham flag, up from only 87 in August 2006.", "Our Vacation Ownership business enters 2008 with a clear path forward to more exfoliate leverage and capitalize on the Wyndham brand. We believe our strong results in 2007, particularly in upgrade sales efficiencies, were in part due to the early use of the Wyndham brand within in-house sales channels. Clearly, we\u2019re excited about what the Wyndham brand means for our Vacation Ownership business in the long term. In the short term, however, particularly as we work to sustain double digit growth in an uncertain economy, we believe our greatest assets are our people, a satisfied member base, and our business model which includes diverse marketing strategies during on-site and off-site sales channels and a best-of-breed product structure that works well for our customers and just as well for us as the developer.", "As we noted in our Investor Day conference in December, our Vacation Ownership business employs one of the most highly diverse marketing strategies in the industry, allowing us the flexibility to adjust our strategies to match consumer behaviors.", "In 2007, our marketing programs yielded more than a million tours through a combination of in-house direct mail, call transfers, telemarketing, e-commerce, magazine ads, alliance partners, special events, community marketing programs, and other offers designed to bring consumers directly to our sales centers. We continue to add new approaches to our marketing as you can see in our motorsports and golf alliances which appeal to wide audiences from baby bloomers to Gen-X and Gen-Y.", "Our points-based product structure enables us to sell any inventory we develop or acquire from virtually any sales center throughout our system of which there are currently more than 135. While many of these are located on-site within resort properties and major tourist destinations, more than 45 are off-site sales centers located in suburban markets where our customers live and work. So, our strategy is not dependent on whether people plan on traveling to exotic places this year or maybe staying closer to home. In addition, our points-based product, by design, is not a one-size-fits-all offering. We\u2019re able to adjust each sale by the amount of points a particular customer is willing and able to purchase. We can effectively meet the demand and match the pocket book of each individual consumer.", "Throughout 2007, our sales base exceeded our expectations while maintaining sales efficiencies. Our early read into 2008 is at the strength in sales is continuing. Our double digit growth projections are fully reflective of how we see the business performing today.", "But before I turn it over to Gina, I\u2019d like to report on an aspect of the business, though while one of my top priorities we really discuss with the street, corporate culture and employee morale. We\u2019re in the process of tallying the results of our first associate opinion survey. We had a great response rate and the most significant finding was though we score higher than both external norms and hospitality norms in employee engagement. This is especially impressive since we have been an independent public company for only a little over a year when this survey was taken. The strongest ratings included ethics, teamwork, work-life balance, and employee sense of inclusion. To me, the results reflect the energy and direction of our great employees and I\u2019m very proud to be part of this organization.", "Let me now pass the call over to Gina, who will provide some more detail and walk you through the financials. Then I\u2019ll come back to briefly wrap up before we take your questions. Gina?", "Gina Wilson", "Thank you, Steve. Let me take a few minutes to go through our results and then we\u2019ll take your questions.", "First, in the Lodging business, we ended the quarter and the year right within our expectations, continuing to make progress on system size and quality. Margins are tracking according to plan with full year adjusted franchise margin of 75%. On a broader note, here are some points to consider in evaluating our sensitivity to various economic factors. Because of the positioning in market segments of the majority of our brands, we historically have been left affected by softness of the economy. Indeed, we see an opportunity for Wyndham Worldwide to benefit in a softer market as consumer seek value and independent hotels become franchisees to benefit from stable brand performance.", "So, where does that leave us? In light of recent industry reforecast for the lodging segment, we\u2019re revising our revPAR 3 to 5% from 4 to 6%. Steve went into the details regarding revPAR and how changes in that metrics will only impact our EBITDA in a muted way but despite the reduction in revPAR, we are able to maintain our lodging revenue and EBITDA guidance and company-wide financial guidance, including EPS, revenue and EBITDA remains unchanged.", "Now, moving on to Vacation Exchange and Rentals\u2014exchange and rental results were in line with our guidance. The year and quarter reflect an adjustment of previously recorded revenues related to consulting activities in Asia Pacific which we told you about when we announced the second quarter. Impact on 2007 reflect a year-over-year decrease in revenues of $11 million with fourth quarter comparisons adversely affected by $4 million in consulting revenues in 2006 and were absent in 2007.", "On the exchange side, the average of number of members is where we expected it to be and annual dues and exchange revenue per member was flat during the second half of the year. As we told you on the last call, this was due primarily to the mix and timing of inventory deposits.", "On the rental side, the average net price per vacation rental was strong, helped by currency and the mix of premium locations. The number of transactions met our expectations.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to Vacation Ownership. Results for the fourth quarter which reflects $21 million in deferred revenues were in line with expectations. Drivers are tracking to plan stuff for 2008 and we see no signs of any slow down in this business.", "Gross and gross sales for the quarter was in line with our expectations as well at 4% ahead of last year but somewhat dampened due to the benefit of revenues recognized in the fourth quarter of 2006 on business written early in earlier periods related to the change in accounting rules at the beginning of the year.", "The second half of 2007 also reflect the lasting effect of sales offices opened in the first half of 2006. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2006 benefited from a pricing freeze to defray certain marketing-related costs. Consistent with our previously communicated guidance, we expect to see the timing of those marketing programs reduced or drive a comparison early part of this year.", "Consumer finance revenues were up 22% for the quarter and 24% for the full year 2007, driven by higher outstanding consumer receivable levels. As we\u2019ve told you before, our goal post-spend is to improve our balance sheet leverage by shifting to more secure-type debt to help finance growth in this business. This improved financing efficiency shift interest expense from below EBITDA to operating expense above EBITDA, reducing Vacation Ownership\u2019s reported results.", "We estimate that this shift to a higher secure-type debt ratio reduce fourth quarter and full year 2007 EBITDA by approximately $4 million and $13 million respectively. That means Vacation Ownership would have reported even better results if we hadn\u2019t continued to work on the balance sheet over the course of 2007. Fourth quarter Vacation Ownership EBITDA was also reduced by the higher levels of deferred revenues that we talked about before which carries about a 50% margin. Absent of the effect of the deferred revenues, margins would have been about 18%.", "Our growth assumptions for VOI sales this year is 10 to 12% and again, what we\u2019ve seen so far this year leads us to believe that we should achieve it. Remember that 2008 reported results will be reduced by $40 to $100 million in deferred revenues associated with percentage of completion accounting under GAAP. We have included increased disclosures on Table 4 of the earnings release to give you more transparency into this aspect of the business.", "It\u2019s also worth reminding you a construction reality which any of you has done your own construction project knows, the various development projects that we have underway at any point in time are subject to a host of factors that can lead to changes in the pace of construction, such as, weather, materials delivery, and inspections by local building departments. We build our project plans with those uncertainties in mind and our best estimates construction progress show true into our GAAP revenue forecast. We have more visibility into the level of deferral closure end but actual results will still depend on how those various construction realities play into our percent complete level at each quarter end, project by project. Our estimated deferred revenue range for Q1 is based on our current assessment of the construction pace at this point.", "As discussed on Investor Day, we currently expect deferred revenues of $70 to $90 million in the first quarter and at this point, we\u2019re estimating $5 to $20 million in the second quarter. Remember again that deferred revenues carry an estimated 50% margin.", "On the consumer financing side, our portfolio remains stable. The quality of the portfolio is strong with average FICO scores increasing slightly since 2006 to 665. An average borrower equity in the portfolio is about 37.5%. Overall, the portion of the portfolio that is current is tracking close to our past experience, taking seasonality into account. We\u2019re not seeing any dramatic changes in the performance of the overall portfolio but we are seeing some stress among our weaker borrowers, consistent with what you\u2019d expect in weaker economic environments. For example, our collections team may need to place more calls to contact past due borrowers. We will continue to watch our portfolio carefully and we always do. Our seven outstanding securitizations are all performing well within their predetermined tolerances.", "On our last call, we announced a $455 million term securitization, as well as, the renewal and upsizing of our conduit facility to $1.2 billion. Based on our current sales pace, we expect to be in the market with the securitization in the second or third quarter.", "On market research, which include talking to both banks and investors on a regular basis, indicate that demand for our paper remain strong. While our last few deals were wrapped with an insurance guarantee over $1.6 billion of our historical securitization transactions were successfully completed without rep coverage. We\u2019re reviewing various structures and relationships so the next time we go to market and the decision whether to insure the securitization will ultimately be determined by price and availability. It\u2019s important to note that our securitization transactions are bankruptcy remote and therefore, none reports to us, even though they are consolidated onto our balance sheets.", "Now, moving on to then corporate matters. Adjusted corporate EBITDA for the fourth quarter, excluding legacy matters, was $13 million. We expect to see a ramp of corporate expenses in the first half of 2008 and estimate that a normalized run rate will see about $15 to $17 million a quarter in 2008.", "Decoration and related expenses are now finished as expected. Contingent liabilities related to the separation from Cendant now stand at approximately $349 million with related assets of $48 million as of 12/31/2007. Changes in which will continue to be reported as legacy items.", "We are pleased with the Ernst & Young settlement announced in late December, which resulted in a $29 million after-tax gain.", "As you saw from the press release, we are affirming the 2008 guidance that we provided in December. Before I turn it back to Steve, I want to spend a moment on the quality of our balance sheet and how we have managed to improve its efficiency while maintaining our credit metrics.", "During the course of 2007, we\u2019ve grown our revenues and adjusted net income by 13 and 14% respectively while our total assets have grown by only around 10%. We have a good portfolio of timeshare inventory spread between finished project in construction pipeline and land slated for 2000 and later development and delivery. As I mentioned just now, we\u2019ve shifted our debt-mixed-use our timeshare receivables more effectively and we have an appropriate liquidity posture to support our plans for growth. That combined with the well balanced global portfolio of businesses that we operate positions us well to execute our plan and take advantage of opportunities that these unstable markets may present.", "And now I\u2019ll turn it back to Steve to rap up.", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks, Gina. So, I hope that you all come away today with a clear sense that we are watching things very carefully and that we have the ability to quickly make adjustments to our business if we need to. Our businesses are performing well and we will continue to focus on executing on our strategic plan and thereby generating long-term value for our shareholders. With that, let me open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll take questions. Please press *1 if you have a question and *2 if you\u2019d like to withdraw your question. When prompted, please state your name. We ask that you limit yourself to one question so that everyone can get an opportunity to ask a question. One moment while the questions register\u2026", "Our first question comes from Steven Kent.", "Steve Kent - Goldman Sachs", "Hi, Steve and Gina. It\u2019s Steve Kent. Can you hear me?", "Steve Holmes", "Yes, we can Steve.", "Steve Kent - Goldman Sachs", "A couple of questions. First off, just on\u2014maybe it\u2019s my new point\u2014but it looks like the estimated on collectible receivables sell in the fourth quarter\u2014is that a seasonal issue or are you doing a better job at getting those collected correctly? And then, more broadly, we can\u2019t help but see that the pipeline of your hotel development is robust. Has there been any shifting, anybody talking about capital constraints slowing down their development, etc?", "Steve Holmes", "Well, I\u2019ll take the second one and I\u2019ll let Gina take the first one. With any slowdown, all the feedback that we\u2019re getting from the developers that we\u2019re dealing with, particularly on new construction, is that the projects are moving forward as planned. Now, realize that most of the new construction projects we\u2019re talking about are smaller projects that are often financed by the local banks or the local funding institutions within their communities. So, it\u2019s a little bit different than large, urban big city center projects. We did hear because we had people out at the conference two weeks ago out in Los Angeles that there was currently pressure on big projects. We haven\u2019t seen the pressure on the smaller kind of projects that we\u2019re dealing with. And Gina?", "Gina Wilson", "And Steve, on your question on the Lancer\u2019s down just slightly from third quarter. That is a seasonal pattern. If you look at last year\u2019s charge off, you would see that the fourth quarter was relatively high compared to Q3 as well.", "Steve Kent - Goldman Sachs", "But you mentioned earlier that your people are making more phone calls to get these collected. Is it more dramatic? How significant is that and how concerned should we be about that?", "Gina Wilson", "The charge offs are pretty much in line with what we would have expected for the fourth quarter given the larger size of the portfolio. On the collection size, what our teams are telling us is that people who are not inclined to answer the phone may be a little harder to track down. So, they may have to work a little harder to catch them and talk to them about their repayment plan.", "Steve Holmes", "But to your question we\u2019re not seeing anything significant.", "Steve Kent - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Greff. Your line is open and please state your company name.", "Joe Greff \u2013 Bear Stearns", "Hi, guys, Joe Greff Bear Stearns. Steve took most of my questions. Just with regards to that last comment about seeing some stress with the weaker borrowers and making more calls and things like that\u2014are you thinking of changing some of the financing criteria in terms of who you\u2019re lending to?", "Steve Holmes", "No, Joe. I\u2019ll take that one and Gina can add anything that she would like. No, we are constantly changing our marketing programs to target the best possible consumer but at the end of the day, we are targeting a very broad net. We\u2019re pulling in one million tours in 2007. So no, we\u2019re not planning on adjusting our marketing programs specifically to change the credit profile of the person that we\u2019re targeting. We do try to target to the best possible buyer that we can get. We do that on a constant basis but again, there\u2019s no significant movement that we\u2019re seeing in the portfolio. The answer is we are making a few extra calls to get those collections and we\u2019re just trying to give people a feel for what we\u2019re seeing on a hands-on basis.", "We have over the last two years though, Joe, just to give you one aspect of what we\u2019ve done. We did change some of our pricing to consumers based on their credit worthiness, what we called internally, our risk-based pricing. So, the better consumers could achieve a lower interest rate from us in their consumer financing and that has tended to keep some of the higher rated FICO consumers with their paper in place by getting a 9.9% loan instead of a 13% loan, but those are all built into the models of what you\u2019ve been seeing.", "Joe Greff \u2013 Bear Stearns", "Great, and then one final question with respect to your earlier outlook and Gina, I think you mentioned this and Steve, you talked about the revPAR sensitivity which\u2014thank you for that. In terms of the revPAR growth going from 3 to 5 from 4 to 6, that EBITDA impact is offset by higher margins. Is that what you said, Gina?", "Gina Wilson", "No, I think what we\u2019ve said is that we\u2019re confident we should be able to hold the EBITDA for the segment because of cost savings that we\u2019re going to charge the business with making sure that they achieve.", "Joe Greff \u2013 Bear Stearns", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from William Truelove. Your line is open and please state your company name.", "William Truelove \u2013 UBS Research", "UBS. Hate to be the dead horse with the consumer financing but on your December presentation, slide number 33 on the consumer financing operations, you give a chart that shows net new monthly default dollars as a percentage of qualified portfolio, excluding 120 days past due. It\u2019s never been over, say, 80 basis points. What\u2019s it currently running?", "Is it over 80 basis points now or is it still within the historical range of, say, roughly 60 basis points?", "Gina Wilson", "Good question, Will. We have that information somewhere here. We could go to another question while we\u2019re looking for that. That\u2019ll be great.", "William Truelove \u2013 UBS Research", "Sure. I got back ups. All right. My next question is: The deferred revenue\u2014you\u2019re talking a range of $40 to $100 million which is also what you said in December. Is there any sense that that range could narrow in terms of your expectations and a little bit more on the quarterly expectations possibly about?", "Steve Holmes", "Yes, it could narrow as we get closer to it. It\u2019s a lot easier for us as we get closer to the end of the quarter\u2014what our deferred revenue\u2019s going to look like. Let me give you an example, Will, of the kind of things that impact the deferred revenue line:", "In the first quarter of 2008, we\u2019re in the process of developing a project up in Wisconsin Dells. They\u2019re under construction for a while and the kind of delivery of the certificate of occupancy will determine that final bit of earnings that we can report on that project. Weather\u2019s been good up in Wisconsin. We could add that project end up, delivering a CO in the first quarter. Likewise, there could be another project that we\u2019re working on where we can\u2019t pull the foundation because the project is in an area that gets hit by bad weather and it could delay some of the reporting of the revenue until the next quarter. So, there\u2019s gives and takes in all of them. We try to be as precise as we can to give you guidance. We\u2019ve always been close at hitting where we said we would be relative to deferred revenue and we foresee that we\u2019ll continue to do that.", "We have projects ongoing and in over a dozen markets and we monitor all of them very closely. We have a great development team that manages that process and so we think we are very close to the range that we\u2019re giving. We\u2019ll try to tighten those ranges as we get closer.", "William Truelove \u2013 UBS Research", "All right. Thanks so much, Steve. I really appreciate that.", "Gina Wilson", "Okay, going back to your first question. What we\u2019re seeing in the last couple of months is that generally within the zone of what we\u2019re seeing in prior years, maybe slightly closer to the top end of that range.", "William Truelove \u2013 UBS Research", "So, still under the 80 basis points bubble?", "Gina Wilson", "That\u2019s the best information that I actually have at the moment.", "William Truelove \u2013 UBS Research", "Right. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes. Your line is open and please state your company name.", "Patrick Scholes \u2013 J. P. Morgan", "Hi. Good morning. This is Patrick Scholes with J.P. Morgan. In the commentary, you mentioned that locally, you\u2019ll be doing a securitization in the second or third quarter. What type of backup plans do you have if securitization markets aren\u2019t favorable for you at that time?", "Steve Holmes", "Well, there are a number of different steps that we would take, Patrick, and it sounds like the same conversation we had last year when the credit markets were falling apart and nobody said that securitizations would get done and then we did one. Because these markets are\u2014there\u2019s great demand for the paper that we\u2019re issuing. If we can\u2019t do a securitization as we did it in the last year, as Gina said, we\u2019ve got a number of securitizations that are just in the tier structure, the seniors, the structure of issuing the additional debt. If for some reason all of those markets are closed, we do have a conduit that\u2019s up to $1.2 billion and then we do a revolver. And then if all of those are tapped out and we\u2019re sitting here and we want to continue to grow our business and we\u2019re not willing to take our growth rates down in the timeshare business, we can always just sell our receivables. We\u2019ve often gotten unsolicited inquiries from people who would just like to buy our notes. That\u2019s not our preferred approach because we think it\u2019s less efficient but there are different ways that we could go. So, we\u2019ve looked at a number of different kind of Armageddon-type scenarios to make sure that we\u2019ve thought through all the various alternatives. We\u2019re very actively in the market on a daily basis, talking to both people who buy these securities, as well as, the banks that help us issue them.", "Gina Wilson", "And I think the only additional comment that I\u2019ll make is that when we talk to investors and to the bankers that work with those, there are still a fair amount of liquidity that needs to find a home and we\u2019ve looked for this low yield that they cannot get alter state security like treasury. So, we don\u2019t really have a concern that that money won\u2019t be looking for the kind of paper we have to offer. It\u2019s just a question of timing.", "William Truelove \u2013 UBS Research", "Great, thanks. One more question on a different topic. Concerning your lodging segment\u2014looks like you\u2019re forecasting a step up in your wind count growth from 1.5% in 2007 to 4 to 6 in 2008. Does that assume any acquisitions like you had in 2006 with the Corinthia transaction?", "Steve Holmes", "Well, the Corinthia transaction was more of a\u2014well, we consider it kind of a bulk conversion. We did a conversion of a number of Corinthia properties to Ramada and Wyndham brands. And yes, we may do more of those types of bulk conversions. It doesn\u2019t assume large acquisitions that we might be able to do based on what\u2019s in the marketplace but it does assume that we continue to do those bulk conversions. Then, we\u2019ve always done those. Those are part of our organic conversion pipeline.", "William Truelove \u2013 UBS Research", "Great, thanks. One last question here: In taking a look at your timeshare market across the country, are you seeing any market that are particularly stronger than others? Any particularly weaker than others?", "Steve Holmes", "Yes, Patrick, that is actually a great question because it\u2019s a question that we get quite a bit, but the fact is because of the way that we sell our product and we sell a pure points-based product, the ability to adjust marketing channels is very flexible. We\u2019re selling from 134 different locations. We sell various products that are built in different locations. So, really from our standpoint, it\u2019s not a question of Is the Las Vegas market a market for timeshare to be built and sold right now? It\u2019s likely we haven\u2019t built any in Las Vegas in the last year but we\u2019ve been selling in Las Vegas a lot of products that was built in markets like Oceanside, California and San Francisco.", "So, the markets that we\u2019re marketing to are those where either people are living because we sell in suburban market, or people are traveling to in our resort market. So, really, if you look at our sales offices, Las Vegas had great performance; Orlando had great performance; our San Diego office did very well this year. I can rattle off a lot of great locations that we saw from a sales perspective performance come out of and I would say there was no market that we would say, \u201cGee, that market really fell off the table. People weren\u2019t buying in that market.\u201d So, long winded answer but we don\u2019t see any areas of softness and we continue because of the very flexible model that we have. We continue to push products throughout all of our channels.", "William Truelove \u2013 UBS Research", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Millman. Your line is open and please state your company name.", "Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research", "Thank you. So, like securities\u2014just several questions: I just wanted to follow up on a recent one. The pipeline for lodging\u2014could you tell us where you expect to be at the end of the year or give us some of the increases for the pipeline less the attrition? I thought I heard a 46% number but I\u2019m not sure where that came from.", "Steve Holmes", "Well, we don\u2019t give projections on pipeline and frankly, Mike, if we could get all of our products and our pipelines open next week, I\u2019d love to do it, which means our pipelines would go down but we have more products that are being worked on every day by our sales force to tee up to flow into the pipeline. So, we\u2019d like to see the pipeline grow. We\u2019d like to see that pipeline grow sequentially every quarter but again, I wouldn\u2019t get too caught up. If we have a great quarter of opening products like we did in the fourth quarter of 2007. We opened 19,000 rooms and we still grew our pipeline. There wasn\u2019t as much as it would have grown if we only opened 14,000 rooms because we would\u2019ve let in 5,000 of pipeline. So, get a look at that pipeline and the rooms are opening is working very closely together. I think what you\u2019re referring to on the 4 to 6% that is our room growth guidance for 2008 and we achieved about a 1.5% growth in 2007. So going back to Patrick\u2019s question. We are looking at a faster level of growth in 2008.", "Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research", "Okay, thank you. Also, could Gina repeat what she said with the first and second quarter deferred revenue numbers disclosed?", "Gina Wilson", "Yes, hold on one sec. First quarter is unchanged for all we told you in December.", "Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research", "Which was?", "Gina Wilson", "Which was\u2014", "Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research", "$70 to $90 million.", "Gina Wilson", "$70 to $90 million and our current best estimate for the second quarter, again, recognizing that things might move between Q1 and Q2, is $5 to $20 million of additional referred revenue.", "Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research", "So $70 to $90 million in the first quarter and then five\u2014", "Gina Wilson", "Five to twenty.", "Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research", "Okay. Regarding the vacation business\u2014I understand the tough comparisons but little unsure as to why it was up only 4%. Can you talk about that? Is there mixed within that number more semi-annual or more trials, or are existing buying smaller pieces?", "Steve Holmes", "I think it\u2019s really more of a function of what happened in the fourth quarter of 2006. We opened in 2006 a number of sales offices. We rolled out some new marketing programs in response to the change of accounting that occurred at the beginning of 2006, where we had to adjust our sales processes to be able to report earnings and a lot of that came and hit in 2006.", "Also, in the fourth quarter of 2006, part of the sales offices that we opened were in-house sales offices for WorldMark by Windham, was formerly known as TrendWest, and there was also increased our VPG in the fourth quarter of 2006. So, I think what you\u2019re really seeing is just a good trend in VPG. You\u2019re just seeing less of an increase because we had a real killer 2006 fourth quarter.", "Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research", "I can see them and the tour numbers are much bigger differences but on the RCI business\u2014I guess a couple things. One is it seems to be a very large difference when you compare with what numbers Interval\u2019s putting up. Could you discuss? Are they doing something different? Why are they growing close to double digit?", "Steve Holmes", "Well, I don\u2019t want to comment on what Interval is doing. I think if you go back to their numbers, you can divide from it. Clearly, they did an acquisition, a resort in Hawaii, which really added a lot to their growth in the fourth quarter of 2007 versus 2006.", "Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research", "I\u2019ve taken that out and still they\u2019re up 9% in revenue and 12% in OIBA.", "Steve Holmes", "That\u2019s in the fourth quarter specifically?", "Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research", "Specifically the fourth quarter with an over 40% margin.", "Steve Holmes", "I\u2019d be happy to sit down and analyze their financials alongside ours. We\u2019re happy with our performance at RCI. That fact is we had a great fourth quarter of 2006 so I don\u2019t know how their fourth quarter of 2006 compared to ours. So, I think the question you\u2019re asking\u2014I welcome the analysis but I\u2019m not sitting here prepared to do an analysis of the competitor.", "Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research", "Related to that, are there any slowdowns in the actual number of exchange? We see membership is up.", "Steve Holmes", "Well, as we mentioned we did see some slowdown in exchange revenue per member and that was, as we said, was really related to the inventory mix and the timing of the inventory that we had. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we had a marketing program that was accumulating during this first three quarters of 2006. They\u2019ve delivered a lot of inventory for us at the end of 2006. That is what we\u2019re comparing ourselves to right now.", "I can tell you what we see in the business and in the business, we need to continue to drive to get inventory in, focus on the fundamentals and give our customers inventory to trade in to. If we had it slow like we did at the fourth quarter of 2006, it may offset the comparisons a little bit but we don\u2019t see an overall negative trend here and we haven\u2019t predicted that for 2008. Rather, I think we predicted it pretty much flat for 2008.", "Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research", "Touching back on the VPP\u2019s for the final question again. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re saying that there is some difference in or no difference in the mix you\u2019re saying between existing owners and new owners in terms of how much each one is buying?", "Steve Holmes", "No, we\u2019re seeing pretty much the trends that we\u2019ve seen over the last several quarters. There\u2019s really nothing different and I wouldn\u2019t read anything more into that. And Mike, I apologize but I need to touch off so other people can get some questions in.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jake Fuller. Your line is open and please state your company name.", "Jake Fuller \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Good afternoon, guys. A couple more questions for you: First, the higher lodging marketing you talked about\u2014what did that go for?", "Steve Holmes", "The majority of it went for Wyndham and about five million or so went into TripRewards. The marketing program\u2014we are converting this year, as we told you before, the TripRewards program over to Wyndham Rewards, and we\u2019re starting that process now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Woronka. Your line is open and please state your company name.", "Chris Woronka \u2013 Deutsche Bank Equity Research", "Good morning, everyone. Steve, looking at the lodging\u2014the number of rooms at the end of the quarter\u2014I know you added about 19,000 the fourth quarter. It looks like, by my math, you probably about 9,000 left the system because I think there\u2019s like 10,000 net increase. Is that about right?", "Steve Holmes", "Yes, Chris. I think that\u2019s pretty close to right. We continue to be aggressive at terminating properties that did not meet the qualities standards or not high enough.", "Chris Woronka \u2013 Deutsche Bank Equity Research", "Right and so, as we look at 2008\u2014do you think the attrition rate changes much and then how does that affect your revPAR outlook because presumably a lot of this stuff that\u2019s leaving this system is probably a lower revPAR, I would guess.", "Steve Holmes", "Well, that\u2019s a good point. There are a number of things that go into the mix of the revPAR. The fact is, we\u2019re bringing in more Wyndham products as a mix. We\u2019re bringing in more international products which can carry a higher revPAR. So, there\u2019s a lot of things going into our revPAR mix and it maybe why we\u2019re not reducing our revPAR by more based on what a lot of other people are saying about just US domestic straight out. So we do have improvement in our revPAR through mix which we\u2019d always like to take out the weaker and bring in the stronger. That\u2019s a good model for growing the business.", "With respect to the number of properties in the attrition\u2014the attrition has been pretty much what we expected. We look at our quality assurance scores of the properties. We put people on plans if they don\u2019t meet our quality. We can look forward and see how many we put in default and how many we think are going to able to remedy themselves. So, we\u2019re pretty scientific about the way that we look at our role of attrition, as well as, what\u2019s going to be coming into the system. So, the guidance we\u2019re giving for 2008 is based on the best information we have available and looking at all the current trends.", "Operator", "Before our next question from Patrick Scholes, I\u2019d like to remind parties *1 should you wish to ask a question. Mr. Scholes, your line is open.", "Patrick Scholes \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "All right. Just one more question here. Could you remind me again where you stand with the status of the share repurchases? I recall you had that after the two-year site restriction after spinning off from Cendant that limited the number of shares you can repurchase. Remind me again where you stand with that.", "Steve Holmes", "Well, we still have some room under our current $200 million program that we\u2019ve put in place. We still have about $154 million outstanding in that. And then we have some room beyond that still stay within the IRS Safe Harbour for the tax re-spinoff. So we still have some room even over what we\u2019ve currently authorized. The fact is, you\u2019d have to take the share repurchase mix with what we see as business opportunities for investing in our business, both organic and inorganic growth, as well as, our credit ratings and a lot of other factors. So, we\u2019ve said that we can\u2019t do more than 20% until August 2008 because of the spinoff but we\u2019d also have to see where we stand with all of our other factors. So, I don\u2019t want to make\u2014it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a one-event trigger, Patrick.", "Patrick Scholes \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Chris Wolonka, your line is open", "Chris Woronka \u2013 Deutsche Bank Equity Research", "Thanks. Just a follow up also on Patrick\u2019s question: I see you\u2019ve brought back about half a million shares in the quarter. Can you tell us how many days of the quarter, of any given quarter, are you blacked out?", "Steve Holmes", "Well, the black out with be during our quiet period where we can\u2019t be between. That\u2019s assuming that we don\u2019t put a 10B5 plan in place. So theoretically, there\u2019s no time that you\u2019re blocked out if you put a 10B5 plan in place.", "Chris Woronka \u2013 Deutsche Bank Equity Research", "Okay, and how do you look at where the stocks are? It looks like if we just extrapolate it, you\u2019d be on pays for about another million shares in total for the 1Q just like 4Q. Would you be comfortable going beyond that? I understand what you said about the opportunities and other things. Are there any kind of inherent limit that you guys where you just wouldn\u2019t do a certain amount of repurchase or how do you look at that? And thanks.", "Steve Holmes", "Well, Chris, we look at holistically. We look at it in light of what opportunities are sitting in front of us now. We look at it based on our build rate on the timeshare side of our business. We kind of look at all the pieces, prices, seasonality to our cash flow so we can certainly buy it off through a revolver but that gives us more limiting capacity on the overall debt capacity. So, we\u2019ll be willing to change the pace that we\u2019re buying. I really don\u2019t want to speculate or predict how we\u2019re going to buying back stocks or at what pace we\u2019re going to be buying it back.", "Chris Woronka \u2013 Deutsche Bank Equity Research", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "And that is our final question.", "Steve Holmes", "All right. Well, thank you all very much for joining us for the call this morning.

Ma'am, you may begin.", "Margo Happer", "", "Thank you, [Candy]. Good morning and welcome to the first quarter 2008 Wyndham Worldwide earnings conference call. Joining us today are Steve Holmes, our CEO, and Gina Wilson, our CFO. ", "Before we get started, I just want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking information that is subject to a number of risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10K filed February 29, 2008 with the SEC. ", "We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measure. The reconciliation of these measures to the comparable GAAP measure is provided in the tables to the press release and is available on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.WyndhamWorldwide.com. ", "Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us. ", "As you saw from our earnings release, we had a solid first quarter, with strong sales across all three businesses despite continued softening of the U.S. economy. We believe our global diversification and the flexibility of our model give us the ability to navigate economic weakness in the U.S., take advantage of opportunities internationally, and continue to grow and generate substantial value for our shareholders. ", "As you saw from the press release, we posted strong first quarter results, with net income excluding a rebranding charge of $62 million or 35% diluted earnings per share. That's at the top end of our guidance. Excluding the impact of deferred vacation ownership revenues in both periods - so really on an apples to apples basis  diluted earnings per share for the first quarter 2008 would have been $0.48 compared to $0.42 in the prior year, a 14% increase in EPS.", "We will close our first timeshare securitized financing for 2008 today. Gina will provide more details in a few minutes but let me hit the highlights. ", "The credit market is clearly challenging and the pricing of this recent financing was wider than previous deals. While timeshare sales in the industry remain strong, taking this financing as well as other planned securitizations into account, we are lowering the EBITDA range for our vacation ownership group by $10 million. We have also lowered our corporate expense range by the same amount to reflect additional cost containment measures we are implementing. Therefore, we are reaffirming our 2008 financial guidance for the overall company. And again, to reiterate, the Timeshare business remains very strong. the impact of higher financing costs are creating this lowering of the guidance. ", "Driver guidance remains unchanged except for some fine tuning in the rental transaction and price drivers at RCI. Gina will have more details on that in a few minutes.", "Now let me review our results. ", "Results in Wyndham Hotel Group were in line with our plan, with revenues of $170 million and EBITDA of $46 million. Systemwide RevPAR for the first quarter of 2008 increased 2.7% from last year and comparable RevPAR was up 2.2%. In line with the rest of the industry, the RevPAR improvement was largely rate driven.", "Our Super 8 and Days Inn brands again outperformed their competitive set, with domestic RevPAR growth of 2.4% and 1% respectively compared to a 1.4% decline in the economy segment.", "Ramada also achieved domestic RevPAR growth in excess of its competitive set, with growth of 1.5%, while the midscale of food and beverage segment was essentially flat.", "Our brands offer compelling value for their price point, an advantage in a soft economic environment as leisure and business travelers trade down. For example, Days Inn was recently nominated the top choice for travel buyers in the economy tier in the 2008 U.S. hotel chain survey conducted by Business Travel News. ", "While we are seeing some weakness in U.S. RevPAR growth, as I said earlier, we expect to remain within the guidance we provided in February. We have implemented cost containment measures and several initiatives to drive further value to our franchisees with the goal of increasing RevPAR. ", "Specifically, we're focusing on yield and revenue management, and from April through Memorial Day our field teams will primarily be focused on ensuring that our nearly 6,100 North American properties are positioned to maximize penetration, rate and yield indices.", "Another key revenue generating initiative will be the launch of Wyndham Rewards, supported by our summer promotion in midMay. Importantly, Wyndham Rewards will offer consumers the opportunity to earn and/or redeem points at inventory across all our brands, giving us a great competitive advantage over other loyalty programs.", "We're also benefiting from our geographic diversification. International RevPAR was strong, up 13%. We're achieving critical mass brand awareness in several areas. For example, in the U.K. the Ramada brand awareness grew from 58% to 68% over the past two years, and Days Inn brand awareness grew from 35% to 42% during the same period. ", "We had targeted China as one of our most significant growth opportunities and continue to strengthen our leading position as China's largest U.S.-based hotel chain, with 140 hotels open today and another 90 properties  or 20,000 rooms  under development.", "We recently expanded our management business to the Ramada brand in China, where we will be managing 8 Ramada Plaza and Ramada Resort Hotels. The first property is a new build, 214-room Ramada Plaza in [Singshing], followed by a 321-room Ramada Plaza in Jiujiang. These two hotels are expected to open by year end. ", "We are about to launch a new Chinese website that will focus on cross-selling all of our brands in China, but also offer all of our products around the world. This will enable one-stop shopping for Chinese clients whether they are traveling domestically or anywhere else in the world.", "With respect to the Wyndham brand, RevPAR at our managed hotels increased almost 9%. We have increased the international presence of the brand over the past two years from 20% to almost 35% of the total Wyndham room portfolio. ", "Our geographic diversity helps offset our exposure to the slowing U.S. economy, and we intend to continue growing the international portion of our lodging portfolio.", "Turning to development, in the first quarter of 2008 we opened over 10,000 rooms, the highest of any first quarter since 2001. Overall, system size was up 2% compared to a year ago, which is slightly below our plan but we expect to catch up over the remaining three quarters.", "The majority of this growth comes from international openings. Our total international room portfolio is now 20%, up from 17% a year ago. We are also seeing steady room growth in the Wyndham portfolio, which has increased by 11% from a year ago. We signed 158 contracts across all of our brands representing an increase of almost 13% from a year ago, adding a contract every 14 hours during the quarter.", "Last quarter we told you that we had not seen a significant impact from the current credit markets on our franchise pipeline. This remains true today. Although some larger deals, mostly new construction deals are taking a little longer and credit terms may be tighter, financing is still available for them.", "In terms of conversion, we are seeing some hesitancy where the property improvement plans require significant cash investments from the franchisees. However, we've been successful mitigating this through the breadth of our product offering. Where it may be too expensive to upgrade to one brand, we are able to offer the potential franchisee a less-expense option. ", "Our pipeline is strong, with almost 107,000 rooms, up 2% from December 2007 and 12% from a year ago, evidence of the continued interest in our brands. More than 35% of our pipeline is international, a significant increase from 21% a year ago. Almost half of the international pipeline represents new construction, positioning us well to achieve our international growth objectives. And further, the Wyndham brand makes up 21% of our total pipeline, with close to two-thirds of those being new construction deals.", "Now turning to vacation exchange and rentals, first I want to welcome Jeff Ballotti to the Wyndham Worldwide team as the new leader of Group RCI. Jeff started at the end of March and has already made a strong impression on our associates and the developer community. We're all looking forward to working with him, and I am confident he will have a great impact on the Group RCI business.", "Now in the business results, Group RCI had a solid quarter, with revenue and EBITDA both increasing 9%. These results are in line with our expectations and primarily reflect continued strong growth of our European rental businesses. Foreign currency translation helped results in the quarter, but underlying business growth, excluding currency impact, continued to be very positive.", "In the Vacation Exchange business, the average number of exchange members was up 5%, reaching approximately 3.6 million members. Annual dues and exchange revenue per member was down 3% for the quarter, reflecting the very early Easter holiday this year, which shortened the peak booking season for our members. ", "RCI had a strong showing at the annual ARDA conference, where we had a chance to meet with many of our developer customers and industry participants. The industry as a whole is guardedly optimistic despite the current macro economic environment in the U.S. Developers were excited to meet Jeff and are enthusiastic about our commitment to help them grow using our services, including lead generation tools, data mining expertise, the relaunch of Ventures, which is our affiliate publication in the U.S., and Extreme Search, our new and well-received member rental web capability. ", "With Extreme Search, we are continuing to improve and expand our online search capabilities for the RCI business. We launched our enhanced web-based U.S. member rental platform in December and saw significant increase in web transactions during the first quarter. Online share of member rental transactions increased by 13 points for the quarter, up to 40%. We're building on this success by bringing these search tools to our online resort directory. The objective is to greatly enhance the member experience, gain efficiencies of online booking, and drive increased member exchanges and satisfaction. ", "The rental business was strong in Q1, with revenue up 15% or 6% excluding favorable foreign currency translation. Average net price per vacation rental was robust, increasing 18%, reflecting a weaker U.S. dollar as well as increased pricing. It improved transaction mix and the conversion of two Landal parts from franchise to managed properties. ", "The strong pricing offset some lower rental transactions, which were down 3% primarily due to softness in the U.K. rental market. We believe a cautious consumer outlook in the U.K. is resulting in shorter booking windows as well as lower U.S. member rental transactions, which are partially offset by increased yield as a result of our North American price increases. In Europe, Landal and Novasol continued to lead performance. ", "Turning to our Vacation Ownership business, we're pleased to report that the significant momentum we experienced in 2007 continues in 2008 with gross VOI revenues for the first quarter increasing 7% versus prior year. Our marketing programs continue to generate strong tour flow, driving 255,000 consumers to our network of sales centers in the first three months of 2008, a 6.3% increase year-over-year. And most importantly, we continued to efficiently convert these consumers into buyers, recording a 3.8% increase in volume per guest compared to the first quarter of 2007. ", "Our Timeshare business remains stable and well positioned, supported by a marketing strategy that leverages multiple channels and partners to continue to bring consumers into our showrooms. We've also seen the value of operating both on-site and off-site sales centers, making our product accessible to both the vacating and nonvacationing consumer. And we're seeing the very clear advantage of selling a points-based product, which creates flexible price points, ensuring that we can offer today's prospective buyers a purchase tailored to their needs. So even if some consumers may be tightening their belts, our model is proving effective at matching buyers with products they can afford and enjoy. ", "Our sales base remains strong, and we're driving continued long-term growth with new projects and additional inventory in several key locations. ", "For example, we recently unveiled the only major branded vacation ownership resort in West Yellowstone, Montana, with the opening of WorldMark Yellowstone Resort. ", "In Southern California we opened new resorts in both San Diego and nearby Oceanside, and added the Wyndham Palm Spring Hotel to the portfolio of products now available to our timeshare owners. ", "In Waikiki, we've acquired the Royal Garden Hotel and Spa, which, following a two-phase renovation and conversion, will become our industry leading 14th property in the Hawaiian Islands. ", "In Las Vegas, we announced plans to build the Wyndham Desert Blue, and in Washington, D.C., construction of the Wyndham Vacation Resorts and National Harbor property is now under way. ", "In keeping with our strategy to develop resort properties in both major destinations and regional, drive-to locations, we've added new inventory in Panama City, Florida, New Braunfels, Texas, and Santee, South Carolina. ", "We made considerable progress last year in fully leveraging the Wyndham brand across the company. A significant portion of this was accomplished within Vacation Ownership, where we aligned our historical brands  Fairfield and Trendwest  with Wyndham. ", "In 2008, we will push further and evolve our timeshare branding to an umbrella of Wyndham brand with some exciting new products. The new products are designed to offer more flexibility and benefit to our current and future owners. We will allow greater access to Wyndham Hotel properties through Wyndham Rewards and access to additional usage options outside our owner's home club, as well as allowing full promotion of the Wyndham brand through Wyndham Vacation ownership. ", "The conversion to the Wyndham brand resulted in a $17 million noncash after-tax charge for some trademark write-offs. Wyndham Vacation Ownership tours more than 1 million consumers per year. These changes allow the Wyndham brand to be more prominently displayed in our Timeshare sales presentations, benefiting the continued development of the brand. We're excited to take this important next step in the evolution of the Wyndham brand.", "As many others have noted before, the Timeshare segment as a whole is extraordinarily resilient and has historically performed well through economic downturns and other external, uncontrollable events. That's a big part of why we find this business so attractive.", "We're maintaining our sales and marketing momentum even as we face some macro economic headwinds because of the strong business fundamentals that we've been sharing with you since day one. Based on our performance during the first three months of 2008, we remain confident in our ability to execute our strategies and deliver solid results through the balance of the year.", "Let me now pass the call over to Gina, who will provide some more detail and walk you through the financials, and then I'll come back to briefly wrap up before we take your questions. Gina?", "Gina Wilson", "Thank you, Steve. Let me take a few minutes to go through our results and then we'll take your questions.", "First, in the Lodging business, as Steve mentioned, results were in line with our expectations. Reported results for 2008 include an additional $12 million in property management reimbursable revenues, a 74% increase over the first quarter of last year, reflecting the additions of the Rio Mar, Chelsea London, Princeton, New Jersey, and other properties into the system since last year. These revenues produced no EBITDA and therefore depressed reported margins.", "Our Royalty, Marketing and Reservation revenue compared to 2007 was depressed despite RevPAR growth of 3% and a 2% increase in rooms primarily due to a higher mix of international properties which generally carry lower rates than domestic properties as well as amortization relating to development advances which previously had been recorded as an operating expense and is now recorded as an offset to revenue. This had no impact on EBITDA.", "For a clearer look at efficiency in this business, first quarter 2008 adjusted franchise margin remained strong at 72% compared to 71% in the first quarter of last year. As Steve discussed, overall the business is tracking to plan despite the slowing U.S. economy and we remain comfortable with our guidance for the year. ", "Now moving on to Vacation Exchange and Rental, Group RCI revenues and EBITDA were solid and in line with our expectations, so we are making no change to guidance. Vacation Exchange drivers are also in line with our expectations for 2008, however we are rebalancing our Vacation Rental drivers to reflect recent shifts in the mix of business and improved pricing. Our current view is that Vacation Rental transactions will increase 2% to 4% and price per Vacation Rental transaction will increase 8% to 10% this year. We went to remind you that this business has had some benefit from a weaker dollar and a reversal of that trend could affect our future results.", "Now let's turn to Vacation Ownership. First quarter results, which reflect the effect of $82 million in deferred revenues, were in line with expectations. Gross VOI sales for the quarter were 7% ahead of last year, also in line with our expectations. The performance of the business is solid, particularly when you remember that Q1 '07 gross VOI results were exceptional at 20% growth over '06 as a result of new marketing programs, price increases and sales office openings throughout the last three quarters of 2006. Drivers in this business are all tracking to plan and are on target for the year.", "The way we're thinking about this segment's performance for the quarter, adjusting for the effect of the deferred revenue in '08 and '07 as well as the re-branding charge of $28 million as well as separation and related costs of $3 million would show revenues up 9% and EBITDA up 14%, which we consider very good performance. The revenues we deferred in Q1 will show up in GAAP revenues as we complete the projects under construction and that's embedded in our sense of how the rest of the year's reported results should play out.", "As we told you on the last call, our 2008 growth assumptions for gross VOI sales is low double-digits and, again, what we see so far this year leads us to conclude that we'll achieve it. ", "Remember that Vacation Ownership guidance for the full year reflects $40 to $100 million in deferred revenue. On our last call, our guidance for second quarter deferred revenue was $5 to $20 million. We now expect deferred revenues of $25 to $35 million in the second quarter, only a small amount from deferred revenue in Q3, and a pickup in reported revenues in Q4 from deferred revenue becoming reportable under GAAP. ", "Again, I caution you that construction schedules are variable and subject to change, especially in the out months. These estimates represent our current best view, and we'll keep you updated as appropriate.", "Regarding the consumer finance portfolio, as we told you in February, we're seeing some stress, as you would expect in this environment. We're watching the consumer credit environment closely and stepping up our collections activities for these portions of the portfolio that are showing more signs of stress, however the securitizations are performing within their pre-determined tolerances and we don't see any difficulties in continuing to operate within them at this point.", "You'll notice that on Table 4 that the Q1 '08 provision for uncollectible receivables is higher relative to gross VOI sales than it has been in recent quarters, which we think is appropriate in the current environment. We'll issue our 10Q shortly and you'll see that write-offs at about $86 million or 2.6% of the portfolio for the quarter are up slightly from 2.1% last year, but is consistent with Q4 '07. ", "We're currently expecting to see defaults run at a slightly higher rate than last year, and if that plays out the way we think you should expect to see corresponding increases in the provision, which, again, we believe is prudent. This could put some pressure on the top line since the provision is netted against reported revenues, but at this point we remain comfortable with our current revenue guidance for the year.", "We're very pleased to announce a term securitization of $200 million, and we're still looking at other securitization options to supplement this liquidity. The all-in cost of the term deal came in right around 8%, or just over 200 basis points above the cost of our November 2007 transaction on a weighted average basis. The difference between the cost of this recent securitization and our last term deal translates to a P&L impact of about $2 million in 2008 and is included in our guidance. ", "As Steve mentioned, we had a $17 million non-cash after-tax charge in the quarter due to the Wyndham re-branding initiative. We expect another incremental $3 million in trademark amortization over the next 12 months, with about threequarters of that in 2008. ", "Let's move to update our 2008 guidance now. ", "As we mentioned before, both Lodging and Vacation Exchange and Rentals are performing much as we expected so far this year, and we're reaffirming their guidance and EBITDA ranges for 2008. ", "For Vacation Ownership, although we're pleased with the execution of our current securitization activity, the volatility of the financial markets is causing our borrowing rates to increase. At this point, we do not expect the trend to reverse for the remainder of the year. As I mentioned, our current expectation for 2008 defaults is slightly higher, but we're countering that with a series of cost containment activities that should not impact the strength of the business overall.", "Consequently, we're updating our Vacation Ownership EBITDA guidance principally to reflect the impact of external market conditions, and we're reducing this segment's EBITDA range to $405 to $425 million, down from our previous guidance of $415 to $435.", "We've been especially mindful of overhead costs given the uncertain economic environment, as you can see in our first quarter Corporate segment's results, and we will continue to manage them carefully. As a result, we're reducing our corporate expense range to $50 to $60 million for the year, down from $60 to $70 million.", "The changes to our Vacation Ownership and Corporate EBITDA expectations for the rest of the year offset each other, so we are not changing our full year 2008 adjusted net income guidance of $401 to $429 - that's $401 to $429 million - or our EPS guidance of $2.23 to $2.38, which assumes approximately 180 million shares outstanding. Each of these ranges exclude the impact of the re-branding charge we took in Q1 as well as legacy items.", "For the second quarter, we are offering diluted EPS guidance of $0.46 to $0.48 based on weighted average shares of approximately 180 million. This is slightly lower than consensus, reflecting our updated deferred revenue assumptions for the quarter and, again, $25 to $35 million or $0.04 to $0.06 per share, assuming an average margin of 50% which will be recognized in future quarters as construction progresses. Again, this is updated versus our prior Q2 deferred revenue expectation of $5 to $20 million. ", "And now I'll turn it back to Steve.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Gina. ", "I hope you come away from today's call with the sense that, despite some softening in the U.S. economy, our business continues to perform well and we're maintaining a sharp focus on executing our strategic plan. We're mindful that the economic headwinds could get stronger over the remainder of the year, and we're taking prudent steps today to manage costs and deliver the results we set out to achieve.", "As the closing thought for our prepared remarks, I'd like to suggest that you consider spending some or all of your economic stimulus check to enhance your vacation plans for 2008. And if you aren't one of those fortunate folks getting a check from President Bush, please pass the thought along to your friends and family. We love helping to put people on vacation through our Hotels, Vacation Exchange and Rentals or our Timeshare offerings. ", "With that, let me open the call to your questions. Candy?", "Questions-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs.", "Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs", "", "Steve, could you just talk a little bit about the deferred revenue on the Timeshare? I guess I'm still not completely sure of how this is laying out. I think Gina mentioned that there was some construction issues that are causing this quarterly volatility so could you just review that again? And maybe, especially in light of the construction issues, how secure are you that these construction delays or construction issues won't go into '09 or further?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "It's not really a construction issue. It's not a matter of construction being delayed or there being some slowdown in construction. Really what it is is it's a sales mix issue, and let me try to walk you through an example.", "We're building a project in Orlando in our Bonnet Creek site. Because we sell with a distributed system, that Orlando product can be sold in any one of our 100-plus sales offices around the country. Depending on how sales are going in different offices, we'll shift inventory from being sold just out of Orlando, for example, to also selling an Orlando product in both Orlando and Las Vegas, as well as other offices. If that shift results in greater sales in a location that is in the process of being constructed, we then only recognize the revenue to the degree that the site has been built. ", "So it really is not that there's a slowdown in construction and, in fact, our construction team is incredibly good at meeting their schedules and their timing. It's really just a question of where the sales mix is, both how we're putting the sales product out to the sales offices as well as what offices may have a great month or a great quarter and they're selling a lot of that particular product. So it's really not a function of construction at all. ", "And what we talked about in the second quarter is a similar situation. We see the mix of the product as we're putting it out to the market through our sales offices to be resulting in a little bit more deferred revenue. The fact is that we're [in] all of our construction plans and so we're confident that that will turn around as that product that is being sold right now is completed for construction and is put into use.", "Does that describe the question? We do get a lot of questions around deferred revenue.", "Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs", "I think that was helpful, thanks.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "I mean, as we said, there's no change in the full year. This is just a shift between the second quarter basically and the second half of the year. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Joseph Greff - Bear Stearns.", "Joseph Greff - Bear Stearns", "", "Can you just remind us when the next time is that you really need or would like to do the next Timeshare securitization?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, we're constantly in the market, Joe, and we're constantly feeling out where the best opportunities lie. ", "We wanted to get something done in the first half of the year, and we obviously are announcing today this $200 million securitization. We will continue to work on securitizations during the second quarter and also the third quarter. We do want to get some more securitizations done, and we'll continue to work on it.", "We're very mindful of the costs that we're incurring by going into the market right now, so we're being very cautious and we try to execute as well as possible.", "Joseph Greff - Bear Stearns", "So I presume within the Vacation Ownership EBITDA guidance you have at least one more securitization in there and you're assuming - I'll put it this way - assuming higher costs similar to the higher costs that you saw in this more recent one that you closed today?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes, absolutely. We've built that in. That's why we guided down a little bit for WVO, for our Vacation Ownership group, because we're assuming that these higher costs we're seeing - which are, frankly, a little bit higher than we had originally thought - that this will continue at at least this level for the rest of the year as we get other securitizations done.", "Kind of the good news is, because we don't report gain on sale, this is really just a cost that we will cover over time as opposed to a hit in any particular period of time.", "Joseph Greff - Bear Stearns", "And if I could go back to that Table 4 that you guys referred to, as you think about provision for loan losses as a percentage of receivables or a percentage of sales, are you assuming that that percentage bumps up from Q1 levels?", "Gina Wilson", "Yes, we pretty much are at roughly the same level that we were seeing in the fourth quarter.", "Joseph Greff - Bear Stearns", "And going forward, the 1Q was the same percentage as the 4Q but going forward you have the same, I guess, year-over-year delta.", "Gina Wilson", "I said we're expecting to have a higher level of defaults compared to prior year for the remainder of this year, and that's included in our updated guidance.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from William Truelove - UBS.", "William Truelove - UBS", "", "In terms of, now that you've got the re-branding done on your Timeshare division and I believe that re-branding was being done over time, can you tell us what the differential has been in terms of your sales expense as a percentage of the revenues from those that have been, let's say, re-branded for quite some time, so we can get a sense as to the cost savings associated on the marketing expense? And then secondly, I believe you just recently announced your first Wyndham project - or Wyndham brand - out in China. What's your outlook for the Wyndham brand in China going forward? ", "Stephen P. Holmes", "On the re-branding side, it's still pretty early to tell. The fact is we re-branded quite a few of the properties during 2007 and we started to shift the marketing over to the Wyndham brand marketing. But honestly, it's a little bit too early to tell. ", "We have seen great efficiencies in some of the markets where we made an early changeover, but I wouldn't conclude too much from it, honestly, until we have a chance to really see the results and analyze the results. I don't mean to be evasive on that. I just don't think we know completely yet.", "We're still confident and certainly if you stopped into any of our sales offices and talked to our sales force as well as our marketing team, they teem with exuberance. But I just want to make sure we're cautious about setting expectations because it's not a flip the switch, as we've said before; it's more of a gradual improvement that will ultimately result in improved margins in this business.", "With respect to the second part of the question, which is the question about China, we announced that we will be managing our first Wyndham in China, which will hopefully open later this year, beginning of next year. That's down in [Shaman]. What I was talking about today was the Ramada properties that we'll be managing there.", "With respect to the Wyndham property, with the Wyndham brand, we do expect to continue to grow that brand in China. We think there's tremendous opportunity to fill the needs in not only the Tier 1 but the Tier 2 cities as well, where the domestic travel - that group of 400 million people who up to now really haven't traveled all that heavily, that middle class  will start to travel. It will need hotel accommodations. We are heavily focused on helping to meet that need.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Amanda Bryant - Merrill Lynch.", "Amanda Bryant - Merrill Lynch", "", "I'm assuming given that you're holding your lodging guidance for the segment for the full year, implied in that was RevPAR growth of 3% to 5%, I'm assuming you're still holding that, and if so, what kind of gives you confidence that you can hit that RevPAR assumption given the continued weakness in the U.S. economy? ", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, as you're aware, we brought down our RevPAR guidance in the fourth quarter call and adjusted it down from 4% to 6% to 3.5%, so we did take into account what we're seeing as trending.", "There's two factors that I think will influence that outcome. One is our international growth is becoming a more and more significant portion of our overall mix of business on the Hotel side. In addition, we're adding Wyndham properties that tend to have a higher RevPAR, obviously, which will help our lift.", "So when we give you this guidance, we're taking the best information we have available into account and coming up with what we think is achievable based on our business mix, both internationally as well as our brand mix.", "Amanda Bryant - Merrill Lynch", "So it's safe to assume that if you back out changes in the mix that on a same-store basis the RevPAR growth would certainly be lower than the indicated 3% to 5% range, that's fair. Is that correct?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, sure. As we've said, the Super 8 and Days Inn brands outperformed the economy segment, which was actually negative in the quarter, but it certainly wasn't - even our growth, which beat the economy as a whole, wasn\u2019t up in that 3% to 5% range. ", "Operator", "At this time we're showing no questions.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay. Well, we love to be clear with our presentation, and obviously we were this quarter. So we appreciate everybody's participation on the call and look forward to talking to you on the next quarter's call.

At this time, I would like to inform all participants that your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s conference. (Operator instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Margo Happer. Thank you. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.", "Margo Happer", "", "Thank you, Melissa. Thank you, and good morning. And welcome to the second quarter 2008 Wyndham Worldwide earnings conference call. Joining us today are Steve Holmes, our CEO, and Gina Wilson, our CFO.", "Before we get started, I just want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking information that is subject to a number of risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K filed February 29th, 2008 with the SEC. We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these measures to the comparable GAAP results is provided in the tables to the press release and is available on our Investor Relations Web site at www.wyndhamworldwide.com.", "Steve.", "Steve Holmes", "", "Thanks, Margo. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Despite a very tough macroeconomic environment, the resilient Wyndham Worldwide business model continues to perform well. Our earnings for the second quarter of 2008 showed growth over the second quarter of 2007 and even included \u2013 and excluding the impact of less deferred revenue than we forecast in our timeshare business, our results were ahead of expectation.", "No travel business is immune to the current pressures on the U.S. and global economies. However, our business model is very flexible, and we have worked hard to anticipate the challenges and cut costs while driving for greater efficiency in order to achieve our goals. We believe our brand\u2019s geographic distribution and diverse product offerings combine to produce a stable and resilient business model, just consider our results.", "Each one of our business units delivered EBITDA growth in the second quarter of 2008 over the same period of 2007, and our second quarter EPS, adjusted EPS, increased 8% year-over-year. As you saw from the press release, we are adjusting our 2008 guidance to reflect our best views of current trends. The current economic environment creates real challenges for forecasting results as there are more variables in play than we have seen in prior slowdowns. Financial market instability, record oil prices, narrow line (inaudible) productions, an unstable housing market, and rising unemployment, just to name a few.", "As we went through the risk process of risk adjusting our forecasts for the remainder of 2008, we felt the bottom end of our previous range may still be achievable, but we felt it was appropriate to slide our range down to reflect the volatility we are seeing. In light of the pressured economy, we lowered our revenue projection by 5.5%, but we are comfortable with only at a 2.5% reduction in EPS. This reflects the flexibility of our business model and the dedication of our associates to strive for our goals.", "Gina will walk you through the changes to our drivers and guidance in a few minutes.", "Now, let me review second quarter results in each of our three businesses. Results in our lodging group are in line with our plan with revenue of $200 million and EBITDA of $62 million. Worldwide RevPAR for the second quarter of 2008 was up 1.4% over last year. Year-to-date, worldwide RevPAR was up 2%. International RevPAR was particularly strong up 15.2%, but domestic RevPAR declined 3.7%. Even though we saw RevPAR growth in the first half of the year, RevPAR is running below our expectations. And in June, we began to see further softening.", "Therefore, we are revising our 2008 worldwide RevPAR guidance to a growth rate of 0% to 2% that is down from our prior 3% to 5% range. Our PBase [ph] model inflates us somewhat in difficult times. So even in the market with domestic RevPAR\u2019s declining, we expect it to continue to grow and be within our previous 2008 lodging EBITDA guidance. Largely due to our international pipeline, our ability to contain costs while maintaining quality of service to franchisees and the modest impact of our recent acquisition.", "We have implemented business building initiatives throughout the year designed to optimize our franchisees\u2019 RevPAR performance. For example, we put in place additional programs to ensure rate and inventory information is correctly loaded into property management systems of 900 properties, which has resulted in higher RevPAR performance compared to a controlled group of companies. We expect to enroll another 15,000 properties by year-end.", "As I mentioned, international RevPAR was strong at just over 15%, or 8% in constant currency offsetting declining domestic RevPAR. Performance was particularly strong in Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East. We also continue to expand our management business in Asia Pacific, and expect to manage two hotels in China by year-end. ", "With regard to our namesake brand, Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, results were up by every measure, rooms, hotels, in RevPAR, driven by both ADR and occupancy increases. This is primarily due to international properties added in the past 12 months. We\u2019ve said we are firmly behind the Wyndham brand and we\u2019ll support its growth while revitalizing and building the subscale brand, and we are doing just that.", "Stranger development across our portfolio brands, in the second quarter we opened over 12,000 rooms and executed over 200 contracts representing 25,000 rooms. Since this time last year, overall system size is up 2%, and the total international portfolio is up 15%. International markets provide some of the best opportunities for growth, but they are also somewhat more difficult to predict and forecast than the U.S. when it comes to timing of property conversions or openings.", "Our pipeline is strong with almost 109,000 rooms, a 9% increase from a year ago, and a 2% increase from last quarter. Over 40% of our pipeline is international, up from over 30% a year ago. The Wyndham brand now makes up 21% of our total pipeline. Of our entire pipeline, 50% represents new construction. And with respect to that new construction, over 80% of the new construction pipeline is scheduled to open in the next 18 months. That which is expected to open over the next 18 months, is already secured per (inaudible).", "Earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of two brands from Global Hyatt, Microtel Inns and Suites, a chain of 298, all new construction, economy hotels, and Hawthorn Suites, a chain of 91, all suites, extended stay hotels. This acquisition expands the Wyndham Hotel Group system to 12 brands encompassing 7,000 hotels on six continents. These new brands are an excellent fit with our existing portfolio, and also provide an entry into the extended stay market. We have great experience in integrating this type of business and leveraging our existing infrastructure to reduce expenses, and we expect the acquisition to be slightly accretive this year. We have already met with the franchisee advisory councils for both brands a couple of times, and we are looking forward to working together as we continue to grow the brands.", "Now turning to vacation exchange and rentals, for the quarter, Group RCI did a great job managing costs in the face of slowing economies in some key markets, including Denmark, the UK, and the U.S. Revenue growth was 9% and EBITDA growth was 10% reflecting a focus on cost reductions in management across the entire business as well as the effect of a $6 million adjustment related to consulting activities in the second quarter of 2007.", "In the vacation exchange business, the average number of exchange members continued a steady growth at 5% for the period. But annual dues and exchange revenue per member was down 3% for the quarter reflecting tighter booking windows of longer range vacations, fewer higher-priced international exchange requests, and we believe, some customers choosing to return to their home resorts where an RCI exchange is not required. ", "In the face of economic uncertainty, higher gas prices and airfares, Group RCI has aggressively stepped up its regional drive-to direct marketing efforts, highlighting vacations closer to home for fall and winter, and featuring select vacations that are only a short drive away.", "Turning to Group RCI\u2019s rental business, revenue growth of 12%, 3% adjusted for currency, was driven by our Landal GreenParks business. Overall average net price for vacation rental increased 15%, or 5% in constant currency, reflecting a more favorable pricing mix in the Landal property conversion of a franchise to a managed park. This double-digit increase in price was partially offset by a lower number of rental transactions, which were down 2%, primarily due to softness in our Holiday Cottages brand in the UK rental market, our U.S. member rentals, and our Novasol business in Denmark. To support the U.S. member rental business, we are emphasizing our value proposition by promoting lower priced inventory and increasing the frequency of closer-in travel campaigns.", "While the trend towards sure booking windows is expected to support growth, we are taking a more conservative stance for the second quarter of the year, and we are reducing our drivers. Yet, we are maintaining our revenue and EBITDA guidance ranges for the full year.", "Let\u2019s now turn to our vacation ownership business. Interest in our vacation ownership product is holding up well, particularly when compared to well-publicized demand declines and other consumer discretionary purchases such as boats, RVs, and second homes. Tour flow and gross VOI sales for Q2 experienced modest year-over-year increases of 3% and 2%, respectively. And our selling efficiency remains stable with our volume per guest essentially flat year-over-year. ", "Similar challenges in the hospitality industry, we are seeing some challenges in Hawaii and Las Vegas, which together contributed 18% of our revenue last year. And our sales plan assumed continued growth in both markets this year. Sales to new customers declined at both sites driven by reduced tour flow in Hawaii and lower volume per guest in Las Vegas.", "While sales in the rest of the country are holding up and sales to existing owners remain strong, we are lowering our revenue and EBITDA guidance, which Gina will detail in a minute. ", "We continue to be pleased with the performance of this business, and remain confident in this long term growth prospect for several reasons. First, timeshares at sold, not at soft (inaudible). Our sales and marketing strategies address this within centerpiece offers to drive consumer behavior. Second, unlike traditional real estate, timeshares purchased with a singular intent to use it year-after-year for great vacations. Our value proposition is not built on any expectation of profit from rental or gain from future sales. And thus, there are fewer hurdles to overcome during the purchase process. In fact, our value proposition is actually enhanced in difficult economic times as consumers previously in the market for a vacation home now look for more affordable alternatives. Third, our customers keep using what they\u2019ve already purchased. Occupancy for the second quarter in our timeshare resorts is roughly 80%, and that\u2019s consistent with last year. Not surprisingly, some of our customers will be visiting resorts closer to their home this year, but our extensive network of drive-to locations accommodate these shifting travel patterns and our points program gives star owners the flexibility to use their timeshare asset as their leisure time permits. Our owners are taking their vacations, enjoying the flexibility of the timeshare product, and buying even more points while staying at our resorts.", "Third quarter advanced reservations are up 14% over the same period last year reflecting some great addition to our resort network. During Q2, we added more than 500 units with a successful new resort opening in New Orleans as well as additional development at existing projects in Orlando, Las Vegas, and Wisconsin Dells. We also commenced sales for new projects in San Francisco, in Washington D.C.\u2019s National Harbor.", "Clearly, the remainder of 2008 is expected to be challenging and most economists believe the weakness will carry into and possibly through 2009. We are taking proactive steps to position ourselves to face these economic headwinds by leveraging our flexible business model. For example, in our timeshare business, we remained firmly committed to our strategy of increasing our margin while maintaining double-digit growth on the bottom line. A major component of this strategy is to refine and refocus our tour generations efforts on our most \u2013 to our most efficient marketing programs such as those associated with our new Wyndham branding while eliminating more costly, lower performing tour sources.", "As a result, our revenue growth in 2009 will now shift to the single-digit range as we begin to tour fewer prospective buyers. Yet, our margins will improve as we increasingly focus on buyers with a higher propensity to purchase our product and a greater ability to pay on time and in full. The end result for the WBO business will be solid single-digit revenue growth and improved margins that will drive double-digit EBITDA growth. The added benefit of this approach is that it will allow us to free up capital for other uses like allocating more resources to growing our hotel business, supporting our goal to increase the relative contribution of the hotel business unit.", "Before I turn the call over to Gina, let me end up by thanking all of our associates around the world for their dedication to deliver on our goals and for their respective efforts to reduce expenses and adjust marketing sales promotions to fit the current environment. ", "We continue to prove that our brand\u2019s geographic distribution and the diverse product offerings combine to produce a stable, flexible, and resilient business model. Gina.", "Gina Wilson", "", "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. This quarter demonstrated not only the resilience of the business model, but our team\u2019s ability to execute within that model by applying disciplined actions to control costs. I\u2019m pleased with our ability to grow the bottom line despite soft line pressures across the business, which reflects the difficult economic conditions we\u2019re in.", "Adjusted earnings per share were $0.05 ahead of our guidance range due primarily to lower than expected percent of completion or POC deferred revenues. This acceleration of income in our vacation ownership business into Q2 from Q4 was a result of shift in the timing and mix of completed and partially constructed inventory sold during the quarter.", "Since Steve spent a fair amount of time on the macro environment and second quarter revenues and EBITDA results for the businesses, I\u2019ll cover or I was thinking about business drivers and how that impact full year revenue and EBITDA guidance by business units.", "In lodging, we\u2019re expecting full year RevPAR growth of 0% to 2%, down from our earlier guidance of 3% to 5%. This assumes 7% to 9% international RevPAR growth and a domestic RevPAR decline of 1% to 3%. System size guidance, absent the acquisition that we recently completed, would have been adjusted down from our May expectations of 4% to 6% due principally to delays in timing of international hotels. As Steve discussed, the pipeline is strong and we expect the openings to occur just later than originally anticipated. So our updated system size guidance is 7% to 9% room growth for 2008, including about 5% related to the rooms that came with the Microtel and Hawthorn acquisition.", "As you know, we completed this acquisition of the Microtel Inns and Hawthorn Suites brands two weeks ago. The purchase price was $131 million, and we financed that using the corporate revolver. We expect a modest contribution to EBITDA for 2008, and an EBITDA contribution of up to $15 million next year. We\u2019ll be posting some historical operating statistics for these brands in the next couple of days on the Web site for your reference.", "We now expect 2008 lodging revenues to be $770 million to $800 million, bringing both ends of our prior range down $70 million primarily due to the timing of managed property additions, and no change to EBITDA of $235 million to $245 million. ", "As Steve mentioned, vacation exchange and rental revenues and EBITDA improved 9% and 10%, respectively, for the quarter. However, after considering the 2007 adjustments we made related to Asia Pacific consulting contracts, which resulted in a $5 million revenue reduction and a $6 million EBITDA reduction and the impact of foreign currency, revenue improved by 2% while EBITDA declined 2% driven primarily by the timing of marketing expenses, the mix of products, and investment in our important online strategy freshly offset by good cost control.", "Average number of members continues to track to our expectations, and we expect growth at 4% to 6% this year. Based on lower than expected exchange transactions through the first half of the year, we now expect annual dues and exchange revenue per member to decline 2% to 4% this year, compared to our earlier expectation that they would be flat compared to \u201907.", "Given the current economic challenges in some of our key rental markets, our best estimate is that vacation rental transactions will be down to flat or flat to down 2% versus our earlier guidance of 2% to 4% growth. However, we expect favorable pricing due to the mix of transactions as well as favorable currency effects to drive full year average net price per vacation rental to 12% to 14% growth over the last year, up from our May guidance of 8% to 10%. Based on these mixed trends and our ability to manage costs, we\u2019re making no changes to RCI\u2019s 2008 revenues at $1.3 billion to $1.35 billion or EBITDA at $315 million to $335 million. ", "Vacation ownership gross VOI sales, as Steve discussed, reflected some weaknesses in Las Vegas and Hawaii, but overall the business is demonstrating solid performance in this challenging environment. However, given the current economic trends, we\u2019re adjusting full year VPG growth to 1% to 3%, down from 4% to 6%, primarily to reflect lower closed rates to new customers. And we\u2019re lowering our tour flow growth for the year to a range of 4% to 6%, which is down from 6% to 8%.", "The consumer finance portfolio continues to grow with our increase in VOI sales with modest increases in weighted average coupon and borrower equity in our loans compared to 2007. The consistency of the portfolio\u2019s quality and performance has supported our completion of two securitizations during the second quarter totaling $650 million, and all our securitizations are performing within their predetermined tolerances. Given the unsettled nature of the credit market since last year, we were pleased to be able to complete these two term securitizations at a cost of 7.37% excluding transaction fees, and at a combined leverage rate of about 76%. That compares to a blended cost of 5.7% and a combined advanced rate of 87% for the three securitizations that we did in 2007. We\u2019re already working on renewing the conduit and our consent and our ability to get that deal done.", "As we\u2019ve discussed for several quarters, the strains in the economy are showing in the performance of the weaker borrowers in our portfolio, and this quarter\u2019s performance continues that trend. Write-offs as a percent of the quarter-end loan balances were closed to the 2.5% for the second quarter consistent with the first quarter and last quarter of last year. Remember that we increased the provision for loan loss in the first quarter based on what we had been seeing since late last year. The provision for loan losses in the second quarter, which reduces reported GAAP revenues, was $113 million as you can see in table four. This amount is higher than is higher than the prior year amount as a result of recent portfolio performance and growth in the portfolio.", "We told you in the past that we look at the quality of the portfolio and loss exposure a number of different ways. For simplicity, you might want to look at the portfolio in two ways, first, comparing the provision for loan losses for the period to the percentage of gross VOI sales less deferred POC revenues, and second, the loan loss reserve as a percent of the gross outstanding loan balances. By both of those measures, the second quarter provision and reserve are consistent with Q1 levels. For the remainder of the year, we\u2019re assuming that there will be continued thrust within the portfolio. We now expect the effects of deferred POC revenue this year to be between $70 million and $100 million due to the sales mix and construction timing that we\u2019ve seen today and expect to see for the remainder of the year. We believe that the impact from deferred POC revenue for the third quarter could be recognition of $5 million to deferral of $10 million. Remember that construction schedules are variable and subject to change, especially the further outward forecasting.", "Now, taking our revised \u2013 thinking about deferred revenue tour flow, VPG, and credit risk into consideration, we\u2019re adjusting vacation ownership\u2019s revenue range down to $2.45 to $2.55 billion, or $200 million lower at both the top end, bottom end of that range, and EBITDA down to a range $390 million to $410 million, compared to the former range of $405 million to $425 million.", "Moving on to some corporate matters at the end of the quarter, our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.8, right in the middle of our target range. The balance sheet is strong, and we remain focused on preserving liquidity to leverage investment opportunities, such as our recent brand acquisitions. There\u2019s no change towards (inaudible). ", "We expect our full year tax rate to remain relatively consistent at about 38.15%. Our guidance for third quarter diluted EPS is $0.80 to $0.82, and $2.18 to $2.32 for the full year on an adjusted diluted basis, down from our former guidance of $2.23 to $2.38.", "As Steve said, while we\u2019re not immune to economic strain that others in our industry are facing, we have a number of complementary levers enhanced to navigate what we see ahead. ", "And now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Steve before we go to Q&A.", "Steve Holmes", "", "Thanks, Gina. In summary, our business has deep and experienced management teams that can and do actively manage them to grow revenue, shift marketing tactics, contain costs, and provide value in our millions of customer interactions we have, whether they are franchisees, hotel guests, developer-affiliated to exchange member, tour guests, or long term timeshare owners.", "With that, I will ask Melissa to line up any questions that we may have. Melissa.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. (Operator instructions) One moment, please, for the first question. Our first question comes from Joe Greff with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Joe Greff \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "", "Good morning, everyone. ", "Steve Holmes", "", "Good morning, Joe.", "Joe Greff \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "", "I was hoping you can just give us \u2013 is that the timing on renewing the conduit?", "Gina Wilson", "", "It\u2019s scheduled to expire in the fourth quarter. So we\u2019re looking to get all of that detailed worked on well before then.", "Joe Greff \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "", "And I was hoping you can also just update us if there was any change in terms of your capital investment and CapEx then for \u201908.", "Gina Wilson", "", "No change in CapEx to speak of.", "Joe Greff \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "", "And as you look at timeshare and you see certain markets like Hawaii and Las Vegas being softer than other timeshare markets, are you looking at altering your investment in timeshare looking beyond this year?", "Steve Holmes", "", "Well it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s a good \u2013 great question, Joe. We do see a little bit of softness in tour flow in Hawaii. Actually Las Vegas, tour flow was up a little bit, but, Joe, it really wasn\u2019t a question of demand. It\u2019s just a question of how many we can close. With respect to the kind of the spend \u2013 as I said, we\u2019re looking at a single-digit revenue growth in 2009. That will allow us to spend less on product in order to fill that need. We\u2019ve given guidance before that our property purchase was at a range, for this year, $650 to $750 million. We revised it down to $600 to $700 million in the second quarter. That\u2019s probably still pretty good guidance for 2008. In 2009, that number will look down further. It\u2019ll be down another $100 million or so.", "Joe Greff \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "", "Great. And I think expected today or expected tomorrow, should you choose, you can be more aggressive with the buyback. I was hoping you can just update us with your \u2013 with your view on buyback in light of your capital structure, in light of the stock price that\u2019s implying five or four and half times EBITDA. Thanks.", "Steve Holmes", "", "Yes. Well, I mean to say our stock is cheap in my view would be an understatement. As you kind of said, it\u2019s really a question of capital allocation and where do we stand in the current credit markets, and what do we see as our opportunities going forward. I\u2019ve always said that the most important thing for us to do is invest in our businesses, and being able to do \u2013 to deal like the acquisition of U.S.FS from Global Hyatt is a perfect example of the kind of flexibility we have when we have a good rating and we have good liquidity.", "We still feel that there are opportunities out there for us. We think that there would be probably an acceleration of opportunities over the next 18 months, and we want to keep that flexibility to take advantage of deals as they become available. ", "With respect to the buyback, we still have room in our buyback programs that\u2019s been approved by the Board. We have never said that August 1st is the trigger date for us to change our \u2013 to change our mode of managing the company. We\u2019re all frustrated by the share price, but unfortunately, it\u2019s a broad problem across the entire industry and the market as opposed to just specifically us. And I don\u2019t know that we can buy our way out of it.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Kent with Goldman Sachs. Please limit yourself to one question.", "Steve Kent \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Sure. Steve, can you just \u2013 I guess I\u2019m just trying to understand this more broadly. To me it looks like revenue guidance lowered by $275 million, EBITDA guidance only lowered $20 to $25 million. I know you\u2019ve tried to explain this a couple of times, but I still don\u2019t really get it. And then, just to follow on Joe\u2019s question, if stock is trading at four and half, five times, I mean I understand why you want to build the company and get it bigger, find all these opportunities, but I haven\u2019t seen that many deals, hotel deals, at four and a half to five times. So why not buy yourself rather than buy another company?", "Steve Holmes", "", "Okay. Well thanks for the questions, Steve. We\u2019ll take them in the order that you gave them. First on the revenue growth, there are a few things playing into it. The first, I should point out, is we got a great business model. We managed to drive more EBITDA out of our revenue. And therefore, revenue doesn\u2019t drop as much as revenue does, EBITDA doesn\u2019t drop as much as revenue does. ", "There are a few factors weighing into it, though. The first is the timing of hotel management contracts. Hotel management contracts bring with them a lot of revenue, not a lot of EBITDA. And there are some management contracts that we had in the \u2013 in our planning to occur earlier than they\u2019ll occur. They\u2019re still in the pipeline. They\u2019re still going to come on board, but they\u2019re just coming on board a little bit later, which means there\u2019s a reduction in revenue.", "The second thing is, Gina talked about the loan loss reserve and the impact in our \u2013 the impact on our provision and what we see in the consumer finance portfolio. The loan loss offsets against revenue. Okay. So there\u2019s a direct drop of revenue related to the loan loss provision, and it does dropdown through, but that is what is in part taking down part of the revenue side. In addition, there \u2013 we\u2019re thinking there might be a little bit more deferred revenue that\u2019s why we tightened the range up from $40 million to $100 million to $70 million to $100 million. That would, likewise, have impact on deferred \u2013 on the revenue overall.", "So really it\u2019s kind of those factors, a few others. And then, as we\u2019ve been saying, we put in place a lot of costing programs, efficiency programs, and we\u2019ve been managing the business to try to retain our guidance that we gave all of you. We can\u2019t manage the macro environment so we\u2019re going to be hit on the revenue side, but we can become more efficient and try to drive more margins. The fact is it is a pretty good result, and we wish we could have kept our guidance for EBITDA and EPS. And we did keep \u2013 we did kind of just overlapped our range, but moving us down because we\u2019re not really giving up on the bottom end of the range, of our own range by any sense, such as imagination. We\u2019re just trying to be more conservative and show what we\u2019re seeing, and we want to be realistic about where we think the range now is starting to look.", "With respect to buyback, I agree that it\u2019s incredibly attractive at these prices, and we can\u2019t do many deals to buy our company at these prices. The difference is that when we buy our company at these prices, we may increase our earnings per share, but we don\u2019t increase our cash flow to our leverage. Where when we buy companies, we\u2019re adding earning that\u2019s building long term value, and we think that there will be great opportunities out there in the marketplace. ", "Now we\u2019ve never said that we won\u2019t do more buybacks. We never said that we will do more buybacks. We\u2019re just looking at the environment as we see it right now, and feel that the right thing to do is to continue to try to grow the business, continue to take advantage of opportunities that we keep presenting themselves, and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate the marketplace as we go forward.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question comes from William Truelove with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Michelle Ko \u2013 UBS", "", "Hi. It\u2019s actually Michelle Ko. I was wondering if you could give us a sense directionally for the deferred revenues for next year. Marriot has said that there will be powerfully positive forces next year. We understand you might not be able to give us an amount, but if you could tell us if the deferred revenues might be similar to this year or just $70 to $100 million, or like last year about $20 million, or will they actually turn positive. And also, if you could tell us how much deferred revenues are on the balance sheet. Our estimate for cumulative net deferred revenues, for all of revenues, is minus $130 million. We just wanted to know if that was roughly in the ballpark.", "Gina Wilson", "", "I\u2019m sorry, Michelle. Can you say that last part again?", "Michelle Ko \u2013 UBS", "", "We also wanted to know how much deferred revenues are on the balance sheet. Our estimate for cumulative net deferral of revenues is minus $130 million, and we just want to see if that was in the ballpark.", "Gina Wilson", "", "Okay. Steve, you want to take the first one? I\u2019ll take the second one.", "Steve Holmes", "", "Sure. Which was the first one? Sorry.", "Gina Wilson", "", "The first one was a view into deferred revenues from \u2013", "Steve Holmes", "", "Oh yes, yes. Well for 2009, we have not yet given guidance, Michelle. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to be able to give you much guidance. This year was \u2013 had more volatility than we\u2019ve seen in the past, and I would not expect to see this thing kind of volatility going forward. But some of it evolves around the fact of our investment in-product that is going into our Club Wyndham Access business, and part of it is the timing of projects as they come on board and the mix of products that are sold. So I can\u2019t give you a specific \u2013 we will \u2013 obviously, we\u2019ll give you something before \u2013 when we give you the forecast, our guidance for 2009. We\u2019ll give you more specifics. But if you\u2019re trying to look at it on a quarterly basis, I would not expect the same volatility that we saw this year. And if you try to look at it on annual basis, I can\u2019t say that it\u2019s going to be a lot different than this year from a beginning of the year to end of the year standpoint.", "Is that accurate or is it more going to be flat? It\u2019ll be probably flat. It\u2019s where \u2013 we\u2019re sitting here, looking at each other trying to decide how best answer to that question.", "Gina Wilson", "", "Okay. And then on your question about what\u2019s on the balance sheet at this point, I just want to remind everybody who hasn\u2019t delved into it as much as you might have. We have a number of different kinds of deferred revenues. So I\u2019m just going to talk about the percentage of completion revenue. We have about $200 million at the (inaudible). ", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Millman with Soleil Securities. Please go ahead.", "Michael Millman \u2013 Soleil Securities", "", "Thank you. It\u2019s Soleil Securities. Could you give us a breakdown between what the VPG for existing and new buyers was, and what you expect it to be? And can you also give us the medication related to that and to the effect on marketing expense of focusing more on existing \u2013 and you expect in \u201909 to be slowing production down or building down? That might affect the deferred revenue as well.", "Steve Holmes", "", "Mike, we\u2019re having a hard time hearing you, but I think your first question was VPG.", "Michael Millman \u2013 Soleil Securities", "", "Yes.", "Steve Holmes", "", "Okay. VPG is, as we said, it was basically flat in the second quarter. What we\u2019re seeing impacting VPG is, in essence, a slightly lower closed rate than you\u2019ve seen in the past. There\u2019s pressure on our closed rate, and our prices is holding up. Most of that is occurring on the front line, which means \u2013 front line is new buyers versus selling to our existing owners. So part of the confidence we have for the rest of the year is the fact that we have a lot of our resource to run (inaudible) fold in the summer and into the fall, and we tend to have a lift in VPG going into the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s \u2013 and I hope that that gives you a sense of VPG.", "You also asked about marketing spend, and our marketing spend is pretty consistent year-over-year with respect to cost per score and general percentage of marketing spend versus revenue. And then \u2013", "Gina Wilson", "", "The last part of the question was about \u201909 and what the impact of the slowing down of sales growth might mean to inventory build, Mike?", "Steve Holmes", "", "Do we still have you, Mike? Okay. Well I\u2019ll keep talking then we\u2019ll go to the next question. ", "The inventory build, as I said, will probably decline by $100 million or so going into 2009. However, this is a planned reduction in spend that will still maintain a solid single-digit growth, and we will drop it down to a double-digit growth and EBITDA. So revenue in single-digit growth, double-digit growth and EBITDA as we go after the more efficient marketing programs as the Wyndham brand kicks in. This is consistent with what we\u2019ve been seeing in the past. The only difference, we\u2019ve always said in the past is, we are going to take our spending down, which will reduce the top line growth, but we feel that we can still get to the bottom line growth we\u2019ve been talking about.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Chris Woronka \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Hey. Good morning, everyone. Steve, did the U.S.FS acquisition at all impact your ability to buyback stock in the second quarter? And then, your corporate expenses were kind of significantly below where we had modeled them. Can you give us any kind of color on that, and then what you\u2019re thinking for the rest of the year on corporate? Thanks.", "Steve Holmes", "", "Sure. I\u2019ll let Gina handle the corporate side. I\u2019ll address the credit, as you said, Chris. When we announced the U.S.FS deal is when \u2013 I think it\u2019s pretty close to the same time, in essence it did put us on negative flop. And then subsequently downgraded us. Normally and in a normal environment, normal being anything that I\u2019ve seen before this environment, doing the acquisition that\u2019s accretive \u2013 the petty cash flow is generally viewed pretty positively. So I would say based on anything historical that I\u2019ve ever seen, doing an acquisition like the U.S.FS deal would not have stressed us any more on the credit side, from a credit capacity side.", "This deal, I could only respond to what I\u2019ve seen happen now from SMP with their action. Obviously, you\u2019ve done as part of the mix that in their decision process. So I think it probably did put some pressure on our credit standing. But again, it was a relatively small deal. It was only $130 million.", "Gina, you want to take the second part of it?", "Gina Wilson", "", "Yes. Chris, I want to make sure that we\u2019re talking about the right numbers. So on a reported basis, you have to remember that there\u2019s some legacy cost in both periods. So they\u2019re substantially different between \u201907 and \u201908. We had corporate expenses without the legacy impact of about $15 million this year, which is roughly in line with what we had anticipating for the full year.", "How that matches up against your model, I don\u2019t have that in front of me.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jake Fuller with Weisel. Please go ahead.", "Jake Fuller \u2013 Weisel", "", "Hey, guys. I wanted to delve into the deferral issue a little bit. It looks like, if I\u2019m working the Math right here, your change in annual deferral revenue guidance implies that the back half deferred revenue went from being a positive to between the $70 to $90 million, to now being negative 9 to positive 20. What\u2019s the big change there?", "Gina Wilson", "", "There are a couple of things going on. Obviously, we had less deferred revenue in the second quarter than we anticipated just based on mix and construction progress. So you can think of that as being pulled forward from the second half. And then the other thing that we now have better visibility into, which we obviously did not last quarter, is we have a good sense of kind of where the sales plans look like they\u2019re going to be for the remainder of the year. And the construction progress on some pretty big projects.", "", "Jake Fuller \u2013 Weisel", "", "I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m hearing you correctly. Then is this a function of a change in the pace of building or a function of a change in the pace itself?", "Gina Wilson", "", "It\u2019s both. And you can always use \u2013 we are more clear about exactly what progress is going to be made on the individual projects. And I think, essentially, the way you can think about changing the range from $40 to $100 million is really about tightening of the range based on our best estimate at this point, which was less precise the last time we talked about it.", "Steve Holmes", "", "If I could, Jake, let me give you an example in the second quarter of what happened. We have a project called National Harbor outside Washington D.C. in the state of Maryland where \u2013 which we were planning on getting into our sales process the beginning of the second quarter. Unfortunately, and Maryland has always been a difficult state to get regulatory approval, that approval did not come through until the very end of the second quarter. So instead of selling what we thought we would be selling for the quarter, we had to shift to other products. And we know the product to sell. It just happened to be products in different parts of the country that was completed so it recorded more revenue that was recordable, and we had less deferred revenue.", "We\u2019re still going to sell the National Harbor product, which has now been approved. It is in the sales cycle. It\u2019s under construction. The project\u2019s coming out of \u2013 is up out of the ground. But it just shifted a little bit quarter-to-quarter. ", "Now, as we move forward in the upcoming years, we will be shifting to a new product called Club Wyndham Access, which is going to give us much better ability to control this deferred revenue number. Deferred revenue was not as big an issue for us years ago because we were building very small projects. Now, as you build these larger projects, you have the ability to have a little bit larger volatility in the deferred revenue. ", "So as an example, just to flush that out a little bit. I don\u2019t know if that was helpful. That\u2019s what happened in the second quarter.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our last question comes from Patrick Scholes [ph] with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. Please go ahead.", "Patrick Scholes \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "", "Hi. Good morning. Gina, I may have missed this on your commentary, but what are your expectations for the timing of upcoming securitizations? And my second question is, I think it was in the December timeshare day, investor day you had, the average credit score of your timeshare customers was approximately 660. Have you seen that change in the \u2013 at the last several months?", "Gina Wilson", "", "We haven\u2019t really talked about when we think we\u2019ll go back to the market to do another term transaction. We\u2019re really pleased with where we are through June 30, with $50 million issuances so far. FICO is up slightly at the end of June compared to 12/31, but it\u2019s in basis points.", "Patrick Scholes \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "", "Thank you.", "Steve Holmes", "", "Melissa, anything else queued up for us?", "Operator", "", "And no one else has queued up at this time.", "Steve Holmes", "", "Okay. Well thank you all very much for attending the call. Go out and take your vacations. It\u2019s good for your health. And we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter.", "Operator", "", "Thank you.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions). Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.", "Now I would like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Miss. Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.", "Margo Happer", "Thank you, Evan. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for the Third Quarter 2008 Wyndham Worldwide Earnings Call. Joining us today are Steve Holmes, our CEO and Gina Wilson, our CFO.", "Before we get started, I just want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking information that is subject to a number of risk factors that may cause our actual results to different materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K, filed February 29, 2008, with the SEC.", "We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these measures to the comparable GAAP measure is provided in the tables to the press release and is available at the Investor Relations section of our website at www.wyndhamworldwide.com. Steve?", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks very much for joining us today. We always look forward to our quarterly calls as an opportunity to share with you the performance of Wyndham Worldwide and the developments within each one of our powerful businesses.", "However, before we get started, I want to spend some time upfront addressing the elephant that has been in our room for the last couple of weeks; specifically, the status of our conduit and our liquidity. I will not spend anytime talking about how tight the credit markets are and the challenges in the current global economy. You all know what is happening out there.", "With respect tour timeshare conduit facility, we expect to close on a new facility led by JPMorgan on or about November 10th. We expect the new conduit to have a capacity of at least $800 million with the standard 364-day term. As we announced previously, we are deemphasizing the growth of our timeshare business and our conduit do not need to be as large as in the past. Not surprisingly, due to the current credit market, the terms are not as attractive as the previous facility.", "The most significant changes are expected to be a decline in the advance rate from around 80% closer to 50% for new loans and an approximate 400 basis point increase in the interest rate. Clearly, these terms will change the financial returns of our timeshare business and I will address that in a few minutes.", "With respect to our timeshare business, I would like to make a few observations and tell you where we are headed. First, we are not seeing the same level of pressure that others have seen with the marketing and sale of timeshare.", "As we have repeatedly said, our points based timeshare model is relatively unique and has multiple distribution channels. As you saw with our third quarter results, our timeshare business continued to perform well because of its scale, and its flexibility. We can sell as much or as little as the consumer can afford to buy. This is a real testament to the product as well as the marketing and sale pros of this business.", "Having said that, despite relative strength in this business, the current credit environment requires some adjustments and that is exactly what we are doing. We have already mentioned that we reduced our sales pace for the timeshare business. This reduction will result in about a 15% decrease in gross VOI sales for the 2008 to 2009.", "We expect our EBITDA from the timeshare business to be in the $370 million to $410 million range for 2009 which is relatively flat compared to 2008. We are reducing the sales pace by closing the least profitable sales offices and eliminating marketing programs that were producing prospects with lower credit quality. Therefore, you will start to see our timeshare sales slow in the fourth quarter of this year as reflected in our revised guidance.", "In addition, we have slowed or delayed our product development pipeline to create more cash flow from this business. We will sell the product on our balance sheet and complete our projects currently under development. We believe that our timeshare business will have adequate inventory to carry us through 2010, by spending approximately $300 million over the next two years on product development.", "As we have said before, the timeshare business is a net user of cash during periods of rapid growth as it has been in the last few years. As we reduce the base of sales and limit our product development, this business will become a cash generator.", "In addition to closing sales offices and eliminating some marketing programs, we recently made additional changes to our sales process. For example, we shortened the term of the consumer paper, and we are increasing down payment requirements at the time of sale; both of which will have the effect of generating additional cash flow. We are also increasing the interest rate on the consumer loans we finance. This sales strategy will over time leave us with a smaller consumer finance portfolio with a stronger credit profile.", "With the uncertainty swirling around the securitized and asset-backed markets, we recognize that the liquidity that existed in this sector in the past may not return for quite a while. If we find that the markets are not opening, we are prepared to make further modifications to our timeshare model and our business model to reduce our need for secured financing.", "We have told you in the past that the timeshare business model is flexible and then we have the ability and experience to actively manage it as circumstances dictate. We are demonstrating that flexibility in the changes we are making now to our sales and development pace for the remainder of 2008 and 2009.", "There are other changes that we can and will make to our sales and consumer finance practices to work within current and changing market dynamics. As Gina will cover later, these changes along with very volatile marketplace make it more difficult to provide precise guidance for our timeshare earnings.", "So, how does all of this impact our liquidity and how are we position today weather this global credit storm? First, since the start of the year, we have managed down our town spend for timeshare inventory from prior guidance of $650 million to $750 million to our current expectation of about $430 million for 2008, showing that we can adjust our spend to the environment.", "Second, the terms of our new timeshare conduit will reduce our advance from existing consumer receivables by about $200 million and we have adequate capacity in our revolver to cover that reduction.", "Third, after a accommodating the new terms of the conduit, we expect to end the year with about $200 million of capacity available under our revolver.", "Fourth, as we pair down this sales pace and development in the timeshare business, we expect to be cash flow positive.", "Finally, while we are expecting to access the securitized markets in 2009, we are prepared to privately sell some of our receivables as we have done in the past or make additional changes to our timeshare operating model to further reduce our need for financing. Given the tools we have available, we are comfortable with our liquidity.", "I will now review our operating results for the third quarter of 2008. As expected, earnings for the third quarter showed growth in total and across each of our three business units. Once again, despite a tough global economic environment, the Wyndham Worldwide business model continues to perform well.", "We believe our brands, geographic distribution, and diverse product offerings combine to produce a stable and resilient business model which even in this environment produced a double-digit third quarter adjusted EPS increase of 11% year-over-year.", "We have worked hard to anticipate the challenges and cut costs while driving for greater efficiency in order to achieve our goals. To that end, we recently announced a series of strategic realignments which are geared towards greater customer focus, as well as cost containment. We do not believe that two are mutually exclusive. While the catalyst for much of the change was to make adjustments for long-term strategic growth, we believe the steps we are taking will also contribute to our success as we navigate the current environment.", "As you saw from the press release, we have identified some additional high return restructuring opportunities. When we originally announced the plans a few weeks ago, we were anticipating pre-tax charges of $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, and $5 million to $10 million in the first quarter of 2009.", "We now anticipate pre-tax restructuring costs of approximately $25 million to $30 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $5 million to $10 million as we said before in the first quarter of 2009.", "Specifically within the business units, the Hotel Group delivered adjusted EBITDA of $76 million, a 9% increase over last year excluding a $4 million charge relating to the strategic realignment. We are pleased with this result as it further demonstrates the resilience and sale of our franchise business model which delivers predictable royalty revenue even in challenging times.", "Our international portfolio is growing with top line royalty income up 17% year-over-year. In addition, our ability to contain costs coupled with the modest impact of the recent acquisition of Microtel and Hawthorn brands position us well to the achieve our full year 2008 EBITDA goals.", "Worldwide RevPAR for the third quarter of 2008 was down 2.7% over last year, reflecting a 4.2% decline in domestic RevPAR, and a 1.7% decrease in international RevPAR which was predominantly impacted by the UK. Year-to-date, worldwide RevPAR was flat versus prior year with international RevPAR up 8% or 3.8% in constant dollars and domestic RevPAR down 3%.", "This quarter, we executed 125 contracts representing another 13,000 rooms. Since this time last year, overall system size is up 2% excluding the impact of Microtel and Hawthorn brands acquisition and the total international portfolio is up almost 17%.", "Our pipeline is strong with over 111,000 rooms, a 7% increase over a year ago and a 2% increase from last quarter indicating strong interest in our brands even in these tough times. Approximately 41% of our pipeline is international, up from 35% a year ago. The Wyndham brand makes up almost 20% of our total pipeline with almost three quarters being new construction and part of that pipeline are three new Wyndham Garden hotels that will open in Manhattan in the next few months.", "Of our entire pipeline, over half represents new construction. Over 80% of the new construction pipeline that is scheduled to open by the end of 2009 has financing already in place. Since the remainder of the pipeline is conversions, there are minimal capital requirements for these franchisees.", "The integration of our newly acquired brands Microtel and Hawthorn suites is nearly complete and we believe the opportunity for growth in these brands even in a weak economy is excellent.", "Now turning to vacation exchange and rentals; for the quarter, Group RCI reported solid revenue growth of 5%, 3% adjusted for currency and EBITDA growth of 2%. Group RCI\u2019s transaction volume decelerated at the end of the quarter as the uncertainty in global markets increase. However EBITDA growth of 2% reflects continued focus on expense control partially offset by higher rental cost of sales.", "As part of the cost control effort, RCI began implementing a restructuring plan in the third quarter focused on reducing overhead cost while funding technology to drive online marketing share growth. The restructuring plan is primarily focused on streamlining the international exchange operations by reducing management layers to improve regional accountability.", "In North America, we are accelerating the move to RCI's new web-based exchange platform and our restructuring plan better aligns our exchange functions with this new platform. The majority of the restructuring plan will be implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008.", "In the vacation exchange business, revenue was down 2% despite 4% growth in average number of exchange members. Annual dues and exchange revenue per member was down 5% for the quarter reflecting a general slowdown in exchange transactions. We believe this is linked to global economic uncertainty, coupled with members postponing longer range vacation plans and an increased impact from our members deciding to simply return to their home resorts or clubs when RCI exchange is not required.", "Member growth moderated only slightly during the quarter; however, we expect a further slowdown as vacation ownership developers reduced sales and marketing programs in reaction to the overall economic environment.", "To address these issues, RCI is launching member retention and renewal campaigns and continuing to promote value vacations. As part of this, its drive to continually improve member experience and move more of its transaction processing to the web, RCI is launching enhanced search for Weeks exchange in early November.", "Earlier this year, we successfully launched the enhanced search for rentals, which resulted in an 18% increase in web bookings during the quarter. The enhanced search for Weeks program will dramatically improve the online experience for RCI's largest member base enhancing and significantly simplifying their web search capabilities while providing more robust information. RCI has already improved web penetration from 12% in the third quarter of 2007 to 16% in the third quarter of 2008.", "Turning to Group RCI's rental business, revenue growth of 9% or 5% adjusted for currency was driver primarily by our Landal GreenParks business. Overall average net price per vacation rental increased 9% or again 5% adjusted for currency reflecting a conversion of one franchise Landal property to a managed park and more favorable pricing mix.", "Vacation rental transactions were flat for the quarter, primarily due to softness in the US member rental market which was impacted by lower member interest and additional vacations. To support the US member rental business, we are focused on close-to-home travel campaigns and targeted promotional activity.", "Group RCI's fourth quarter forecast reflects lower transaction volumes which weaken at the end of the quarter this past quarter, and a negative impact from the stronger dollar. We are reducing revenue and EBITDA to reflect the current economic environment and in Gina will provide more detail shortly.", "Let's turn now to our vacation ownership business. I covered the modifications we are making to our timeshare business at the start of the call. Now, I will spend a few minutes discussing our results for the third quarter.", "Our diverse resort portfolio and our points-based product continued to provide resiliency within our business model supported by a terrific sales organization. Gross VOI sales increased 3% versus prior year reflecting stable tour flow and VPG compared with the same period in 2007. As noted, our fourth quarter sales efficiency, as measured by VPG, is close of those of one year ago.", "As we stated before, we believe our flexible points-based product gives us significant advantage versus those developers who sell a fixed week and therefore a less flexibly priced timeshare product. Points-based timeshare enables our prospective buyers to purchase the amount they want ensuring that we will always have a product and a price to match their pocket book. Moreover, points enabled multiple shorter stays as oppose week long vacations, a key distinction as consumers increasingly opt for less costly and shorter getaways.", "We recently conducted a Wyndham brand research study to confirm our strategy of re-banding our vacation ownership business with the Wyndham name. We are pleased to see that 71% of our owners who bought from us under the Fairfield and WorldMark names believe that their timeshare is more valuable to them today under the Wyndham brand name. Further, these owners ranked the Wyndham vacation ownership product higher than any of our competitors.", "So to wrap up my remarks, once, again, in a very difficult economic environment, we are proud to report year-over-year increases in EBITDA in all three of our businesses. With our recently announced restructuring plans, we are taking the necessary steps to position each business and thereby the company to continue to perform well within the current economic downturn and at the same time to be poised for growth when the economic recovery begins.", "In the meantime, we will continue to deliver value to well over one hundred million guests, add more franchised hotels to our system to surpass the 7,000 hotel mark, affiliate more resorts and rental properties to RCI\u2019s family of 67,000 plus locations and leverage our tremendous scale to deliver results for our franchisees and affiliates and of course, our shareholders. Gina?", "Gina Wilson", "Thank you, Steve and good morning everyone. Since Steve spent a good amount of time going through the results, let me detail some additional items from the quarter, focus on update for 2008 guidance, and then provide you with some high level thoughts around 2009.", "As you saw from the press release, this quarter\u2019s results were pretty much what we had expected which is quite an achievement in this environment and as Steve mentioned, illustrates the strength of our model and the dedication and skill of our employees in consistently executing that model.", "Business unit performance was consistent with our expectations and corporate performance was better than expected, reflecting $4 million from a combination of continued cost containment and favorable currency translations.", "Like many companies, we suspended our share repurchase program during the quarter. We have $155 million available under the current authorization, but at this time we expect to defer further purchases until the macroeconomic outlook and credit environment are more positive.", "Overall, the consumer finance portfolio continued to perform within our revised expectations during the quarter. Write-offs as a percent of the quarter end gross loan balances were close to 2.5% for the third quarter, consistent with levels we have seen in the last four quarters. The provision for loan loss for the period as a percent of gross VOI sales less deferred percent of completion revenues again was consistent with recent periods.", "To provide more transparency, you will notice that we have included a separate line on the income statement in table two this quarter for consumer financial interest expense. This information was previously available in the footnotes but now you can easily calculate the net interest margin on the face of the income statement.", "That consumer finance interest expense is one component of the cost associated with our consumer finance operations. Other costs are integrated in the WVO and corporate overall cost structures, our best estimate for EBITDA contribution from the timeshare unit\u2019s financing operation for the last several years has been somewhere between 20% and 30%, depending on how we allocate share costs and excluding any allocation for loan loss. Obviously, that contribution will be reduced as we look at expected financing conditions going forward, and those assumptions are included in our 2009 guidance.", "Now, moving onto our expectations for the remainder of this year. We expect fourth quarter EPS of $0.41 to $0.46 that assumes neutral fourth quarter deferred revenue from vacation ownership and a reduction of about a penny due to changes in the foreign exchange spot rates since the end of the third quarter.", "We have slightly modified full year guidance based on current business trends. Despite the challenging environment, our revenue drivers for the year are tracking to expectations albeit hovering around the lower end of their ranges. We have moved quickly to scale back vacation ownership and based on that initiative, we now expect full year 2008 tour flow and volume per guest to be relatively flat compared to 2007.", "In lodging and Group RCI, we are taking into account these generally weaker revenue drivers. So, we expect 2008 lodging revenues to be $755 million to $770 million. The majority of the revenue shortfall was in low or no margin revenues such as reimbursable cost passthroughs in the managed hotels. Therefore, we are not changing EBITDA guidance to $235 million to $245 million as we have been able to mitigate the remainder of the revenue shortfall with continued cost containment.", "We are adjusting Group RCI\u2019s 2008 revenue grange down to $1.25 billion to $1.275 billion and EBITDA down to a range of $300 million to $310 million, about $45 million of revenue reduction and $11 million of the EBITDA revenue relates to current foreign exchange assumptions compared to the previous July 31st guidance. The remainder of the change relates to trends that we have seen in the third quarter and into the last few weeks.", "Taking our recent operational changes into consideration, we are adjusting vacation ownership\u2019s revenue range down to $2.33 billion to $2.38 billion or down about $120 million to $170 million. EBITDA will be down to a range of $360 million to $385 million to former range of $390 million to $410 million.", "There is no change to our guidance for depreciation and amortization. We have reduced our net interest expense guidance by $5 million to a range of $70 million to $80 million to reflect our current estimates regarding borrowing levels rates and capitalized interest for Q4. We expect our full year tax rate to remain at about 38%.", "One other thing related to the rest of the year. Under FAS 142, we are required on an annual basis to perform a goodwill impairment assessment which requires among other things a reconciliation of our current market capitalization to shareholders equity.", "Based on our recent stock price, our total shareholders equity exceeds our market capitalization. If our stock price continues to be depressed, we may be required to report a non-cash charge for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter.", "We are unable to estimate the amount if any of a potential charge at this time but for your reference, our total goodwill balance as of September 30, 2008, was $2.7 billion comprised of $300 million related to lodging, $1.1 billion to our vacation exchange and rental business and $1.3 billion to our vacation ownership segment and our current market cap is about $1.3 billion, any charge could be substantial.", "Now, moving onto 2009; I will echo what many other companies have said during this reporting cycle and caution that the economic environment continues to be unstable and visibility is reduced. This preliminarily look at 2009 is based on current foreign exchange rates and significant movements between key operating currencies will be reflected at actual results.", "Recent strengthening in the dollar versus other currencies for example has reduced our expected 2009 growth in revenues and EBITDA for RCI by 7% to 5% respectively. Having said that, based on current trends, we currently expect total company revenues of $4.1 billion to $4.5 billion and EBITDA of $830 million to $890 million for 2009.", "We expect vacation ownership\u2019s revenues to be relatively flat and that assumes about $75 million to $175 million of recognition of previously deferred percent of completion revenue. Under the current scenario, vacation ownership\u2019s EBITDA will also remain relatively flat reflecting improved margins on the rolling of those deferred revenues and an average lower level of securitized borrowing.", "There will be a corresponding increase in corporate interest expense net of about $100 million next year based on higher corporate borrowing levels. This early look at what we expect for 2009 will be refined as we wrap up our budget process in the coming weeks. We expect to provide a more detailed outlook for 2009 in December via a conference call instead of an in person Investor Day and we will nail down the date and time for that call in the near future.", "Now I will turn it back to Steve before we go to Q&A.", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks Gina. Before taking questions, I would like to close with a few key points. First, we are well positioned to weather this economic storm. We previously announced and began working on a strategy to rebalance our earnings sometime ago to lower the contribution from vacation ownership in favor of our Hotel Group.", "The current economic conditions have accelerated that strategy and we have taken the necessary steps to enhance our liquidity. We have the talent and management expertise to perform even in these market conditions.", "Our fee-for-service model combined with our global scale and product diversity give us solid financial stability. Second, in the past when the economy has been soft, our franchise hotel brands have been particularly attractive to hotel owners and financial institutions seeking global marketing, sales and reservations. Further, customers aiming to save but not stop their travel choose our brands because of their exceptional value. Finally, our current share price provides investors with a very attractive long-term value.", "On that note, Gina and I will take any questions you have. Evan?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question today comes from Steve Kent with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir.", "Steve Kent - Goldman Sachs", "Hi, good morning. Two questions, first Steve and Gina, just walk me through the margin improvement in timeshare, again, essentially for late '08 into '09. What I'm struggling with is, it feels like part of it is just reducing marketing expense and at the same time it's also just slowing down timeshare and if you slowdown timeshare sales, you just naturally get an improvement in margins because of the sort of the way the mix of the business is going and I had this conversation with somebody already this morning and we're just trying to understand that.", "Then the second question is, just on your pipeline, you seem to be gaining some traction here, are you gaining market share from your competitors in part because you're doing any discounting or offering any financing or doing any of those other things or is it just simply people transitioning from other brands into your brands or independent into your brands?", "Steve Holmes", "Okay. Thanks for those questions Steve. Gina and I will tackle them. First on the margin improvement question on timeshare, you\u2019re right that as we take down the volume of our sales pace and we're not growing at a double-digit rate, we will get some marketing efficiency both from the use of the Wyndham brand as well as from the fact that we go through a process of removing the sales offices that are not performing as well and taking out the marketing programs that aren't performing as well.", "So, it's kind of Darwinism, survival of the strongest and the strongest offices are continuing to sell. So, that's a kind of a natural impact of the slowdown of the business. And we would expect to see that continue, but at the same time, obviously we've had to take some steps to remove some of the fixed overhead as well. And then Gina, do you want to address the loan loss?", "Gina Wilson", "Oone of the other things that you would see if you look at this quarter or the year-to-date performance is, loan loss is also reducing revenue which has a modest impact on the reported margins and we're doing our very best to analyze and make sure that we're estimating next year appropriately for the impact that that will have as well.", "Steve Holmes", "Then finally for the margin question, we will see some interest expense shift from the EBITDA timeshare down to our corporate interest expense line. As some of our, some of the financing that we previously did with securitized positions are not going to be as large relative to the size of the business, so there will be some shift down. So hopefully Steve, between all that we kind of answered the margin question.", "The second one about why are we attracting people to our hotel brands? We have continually attracted people to our hotel brands. The fact is that in the past few years, we've been terminating a large number of properties, kind of cleaning out our brands, but we've always had a high level of interest in the brands.", "What we've seen historically in difficult times like these, two things happened; one, the brands become more relevant to the hotel owner. A hotel owner who's performing well in a great market because, a rising tide lifts all boats as has been the case for the last few years; may not feel they need to go branded and may feel comfortable remaining independent. As times gets tougher, there is definitely an attraction of joining a brand.", "Our brands happen to be very, very powerful brands in the economy in mid scale sector, and now with our new Wyndham offering, we have a brand that we can compete very effectively in the upper up scale segment. So, I don't think that there's any rate change other than it will be probably and we'll see more of it a shift of people looking to move toward brands. But we've maintained a strong position with our brands throughout the years.", "Steve Kent - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Will Truelove of UBS. Sir, your line is open.", "Will Trulove - UBS", "Hi. I've got a few questions, I think Gina you can help me out with few of them. The conduit facility, I know it\u2019s due at the end of October and now it\u2019s potentially around November 10th. Is there any shift in any of that to the corporate line of credit or is that just, how does that work?", "Steve Holmes", "You mean the shift, in the timing? I understand your question. There won't be any shift in it. The conduit will remain in place and we're working with JPMorgan and about seven other banks to put the new facility in place over the next few days. In essence to give you kind of a little more color on the update, we're in the process of going through with the rate agency, all the documentation that's required to complete in order to close the facility, but we're very confident based on all the discussions with the banks which we've had over the last 48 hours to get this closed at that point in time.", "At the time that we closed the transaction, there will be a shift, and that's why I mentioned in part of my script is, when we close the transaction, we'll be taking roughly around $200 million that's currently out in the conduit and we will fund that from our revolver, because our advance rate will be lower on the revolver, on the new con to you it. But I think the terms that we're looking at is about a reduction of 80% to 60% immediately and then there's a 50% advance rate for all new loans that are going in. So, I'm not sure which question you were asking. I answered a couple of them there.", "Will Trulove - UBS", "Yeah. That was helpful. Quickly on timeshare cash flow expectations; you mentioned you were going to do maybe 370 and 410 in EBITDA in timeshare and if you do $300 million of CapEx over two years, I\u2019m just going to take it easy 150 annually. So, essentially I could just take the EBITDA minus the CapEx and any other types of adjustments for a segmentation basis for cash flow and timeshare?", "Gina Wilson", "The only other pieces that we haven't given you yet is we haven't given you an idea about what the operating CapEx is going to be, and we are still in the process of working with the business units to sort of take their lists and scrub them appropriately which we should have some very sort of solid numbers to share with you when we talk in December and then there's also some modeling related to our working capital strain related to receivables.", "Will Trulove - UBS", "Can you assure\u2026", "Gina Wilson", "Unfortunately, you don't have enough information to get a real beat on it.", "Will Trulove - UBS", "Okay, so that's common theme. So, can I have maybe what was going on in 2008 so far or what the projection was in 2008 for those two line items?", "Steve Holmes", "Well, I think we did show in the information we've given in the past what we thought the receivable financing takeout would be on a cash basis. We haven't updated any modeling for the timeshare business by itself. We will be doing that in the December call that we do when we kind of finalize what 2009 will look like and some of it will be depended upon the way that we finance our receivables. If we take them to the private market as we've done in the past, the advance rate maybe what we're currently achieving. It may be better or it may be worse, I'm not sure. It depends on what the market is like at that time. Based on how we're looking forward to 2009, I think the best way to model, it would probably be to assume that 2009 timeshare is pretty much cash flow neutral. If we can make it a cash flow generator, assume as 2009 will do it, but I would probably model it kind of neutral.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Woronka of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.", "Chris Woronka - Deutsche Bank", "Hey, good morning. Steve, how do you look at some of the adjustments you\u2019re making on CapEx and OpEx on timeshare? How do you balance that with a year to two year weakness in the economy versus your longer-term view of the business and kind of how quickly do you read in costs and how quickly can you bring them back?", "And then the second question is, what kind of appetite do you have for more lodging brand acquisitions given liquidity situation investors are having a preference for preserving capital but you might see some opportunities out there that were pricing as attractive?", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks for the questions, Chris. Let's talk about OpEx CapEx for the timeshare business first and how quickly can we adjust the cost spin. We've shown that we can adjust it pretty quickly. I mean we're decreasing our sales pace by 15% next year over what we did in 2008 and we're effectuating that now. Now, we're taking it down by taking out the unprofitable sales offices and marketing programs.", "We could go deeper if we needed to. We would prefer not to, because we've got a great business model. We've got incredible sales organization and marketing group down at the vacation ownership group and we think that we can be very, very profitable at the pace that we're now projecting for 2009.But if we needed to be down lower because the financing market is worse, we would do that and we would do it very quickly.", "Mush of the cost associated with timeshare is variable cost, when you look at it. When you sell timeshare about 25% of the revenue is spent on the product, well, we\u2019re not selling anything, we have no product cost it\u2019s just going to sit on our balance sheet.", "About 25% of the sales cost of the price is commissions, sales commissions. Obviously, if we're not selling anything, those go away. And another 25% is marketing, I know that marketing, probably about half of it you'd consider to be variable, because a large portion is just the incentive that we give away at the time that we sell the timeshare, whether it's Wyndham rewards points or some other element that we give away when we sell the timeshare, and then the remainder of our profit is G&A that we have to obviously right size for the size of the business as we project it needs to be.", "So, I don't mean to give you too much detail Chris, but I'm just trying to walk through the elements of why we can flex this business very, very quickly. And we're obviously hopeful that there will be a return in the securitization market sometime in 2009, but if there isn't we'll probably place the receivables if we don't see that that's possible. Unfortunately we have to downsize the business further.", "And then with respect to the acquisition question, I think it's safe to say that right now we would probably view liquidity as a more important aspect than acquisitions, even though there may be a lot of attractive opportunities out there. We've got to see a stabilization of the credit markets before we start turning our eyes to either acquisitions or share buyback.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kevin Milota of JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir. ", "Kevin Milota - JPMorgan", "Good morning. Just have a couple of questions on balance sheet and capitalization issues. The new $800 million conduit, just kind of get your expectations for usage in 2009. Secondly, net debt, what your expectations are for year-end of '09? And also are you working to increase the revolver size, the corporate revolver size and then lastly CapEx excluding timeshare development for 2009? I Appreciate it.", "Steve Holmes", "Okay. I'm just writing down the questions because you've got these multiple questions and they become challenging. The conduit, what I said was the conduit would be at least $800 million. Obviously, we're still bringing in a few people and we're trying to get the, the best balance of our conduit facility and so we know that it will be at least $800 million.", "Just to kind of give you a sense of what we've done in the past, the average draw that we've had in the conduit has been somewhere around $600 million in 2009 looking forward to what of what we think the draw will be on the conduit for 2009 based on our current sales base, we're thinking it will probably be around $500 million. I'm not sure if that answered both the questions that you had there.", "We're not currently looking to increase our revolver. We have a $900 million revolver. We think that's adequate to what we need. With respect to the CapEx, excluding timeshare for 2009, I think for purposes of if you're trying to model something, for purposes of modeling, I would assume that it's about the same level as it was for 2008 and we'll try to give you better visibility when we have our call in December.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Millman of Soleil Securities. Your line is open.", "Michael Millman - Soleil Securities", "Thank you. You said Soleil Securities. I guess going over some of the same ground; on the timeshare development, how is the development financed? And when you complete development, does it go from, if as a construction loan to some other loan and do you have that available, that's the first question.", "Steve Holmes", "Well, there is two ways that we finance the development of timeshare, Mike. One is just we do it on our balance sheet. We do off the corporate availability of the revolver. The second is that we use developers to build for us, turnkey developments and we've done that a number of times and actually have moved more to that model over the last year. So where we'll find a developer who has a piece of land and wants to develop it for us and we negotiate a fixed price for that development. So, those are the two ways we do. We do not go out and get construction loans.", "Michael Millman - Soleil Securities", "So, what you show on the balance sheet, does that include and what's being turn keyed for you?", "Steve Holmes", "On the inventory, is you're question related to inventory?", "Michael Millman - Soleil Securities", "Yes. ", "Steve Holmes", "Only if we've closed on it. Obviously, if we've purchased it, it then is on our balance sheet, yes.", "Gina Wilson", "And it's in the commitments table in the 10-Q by year of when we expect to actually execute those commitments.", "Michael Millman - Soleil Securities", "Could you give us some numbers as to what that looks like in total for '09 and 2010?", "Steve Holmes", "Well, it's concluded in the $300 million that we\u2019d expect to spend over the next two years Mike. Some of the projects that we will be closing on in 2009 are turnkey projects.", "Gina Wilson", "Yeah. And if you look at the second quarter 10-Q in the commitments table inside the financial condition and liquidity section, you'll see our best guess as of that point in time. We've obviously adjusted that. So, stay tuned and look at the 10-Q when we file it shortly.", "Michael Millman - Soleil Securities", "And looking it looks like, I guess 30,000 feet, is that you're saying \u201809\u2019s earnings will be kind of similar to \u201808's less something on the order of $0.30, $0.40, $0.50 of interest, is that the correct way to look at that?", "Steve Holmes", "That sounds a little heavy on the interest. There will be more interest expense, but not to that tune. I mean, $30 million, if you meant $30 million, it's probably, that might be in the neighborhood, but not $0.30.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)", "Steve Holmes", "Alright, Evan. It sounds like we have no more questions. We appreciate everybody's time. We look forward to talking to you next on the December call to give you an update in more detail for 2009 and we appreciate all your support and look forward to finishing the year strong.

Morgan", "Steve Kent - Goldman Sachs", "William Truelove - UBS", "Chris Woronka - Deutsche Bank", "Patrick Scholes - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "Michael Millman - Soleil-Millman Research Associates", "Leon Cooperman - Omega Advisors", "[Matt Mickel - Eva Evans Investors]", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)", "I would now like to introduce Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.", "Margo Happer", "", "Thank you, [Tanya]. ", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO, and Gina Wilson, our CFO. ", "Before we get started, I just want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking information that is subject to a number of risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form\u00a010-Q filed November 10, 2008 with the SEC. ", "We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these measures to the comparable GAAP measure is provided in the tables to the press release and is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at WyndhamWorldwide.com.", "Steve?", "Steve Holmes", "", "Thanks, Margo. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today.", "Difficult years such as 2008 test a company's business model and strategy as well as the capabilities and adaptability of its employees and management team. Overall, I believe Wyndham Worldwide handled this test quite well.", "For the year, revenues were up in our Hotel and Vacation Exchange and Rental businesses and down modestly in Vacation Ownership as we expected, which reflects our reconciliation efforts in that business. We have rebalanced our business mix, reduced our need to access the ABS market, and made meaningful expense reductions. In a year when so many companies across a variety of industries are facing doubts about the viability of their business models, we think Wyndham Worldwide's 2008 performance stands out.", "During the fourth quarter we continued to restructure our operations to reflect the realities of the current marketplace and incurred restructuring charges of $73 million. When we complete our previously announced restructuring work in the first quarter of 2009, we will have incurred $110 to $125 million of restructuring charges that will save us approximately $160 to $180 million annually. ", "In addition, as we mentioned in our last quarterly call, in the fourth quarter we were required to writedown our timeshare goodwill and various other assets that resulted in non-cash charges of approximately $1.4 billion. In the process of brining up liquidity in our foreign operations we incurred $24 million of currency conversion losses related to the transfer of cash from Venezuela. And finally, we recognized the net benefit from $14 million of legacy adjustments. ", "Excluding these special charges, the strength of our operating results showed through. Adjusted fourth quarter EBITDA and EPS increased 5% and 2% respectively over 2007. Our operating results increased over prior year despite our decision to decrease the sales pace at our timeshare business, an increase in the loan loss provision for our consumer finance portfolio, which Gina will discuss in a few minutes, and the extremely difficult economic environment with clear pressure on RevPAR in the hotel industry. These impressive results would not have been possible without the proactive efforts to control costs and drive efficiency by our team and the strength of our fee-for-service business models. ", "Despite these positive results, the outlook for the hospitality industry remains challenged as we enter 2009. We have issued revised guidance this morning that reflects continuing pressure on some of our revenue drivers, the implementation of our decision to reduce the size of our timeshare business, and significant pressure from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar on our international earnings. These pressures resulted in less than a 5% reduction from our previously provided adjusted EBITDA guidance range, again, a testament to the resiliency of our business models.", "Before I run through the performance for the business units, I would like to take a moment to address another announcement we issued this morning. We announced the intention to commence an equity drawdown program of up to $200 million. While the credit markets have shown some signs of life, we feel it is prudent to strengthen our balance sheet and free up some additional availability under our credit lines. We certainly would prefer not to issue equity at these low prices, but the volatility in the credit markets is not comforting and we want to retain the strength to take advantage of opportunities as they will undoubtedly become available during this dramatic downturn for our industry.", "Now I'll turn to the performance of the business units, beginning with the Hotel Group, which delivered both revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth for the full year 2008. Full year revenues were up 4% and adjusted EBITDA was up 7%. Worldwide RevPAR was down slightly, helped by a larger contribution from international RevPAR, which held up well for most of the year. ", "We delivered on the EBITDA guidance we provided back in December 2007 despite declining RevPARs because we grew our system size. We were able to implement revenue generating initiatives both on and off property, as well as cost containment efforts. This drove a nice increase in our adjusted franchising margin to about 80%. ", "Fourth quarter revenue declined 3%, while adjusted EBITDA was up 10% from the fourth quarter of 2007. ", "Given the deteriorating economic environment in 2008, I'm pleased with these results. Nevertheless, 2009 will be a challenging year. Some industry experts are now predicting RevPAR declines in excess of 10% domestically. While our current guidance reflects these most recent predictions, we will continue to adjust our business model to accommodate the uncertain global economic environment while prudently maintaining the infrastructure and business engine needed to take advantage of growth opportunities when they present themselves later this year and next, particularly for our management company and our flagship Wyndham Hotels and Resorts brand.", "We made significant strides that have helped fortify margins in this environment and will support increased growth when the economy begins to recover. For example, we've ramped up our development efforts despite the downturn. We executed 185 new contracts in the fourth quarter. Our pipeline remains strong, with almost 111,000 rooms, up 5% from a year ago. Over 42% of our pipeline is international. That's up from about 39% a year ago. ", "Last quarter I said that we were going to provide our properties with enhanced revenue management services to ensure they are well positioned to maximize their fair market share. To date we have rolled out this service to over 1,100 hotels and expect to roll it out to another 1,700 hotels by the end of 2009. Results to date of those properties using these services has been very positive, with measurable increases in RevPAR. ", "Additionally, our e-commerce channels grow year-over-year, and we continue to implement important enhancements that are driven by consumer usage and insights. Customers who come to one of our websites will enjoy an even better customer experience. We believe that even in these tough times we need to invest in this important distribution channel.", "And finally, our loyalty program, Wyndham Rewards. It continues to expand in North America and internationally, where we recently launched Wyndham Rewards in 18 new countries across Europe. We have the largest loyalty program in the industry, with over 6,000 participating hotels. Our members can now redeem their points across all of our businesses so they can stay in hotels, vacation rentals, and even use points to pay timeshare maintenance fees. This is another significant competitive advantage as we lever our scale and product diversity with our customers.", "Let me give you a little bit more color on our development activities. In the fourth quarter of 2008 we opened over 19,000 rooms, including our first two Wyndham Garden Hotels in New York City. One is the newly constructed 224-room Wyndham Garden Hotel Midtown Convention Center that's on 36th Street, and the other is the all-new 124-room Wyndham Garden Hotel Manhattan Chelsea West on 24th Street. These are two exceptional hotels that have received rave reviews from guests and media alike.", "Super 8 also opened its 2,100th property, an all new construction hotel in Monterey, Tennessee, and we opened 16 hotels in China, bringing our total number of properties up to 171 open, with another 105 in the pipeline, further cementing our position as the U.S. hotel company with the most properties in China.", "Overall system size reached 593,000 rooms, up 8% compared to a year ago. We exceeded 7,000 properties for the first time. This reflects both the 19,000 rooms we opened and an improved retention rate on expiring franchisee contracts. We grew the international portfolio 15% in 2008, an important component of our growth strategy that we've spoken about.", "Before I move on the Vacation Exchange and Rental business, I would like to take a moment to welcome the Hotel Group's new President and CEO, Eric Danziger. Eric, who started on December\u00a01, has more than 30 years of experience in the hotel industry, including previous roles with Wyndham, Doubletree, Starwood, Carlson Hotels, and many others. He has a proven track record of growth and success in key management roles. With his strong track record of successfully managing hotels and growing brands domestically and internationally, along with his palpable passion for the business, I couldn't be more pleased to have Eric at the helm of our Hotel Group. ", "Now turning to Vacation Exchange and Rentals, Group RCI continues to deliver to plan despite a tough operating environment. For the full year revenues grew 3% to $1.3 billion. After adjusting for restructuring charges, asset impairments, and the currency conversion losses to get the money out of Venezuela that I spoke about before, full year EBITDA was up 8% and within our December 2007 guidance range. Fourth quarter revenues and adjusted EBITDA were down 11% and up 13% respectively, reflecting great cost controls and favorable impacts in hedging activities.", "In the Vacation Exchange business, fourth quarter revenue per member was lower, driven by a slowdown in exchange transactions. We believe that member transactions reflect reduced vacation travel, members postponing bookings of longer-range vacations, and members returning to their home resort, where an RCI exchange is not required. ", "While member growth held up in 2008, we expect a slowdown in organic member growth in 2009 as timeshare developers reduce their sales and marketing programs. To offset this trend, RCI continues to add upscale and quality affiliations around the globe. RCI was proud to announce that the Disney Vacation Club, one of the world's most innovative and fastest-growing brands in the vacation ownership industry, entered into an exclusive multi-year affiliation relationship with RCI. The addition of Disney Vacation Club adds more than 135,000 member families and nine high-quality resorts to RCI's global exchange network.", "RCI has enhanced its marketing messages in response to the current environment and launched renewal campaigns and promotions to drive transactions. 2009 marks the 35th anniversary of the RCI exchange business, and we are rolling out a series of sales and marketing celebrations around the event, including a deposit and exchange campaign and the first-ever RCI WebTV programming, that will be showcased next month at ARDA, which is the industry's largest annual conference. ", "RCI also continues to expand and leverage technology in the fourth quarter to improve member experience and move transaction processing to the web. To drive more transactions online, RCI rolled out a price increase for call center exchange transactions while holding prices constant on the web. The new search technology and pricing initiatives have already resulted in increased web transactions. For instance, in our North American region, web transactions reached 25% in January, up from 17% last year. ", "In Group RCI's rental business, fourth quarter revenues were down 10%, reflecting declines in both transactions and currency impacts on average net price per vacation rental. The decline in transaction was driven by softness in the U.S. member rental market, which was impacted by lower member interest in additional vacations. In addition, our Danish and U.K. cottage rental businesses also experienced weakness due to reduced bookings of 2009 vacations. Landal, our Dutch [inaudible] business, showed continued strength and grew transactions during the quarter. Given the fourth quarter's softness in advanced bookings for 2009 vacations, our European rental teams have launched targeted promotional campaigns around Easter, school breaks, and the summer. ", "Now let's turn to our vacation ownership business. In early December we announced a plan to reduce our need to access the term securitization markets by significantly reducing the size and scope of our Vacation Ownership business. We are well into executing our plans to reduce our development spend, eliminating our most costly marketing platforms, and closing our selected sales offices around the country. As a result of these measures, this business is expected to reduce its annual gross VOI sales by roughly 40% from 2008 levels to approximately $1.2\u00a0billion in 2009.", "For the year, WVO revenues were down 6% to $2.3 billion and adjusted EBITDA was down 5% to $366\u00a0million. Fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA were down 15% and 8%, respectively. Reported EBITDA for this business for the fourth quarter and full year reflects a $1.3\u00a0billion non-cash goodwill impairment charge.", "Resizing our Vacation Ownership business will significantly reduce costs and capital needs while enhancing cash flow. It's important to point out that, although the credit markets should eventually return to a more normalized condition and while we will continue to pursue additional term securitizations, we will not return to growing the timeshare business at the rapid double-digit rates we've seen in recent years. Rather, the future growth of this business will be tempered by our focus on cash flow generation and margin improvement. ", "We will focus an even greater effort on prospective buyers already within our reach, namely, our industry leading base of more than 830,000 existing owners who represent our lowest cost and highest efficiency tour prospects. Our points-based product has long helped fuel our success in owner upgrades, and we're confident in our ability to optimize the sale channel in 2009 and well beyond. ", "So in summary, we feel very good about the strategic shift we made in our Vacation Ownership business. These past few months have been difficult for many of our associates at WVO, but our people have remained focused and committed through these changes and our results for the quarter demonstrate the extraordinary ability of this team to adapt and evolve to meet the challenges of this environment.", "As you may recall, we actually initiated the resizing of our Vacation Ownership business at the beginning of the fourth quarter by closing 12 sales offices and implementing higher tour qualification standards. This resulted in a year-over-year decline in tour flow and related gross VOI sales revenues of 10% and 12% respectively for the quarter. Fourth quarter sales efficiencies were also slightly lower than last year, and we attribute this mainly to the disruptive working environment resulting from our restructuring activities. And, as Gina will tell you, we saw improved efficiencies in January.", "Despite the pressure on consumers in the economy, our resort occupancy and advanced reservation remains strong and in line with last year's levels. Consumers are still buying timeshare products and owners are actively using their timeshare vacations. ", "Now let me turn the call over to Gina, our CFO.", "Gina Wilson", "", "Thanks, Steve. As you saw from the release today, excluding special items we ended the quarter and the year ahead of our expectations. In fact, we ended the year less than 5% below our original EBITDA and EPS guidance range issued in October of 2007. We're very pleased with that performance given the challenges the industry has faced this year, particularly in the fourth quarter. ", "Now let me walk you through our 2008 results in a little more detail, give you a look at what we're seeing so far this year, and detail our 2009 full year guidance.", "As Steve mentioned, the Hotel Group delivered both revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth over 2007. For the full year, revenues increased 4% to $753 million. Excluding $16 million in impairment charges and $4 million in restructuring, full year 2008 adjusted EBITDA increased 7% from 2007. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $54 million, excluding the $16 million in impairment charges, up 10% from 2007. ", "These are remarkable achievements considering the impact the economy is having on the entire hotel industry. These results include our July acquisition of Microtel and Hawthorn. More importantly, these results demonstrate both the resilience of our fee-driven business model and the proactive and strategic financial management that's at the core of our company's DNA.", "Worldwide RevPAR for the fourth quarter of 2008 was down 6.4% in constant currency or 6.2% including currency. Domestic RevPAR decreased 9.3%, while international RevPAR decreased 1.6% in constant dollars.", "Franchising margin for 2008 improved over 500 basis points to 80%, and while we don't expect to continue operating our business at 80% plus margins for the long term, these results reflect the flexibility of our cost structure in very tough economic times and our ability to take meaningful and timely action that flows through to the bottom line.", "As Steve mentioned, the pipeline is strong, with almost 111,000 rooms. 55% of that total pipeline is new construction, with almost 20% of the new construction pipeline already in the ground.", "The Wyndham brand makes up close to 19% of the total pipeline, with over 70% being new construction deals, of which 60% of the scheduled openings in the next 12 months already have secured financing and almost a quarter are already in the ground. And with 45% of our pipeline being conversions, it generally takes minimal franchisee capital to bring those properties from the pipeline into open and operating status. ", "Moving to 2009, January RevPAR comparisons versus the prior year were consistent with December. Taking that information into account as well as industry projections and our expected mix of domestic and international properties for the full year, we expect our RevPAR to decline 6% to 10% worldwide, system size to increase 3% to 6%, revenues to be $720 to $760\u00a0million, and adjusted EBITDA of $200 to $230 million. ", "Now turning to Vacation Exchange and Rentals, excluding special items and the net impact of foreign currency, Group RCI full year revenue grew by $25 million or 2%, with adjusted EBITDA up $10 million or 3% compared to 2007. For the fourth quarter, excluding special items, revenue was $250 million, down 11%, and adjusted EBITDA was $63 million, up 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. The special items for the quarter totaled $67 million pre-tax and included a restructuring expense of $7 million related to our previously announced plans to reduce costs, primarily in the international exchange businesses. ", "Asset impairments of $36 million related to businesses in the EMEA region, where Group RCI reassessed its strategic direction resulting in updated business valuations. And currency conversion losses of $24 million related to the transfer of cash from our Venezuela business for access by our broader international operations. The strength of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2008 reduced revenue by $22 million; however, EBITDA benefited by $10\u00a0million, primarily due to gains related to our hedging contracts. ", "January trends continue to be below prior year, but are in line with our expectations. In Exchange we're seeing stable trends in North America behind enhanced marketing. Some of our Rental businesses in Europe are seeing resiliency and performing well. In January, revenue for our Holiday Cottages group in the U.K. is running ahead of the prior year. Holiday Cottages has also made significant progress in driving consumers to our online channel, where the number of online bookings in January increased from 50% to 65% of all bookings compared to the prior year. ", "Looking to 2009, we expect average numbers of members to grow between 1% and 4%, annual dues and Exchange revenue per member to be down 6% to 10% based on lower expected transactions and a stronger dollar, flat Vacation Rental transactions, and average net price per Vacation Rental down 4% to 7%, reflecting that stronger dollar. We expect Vacation Exchange and Rental revenues of $1.05 to $1.15 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $260 to $290 million. ", "Note that the RCI guidance ranges include a significant negative impact from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar as measured on January 31, 2009 compared to 2008 levels. As you know, RCI operates in about 100 countries with many currencies. One thing that's unusual about the current environment is the magnitude and extent of the strengthening of the dollar against nearly every foreign currency. For example, a 10% change in the dollar would result in an $8 million impact on RCI's full year 2009 EBITDA. If RCI guidance was presented on a constant currency basis compared to 2008 results, the revenue range would be increased by approximately $135\u00a0million and EBITDA would be increased by approximately $55 million.", "Now let's turn to the Vacation Ownership business. As Steve said, the Vacation Ownership team is doing a great job implementing the December plan and the business is tracking to our expectations. We have adjusted our marketing programs and closed over 50 sales offices, which will reduce our 2009 tour flow 40% to 50% compared to 2008 levels. We are finishing our existing construction projects, which, combined with our completed inventory, will give us enough product to meet our reduced sales expectations as we look out into 2009 and 2010. ", "We've tightened credit standards to increase average FICO scores and have aligned our commission programs to drive higher down payments, which over time will continue to improve the overall strength of the consumer finance portfolio. ", "The business is responding well to these changes. Booking rates and occupancy levels at our properties are consistent with last year, which is particularly impressive when you consider that the number of units has increased 9% January '08 to January '09. On the sales front, January volume per guest, which is a blend of close rates and price, was up 14% compared to the prior year and tour flow is tracking to plan.", "Despite our intention slowdown in late 2008, we maintained gross VOI, tour flow and volume per guest in 2008 at levels close to those achieved in 2007. Our January sales are tracking to plan and we continue to believe that the timeshare product is a good fit for a broad portion of the American public, who continue to plan vacations with their family and friends. In the near term, those vacations may be closer to home or fewer days or less extravagant. ", "Our product, which is truly points based rather than fixed weeks, provides customers flexibility in this environment to match price to their budget. And our top-notch sales force can sell this product remotely or from the actual resort location, giving us a broad distribution network which enables us to connect with consumers in the many places where Americans continue to travel. ", "In the fourth quarter, we increased the provision for loan loss to $136 million, up from $84\u00a0million in the prior year. Write-offs in the fourth quarter were about 3.27% of loan portfolio, which was up from third quarter, and we felt it was prudent to increase the provision and boost that reserve. For 2009 we expect that full year write-offs and the provision will be consistent with 2008 levels. We expect the efforts that we've made and continue to make to improve the portfolio will partially offset continued pressure in this general credit environment. Also remember that we take back the points associated with defaulted loans and sell them at current prices, so the underlying asset is not lost to us.", "At year end we had 8 term securitizations with total outstanding of $1.3 billion, plus our old and new conduits, with combined debt outstanding of $558 million. These securitizations continue to perform within their expected tolerances.", "With regard to 2009 Vacation Ownership outlook, we expect gross VOI sales to be down 40%, tours down 40% to 50%, and volume per guest to increase 5% to 10%. This is down slightly from what we told you December due to increasing down payment requirements. GAAP revenues should be between $1.7 to $2 billion, down about $200 million from what we told you in December, again, reflecting higher provision for loan loss and somewhat lower volume per guest, as I just mentioned. And we expect adjusted EBITDA of $325 to $375 million. ", "On the corporate side, our teams continue to be focused on controlling G&A expenses across the board. These corporate associates, along with their colleagues in the operating businesses, have maintained an intense focus on cost and cash mobilization which enabled us to end the year with $291 million of capacity on our corporate revolver. Some of this favorability was due to timing differences in payments. We remain well within our debt covenants, which require a consolidated leverage ratio of less than 3.5 and an interest coverage ratio of more than 3, as defined in the debt agreements. At year end, the leverage ratio was 2.2 and our interest coverage ratio was just over 20 times.", "You'll notice as you analyze fourth quarter reported results that we have a small tax provision despite the pre-tax loss due to differences in the tax treatment for some of the special items in the quarter, the most significant being minimal or no tax benefit for the goodwill and other impairment charges and the currency conversion losses. ", "Our corporate guidance for 2009 includes revenue of $3.5 to $3.9 billion, corporate costs of $55 to $65 million, adjusted EBITDA of $760 to $810 million, depreciation and amortization of $185 to $195 million, net interest expense of $80 to $90 million, slightly lower than our original guidance based on lower benchmarks and updated projections of the timing of our spending. We expect a tax rate of approximately 39%, which brings us to an EPS range of $1.61 to $1.85\u00a0per share based on a share count of 179 million shares.", "And again, just to give you a sense of the foreign exchange impact, assuming constant currency at RCI versus 2008, that EPS range would have been $180 to $204.", "2009 guidance assumes a benefit from the roll in of deferred Vacation Ownership revenues of $175 to $200 million, and we expect to spend $130 to $150 million in CapEx, plus $175 to $225\u00a0million in timeshare development. We expect EPS of $0.35 to $0.40 in the first quarter assuming a $65 to $75\u00a0million benefit from the roll in of deferred revenue. Excluded from that guidance is between $30 and $45 million of restructuring costs, of which about $25 to $35\u00a0million is cash.", "And now I'll turn it back to Steve to wrap it up.", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks, Gina. ", "And we put a lot of numbers out there. Let me just hit a couple of them that I think we may have misspoke on. ", "The RevPAR for the fourth quarter on a constant currency basis was down 6.4%. It was actually 9.2%, including the currency impact.", "And our interest coverage ratio is about 2.1 times.", "Okay, before we open to some questions I'd like to close with a few other key points. First, considering the severity of the economic environment and its impact on our industry, I think Wyndham Worldwide's 2008 performance held up quite well. ", "Second, we have a flexible business model and a highly adaptable management team. You saw this in the significant actions we took last year to rebalance our business portfolio, reduce our reliance on the securitization market, and lower costs.", "Third, as we look at our economic environment that continues to weaken in 2009, our concentration in mid-scale and economy hotel brands position us well with both hotel owners and customers.", "And finally, given the steps we have taken and continue to take, we are positioned to generate significant long-term shareholder value.", "With that, I'll turn it over for some questions. Tanya?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Joseph Greff - J.P. Morgan.", "Joseph Greff - J.P. Morgan", "", "The 8-K filing after the earnings release this morning of the $200 million equity sales program, can you just talk a little bit - I guess potential use of proceeds and, I guess, the bigger question, like why now?", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks for the question, Joe, and I thought that might be the first question out of the block. ", "Why now is a great question. We would prefer not to issue equity at these prices, obviously. This is not what we think is a very good value on the stock right now; it should be quite a bit higher. Having said that, the markets are very unpredictable, as we all know, and we don't know what the movement will look like in the next quarter, in the next week, in the next month. And for us to not inform you that this was our intent and then just pop out with something later when we didn't have a chance to get on the phone and talk about it didn't seem to be very prudent.", "We think that, as you know, we are on negative outlook from the agencies. We're on the bottom of investment grade. We'd like to retain that liquidity if we can. We think there are going to be enormous opportunities in our industry during 2009, and we just frankly want to be positioned to take advantage of those opportunities. There's not a lot of offense going on right now within any business and we're not being offensive in our efforts, but we think there will be openings in 2009 to be a little bit more offensive and we want to be positioned to take advantage of that.", "So why now? Well, we just want to make sure that we're clear with what our intent is. We'd prefer not to do it now, but we also can't predict what the ABS markets, what the credit markets in general will look like in the coming weeks, months and the rest of the year.", "Joseph Greff - J.P. Morgan", "If we exclude the equity sales program, by the end of this year, where do you see gross debt, net debt being?", "Steve Holmes", "Well, we think our revolver will be about the same as it was at the end of 2007 and so it's roughly equivalent.", "Gina Wilson", "A lot of that has to do, Joe, with what actually happens with securitizations between now and the end of the year. Depending on which of the different models we look at, we could have less availability on the line by maybe $100 million. But again, it depends very much on how the ABS markets perform.", "Joseph Greff - J.P. Morgan", "And you'd mentioned that January volumes per guest were up 14% in VOI. Can you talk about that specifically? Is that geography? Is that a certain price point or product? Can you just give us, I guess, some amplification on that? That seems like a good way to start this year.", "Steve Holmes", "It is and we're pleased that the performance has been as good as it was at the sales offices.", "We don't report monthly VPG trending, Joe, as you know. We report it quarterly. The fact is that you can have swings in months depending on travel patterns, depending on where holidays fall. So it's a very encouraging sign. We're not suggesting that that's going to continue throughout the year. ", "But it goes to the fact, frankly, and the reason we brought it up on the call, that the timeshare business is not dead. The timeshare business is not on the canvas. People still want to buy timeshares. They're coming in. They're interested in the product. And the fact is our sales force does a phenomenonal job matching our product with the needs and the wants of the consumer. So we really just wanted to show that there's still a lot of strength in that market. ", "But it was broad, Joe. It was anywhere from Branson to Williamsburg to any of our locations.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steve Kent - Goldman Sachs.", "Steve Kent - Goldman Sachs ", "", "First, could you just talk about Venezuela? I didn't even know you really had operations there. I want to understand what was going on there.", "Also to Joe's question about the $200 million offering, yesterday Marriott talked about their securitization market and issues and at one point even Arne Sorenson said he might be willing to even sell these at a lower rate. Why not go there rather than hitting the equity market?", "Steve Holmes", "First, to the Venezuela question, Steve, and thanks for the question, we have been in the Venezuela market for as almost as long as we've owned RCI - or for as long as we've owned RCI\u00a0 and we used to have a relatively large processing operation in Venezuela. And so over the years we had accumulated cash in the market and we have been looking to find a way to redomicile the cash back to the rest of our international operations, you know, bring it into our system.", "Unfortunately, getting cash - and this isn't just unique to us; it's a matter of anybody who's doing business in Venezuela, I believe - getting cash out has a fairly high conversion cost, it has a fairly high tax, for lack of a better word, to repatriate the cash.", "We had not done it because we were hoping the situation would improve; however, when you look at the environment right now, liquidity is king. We said, you know what? If we want to access that cash and use it in operations, we're going to have to pay the tax it looks like. Things had not improved over the last couple of years and there's no line of vision that tells us it's going to improve, so we decided to go ahead and move the cash out and take the hit for it. But it's cash that had accumulated there over the years for quite awhile.", "With respect to the offering and Arne's comments on his call about the securitization market, we think that there will be some life to the securitization market. Similar to what I'm told Arne mentioned yesterday about being in the midst of discussions on transactions, likewise we are in the midst of discussions on transactions to do securitizations. However, we don't want to just bet on that happening, and we also don't yet know what those terms will be. I can tell you this much\u00a0 they're not going to be as good as they were in 2007 or the beginning of 2008.", "So, again, we're just being cautious. I think we're being prudent. We're trying to communicate completely as to what we're doing. We've said continually that we're going to run this business for the long term, and we want to position ourselves to grow the business. I think 2009, as I said before, will present itself with numerous opportunities for us. I don't want to be sitting here not able to take advantage of those opportunities. And that's simply the rationale for doing it.", "Steve Kent - Goldman Sachs ", "How should we handle the share count? I don't know if you mentioned, is it in your own EPS forecast?", "Steve Holmes", "No. Just like the buyback programs, we didn't build them into the forecasting. And it really will depend on timing and pricing at the time if and when we decide to pull the trigger. And we'll update people quarterly on what our activity has been, obviously. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from William Truelove - UBS.", "William Truelove - UBS", "", "Can you talk about the growth in the portfolio of your lodging properties from a domestic versus international perspective?", "Steve Holmes", "Sure. Well, as I think I said in the script, our international grew - I'm trying to remember what the number was that I just mentioned in the script - but both markets grew, the bottom line, both markets grew. International as a percentage increase grew more because it's off a lower base, obviously. I'm just looking to see if we have the breakdown in number of rooms for that. I'll come back to you with the answer on specifics, but both of the markets grew, international and domestic.", "William Truelove - UBS", "What's the environment like, though? I mean, given the deterioration in lodging globally, not just regionally, is the pace that you're seeing on the margin changing internationally versus domestically? I assume nobody wants to build a new hotel in the U.S. How about in Asia and whatnot?", "Steve Holmes", "Well, actually, Will, I'll take exception with that last comment. ", "It's not necessarily true that people don't want to build new hotels in the U.S. We every week are celebrating groundbreakings of new hotels that are being built in the U.S. Now, they're not 900-room hotels in major markets. It may be a 58-room hotel in Texas, Super 8 in Texas, but remember, our market is quite different. We deal with a lot of hotels that are smaller in size that still quality for SBA loans and that take advantage of local and regional lending capacity. So we do still see construction going on. As I said, every week we see new construction.", "I think that you'll see a slowdown in the end of 2009 and 2010 on the big projects if things don't get better, clearly. But we'll still continue to do conversions, which is a large portion of our growth, and we'll continue to see the new construction, I believe, on these smaller projects.", "Gina Wilson", "Our next question comes from Chris Woronka - Deutsche Bank.", "Chris Woronka - Deutsche Bank ", "", "So if you could just maybe talk a little bit about, if at all, how the consumer financing behavior has changed given your kind of resizing of the business. Are you seeing fewer folks finance with you because of the tighter terms or any kind of color on how you expect that to change?", "Steve Holmes", "Sure. Well, a couple of things. One is we are forcing some change by requiring more in the way of down payments so, as a percentage of a sale that is financed, you're going to see a lower percentage of that sale financed.", "With respect to what we've seen so far through the fourth quarter and into January, we haven't see a real difference in the percentage of people who finance with us, so we haven't seen a real significant change at all in the percentage of people who finance. However, you're going to see more cash coming in on the sales because we're requiring more down payment. That's really as much our doing, I think, as frankly people coming in and wanting to put down more. Obviously, our movement towards requiring more down payment's impacting that.", "And going back to, I think it was Will's point, on growth, I just had something handed to me. We are now at international room [count], about 19% of our total versus 17% a year ago. So obviously there's a shift more to the international market on a proportional basis. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Patrick Scholes - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey.", "Patrick Scholes - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "", "A question for you on the $112 million earned in the fourth quarter in consumer finance. What was your EBITDA number on consumer finance?", "Gina Wilson", "I think we've said in the past, Patrick, we don't take EBITDA all the way down to the consumer finance part of the business anymore than we do for the property management. And I think we've said in the past that you can think about the consumer finance being 20% to 30% of the profitability of that segment.", "Patrick Scholes - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "Additionally, I didn't see in the press release any section on cash flow from operation or free cash flow. What was cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter?", "Steve Holmes", "Cash flow from operations, well, we'll be filing the K shortly and you'll see all the details, and I think we'll ask you to wait to then to get the details.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Millman - Soleil-Millman Research Associates", "Michael Millman - Soleil-Millman Research Associates", "", "On the Hotel, can you explain what seems to be an anomaly, I think, fourth quarter RevPAR down some 9% or so and yet the EBITDA was up about, I think you said 10% or $10 million?", "And secondly on the Hotel, the national hotels, do they generate the same profitability, the same fees, as the domestic?", "Steve Holmes", "Hitting the last one on international operations, the dynamic in international operations is that RevPAR is generally a little bit higher than it is with our U.S. operations and royalty is generally a little bit lower, the percentage of royalty rate that we charge. So net-net, it works out to about the same per hotel that we bring on or per room that we bring on. So the dynamic is somewhat similar.", "In the past we've gone more for master licensing internationally, which had a lower production per room. We are moving more towards the direct franchising, the managed model, so we should be able to move that up internationally. But it's roughly the same.", "The first question on the Hotel, it really was a matter of two things, one, our cost containment efforts. And again, I applaud the management team for the steps they took to prepare. We went through this process really throughout 2008 of containing costs, hiring freezes and others to try to hold down our costs, and we also were cautious on our spend in marketing, so there may be some marketing timing spend that goes into that, but that's just an element of cost containment.", "Michael Millman - Soleil-Millman Research Associates", "On the timeshare, I guess two questions. One is can you give us some idea of what the recurring revenue and earnings are from timeshare?", "And secondly, yesterday Marriott said that they were bringing down their percentage to 50% of consumer financing. Can you talk about why you're not trying to do some of those same things?", "Steve Holmes", "Well, taking the last on first, on consumer finance, we probably will see, as I said, we will see a decline. We haven't declared a target of what we're trying to get to right now because we're going through a pretty dramatic shift to drive down our, you know, the amount of cash that we bring in. Right now we're probably - we were about 65% last year. We're probably closer to 60% now. Are we going to get down to 50%? I don't want to handicap whether or not that's a target for us, but clearly we've put a higher focus on getting more cash upfront.", "As for the question about the recurring revenues, we have a series of recurring revenue streams, one being the management fees that we receive in, another one being the interest that we receive on our consumer portfolio. So those pieces together, I can come back to you with detail on.", "Gina Wilson", "A couple hundred million dollars.", "Steve Holmes", "Yes, it's a couple hundred million. But we'll get back to you with more specifics.", "Michael Millman - Soleil-Millman Research Associates", "How's that couple hundred million translate to the bottom line?", "Steve Holmes", "Well, the management fee does not contribute a huge amount to our bottom line. The consumer finance income, it's a question of really what our spread is. As we answered the question before, I think that Patrick asked, we don't break down the consumer finance or the property management pieces separately, but in total it's probably, between the two of them, about $800\u00a0million - rather than a couple hundred million dollars - probably $800 million in total, probably $400 million on each. ", "So we could apply - you can assume various costs associated with consumer finance based on where interest rates are at the time, but hopefully that gets you kind of where you're asking.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Leon Cooperman - Omega Advisors.", "Leon Cooperman - Omega Advisors", "", "I've got to be very calm and I've got to be very careful because I happen to like you guys. You're very available and you do a good job of investor communications.", "I think this potential equity offering is about as dumb as anything I've ever seen. I'm sitting in Boca Raton, quasi-vacation, but I think in 2006, 2007 and for part of 2008, we spent over $800\u00a0million buying back stock starting, I think, the price was around $30. And we thought it was an attractive decision for the shareholders because we thought the business value was in excess of $30, I would guess, right? That's why we bought it at $30.", "And here we're sitting here, giving earnings guidance - I missed part of the call, I apologize, but basically I think that we said something about guidance around $1.60 or something like that. And so we have a stock that's sub $6 and you take off an underwriting discount, so we're prepared to sell stock at 15% of what we bought it back at 3.5 or 4 times earnings? It's ridiculous.", "So my recommendation is, since you have a collection of fine assets that you're very positive on and there are other people in this business, that we should investigate the sale of the company because we will get a much higher price for the shareholders, create much more value for the shareholders, than engaging in equity issuance. And if it's not feasible in this environment to sell the company to a stronger financial partner, then we should basically sell off assets at 60% or 70% of what they're worth to basically get ourselves in a financial position where we don't have to sell equity at 20% of what it's worth.", "So I would really implore you to reconsider what you're saying here because you're portraying yourself as a distressed credit, and I don't think we're a distressed credit. Who goes out in a good business and sells stock at 3.5 times earnings or 4 times earnings?", "So I'm at a loss to understand what you're doing here. ", "Steve Holmes", "All right. Well, you know, Lee, we always enjoy the dialogue and obviously we enjoy your point of view as well.", "The fact is that we are not a distressed credit. We're sitting here with an investment grade rating. We feel that we've got strong business models. However, we know that the strength to take advantage of opportunity in 2009 will be driven by liquidity and access to capital, and we do not feel sitting here right now that we can predict well enough where the credit markets will be or what our access to credit markets will be to assume that we'll be able to get adequate access if we wanted to take advantage of opportunities. ", "So, again, we're doing this. As I said - you probably missed the beginning - I would prefer not to do this. I would prefer not to issue equity at these prices. I totally agree with you that it's a ridiculously cheap price that we're looking at right now, but I also have to balance where we stand with our ratings and where we see ourselves in 2009 with our potential for liquidity.", "We've said a number of times that we're basically cash flow neutral for 2009 as we ramp down the timeshare business and then we become more cash flow generative in 2010. But I think 2009 will be a year that presents a lot of opportunities. ", "Leon Cooperman - Omega Advisors", "Sorry to interrupt you, but you cannot earn the return relative to the cost of capital that you're accepting by selling stock at 3 times earnings. It just doesn't work. So [break in audio] ", "Steve Holmes", "Did you finish that question, Lee? Lee? Okay. ", "Operator", "One moment, please. ", "Steve Holmes", "Okay. Well, I think the gist of Lee's question, it's a question of - are you there, Lee?", "Operator", "Mr. Cooperman?", "Leon Cooperman - Omega Advisors", "Yes. Can you hear me?", "Steve Holmes", "Sorry, Lee. You got cut off there.", "Leon Cooperman - Omega Advisors", "Steve, can you hear me?", "Steve Holmes", "Yes, I can hear you now.", "Leon Cooperman - Omega Advisors", "We'll do this offline, but in all honesty, it's not mathematically plausible that you could sell stock at 25% cost of capital or thereabouts and make a good rate of return on the money, okay? A better alternative, it seems to me, would be to consider a more dramatic cutback in capital expansion in this difficult environment, selling off assets for 80% of what they're worth as opposed to selling equity for a quarter of what it's worth.", "The question you have to ask yourself is, did the business value decline as much as the stock prices declined? Because at the end of the day you don't want to look a year from now, having bought stock back at $30 and issued stock at $5 or $6 and then see business stabilize and improve in 2010. I mean, it's ridiculous. I would actually investigate the sale of the entire company as an alternative to selling $200 million worth of stock at ridiculous prices. ", "But I don't want to monopolize the call. That's just a view. I'll take this up with you offline.", "Steve Holmes", "All right. Well, I appreciate your point of view, Lee.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from [Matt Mickel - Eva Evans Investors].", "Matt Mickel - Eva Evans Investors", "", "I just had a question regarding how to think about cash flow going forward, particularly working capital. In the past, obviously, that's been a big use of cash as you guys have developed your timeshare revenue. If you start scaling back the development, how can we start looking at working capital? Would that potentially be a source of cash going forward, maybe, in 2010?", "Steve Holmes", "Exactly. In 2010 and beyond, as we ramp down the investment in some of our timeshare development, we will start to generate more cash flow. And it's just 2009 is kind of a crossover period, and 2010 and beyond is where you'll start seeing some more cash flow generation.", "So I guess that was our last question. I guess we've run out of time here. Tanya, thank you very much for hosting the call, and thank you all for joining us. We look forward to these calls and we look forward to all your feedback and we'll speak to you next quarter.

Thank you, you may begin.", "Margo Happer", "Thank you. Good morning, thank you for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO and Gina Wilson, our CFO. Before we get started I want to remind that our remarks today contain forward-looking information that is subject to a number of risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied.", "These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K filed February 29, 2009 with the SEC. We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these measures to comparable GAAP measures is provided in the tables to the press release and is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.wyndhamworldwide.com. Steve?", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks, Margo. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Despite some strong economic head winds, Wyndham Worldwide delivered solid first quarter results. Adjusted EPS was up 17% year-over-year. As expected, revenues were down in each of our three business segments including the decline in vacation ownership revenues related to our decision to reduce that business.", "All three businesses delivered adjusted EBITDA in line with or exceeding our expectations. First quarter 2009 net cash from operating activities was approximately $210 million, compared with $87 million in the first quarter of 2008. The remaining borrower capacity on our revolving credit facility increased to approximately $355 million, compared with approximately $290 million as of December 31, 2008.", "2009 cash flow is currently tracking to our expectations and as we said in December, we expect significantly more cash flow in 2010, around $500 million, or approximately 250 million if you assume that the settlement of the legacy contingent liabilities materialized next year.", "Wyndham's first quarter results reflect the strength, flexibility, and diversity of our business model. Our ability to execute even in the face of global economic turmoil and our continued discipline on managing expenses, our hotel brands are primarily in the economy and midscale segments, which hold up better when consumers are under pressure, and make development costs more manageable for owners.", "Our vacation exchange and rentals business, group RCI, has been growing its membership while also reducing costs in part by driving customers to transact on the web, with continued innovations in our industry leading web platforms. In our timeshare sales machine, our points-based product gives customers more flexibility to purchase what they can afford and more flexibility of usage than week-based products. While still giving them the variety of are great vacation destinations around the world.", "With the economy under significant pressure, the advantages of our business model are even more evident in our results. While the economic outlook is still unpredictable, based on where we are year-to-date, and our outlook, we are reaffirming our 2009 guidance. Over the next several quarters, you should expect us to continue to deliver results that demonstrate the advantages of Wyndham Worldwide's business model, and our ability to execute our strategy.", "Now, I will turn to the performance of the business units beginning with the hotel group. The hotel group with its predictable and resilient Fee-for-Service business model delivered EBITDA in line with our plans. First quarter revenues were down 9% and adjusted EBITDA was down 17%, primarily due to lower franchise fees driven by RevPAR declines.", "Worldwide RevPAR was down 11% in constant currency mainly due to global demand weakness. Including the unfavorable impact of the strengthening US dollar, the global RevPAR decline was 14%. Domestic RevPAR decreased 13% from a year ago, while international RevPAR declined 18% or 6% in constant currency.", "Clearly, the industry and the credit markets remained under pressure. We continued to work to mitigate these economic headwinds with revenue generating activities and other initiatives for our franchisees. We deployed a wide range of marketing programs to generate awareness and stimulate interest in booking our franchise and managed properties, including increasing our online advertising spend by 80%.", "As a result we have increased our reservation contribution from branded websites and Internet traffic by approximately 4%. Each of our brands is running campaigns to promote the value price proposition, which is very real and attractive for our brands in this economy.", "Wyndham Rewards is running promotions and helping royalty program members manage tough economic times by giving them a chance to earn rewards, such as free night stays, gift cards, airline tickets, or resort vacations more quickly. We have also integrated the Microtel Inns & Suites brand into our Wyndham Rewards program, adding more hotels to the 6,000 plus properties where members can earn and redeem points around the globe.", "We're offering third party leasing options for property management system upgrades and better purchasing power for third party vendors to help drive savings to our franchisees. On the development front, in the first quarter, we opened almost 9,000 rooms, approximately 1,800 of which were new construction and the remainder were converted from other hotel chains or independent hotels.", "With respect to new construction deals, although the banks are requiring higher equity contributions, we continue to get deals done, largely because our hotels require a much smaller investment than large urban full-service projects. For example, our Microtel brand which has been the highest rated economy brand for JD Power Customer Satisfaction Survey for seven straight years, opened 500 new construction rooms this quarter, with an initial investment cost of only $4 million to $7 million in great brand equity, Microtel is an attractive option for a developer.", "Nonetheless new construction openings still only account for about 20% of our total gross openings in any given year. So we will stay focused on hotel conversions. And we are confident that our brands can attract hotel owners especially in these tough economic times as we offer great value through high brand awareness, strong reservation contribution and a robust loyalty program.", "We are seeing a larger proportion of our conversions coming from independents, which is no surprise, considering the Smith Travel Research is reporting a 20% RevPAR decline for independent hotels, with more than half coming from occupancy weakness. In this environment, a hotel with access to broad-reaching reservation channels and marketing programs is especially important to mitigate demand weakness.", "Overall system size is 588,000 rooms, with an international portfolio of 123,000 rooms. Additionally, our pipeline is almost 109,000 rooms, with over half the pipeline in new construction products.", "Before I move on to vacation exchange and rental business, I would like to take a moment to highlight some of our hotel group's accomplishments. Our namesake Wyndham hotels and resort brand was recognized by Business Travel News as the leading chain in its annual US hotel chain survey, moving to the top of the list of corporate travel buyers highest rated brand in the upscale/select service sector.", "On April 22, we opened the Wyndham Xiamen hotel in China, with 588 rooms, it is our first Wyndham brand hotel and our first managed asset in Asia. Nine of our hotel brands made Entrepreneurs 2009 Franchise 500 list. A ranking based on objective and quantifiable factors, including a franchisees financial strength, growth rate and system size. Some great accomplishments for our hotel group.", "Now, turning to vacation exchange and rentals, RCI is celebrating its 35th anniversary as the global leader in timeshare exchange, and continues to innovate on the technology and marketing front. Given a significantly weakened Euro and British pound compared to the prior year, group RCI's revenues were down 16% on a reported basis. However, revenues were only down 5% in constant currency, but continued strong cost reduction efforts and operating efficiencies offset almost the entire decline in revenues, resulting in nearly flat adjusted EBITDA in constant dollars.", "In the vacation exchange business, first quarter revenue was down 7% on a reported basis and relatively flat on a constant currency basis. The addition of the Disney Vacation Club drove our member growth by adding more than 135,000 member families. In addition to this great new membership base, RCI also expanded its global exchange network by adding all of Disney's eight existing eight vacation club resort destinations.", "Growth in average exchange members was offset by a reduction in annual dues and exchange revenue per member. The reduction in revenue per member reflects lower exchange transactions primarily resulting from increased growth in clubs, where members of the option to exchange within the club network.", "In early April, I attended the Arctic conference, the industry's largest annual timeshare convention, where RCI won the employer of the year award from the vacation ownership industry. The tone of the convention overall was very positive. While certainly acknowledging the current tough credit environment, our timeshare developer partners have responded quickly adjusting marketing plans and right-sizing operations.", "While at ARTA, RCI launched the industry's first ever online television programming on rci.com dubbed, RCI TV. The goal of this initiative is to improve member satisfaction, increase occupancy, and provide new marketing leads for our affiliated developers to drive timeshare sales. It is already received overwhelmingly positive response from our member base.", "RCI TV provides our timeshare developer affiliates with the opportunity to showcase their properties through high definition video segments and travel features, giving them a significant marketing presence. In addition to the new web TV programming, RCI continues to introduce initiatives to improve member experience and reduce costs by moving more transaction processing to the web. Specifically, leveraging the new enhanced search technology developed over the last several years and introduced in the end of 2008.", "To encourage members to transact on the web, we implemented higher pricing for call center transactions, while holding web prices constant. Along with simplified web registration and log-on, these efforts continue to enhance and improve the web experience for our members. The results are compelling.", "Web exchange transactions in North America increased from 16% of total transactions last year, to 24% in the first quarter of 2009. This movement of transactions to the web resulted in reduced call center costs of approximately $2 million compared to the first quarter of last year. We believe the impact of our web enhancements will stimulate member activation and increased satisfaction.", "Looking forward, recent research done by RCI, shows encouraging signs in North American exchange. Over 90% of RCI members surveyed planned to travel in 2009 or 2010 and only 2% said the economy might cause them to eliminate their vacation.", "Member growth is in line with our expectations. Developers have been affected by the credit environment, but have quickly adjusted their sales and marketing operations in response. In group RCI's rental business, first quarter revenues were down 19% on a reported basis, or only 3% on a constant currency basis.", "Transaction volumes were flat, which was especially impressive since last year's first quarter benefited from the Easter holiday. Volumes increased at English Country Cottages and Landal GreenParks, but were soft at Novasol and RCI international member rentals.", "In constant currency, average price was down 3% in the first quarter of 2009, reflecting a change in mix, as well as the shift of Easter into the second quarter, compared with some of the premium pricing we saw last year. Of particular note in the first quarter, our English Country Cottages posted solid revenue growth driven by very successful marketing and promotional offers and increased functionality of their new web platform.", "The improved web focus resulted in 73% of rentals being booked online during the quarter, up from 58% last year. In addition, the business benefited from the significant weakening of the pound versus the euro, which led UK customers to plan vacation closer to home versus traveling to Continental Europe.", "Looking forward, we have ample inventory for the summer season and are focusing our second quarter marketing across all of our businesses, on the advantages of our reasonably priced vacation options, as we continue our drive to the web to reduce costs, increase efficiencies, and improve customer experience.", "Let's now turn to our vacation ownership business. The restructuring we began in the fourth quarter of 2008 is now complete. Our year-over-year reductions in tour flow and DOI revenue during the first quarter were fully in line with our expectations, and have us tracking on target for our full-year projections.", "Tour flow is in line with our adjusted marketing plan. Volume per guest was up 12% year-over-year, with steady pricing and strong close rates. The overarching goals of the reduction program was to scale back the size of this business to improve overall cash flow and credit quality of our new sales.", "First quarter results affirmed that we made the right decision. We acted quickly, and are on plan. This is a remarkable achievement and we are very proud of everyone down at the WVO group, who contributed to its success. We continue to see no softening in consumer interests for our timeshare product. Our close rates and transaction sizes remain strong.", "Our sales reductions reflect a deliberate decision to shrink the business. We believe that demand for our timeshare product remains healthy because our points-based product offers fundamental advantages relative to fixed week products.", "Fixed week means fixed prices and very little latitude for consumers to purchase the product that fit their pocketbook. With the points-based product sold in varying increments, our perspective customers can calibrate their level of purchase. Equally important, is that points-based timeshare is all about flexibility of use. Unlike fixed-week timeshare that generally must be used once a year in a full week increment, points allow families to plan multiple shorter trips, often to locations closer to home.", "Consumer travel trends have been moving in this direction for the last decade and we expect this trend to continue through the next decade. With many drive-to locations in and around major metropolitan and urban areas, our points-based resort system is more frequently sought after, as families increasingly opt for weekend in the country, or a few nights in the city.", "The proof of the value proposition can be seen in our owner's behavior. With business and leisure travel worldwide remaining challenge, occupancy at our timeshare resorts in the first quarter was up nearly 2% year-over-year, despite the addition of nearly 1300 units from the same period last year, a true statement of the value of the timeshare product to the consumer.", "In addition to the benefits of the superior product structure, our results have also been bolstered by our restructuring of this business. As I mentioned earlier, we closed several low-performing sales centers and we focused our efforts in resources on our most profitable operation. At the same time, we raised our tour qualifications across the board effectively eliminating our lowest-performing tour types from the mix.", "Our marketing dollars and our top sales talent are directed at consumers with both a higher propensity to buy our product and demonstrated ability to pay for. The net effect is a more efficient and profitable operation.", "Finally, executing on our plan to generate additional cash flow within our vacation ownership business, during the first quarter we successfully increased our average down payment to 23%, up from 12% a year ago. Cash generated at the time of sale, is up over 30% within our Wyndham Vacation Resorts business, and over 55% in WorldMark by Wyndham, which just implemented those changes in March.", "Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter results from our vacation ownership business, and look forward to continued good performance from this business through the balance of the year.", "Now, let me turn the call over to our CFO, Gina Wilson.", "Gina Wilson", "Thanks, Steve. You saw from the release today, we ended the quarter ahead of our expectations, primarily due to stronger North American exchange activities and strength in vacation ownership sales and efficiencies.", "Reported results included $27 million after-tax in restructuring costs across the three businesses. We are substantially finished with restructurings we started in the third quarter of last year, with the exception of certain group RCI international-related activities that were delayed due to local legal considerations. There, we expect further charges of another few million dollars in the second quarter.", "Revenues benefited from a roll-in of deferred revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting of $67 million during the first quarter of 2009, while first quarter 2008 reported revenues were reduced by $82 million of deferred revenue.", "The net year-over-year impact was about $70 million in EBITDA. Percentage of completion revenue has been coming in as expected, based on our construction plans for 2009. In the first quarter of 2010, we expect little if any impact from deferred revenue, which will be important for you to remember as you model.", "Now, let me walk you through our first quarter results in a little more detail and give you a look into what we're seeing so far this year. Now, as Steve mentioned the hotel group delivered revenues and adjusted EBITDA in line with our expectations. Reported results include $3 million of restructuring charges, margins were down from last year, and recent quarters, reflecting the impact of lower franchise fees, primarily driven by lower RevPAR.", "RevPAR was generally in line with what we expected, but this is obviously under some pressure and we're watching it very closely. For now, we're maintaining our 2009 RevPAR guidance, but at this point expect that we would come in near the low end of that range. Room growth is off to a slower start than we expected, primarily due to opening delays. However, we are comfortable that we will achieve the guidance of 3% to 6% room growth this year.", "As Steve mentioned, the price line has held up well with almost 109,000 rooms, 54% of that pipeline is new construction. And the Wyndham brand makes up over 17% of our total pipeline with almost 70% being new construction deals, and of those 60% are scheduled to open in the next 12 months with secured financing.", "Almost 40% of our pipeline is international, representing 50 countries on six continents. We're excited about the depth and breadth of the pipeline, which will continue to support our strategy of international expansion, as well as solidifying our leading position domestically.", "Now turning to vacation exchange and rentals, excluding the net impact of foreign currency, group RCI revenues for the quarter was down 5%, with adjusted EBITDA relatively flat compared with the first quarter of 2008. The strengthening of the US dollar in Q1 2009 reduced revenues by about $37 million and EBITDA by $12 million. Also affecting reported results were $4 million in restructuring costs.", "Adjusted margins improved 60 basis points reflecting continued cost control. As you saw from the press release, other ancillary revenues were $30 million, a 32% decrease compared with the first quarter of 2008. In constant currency, other ancillary revenues decreased $11 million, due to the lower miscellaneous fees and our termination of a low margin travel service contract.", "Now, let's turn to vacation ownership. The team has delivered flawless execution on the realignment plan, and the business is tracking to our expectations. These changes are creating operational strength, which will service us well for the long-term and there have also been some short-term benefits.", "For example, BPG as Steve mentioned was up 12% in the quarter and we expect that to moderate to our guidance range of 5% to 10% for the year. We are finishing our construction pipe projects, spending between $175 million to $225 million this year, and less than $100 million next year, which combined with our completed inventory willing give us enough products to meet our reduced sales expectations as we look out into 2009 and 2010.", "On the consumer financing front, the provision for loan loss is $107 million for the quarter, consistent with the fourth quarter when compared to gross sales less the impact of deferred revenues. Write-offs in the first quarter were at 3.38% of the loan portfolio, also relatively consistent with the fourth quarter. And the securitizations continued to perform within their expected tolerances.", "We are starting to see some good trends in the portfolio as delinquency rates in the past couple of months have improved, but we will continue to watch that closely. Remember that part of the realignment focuses on tightening credit standards and improving the overall portfolio. We financed 59% of VOI sales in the first quarter this year, compared with 65% in the first quarter of last year. Additionally, the weighted average FICO of our 2009 first quarter new borrowers was 717, compared with 696 in the first quarter of last year.", "We closed the $46 million term securitization in March. This was not a plain vanilla securitization and that the collateral for the transaction consisted primarily of large balance, longer-term receivables, that were ineligible for the conduit. The transaction although small was a great execution in a very difficult environment, and we're pleased with the results.", "Our financing pipeline includes two term financings, totaling between $100 million and $150 million, while receivables in our conduit that we believe will be closed within the next few months. We are also working on an additional securitization that review the pool of previously unsecuritized receivables as collateral, it could also close as early as this quarter or early next quarter.", "On the corporate side, as you saw from the press release, we generated net cash from operating activities approximately $210 million in the first quarter of 2009, compared with approximately $85 million during the prior year period. We had approximately $355 million of capacity on the corporate revolver at the end of the first quarter 2009, compared with approximately $290 million as of 12/31/2008.", "This reflects management's commitment to generating cash flow and increasing our revolver capacity. We're especially pleased with these results considering that we also incurred over $20 million in cash charges related to the restructurings during the quarter.", "We remain well within our debt covenants, which require a consolidated leverage ratio of less than 3.5, and an interest coverage ratio of more than three, as defined in the debt agreement. At the end of Q1, our consolidated leverage ratio was 1.9, and our interest coverage ratio was 27.1, so we have plenty of room on both covenants.", "We're in the process of renewing a small vacation ownership bank borrowing line which is a 364-day secured revolving facility, associated with our South Pacific Vacation Ownership business. There were approximately $156 million of borrowings on this facility at the end of the first quarter of 2009. It expires at the end of June, and as with the conduit last year, we expect to renew the facility and expect the renewal process will take the full amount of allotted time. We will update you if there is any material development but otherwise you should expect to hear details from us in late June, early July.", "We're tracking to expectations through April, and as you saw from the press release, we are reaffirming our full-year guidance. You will notice some variability in the quarterly tax rate. Specifically, in the second quarter, we expect the tax rate to be 44%, this reflects a true-up of the deferred tax asset related to non-cash compensation, or our restricted stock units.", "Overall for the full year, we expect the tax rate to be consistent with our guidance. As I said earlier, we expect a few more millions of dollars in restructuring-related charges in the second quarter. In the near-term, we expect EPS of $0.36 to $0.41 in the second quarter, assuming a $40 million to $50 million benefit from the roll-in of percent of completion deferred revenue in vacation ownership. Excluded from the guidance is the $1 million to $4 million or so of restructuring costs.", "Now I will turn it back to Steve to wrap it up.", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks, Gina. Before we open the line for questions I would like to make a few closing comments. Over the course of 2008, we took significant action to position Wyndham Worldwide to withstand the difficult economic environment and benefits from an eventual recovery.", "These actions which included rebalancing our portfolio of businesses, cutting expenses, and reducing our reliance on the securitization market, were difficult and had the potential to be very disruptive to our business people and our businesses. Our first quarter 2009 results reflect our ability to adapt and act quickly and I'm particularly proud of how our people maintain their focus and continue to execute and deliver.", "For the second year in a row, Wyndham Worldwide was listed as one of fortune magazine's most admired companies for 2009. We ranked second out of only four companies that made the most admired list in the hotels, casinos and resorts category. Wyndham Worldwide was also named to the DiversityInc's list of 25 noteworthy companies.", "For a 3-year-old company to be recognized among highly reputable companies by Fortune and DiversityInc, is a great honor for us, and a tribute to the dedication of our associates across the globe, to deliver on our commitment to our shareholders, customers, and business partners.", "Carol, with that, we will open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Joe Greff. Your line is open and please state your company name.", "Joe Greff - JPMorgan", "This is Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Good morning. Steve, my first question is, I guess, kind of relates to the big topics from the last earnings call, and are you re-thinking potential equity rates here? Obviously we've seen a lot of companies with success in doing that recently. What are your thoughts on that?", "Steve Holmes", "Well, we obviously, we went through the plan that we announced the intent to do last quarter, and we did that in response to a lot of conversations we had with our shareholders and the feedback that we got, and also the reaction of our stock obviously. We are not sitting here with a plan to issue equity now, that is not our intent and we feel very comfortable with our liquidity position.", "Operator", "Our next question or comment comes from Steve Kent. Your line is open, and please state your company name.", "Steve Kent - Goldman Sachs", "Yes, Steve Kent, Goldman Sachs. Just I'm sorry, I got cut off at one point, and I wanted to know just on the restructuring that you mentioned in the press release. How much of it was cash or noncash and then can you also talk about the timeshare business, what's you're seeing? I think Gina, you said that so far in April, not much of a change, but can you talk about upgrades, fees, et cetera, which was a pretty big driver this first quarter. What your expectations are for the balance of the year on those items?", "Steve Holmes", "Well, for the first quarter, I assume you don't want us to completely re-read the script, Steve. So, we will just cut to the chase on the cash from the restructuring. The first quarter the restructuring cost was about $20 million cash, the rest of it was non-cash. For the other questions, Gina?", "Gina Wilson", "We continue to believe that we're going to have good strength in upgrade sales for the remainder of the year. I think part of your question were 43% of the sales were new customers, so we're feeling good about that as well. I think one of the things Steve mentioned is, by virtue of taking some of the marketing programs out, and sort of refinding, which offices we keep open, we have some very talented sales people, and we have very good tour flow quality. So, we're feeling very good about their ability to deliver the remainder of the year.", "Steve Kent - Goldman Sachs", "Then just because Marriott had this issue, did any of your securitizations hit a trigger this quarter that?", "Gina Wilson", "No.", "Steve Kent - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. That was it. I'm sorry, maybe other people got cut off, too. I know our whole line went dead for a little while.", "Steve Holmes", "Okay. Well, the next question can tell us whether or not that happened. Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Our next question or comment comes from Will Truelove. Your line is open and please state your company name.", "Will Truelove - UBS", "Yes, UBS. No, problems here, guys. Can you give us some expectations about deferred revenue recognition or deferral for the remaining quarters? Since you gave first quarter 2010 expectations, I hope you can give second quarter through fourth quarter.", "Gina Wilson", "I think in my prepared remarks we actually said 40 to 50 in the second quarter.", "Will Truelove - UBS", "Okay.", "Gina Wilson", "For the full year, we're still expecting 150 to 200 or so.", "Will Truelove - UBS", "Total recognition, 140 to 200?", "Gina Wilson", "150 to 200.", "Operator", "Our next question or comment comes from Chris Woronka. Your line is open and please state your company name.", "Chris Woronka - Deutsche Bank", "Yes, Deutsche Bank. Steve, I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about, I noticed some of the changes in the average down payments and the percentage that are financing, what are some of the things you guys are doing to kind of drive that, and is it a conscious decision on your part, or is it something else that the customers are doing?", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks for the question, Chris. It is actually a conscious decision on our part. We had said before that we would be taking steps to increase the cash flow from that business, and one of the things we can do is get more cash upfront. So, we shifted our down payment requirements from the customers, and it varied by the brand, between WbW, and WVR. Well, we essentially increased from what was about 10% to 15% to more like 20% to 25% and that resulted obviously in more cash down.", "The number of cash sales did not really change as a percent dramatically, I don't think it changed at all, but it was really more in the down payment requirement that we were pushing and we did that while we were shrinking the business, and it is another burden for our sales force to bear, but they did a terrific job and they delivered on our expectations, as Gina mentioned during that time we also increased our FICO scores. So, really it was a terrific execution down with the timeshare group.", "Chris Woronka - Deutsche Bank", "Right and just in terms of the percentage that were financed, I think it was 59% versus 65. Is there a target kind of going forward? I mean at one point do you not want to go below a certain percentage because then you are not getting some of that finance income?", "Steve Holmes", "Well, in this environment, if everybody wanted to pay cash, we wouldn't turn them away and frankly, all of our financing, as you know, is very simplistic, fixed rate financing. There are no prepayment penalties. So, people can pay cash whenever they want to. I think realistically we will continue to work to get it to be a larger percentage of cash pay, particularly in this environment, and our spread on our receivables is not nearly what it used to be. So, cash being king right now, we would be happy to go to 100% cash.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from Michael Millman. Your line is open and please state your company name.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "I'm Michael Millman from Millman Research Associates. Could you break down free cash flow by segment possibly this year, and last year, and also for each segment, give us the percentage of variable costs?", "Steve Holmes", "Okay. Well, Mike, what we have done historically, and I don't think I'm going to take the time on this call to go through detail each of our business unit by business unit, but in general we've always given EBITDA for the business unit, and what we've said is that EBITDA less CapEx is pretty reflective of cash flow for that business unit, and that is still holding true.", "The only business unit that gets really affected Mike, more beyond that is the amount of financing that we do within WVO, but to give you a comparative, to last year, WVO is kind of flat to last year, in cash flow. For the full year 2009, WVO will be pretty much near zero cash flow, we pretty flat on cash flow, and the other businesses are obviously producing cash flow with their fee-for-service business model.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "Okay.", "Steve Holmes", "Did that answer the question, Mike? I know you're looking by business unit, and we can break it out, when you look at the Q, but I don't have it sitting right here in front of me right now.", "", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "Could you give us some rough approximation of variable cost for the units or?", "Steve Holmes", "Well, I guess the way I look at it, I will try to walk it through for you if you can like. In hotel, we run a very lean machine in our franchising business. So, as we add revenues to that business, from royalty fees, we drop a very high percent to the bottom line. So, it's largely fixed cost base, and very little variable cost, which is why in the first quarter, you see our revenues were down, our EBITDA was down more towards the other way, as those high margin revenues disappear.", "So, that's the way I kind of describe it, look at the hotel business, the group RCI there is more of a variable cost component, because we pay commissions for the rental of product. So, that's completely variable, and much of our costs on the exchange side, is related to the volume of business that we do. So, there are more variable costs. So, I don't have the percentage of variable versus fixed costs, but that's basically how I'd look at it.", "With WVO, a lot of it is variable. Obviously, we have shown that by the shrinking of the business, and what we've produced. When we look at WVO, 25% of the earnings go to just pay for the product, which is completely variable. We don't sell the product. We don't take it off the shelf. We don't take it out of inventory.", "About 50% is sales and marketing, which again is largely variable, but there is a fixed component in there of fixed sales and marketing overhead. So the bottom line, I would say, the way I would look at it is probably 75% roughly of our costs associated with WVO is variable and the remainder would be fixed.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our next question or comment comes from Justin Clifford. Your line is open and please state your company name.", "Justin Clifford - Omega Advisors", "Omega Advisors. Congratulations, on a very good quarter. I might have missed the answer to this question, because I had to take another call for a second. In the first quarter here, you're saying you recognized $67 million of vacation ownership revenues that were previously deferred. As a benefit this quarter was a negative -- the first quarter last year of $82 million.", "Actually, this is just nitpicking, but at one point, it says $67 million and another part of the press release says $70 million. I'm not sure that matters. But I'm wondering if you have any guidance as to how much in terms of deferred revenue you expect to be recognizing in that segment over the balance of the year, or what a good number would be for all of 2009?", "Steve Holmes", "We did, Justin, two things, we did go through that, but will be happy to repeat it. Just for the record, I want to make sure you know that interference on your phone line, you can tell (Lee) that was not intentional, but I will let Gina answer the detailed accounting question.", "Justin Clifford - Omega Advisors", "Steve that was somebody else calling me. It wasn't your guys fault.", "Gina Wilson", "The $67 million is the amount of revenue that was previously deferred that we recognized in the first quarter. You are correct, I did mention $70 million number, that's the EBITDA impact year-over-year when you take those deferred revenues and calculate the impact on the bottom line.", "Justin Clifford - Omega Advisors", "Okay.", "Gina Wilson", "Then I think I said a little bit earlier that we expect between $150 million and $250 million or $200 million in rolling of deferred revenue during 2009.", "Operator", "Our next question or comment comes from [John Singer]. Your line is open, and please state your company name.", "John Singer - Morgan Stanley", "It's Morgan Stanley. I was wondering, can you give us an apples-to-apples comparison of what the RCI would have looked like without Disney?", "Steve Holmes", "Well, I can give you the drivers pretty simply, because we brought in 135,000 members into our system from Disney. So if you take them out, we're relatively flat with our member base. From an earnings perspective, Disney did not add any significant incremental earnings, and in fact, we're spending quite a bit of money right now making sure that they're fully integrated into our system and that we have a seamless operation with them, so we're dedicating some additional resources to that, that new relationship that we just brought in.", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, I am currently showing no further questions. I would like to turn it back over to Steve Holmes for closing comments.", "Steve Holmes", "Well, thanks very much, Carolyn. Thank you all for joining the call this morning. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you. That concludes today's conference call.

Morgan", "Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs", "Patrick Scholes - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "Ryan Meliker - Morgan Stanley", "Operator", "", "Thank you for standing by. I'd like to welcome all parties to the Wyndham Worldwide conference call. (Operator Instructions)", "I would now like to turn the meeting over to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.", "Margo Happer", "Thank you, Caroline. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO, and Tom Conforti, our new CFO. ", "Before I get started I want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking information that is subject to a number of risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-Q filed August 7, 2009 with the SEC. ", "We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of these measures to the comparable GAAP measure is provided in the tables to the press release and is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at WyndhamWorldwide.com. ", "Steve?", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks, Margo. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. ", "I'm very pleased to introduce Tom Conforti, our new CFO, on this call. Tom brings a strong set of finance, strategic and general management skills to Wyndham Worldwide from world class companies like PepsiCo and Disney. These skills and his experience at successfully transforming the IHOP restaurant business to a free cash flow business model will be a great complement to our leadership team as we seek to maximize cash flow from the current operations and rebalance our business portfolio.", "We continue to execute against our strategic initiatives in the third quarter, delivering adjusted EPS of $0.58 compared with guidance of $0.53 to $0.57. ", "Revenues were down 17% from the third quarter of 2008, primarily reflecting our plan to reduce the deployment of capital in our vacation ownership business and the recession's impact on RevPAR in our lodging business.", "Year-to-date cash from operating activities, a measure of increasing importance to us, was approximately $570 million compared with $146 million in 2008. ", "In the worst economic environment since the Great Depression, we are raising our EBITDA guidance by $15 million and expect to come in at the top end of the new range. We expect to be in the middle of our original EPS guidance range. If you exclude the $0.09 per share of additional interest expense relating to our 2009 senior debt issuances, which was not considered when we originally issued guidance, we would be at the upper end of our EPS range. ", "These are outstanding results produced by the exceptional execution of our operating teams, who responded well to the macroeconomic challenges as well as the goals we set. ", "Tom will discuss our third quarter operating and financial results in detail, so I'd like to take a moment now to share some of the important highlights from our recently completed strategic planning sessions which will drive our direction and investments in 2010 and beyond. ", "We'll apply laser focus in the following areas:", "First, with superior execution, we'll concentrate on maximizing free cash flow while enhancing earnings through improved operating margins. We will continue to improve our strategic focus, efficiency, accountability and execution.", "Next, we will continue to rebalance the Wyndham Worldwide portfolio by increasing the contribution from fee-for-service businesses, moderating timeshare spending and growth, and exploring strategic and tuck-in acquisition opportunities in our fee-for-service businesses. We'll also increase market share by delivering our signature customer service experience \"Count on Me\" as well as our Wyndham Rewards program to improve guest satisfaction, which will result in repeat guest activity and support gains in market share. ", "And finally and very importantly, we will continue to attract, retain and develop associates across our organization as well as support and promote Wyndham Green and Wyndham Diversity initiatives. These strategies will serve as the guidepost for the overall company.", "Let me switch now to review how our businesses are applying this framework to move forward. Remember that as we drive to rebalance our portfolio, about two-thirds of Wyndham Worldwide EBITDA is already driven by our fee-for-service businesses. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals contributes over half of that EBITDA stream. That group's execution has been flawless this year, with third quarter adjusted EBITDA increasing 13% excluding the net effect of foreign currency.", "As we announced today, after significant and careful review of our strategic plans and with considerable input from associates and customers, including the over 30 exchange and rental brands that Group RCI operates, we have decided to rename Group RCI as Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. This new name will elevate the vacation rentals business to an appropriate level within our company given its contribution to overall company performance. We'll continue to use the RCI brand in Exchange, which will support the world's largest membership, [inaudible] and developer base in the industry.", "Let me give you an overview of these two great businesses. ", "First, looking at the exchange business, 78% of all timeshare owners are members of exchange companies, and approximately three-fifths have participated in exchange. And RCI is the market leader. Vacation exchange generates approximately half of the segment's revenues through annual membership fees as well as steady transaction fees from timeshare inventory exchange in approximately 100 countries by our 3.8 million members. No exchange company today has more quality product in more countries than RCI, and we believe that RCI is and will remain the strongest brand in the industry. It's a fee-for-service business with modest capital requirements, high barriers to entry and a stable customer base. ", "The other half of the revenues in this segment are from vacation rentals, currently a European-dominated business where we are also the market leader, offering over 60,000 homes, villas, cottages and condos for rental. Our revenues are derived through commissions on rental revenues. Again, this is a fee-for-service business with low capital requirements where we have great brands, a strong network and a significant market position. ", "Given the size and potential of the relatively unbranded and fragmented $65 billion global rental marketplace, we believe that our well-established brands such as English Country Cottages, Novasol, Cuendet, and Landal can leverage the significant marketing, technology, operating and strategic sourcing synergies of the world's largest hospitality provider. ", "Wyndham Exchange and Rentals strategy is focused on two primary areas: optimizing and expanding exchange and expanding rentals. ", "The central initiative for optimizing and expanding exchange is RCI.com, the comprehensive online strategy that will support a number of goals - expanding online capabilities and efficiency, enhancing products and revenue per member, enhancing our affiliate value proposition, improving marketing efficiencies and member satisfaction, improving inventory management, and of course driving margin improvement. ", "RCI.com's success to date is clear. RCI's web share increased from 13% in the third quarter of 2008 to 23% in the third quarter of 2009. And in North America, which generates over 70% of our exchange transactions, third quarter web share increased from 17% in 2008 to 29% in 2009. We believe that RCI.com can support margin improvement of 200 to 300 basis points over the next few years. ", "Moving to our second area of focus, we intend to expand rentals in Europe by capitalizing on our strong base. We intend to continue to grow Landal, our Dutch park business, and expand Denmark-based Novasol. Landal recently announced the signing of two new franchise parks in Austria that will open in December of this year. This will bring the number of parks to 65 across six European countries. Novasol continued to expand its presence in Croatia, where we have gone from zero to nearly 4,000 homes in just four years.", "Now I'd like to turn to the Wyndham Hotel Group, which will be a key investment area for us going forward. While it appears that the worst is behind us and we're certainly expecting industry improvement next year, we do believe there will be a significant restructuring of the lodging industry over the next 12 to 18 months. We are already seeing opportunities for brand as well as multiunit conversion packages. In this environment, we intend to leverage these and other opportunities to globally grow new rooms organically, through acquisitions, and of course by retaining every property we want to keep.", "We have worked hard over the past several years to clarify our brands' positions in the market. We have made great progress in growing the Wyndham footprint, and with the acquisition of Hawthorn Suites and Microtel last year we now have a broad and deep portfolio with strong product in every category from budget to upper upscale. Our ongoing efforts have resulted in Hotel and Motel Management Magazine recently recognizing Wyndham Hotel Group as the largest hotel company in the U.S. From this powerful base, we're well positioned to grow both domestic and internationally. ", "Conversions are a big part of our domestic growth story and an area that we've been quite successful. Historically, 80% of our room openings have been conversions, and we believe the opportunity going forward is huge. In addition, international opportunities are very strong and promising, representing over 40% of our pipeline. We are growing our international organization, strengthening our global sales team, and continuing to increase the Wyndham Reward footprint. ", "We're seeing great success. For example, in the U.K. prompted awareness of Days Inn increased from 35% in 2006 to 42% in 2008, while Ramada awareness went from 58% to 68% during the same period. And we have an exceptionally strong base in China, where we are the largest U.S. hotel company, with over 30,000 rooms. According to American Express' 2010 global business travel forecast, the economy within China is expected to grow 3% to 8% in 2010. ", "Another objective which supports room growth is to improve the franchisee value proposition. We'll do this by increasing property revenue contribution, leveraging the use of consumer data, and enhancing the consumer experience. For example, through our revenue management services we help franchisees ensure that their hotel's inventory is available on sale on all channels and positioned competitively based on market dynamics. Year-to-date through July, franchisees using this service demonstrate RevPAR index improvements 230 basis points higher than those not in the program. Obviously, we are encouraging all of our franchisees to participate in these programs.", "Now turning to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, where we are developing new ways to maintain our revenue base while maximizing free cash flow. Remember that this business includes a stable fee-for-service property management business that accounts for about 15% of segment revenues and annually contributes about $30 million in EBITDA. We have significantly transformed the other two pieces of vacation ownership this year - sales and consumer finance. As we've discussed before, we have refocused our marketing and distribution channels to efficiently target high-quality customers, resulting in an impressive 25% increase in volume per guest in the third quarter. That's led by an increase in our close rate by holding pricing steady. ", "In our consumer finance portfolio, we continue to make great progress in our effort to strengthen the quality of our receivables portfolio by providing financing programs that promote sales to the right customers. During the third quarter we increased our average down payment in North America to over 20%, up from 12% a year ago. Cash generated at the time of sale increased to 43% from 31%. We financed 57% of VOI sales in the third quarter this year compared with about 69% in the third quarter of last year, and the weighted average FICO of our third quarter 2009 new borrowers was 736 compared with 709 in the third quarter of last year. ", "Looking ahead, we believe a great opportunity exists in this business from our new fee-for-service Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model or WAAM. This model offers turnkey solutions for developers or banks in possession of newly developed, nearly completed or recently finished condo or hotel inventory. We will sell this unused or unsold inventory for a fee through our extensive distribution channels. WAAM enables us to expand our resort portfolio with little or no capital deployment while providing additional channels for new owner acquisitions and growth for our fee-for-service resort management business. ", "We recently signed exclusive WAAM sales and marketing agreements in Orlando and Myrtle Beach. We expect to introduce these projects to our owners next year and that the resorts will be affiliated with our points-based Club Wyndham Plus reservation system. We anticipate sales of approximately 460 recently constructed condominium-style units over the next few years. In addition, one of these projects has the possibility of a mixed use hotel under a franchise agreement as a Wyndham Grand hotel, which will leverage our brand as well as our timeshare and hotel operations. ", "We hope the WAAM model will become a central piece of our strategy for this business as we focus on cash generation, although it is still too early to predict ultimately how large it will be. We are uniquely equipped to execute this strategy given our scale and expertise, our points-based product structure, our extensive sales and marketing channels, our consumer financing and servicing operations, and our terrific property management expertise. I look forward to updating you on our progress over time.", "Now let me turn the call over to Tom Conforti, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Tom Conforti", "Thanks, Steve. ", "I've been at Wyndham close to eight weeks now, and I'm really thrilled to be here. I'm impressed with the energy and enthusiasm of the team, and the strength of our business models, the combination of which will yield significant opportunities going forward. And I look forward to meeting and working with each of you over time.", "I come out of a CFO experience where the company was transformed from a net user of capital to a generator of free cash flow. I'm a big advocate of delivering strong cash flow to drive shareholder value.", "As Steve described, here at Wyndham Worldwide we're really focusing on cash flow and seeking to deploy capital for the highest possible returns. Ultimately, our business objective is to transform the cash and earnings profile of the company, primarily by rebalancing the cash streams to achieve a greater proportion of EBITDA from our fee-for-services businesses. We'll focus on generating cash earnings and improving working capital management going forward, investing it in high-return businesses such as lodging. ", "Now let me take you through the business unit performance, beginning with the Hotel Group.", "Revenues and adjusted EBITDA were down 14% and 24%, respectively, primarily due to expected domestic industrywide RevPAR declines and lower other franchise fees. ", "Margins were also compressed due to increased expenses from remediation efforts on technology compliance initiatives as well as an increase in bad debt expense. The majority of our economy brand hotel owners are single property owner-operators that have been hit hard by the recession. We are working with these franchisees in a number of ways to help them through these difficult times, including extending payment terms. As a result, our reserve against these aged receivables is naturally higher. Our managed portfolio, which comprises only about 2% of our total system, is also experiencing some turmoil in this economic climate, and we have adjusted our reserves accordingly.", "Domestic RevPAR decreased 16% from a year ago. Worldwide and international RevPAR declined 17% and 19%, respectively, in constant currency. ", "The Hotel Group continued to benefit from strong brands as well as the geographic and segment distribution of our lodging portfolio, evidenced by a 90 basis point outperformance of domestic industrywide RevPAR. We believe these results reflect market share improvement and the consumer travel shift to more frequent mini-vacations closer to home. ", "With the majority of our domestic properties located on the interstate or in small metro and suburban areas and almost 75% of our domestic portfolio in the economy segment, we were well positioned in this economic climate to capture occupancy and hold rate. Despite this support, the environment continues to be difficult, and we now believe RevPAR for the year could be at or slightly below our earlier guidance. ", "On the development front, the financing timeline has been extended and some conversion prospects are having a more difficult time extracting themselves from their existing relationships. This makes it harder to forecast the timing of property openings and will slow the new room openings for the year. Our current best view is that the number of rooms in the system at year end may be below guidance; however, we expect to still be slightly positive for the year. ", "We ended the quarter with approximately 591,000 hotel rooms and another 111,000 in the pipeline, including some multiunit larger deals. The number of projects breaking ground through September was consistent with last year at close to 30. During that same period we converted over 6,000 rooms from independent brands and another 16,000 rooms from competitor chains. As Steve mentioned, we continue to focus on growing our international system, although at a slower pace than we would like. Year-to-date, we've added over 10,000 rooms internationally, including 4,900 rooms in China, 2,200 in Canada, and 1,400 in the U.K.", "Now moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, in the third quarter both businesses within the segment continued to deliver excellent results. Excluding the net effect of foreign currency and restructuring charges recorded during the third quarter of 2008, revenue was relatively flat. And, importantly, adjusted EBITDA increased 13%, reflecting continued cost reduction efforts. ", "Exchange revenue in the third quarter of 2009 was flat on a constant currency basis and down 4% on a reported basis. Member growth was up 3%, reflecting the addition of the Disney Vacation Club earlier this year. Growth in the average member was offset by a 3% reduction in annual dues and Exchange revenue per member in constant currency. ", "The reduction in revenue per member primarily reflects the impacts of clubs such as Disney's where members also have the option to exchange within their club network. While clubs reduce our revenue per member metric, RCI, our Exchange business, benefits from higher overall revenue from the additional member subscriptions and transactions, as well as other ancillary revenues earned from our development partners. The decline was partly offset by higher transaction fees as we increased pricing earlier in the year for call center transactions while holding web prices constant to encourage members to transact on the web. ", "Rentals revenue in the third quarter were up 3% on a constant currency basis and down 7% on a reported basis. Transaction volumes were up 2%, reflecting strength from Landal's Green Parks in the Netherlands and Holiday Cottages in the U.K. In constant currency, average net price per rental was up 1% in the third quarter of 2009, primarily reflecting favorable yield management for member rentals. ", "We expect Wyndham Exchange and Rentals to deliver full year 2009 results at the higher end of guidance; however, fourth quarter year-over-year comparisons will be difficult due to one-time currency gains and cost savings in the fourth quarter of 2008, as well as a delay in the timing of certain rental expenses until the fourth quarter.", "Now moving to Vacation Ownership, VOI revenues exceeded our expectations in the third quarter. As Steve mentioned, sales efficiencies were once again up significantly, reflecting the resizing of the business with volume per guest up 25% from the third quarter of 2008. [Inaudible] rates are strong and transaction sizes remain stable. We expect Vacation Ownership to end the year with approximately $400 million in adjusted EBITDA, exceeding the top end of our guidance range. ", "On the Consumer Financing front, the provision for loan loss was $117 million, consistent since the fourth quarter of last year. Write-offs in the third quarter were at 3.38% of the loan portfolio, also relatively consistent, and the securitizations continue to perform within their expected [inaudible]. We continue to see some good trends in the portfolio as delinquency and default rates remain consistent with those experienced at the end of last year. ", "We are very pleased with the recent renewal of our conduit as well as the closing in September and October of two term securitizations totaling $350 million. The conduit has a capacity of $600\u00a0million, which is ample for our ongoing sales plans. The spread is approximately 100\u00a0basis points less than our prior facility, with lower upfront fees and a comparable advance rate of approximately 51%. We are particularly encouraged by the improving pricing and terms we achieved on these transactions, which reflects the quality of the underlying loans, our strong history in the asset-backed market, and continued recovery in the market.", "Now remember that our securitizations are currently recorded on our balance sheet and have been so since 2003, so unlike others in the industry we expect no impact from FAS\u00a0166 and 167 in January 2010 relating to our securitizations. ", "Moving on to the corporate front, I want to spend a moment on what will be a significant area of concentration for the company and for me as CFO as we seek to rebalance our portfolio. We will be placing greater emphasis on managing free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx and development advances. This means that as we move forward our management teams will increasingly focus their attention on the major components of this metric - cash earnings, CapEx, and working capital management. ", "For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, free cash flow totaled $455 million compared with an outflow of $1 million last year. Excluding any contingent liabilities, we expect free cash flow of approximately $500 million in 2009 and approximately $500 to $600 million in 2010. ", "We had approximately $850 million of capacity on the corporate revolver at the end of the third quarter in 2009 compared with approximately $290 million as of year end 2008. ", "The convertible debt balance increased to $309 million from $253 million last quarter, reflecting the increased value of the conversion feature, driven by the strong increase in our stock price. The value of the conversion feature will continue to fluctuate with our stock price. As you may recall, we purchased a call option to protect the company from an increase in the value in this convertible debt; therefore, the increase in debt, up to $20.16 share price, will not result in any incremental cash payment or dilution. ", "Turning our attention to the remainder of the year, as you saw from the press release, we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.35 to $0.38, which puts full year adjusted EPS at $1.75 to $1.78, slightly higher than our prior commentary. Fourth quarter assumptions include approximately $20 to $25 million of EBITDA benefit from deferred revenue and diluted shares of approximately 184 million. ", "In addition, we are raising the 2009 EBITDA guidance by $15\u00a0million. We now expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $180 million for the year based on current project timing compared with $175 million in our prior guidance.", "As you saw from the press release, our preliminary outlook for 2010 indicates that revenues and EBITDA will be approximately equal to 2009 guidance ranges with RevPAR assumed to decline by zero to 3% and flat gross VOI sales in our timeshare business. Keep in mind that 2009 EBITDA has benefited by about $90 million from percentage of completion deferred revenue, which will be absent next year. Also we expect interest expense of approximately $130 to $140\u00a0million, reflecting higher interest expense related to the 2009 senior notes and lower capitalized interest, consistent with our resulted vacation ownership spending. ", "With that, I'd like to turn it back to Steve.", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks, Tom.", "Before we open the line for your questions, I'd like to make a few closing comments. ", "Across our businesses we are seeing that leisure travelers are traveling and they're staying at our properties. We believe the overall economic environment is improving, but the strength and course of the recovery are still very uncertain. For example, we see occupancy rates stabilizing in the hotel industry. We're cautiously optimistic regarding our European rental business, where summer travel was strong. European travelers are booking, although later than in years past. And at our timeshare resorts, systemwide occupancies were up 1.5% to 83.8% during the third quarter of 2009 despite the addition of almost 500 units over the past year. ", "Our resized vacation ownership business is operating more efficiently, with a greater focus on only the most qualified and creditworthy sales prospects. Our unique points-based product, sold in varying increments, fits well with current family travel preferences - multiple shorter vacations closer to home. And then, while there have been some industry reports about softer consumer demand for timeshare, we have held our pricing steady and improved our close rates. ", "This is a transformational time. In this environment, superior execution is our central strategy and, as Tom mentioned, this will enable us to drive continued strong cash flow and increase the contribution of our fee-for-service businesses. ", "We're leveraging and growing the strong Wyndham brand and enhancing our customer service culture throughout our company. In this process we will be guided by Wyndham Worldwide's mission statement, which is to be the leader in travel accommodations, welcoming our guests to iconic brands and vacation destinations through our signature \"Count on Me\" service. ", "With the success we're seeing in all of these efforts, I'm confident that Wyndham Worldwide is well positioned to capitalize on an economic recovery and to deliver shareholder value both in the near and long term. ", "And with that, Caroline, we'll open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Joseph Greff - J.P. Morgan.", "Joseph Greff - J.P. Morgan", "A question for you on the RCI margin. You mentioned you expect 200 to 300 basis points of improvement over the next few years. Can you just sort of help us understand relative to what - I mean, I guess my question's more direct - Wyndham Exchange and Rentals had north of 30% EBITDA margins; is that what you're looking for to improve upon or is that the level that you're looking to get to on a sustainable basis?", "And then my second question is with regard to the WAAM initiative. How much revenue contribution or EBITDA contribution do you anticipate from this initiative in 2010?", "Steve Holmes", "Okay, taking the questions, I'll take them in reverse order. ", "On the WAAM question, we are looking for minimal contribution in 2010. The product that we've already signed up for we're going to need to put through our registration process, and that registration process will take us into the beginning part of the year. So it's not going to be a huge contributor in 2010. If successful, which we certainly hoping this program will be, you'll see more of this grow in 2011 and 2012.", "As to your first question, which related to the RCI margin question, the margin in the third quarter, that is one of our higher margin quarters that you're looking at, and our average for the year in that business is probably around 25% or so. We're looking for the 200 to 300 basis points to be incremental to that average of 25% margin that we've been running in that business. ", "And as you know, we've been talking about this initiative for awhile. I think we've already captured some improvement, so this is additional improvement that we're looking to get. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs.", "Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs", "Steve, could you just talk about tuck-in acquisitions and what you meant by that? Given your multiple, it seems like maybe share buybacks would be on the list and maybe more importantly debt paydown, so I was a little puzzled by the idea of tuck-in. ", "And then strategically, can you just talk a little bit more about Wyndham and changing the name, what the reaction is and does that basically put you out of business with pursuing any hotel companies who would want to use you as an exchange company? ", "And sorry, just to be clear on the tuck-in, size of tuck-ins - what does that really mean?", "Steve Holmes", "Okay. Thanks, Steve. ", "On the tuck-in - and let me address the second part of that first question first, which is reducing debt and share buyback - we're not eliminating that as an option for us. Obviously, we are paying down debt; that's been a central focus of ours. We still have a buyback program that's in place, although we haven't been executing on it because we've been cautious with balance sheet and have not been buying back shares recently. ", "What the strategic tuck-in was addressing was the growth of that segment of our business. So if we're looking at where we will deploy capital to grow businesses inorganically, we would expect to focus on the Hotel segment. ", "So that's what we were saying about tuck-in acquisitions. It's not to the exclusion of other uses of capital, and obviously we want to pay down debt and we want to do what we can to improve our share price to the shareholders.", "The size of the tuck-in acquisitions can be varied, and I don't want to put a bracket on a number because I don't want to have one that's $5 million over it and somebody say gee, you're doing bigger deals than you said you were going to do. I would consider a tuck-in acquisition to be like the Microtel-Hawthorn Suite deal that we recently did. That's a deal that was around $100\u00a0million, was an accretive deal for us and will be a terrific add-in going forward. ", "So we're looking at those type of tuck-in acquisitions, but you really can't project opportunities so I don't know exactly what will be available and what we'll be able to cut a good deal on because obviously we've been very disciplined only to do positive transactions for us.", "With respect to the second question on the Group RCI being renamed Wyndham Exchange and Rental, that we don't think will have any impact on your question, which is other hotel companies. Obviously, we've got some terrific hotel companies who are affiliated with Group\u00a0RCI right now. ", "The RCI business will retain its name within the exchange marketplace and will continue to be the leader of exchange with great companies like Disney and Hilton as part of our portfolio. The Wyndham Exchange and Rental renaming was really meant to make sure that the world knows, including the investment community, that we've got this incredibly great business that some people think is just associated with the timeshare business. ", "But the fact is, it also has a terrific rental business over in Europe which is extremely well managed, great brand names, terrific presence in the marketplace, and has performed incredibly well. I don't know that there's many companies - I probably couldn't find any within the travel industry - that on an FX-neutral basis have actually increased from 2008 to 2009. This business has, and we're not sure people actually appreciate what's there. In addition, we are expanding the rental side of the business. It's already grown to half of that business, and we thought it was appropriate to give it the umbrella name of Wyndham.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Patrick Scholes - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey.", "Patrick Scholes - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "Can I get a little more color on the trends in the RCI business of customers booking online versus calling in? I know you've been working hard to improve that. Where does that stand right now?", "Tom Conforti", "The increase has been pretty dramatic. We went from 13% web activity on RCI.com last year in the third quarter to 23% in the third quarter of this year. And in North America, which is our biggest part of the company, the biggest part of our Exchange business, we increased from 17% to 29% in 2008 third quarter to 2009 third quarter. So it has been dramatic. And the website, which is actually going to have a new skin put on it mid-November, has been very well received by the consumer community, and I welcome all of you to go online at RCI.com and see what we have available.", "Patrick Scholes - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "Do you think with customers continuing to migrate online that'll be where most of the margin increase in that segment will come from?", "Tom Conforti", "Absolutely.", "Patrick Scholes - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "Just one other question on a different topic here. There's been a lot press and chatter on one of your competitors not giving in to demands from an OTA. What are your thoughts on demands that OTAs are asking for right now, such as last room availability, 25% net rate and three-year terms? Do you think they're starting to overstep their bounds given that we're starting to see a bit of recovery on the hotel side?", "Steve Holmes", "Well, Patrick, as you probably expect, I'm not going to comment on what others negotiate or what's going on in the marketplace with the OTAs versus our competitors. We have a very good relationship with the OTAs. We work very closely with them. And beyond that, I don't know that there's much that I can comment on because it doesn't really relate to us; it relates to others.", "Patrick Scholes - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "Do you have a master agreement right now with Expedia?", "Steve Holmes", "Yes, we do. ", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "Regarding primarily timeshare, can you talk about how you're sourcing or where you're sourcing the customers so that you're getting an increase in volume per guest - to what extent are those existing, to what extent are you unearthing new customers? ", "And the other question is regarding RCI. Can you talk about, for you and for the industry generally, what is the growth in members or is there growth in members?", "Steve Holmes", "Okay, taking the first question on the timeshare sourcing, we sell to both our existing as well as new customers, Mike, and that's been a constant for us over the years. We always have a mix of that. Most recently the mix of what we call our in-house or upgrade sales has been a little bit higher as a percentage than it was last year or the year before, but we continue also to focus on new members. Obviously, it's important that we bring new people into the fold. So it's both sources.", "The reason that the quality of the buying customer is better, frankly, is that we've more closely refined our marketing for those new customers. We've refined it. We've cut out some of the marketing programs that we had that previously generated lower FICO score customers, and that was all part of the restructuring and the reposition of this business that we did at the end of last year and grew it into this year. So it's really being selective on our marketing channel, and the marketing channels generally drive the quality of the buyer coming to the table.", "We also then don't sell to certain FICO score customers or we don't offer the same financing, I should say, to those customers. We're happy to sell to them, but their cash portion will be more or it'll be an all-cash sale because we limit the credit that we're providing to the customers based on the scoring that we have.", "Tom Conforti", "And, Mike, if I might add, we also closed some of our underperforming sales offices as part of the restructuring effort. So that, combined with the superior execution that Steve described and a more targeted marketing effort, those have been the drivers behind the VPG increase. ", "Steve Holmes", "And on the RCI side, Mike, we aren't looking at large customer growth in RCI. Obviously, we are driven by the number of new people who buy timeshares. The timeshare industry as a whole has contracted somewhat, so we would not expect to see as many new members. ", "There are, though, two things that I would say will be kind of positives for that business. The first is that with this RCI.com technology that we've rolled out and the kind of customer reaction we're seeing to it, we do expect to see an uptick in the number of active members at RCI. We haven't quantified this yet because we're still introducing this new product to the marketplace, but we think people who in the past maybe wanted to do it online, were forced to do it by call center, maybe were defaulting to go back to their home resort or just were not as actively involved in that planning process for their vacation. So we think we'll reignite people to be interested. ", "The second thing is that despite the fact that we may not have new member growth, we do expect to see efficiency. And, again, that efficiency or margin improvement should come through the new mechanisms we have for providing this service to the customer, namely RCI.com.", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Ryan Meliker - Morgan Stanley.", "Ryan Meliker - Morgan Stanley", "I just had a quick question regarding the lodging business. I know you don't have a lot of detail on the corporate rate negotiations right now. I just wanted to get some color on whether you've seen an uptick in RFP requests. Basically I'm trying to get to whether we're seeing any type of trade down from some other brands in the full-service products to some of your limited-service product at the corporate travel level? Any color would great. ", "Steve Holmes", "Okay, Ryan. Well, we are not a huge corporate travel provider. We don't do a lot of meetings and planning business other than in our Wyndham brand, so we probably are not as good a barometer as others are for that. ", "So because of that, I would default more to the general trending that we're seeing in the industry, which is the RevPAR declines at the upscale, upper upscale luxury segment have been more dramatic than those at the economy and mid-scale sectors, and that's in part because there's probably more of a leisure focus - in our business there certainly is - a leisure focus in the economy and the mid-scale sectors, but also I think there's just what some people call that trading down that people do; there may be some of that trading down going on.", "As I've told others, we don't ask somebody when they come and do a Super 8 if they wanted to stay at a different hotel before. We book them a room and give them a great experience, so we don't know if they've traded down or made a different decision. But we can only look at our performance versus our competitors and, where we stand, our declines have not been as dramatic. So that would tend to make me feel that we probably have seen some trading down going on. ", "Ryan Meliker - Morgan Stanley", "You're not seeing an uptick in RFP requests from corporations?", "Steve Holmes", "Again, we're not big enough in that for us to really be a barometer for it, Ryan, unfortunately. I probably am not the right person to answer that question for you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you, and at this time I'm showing no further questions. Thank you, I'd like to turn it back over to the speakers for closing comments.", "Steve Holmes", "", "All right, well, thank you very much, Caroline, and we appreciate everybody's attendance and questions and look forward to talking to you on our next quarterly call.

Before we get started I want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward looking information that is subject to a number of risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-Q filed November 5, 2009, with the SEC. ", "We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these measures to comparable GAAP measures is provided in the tables to the press release and is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.WyndhamWorldwide.com.  ", "Steve Holmes", "As you saw from our press release, we had another great quarter and overall a terrific year despite the tough economy. We continued to demonstrate strong execution against our strategic initiatives and delivered fourth quarter EPS of $0.40 compared with guidance of $0.35 to $0.38. Our full year adjusted EBITDA of $830 million was also ahead of our guidance.", "Today I will talk with you about our 2009 achievements, our exciting plans for 2010 and some major decisions we\u2019ve made regarding how we\u2019ll deploy free cash flow going forward. Then Tom Conforti will review results and walk you through 2010 guidance.", "Overall we see some signs that the economic and operating environments are stabilizing. Like others we are seeing improvement in the upper upscale segment with Wyndham Brand same store managed portfolio RevPAR in the US up over 12% in January. At the same time, unemployment in the US combined with ongoing consumer concerns about the economy, continued to pressure consumer spending and RevPAR in our primary economy and mid-scale industry segments.", "The lower priced segments were not impacted as much during the downturn and will probably follow the upper segments out of the recovery. However, we\u2019re confident that our resilient business model, our proven ability to execute and our growing free cash flow position us well strategically and financially for 2010 and beyond.", "We continued to make great progress in transforming our businesses to maximize free cash flow. In 2009, consistent with our strategic decision to cap the size of our traditional time share business, we reduced inventory spend and reduced receivables in this business. These actions, combined with other cost control efforts, drove free cash flow of $541 million in 2009, a turnaround of over $600 million from 2008.", "For 2010 we\u2019ve also introduced additional disciplined balance sheet reviews into our budgeting and forecasting process and a balance sheet efficiency component into our executive compensation program. This will help maintain our focus on maximizing free cash flow across the organization.", "Our transformation positions the company well for future growth, profitability and cash flow. We expect sustainable annual free cash flow of $500 to $600 million in the coming years and we are committed to deploying the cash flow to drive shareholder value. We expect to reinvest a portion of our free cash flow in our fee for service businesses when we have opportunities that are attractive from a strategic and financial perspective. We also intend to return a greater portion to our shareholders through increased dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. In fact, we made two significant announcements today that address our capital allocation plans.", "First, we\u2019ve tripled the dividend, which puts us at a payout ratio of approximately 30% and a current yield of approximately 2%. This decision demonstrates our strong confidence in our business prospects as well as the sustainability of our free cash flow going forward. We expect to generate over $2.5 billion in free cash flow over the next five years, which enables us to make this commitment now while maintaining a sharp focus on our credit metrics and continuing to strengthen and grow our businesses. Tom will walk you through our dividend policy shortly.", "Second, we intend to resume our share repurchase program on an opportunistic basis. We have $157 million remaining under our current authorization.", "Now let me take you through some of the highlights of our strategic initiatives and results. As a reminder, our mission is to be the leaders in travel accommodations, welcoming our guest to iconic brands and vacation destinations through our signature \u201cCount on Me\u201d service. Of course our primary objective as a public company is to increase shareholder value.", "Our key strategies to support these goals are to increase market share by delivering excellent service, grow cash flow and operating margin through superior execution, and emphasize our fee for service business models, which accounted for 65% of our EBITDA in 2009. ", "I\u2019ll start with Wyndham Exchange and Rental which increased adjusted EBITDA by 9% excluding a net effect of foreign currency in 2009. Our team superbly executed their business plan, demonstrating their technology and marketing leadership across the global exchange business and expanding our vacation rental brands while growing operating margins. ", "The exchange side of the business, RCI, culminated a fantastic year with an annual affiliate meeting last month in New York City, which drew record attendance. The theme of the event was, innovative, value added services we provide. RCI continues to dominate on the technology front, providing new functionality not only to its 3.8 million members but also to it\u2019s over 4,000 affiliated resorts.", "For example, RCI.com is now available to our Club affiliates as a transparent online booking tool. For example, Hilton Grand Vacation Club owners can book within the Hilton Club or transact an RCI exchange all through our portal. Developer affiliates using this new web interface have achieved significant gains in online transaction penetration rate in a matter of months.", "On the consumer front, we successfully completed a significant RCI.com upgrade in November which expanded our cutting edge and enhanced search technology to our over one million point\u2019s members, giving them complete and easy access to the tremendous breadth and depth of our global portfolio.", "We also initiated automatic electronic status updates on pending request, which historically have account for approximately 12% of our call volume. Our efforts to date have resulted in 24% penetration of online transactions in the fourth quarter 2009 compared with 13% in 2008 and resulted in $5 million of sustainable cost center savings throughout 2009.", "Our European rental businesses delivered solid results despite the difficult economic environment. These businesses demonstrated strong resiliency during this downturn as leisure travelers throughout Europe remained committed to their vacations. Our UK Cottage rental business had an especially stellar year, aided in part by weak pound/sterling resulting in increased domestic travel. This business annually serves over one million leisure travelers through exclusive listings of 17,000 rental properties.", "Excluding the next effect of foreign currency, revenue increased by 5% and contribution margin increased by over 30% compared with 2008. Ongoing investment in ecommerce is also yielding results. In 2009, 73% of bookings were made online, up from 59% in 2008, supported in part by a 21% increase in Google click through rates. Additionally, the UK Cottage rental business reduced marketing costs by applying enhance analytics to the four million customers in our database as well as focusing efforts on the most effective marketing channels, resulting in higher marketing conversion rates.", "We have a scalable efficient infrastructure supporting these two great business models, Vacation Exchange and Vacation Rentals. We completed restructuring and other cost savings initiatives in 2009 that eliminated over $50 million annually in costs. We focused primarily on increase efficiency rather than eliminating headcount, resulting in sustainable cost savings and better run businesses which will support margin expansion in future years.", "Moving to the Hotel Group, we believe that strong well supported brands and increasing reservation contribution are paramount to our ability to retain and attract new franchisees. As I said earlier, historically the economy in mid-scale segments compared to higher end segments, have been more resilient during economic downturns and exhibited slower recovery. We\u2019ll use what we believe will be a transition year to heightened our focus on executing on the blocking and tackling in this business.", "We are launching a series of strategic initiatives with the goal of strengthening our brands and delivering our reservation experience that maximizes value for both franchisees and consumers. Our efforts will focus on the following areas: First we will drive bookings through online channels by improving consumer shopping experience on our brand websites by enhancing connectivity to online travel agents and by increasing product exposure on an OTA websites.", "Next, we\u2019ll increase occupancy and allow for better pricing opportunities by ensuring all our rate plans are consistently available across all channels and by equipment franchisees with more competitive rate information to enable them to make better rate setting decisions. We will continue to invest in our international platform, with a keen focus on priority markets. We expect the multi-wave implementation effort on these and other strategic initiatives over the next few years as we continue to build capabilities that enable future growth. ", "We continue to make great progress on building the Wyndham brand also. We opened over 2,000 Wyndham rooms in the fourth quarter and nearly 4,200 rooms during the year, the majority of which were international, with approximately 1,200 rooms in China including the Wyndham Grand Plaza Royal in Hangzhou, 1,000 rooms in Mexico including four ocean front properties and 225 rooms at the Wyndham Apollo Hotel in Amsterdam. On the domestic front, we opened the 255 room Graves 601 Hotel Wyndham Grand which is the largest upscale meeting facility in Downtown Minneapolis and has earned numerous accolades. ", "Wyndham vacation ownership had another solid quarter, wrapping up a year of transformation for that business, reducing the size of our business from $2 billion in vacation ownership sales to $1.3 billion while maintaining high levels of business momentum. We\u2019re in the process of transforming this business to move from a growth orientation to a dramatically improved cash flow and return profile. We\u2019re seeing great success. ", "We reduced our inventory spend from $414 million in 2008 to $189 million in 2009. Cash down payments for the quarter were 22% up from 13% in the fourth quarter 2008. In addition, for the full year, we reduced the percentage of sales finance from 66% in 2008 to 55% in 2009. In addition, FICO scores for the full year 2009 were 724 compared with 694 in 2008.", "We are also making great progress on our alternative business model for timeshare. With product in Myrtle Beach now registered under our asset affiliation model, we expect to begin sales this month. While we remain in the early planning phases for this offering, we are confident this will be a very successful model going forward. Overall we believe there are plenty of products available with over 5,000 units in our deal pipeline. To take full advantage of the opportunity, we are exploring various programmatic approaches for this business.", "Finally, for Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which had a great quarter, we started the year strong as well. On January 26 of this year we hosted the grand opening of Wyndham Vacation Resorts at National Harbor, our newest resort located in the heart of National Harbor and just minutes from the snow covered nation\u2019s capital. This is our second property in the market, joining Wyndham Old Town Alexandria which opened in 1999 and remains one of the most popular resorts in our portfolio.", "This resort will cater to the growing travel trend among timeshare owners to visit major metropolitan centers and is just one more way we\u2019re keeping ahead of the curve for those looking to get maximum value for the vacation dollars.", "In summary, I\u2019m pleased with our results, strong balance sheet, and enhanced cash flow, tripling the dividend, and resuming our share repurchase program, reflect our confidence in our ability to continue to execute and to deliver significant returns to shareholders now and in years to come.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom to go through our results and guidance in more detail.", "Tom Conforti", "I\u2019ll walk you through the details of the quarter, talk about 2010 guidance, and cover some additional topics. Company wide, revenue which included a $46 million roll in of previously deferred sales related to the percentage of completion accounting, were flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. As Steve noted, we exceeded our EPS guidance for the quarter and our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year.", "The company\u2019s balance sheet is in great shape. We had approximately $870 million of capacity on the corporate revolver at the end of the year, compared with approximately $290 million at the end of 2008. Our debt to EBITDA ratio as defined by the rating agencies is at 3.1 times. We have no significant near term maturities and we have significant room under our covenants. Overall we believe we have an investment grade profile.", "Cash from operations was approximately $690 million in 2009 compared to just $109 million in 2008, resulting in a break through year in the company\u2019s generation of free cash flow, which we define as cash from operations less CapEx and hotel development advances. With the free cash flow turnaround of over $600 million our results were transformational. ", "Based on these results, as Steve noted, our Board of Directors has authorized a three fold increase in the dividend and we will resume our share repurchase program. These decisions were based on our belief that the company will sustainably deliver $500 to $600 million in free cash flow well into the future, that our current capital structure is an investment grade profile, and that we have sufficient flexibility to make value enhancing investments in our fee for service businesses. ", "Our dividend payout is now about 30% with a yield of approximately 2% at our current stock price. When we came out of the box with the increase we wanted to target a 2% dividend yield. Going forward, our dividend policy will be to at least mirror the rate of growth of our business. In addition, on share repurchase, we are reactivating our current authorization with a balance of $157 million.", "Now moving to segment performance beginning with Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, it once again delivered excellent results, ending the year ahead of our guidance. For the quarter, excluding the net effect of foreign currency, revenue and adjusted EBITDA were flat. On a similar full year basis, adjusted margins increased almost 300 basis points to 28% reflecting resilient top line performance in a difficult economic environment, efficiencies from our migration to the web, and cost reduction efforts associated with streamlining our organization, a remarkable achievement given the economic conditions of the last 12 months.", "Exchange revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 was up 2% on a constant currency basis. Member growth was up 2% reflecting in part the addition of the Disney Vacation Club earlier this year. Fourth quarter 2009 annual dues and exchange revenue per member in constant currency was consistent with the fourth quarter 2008, reflecting higher transaction fees for call center transaction, offset by lower exchange transactions.", "Vacation rental revenues in the fourth quarter were up 2% on a constant currency basis. Transaction volume was relatively flat, reflecting higher volumes at our Landal GreenParks in Holland and our UK Cottage rentals business, offset by fewer vacation rentals by our RCI members. In constant currency, average net price per rental was up 3% in the fourth quarter 2009 primarily reflecting mix from higher volume at Landal GreenParks.", "Ancillary revenues in the fourth quarter were $30 million a 17% decrease from the fourth quarter 2008, due primarily to lower fees generated from programs with affiliated resorts and our termination of a low margin travel service contract.", "As part of my ongoing education with the company I recently had the opportunity to visit three of our European rental businesses. I was impressed with the energy, enthusiasm and focus of the teams as well as their well thought out growth plans. These are excellent businesses with a great consumer base. They operate for the most part on a fee per service model. ", "I was also impressed by the quality of the rental properties and the parks. As Steve noted, 2009 proved the resiliency of European vacation rentals in a difficult economic environment. The cottage businesses are scalable with no additional CapEx requirements. We believe there is great exportability of this model throughout Europe.", "At Wyndham Hotel Group, revenues and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter were down 12% and 41% respectively due in part to an expected industry wide RevPAR declines and lower other franchise fees. In addition, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $6 million related to a joint venture that manages international four and five star properties which had been hit hard by the global economic downturn, affecting profitability estimates. This charge was not contemplated in our most recent guidance.", "We also recorded incremental bad debt expense in the quarter of approximately $6 million, principally related to three properties in our managed portfolio, which experienced occupancy declines similar to the rest of the industry. Please note these managed properties comprise less than 2% of our systems portfolio in total. As Steve noted, RevPAR significantly improved at our managed properties in January. Overall, we\u2019re beginning to see less stress across the entire system. We lost only two franchise properties to foreclosure in January 2010 compared with nine franchise properties in January 2009.", "Domestic RevPAR decreased 14% from a year ago. Worldwide and international RevPAR declined 13% and 15% respectively in constant currency. Our Day Inn and Super 8 brands continue to outperform the economy segment primarily due to stronger pricing than the competition. It\u2019s encouraging that these brands, which account for over 50% of our rooms, have held rate above their segment. In addition, while a small piece of our business, advanced bookings do signal that rate continues to hold, all of which provides a strong base for out performance when occupancy returns.", "Internationally we are seeing some signs of industry improvement. Fourth quarter RevPAR was down only 1.6% in China. In Mexico, in constant currency, fourth quarter RevPAR increased 3% for the Wyndham brand and 2.2% for all brands. Exhibiting great momentum in a difficult environment, we ended the quarter with approximately 597,700 rooms worldwide, opening over 46,000 rooms in the year, but terminating 41,000 rooms. Our ability to reach our long term room growth rate of 2% to 4% requires that we make retaining the right rooms a top priority. The strategies Steve mentioned earlier address this objective.", "Moving to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, revenues and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter were up 3% and 45% respectively. Our results reflect the benefit of a roll in and percentage of completion deferred revenue, continued efficiencies in sales and marketing which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment and a decline in the provision for loan loss as signs of some stability appear.", "Gross VOI revenues exceeded our expectations again in the fourth quarter. Sales efficiencies were once up again significantly reflecting the resizing of our business with volume per guest up over 36% from the fourth quarter 2008 and up over 23% for the year compared to 2008. Close rates remain strong and transaction sizes in pricing remain stable.", "On the consumer financing front, we saw significant improvement in write offs in the fourth quarter which were 3% relative to the overall portfolio, down from 3.3% at the end of Q4 2008. Accordingly, the provision for loan loss was $103 million or 26% of VOI sales down from 31% on a similar basis from the fourth quarter 2008. The securitizations continue to perform within their expected tolerances and overall we continue to see good trends in the portfolio as delinquency and default rates are improving.", "Now let\u2019s turn to 2010 guidance. Note that we\u2019ll post the guidance to the Investor Relations portion of our website immediately following the call. We are maintaining our previous guidance for 2010 revenue and EBITDA and free cash flow for the company. ", "Let\u2019s look at each business unit, starting with Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. Drivers are generally flat reflecting continued economic uncertainty in the US and Europe, specifically, in exchange we expect the average number of members as well as the annual dues and exchange revenue per member to be flat. In rentals we expect transactions to be flat and we expect average net price per vacation rental to increase between 2% and 5%. Finally, we expect Wyndham Exchange and Rentals revenue of $1.125 to $1.225 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $290 to $310 million.", "Given our expectation that member\u2019s annual dues and exchange revenue per member and rental transactions will be relatively flat, as a result of the economic conditions, we are keeping our EBITDA range consistent with 2009, although we do anticipate a positive FX impact in 2010. Regarding FX sensitivity in Wyndham Exchange and Rentals it operates in approximately 100 countries with many currencies. A rule of thumb, a 10% change in the dollar against a representative basket of currencies would result in a $14 million impact on exchange and rentals full year EBITDA.", "Moving to the Hotel Group, as we mentioned earlier, we expect RevPAR to be flat to down 3% with some improvement in the second half of the year, but the first half still challenged and a 1% to 3% increase in system size. We expect revenues to be between $620 and $670 and adjusted EBITDA in a range of $180 to $200 million, increased somewhat assuming that the continued weakness in RevPAR will be offset by moderating bad debt expense and prudent expense control.", "At Wyndham Vacation Ownership, remember that we are deliberately capping the traditional model for this business to concentrate on cash flow generation and the return profile of the business. Based on these objectives we expect gross VOI sales to be flat. We\u2019re planning a 3% to 6% decline in tours as we target higher efficiency market channels, and a 5% to 8% increase in volume per guest. ", "We expect GAAP revenue to be between $1.7 and $2 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $360 to $390 million reflecting our expectation that there will be no impact from percentage of completion deferred revenue this year. This negative impact is offset by the anticipated continued improvement in sales efficiency and lower loan loss reserves. Remember that we took steps to eliminate deferred revenue and expect no impact from percentage of completion deferred revenue this year.", "The absence of this revenue will result in headwinds of $187 million in revenues and $89 million in EBITDA for 2010 relative to 2009. The affect will be particularly strong in the first quarter since we had a $67 million revenue benefit from deferred revenue in Q1 2009. Based on the improvements we\u2019ve made to credit standards and the improved performance of the portfolio, we are hopeful that the provision for loan losses will come down this year.", "We expect depreciation and amortization, company wide of approximately $180 to $185 million. Interest expense based on our current capitalization is expected to be between $130 and $140 million. Please note that while we have no significant debt maturities in 2010 we\u2019re evaluating alternatives to take advantage of the current improved debt market and refinance some of our debt ahead of schedule, possibly early in the year, and that we could incur additional interest expense and related expenses currently not considered in this guidance. Any change would relate to replacement debt. We will not increase our outstanding debt this year. We will keep you posted as these potential transactions develop.", "The ABS market is continuing to gradually improve. We anticipate that we\u2019ll be executing a turn transaction within the next few months. Our cash flow guidance assumes pricing and advance rates similar to our deals last fall but we believe that the environment could be slightly better.", "We expect our tax rate for the year to be 38% compared with 40% in 2009 reflecting certain corporate initiatives related to some Wyndham Exchange and Rentals non-US operations. In addition, we are making very good progress on the resolution of our legacy contingent liability for taxes related to periods prior to our separation. We are in active settlement discussions with the IRS and those discussions are progressing well. We expect any settlement to be within our reserve. We expect that the vast majority of this issue will be resolved no later than the third quarter and possibly before.", "We expect to spend $175 to $200 million in CapEx in hotel development advances. We expect spending for time share development to be between $120 and $130 million, somewhat higher than the $100 million we previously communicated and that\u2019s really based on the timing of our spend that we anticipated in 2009. We expect a diluted share count of approximately 189 million shares which assumes some share appreciation but no share buybacks. We expect earnings per share for the year to be between $1.48 and $1.69 per share.", "For the first quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.27 to $0.32 reflecting a RevPAR decline of between 10% and 13% and the absence of $31 million of EBITDA contribution related to deferred revenue.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Steve.", "Steve Holmes", "Before we open the line for questions I\u2019d like to make a few closing comments. The economic crisis of the past few years and the impact it has had on the hospitality industry caused Wyndham Worldwide and many other companies to make tough decisions on a number of fronts. As the crisis recedes and the economy recovers I feel very good about the decisions we made and the way we executed against our strategies. We are well positioned for continued success in our markets and we are transforming our business model to maximize free cash flow. In good times and in bad, free cash flow is the great enabler.", "Our strategic priorities for capital allocation are to invest prudently in our businesses and to return cash to shareholders. We announced a significant strategy today, tripling our dividend and resuming our share repurchase program, demonstrating confidence in our ability to maximize and sustain free cash flow in the $500 to $600 million range and our optimism regarding our businesses going forward.", "Most importantly, I\u2019m proud and pleased with how our associates have responded to the challenges of the past few years. In our business, it\u2019s all about the people. You can have a great strategy and a strong balance sheet but you need your people engaged, focused and enthusiastic to provide outstanding service to customers. Our most recent associate survey showed that they are more engaged and motivated than ever. They have a clear understanding of and commitment to our signature \u201cCount on Me\u201d customer service. This continues to be a significant source of competitive advantage for Wyndham Worldwide.", "I want to thank all of our associates for their hard work and commitment.", "With that, we will open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Steven Kent \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Steven Kent \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "My main questions are really on the ability to drive further increases in volume per guest on the timeshare business where you\u2019ve shown an impressive job of improving margins. As we look forward you mentioned that you have a number of strategies and I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more color. I guess my concern is that last year, in 2009 you were targeting more of your existing customers which inherently are higher margin and as you move forward and go through that customer list what are the other opportunities to continue to maintain that profitability and efficiency in the timeshare business.", "One other thing, could you talk about acquisition strategy and where you are on that part.", "Steve Holmes", "I\u2019ll take the first one first and talk about the VPG or efficiency increases at WVO and they really have put up some tremendous results and we\u2019re obviously looking and guiding towards even a greater improvement in 2010. I would focus probably on two things relative to continued improvement in VPG or volume per guest. ", "One is the marketing programs, we have continually innovated and been creative in our marketing programs at WVO and during the downturn that didn\u2019t take a break, we continued to be creative and we continued to work on ways to lever the Wyndham brand, to lever our ability to touch new consumers not just our existing consumers. ", "One aspect of it, I\u2019ve said this in the past, really marketing is so key for the process. We clearly have the best sales force in the industry but they need to have the tours generated for them and that\u2019s where the process starts. We\u2019re projecting tour flow down and part of the reason we\u2019re projecting that is that our marketing programs are even becoming more focused. We think we can generate the kind of revenue that we\u2019ve projected which is similar to 2009 with actually a lower level of tour flow, that\u2019s number one.", "Number two, when you get to the sales table you\u2019re then selling the project, whatever that product is. In our case it\u2019s a very, very flexible points based product. We talked about last year that we were rolling out a new program called Club Wyndham Access and that is the next generation or next transformation of the points based product we sell to consumer. It is even a better more flexible product than we\u2019ve sold for the last five years and so we do expect to be able to take that product to the table and have a positive impact on our close rate. ", "It may sound basic but it\u2019s really a function of really staying ahead of the game and ahead of the curve, having the best innovative product in the marketplace with the best marketing programs and then executing it on that very well. It may sound basic but I tell you, the guys down there are doing a phenomenal job in Orlando.", "On the acquisition front we\u2019ve continually said that we can\u2019t model opportunity for acquisitions. We don\u2019t know when the right opportunities will come up. We continue to look, we\u2019re looking at what I would call strategic tuck in acquisitions, things that fit our profile right now, and we\u2019re not looking to get into another line of business as we\u2019ve continually said. We\u2019ll have to see how they develop over time. We felt comfortable increasing our dividend and resuming our share repurchase program which we still think will leave us enough room for any strategic opportunities that are on the horizon.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Patrick Scholes \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Patrick Scholes \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Can you give an update on the progress that you\u2019re making on migrating RCI customers to book online? Second, can I get a little bit more color on the international RevPAR down 15.4%, it seemed a little bit weaker than I expected and weaker than what I\u2019d seen in some of the fourth Smith Travel Data? Could I get more color on what market that was?", "Steve Holmes", "Let me take the first one then Tom and I will tag team the second one. Our online penetration has been very positive in the RCI business specifically and thanks for the question because frankly we\u2019re very proud of what we\u2019ve done here. We really have modified the behavior of the RCI customer to expect more from us online and we\u2019re delivering more to them online. Its really a credit to the team at RCI that have gotten on this and made it a top priority over the last couple of years.", "We increased our penetration from about 13% in the fourth quarter 2008 to about a 24% penetration rate in 2009. That means that almost a quarter of the people who are doing transactions with us are doing them online. We think there\u2019s still great opportunity to grow that, we continually adding more functionality to RCI.com and as you may have heard me say in the rental business in Europe we\u2019re above 75% online. We\u2019ve got a long ways to go to get us to even a greater level of online transaction capability. We feel like we\u2019ve really made some great progress and set a great foundation with RCI.com.", "Tom Conforti", "I\u2019d only add that we\u2019re in a three year RCI.com development process. We\u2019re basically, in November completed a major upgrade. There are going to be two very significant upgrades in 2010. I think one in the spring and then one again I think in November, ballpark. Those upgrades we think will really push people to the web to a greater degree than we have now. We\u2019re pleased with the progress, we have more work ahead of us and our team is doing a phenomenal job executing behind a very difficult business transformation.", "Your second question had to do with some color around international markets. Two of our biggest markets are Canada and the UK. Canada was down significantly. China is our second biggest international market and China, as I said in my comments actually performed nicely in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s really the two markets of Canada and the UK that I think from a geographic perspective were the largest negative contributors to that 15%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joe\u00a0Greff \u2013 JP Morgan", "Joe\u00a0Greff \u2013 JP Morgan", "Can you talk about in timeshare the decline in the provision for loan losses? What\u2019s driving that and is it a function more that maybe your prior reserves were just too harsh or is it a function of actually collections history improving, explain if it\u2019s the latter what that is? Within the lodging segment if you can talk about churn expectations, what I mean by that is what do you think actually comes out of this system this year. I know you gave a net target number, I assume a net target number if you could clarify that? If you can talk about some of the things that you\u2019re doing to retain the properties that you want to retain.", "Steve Holmes", "On the loan loss provision, I haven\u2019t heard anybody call us harsh on anything in a while so maybe we were harsh on our loan loss provision. I don\u2019t think we were. I think were reacting frankly to the fact that we saw at the same the very systematic approach we take to determining what our loan loss provision should be. We respond to whatever we see as the trends at the time. There are some things that have happened during 2009 that certainly have improved the outlook for that portfolio. One is we\u2019ve continually talked about the fact that our FICO scores have been improving, that\u2019s FICO scores of new sales as well as the portfolio overall. Certainly that is a good dynamic to have.", "The second thing is that I think we really weathered the toughest part of the storm last year. We do not see the kind of trends that we saw at the end of 2008 or 2009 continuing today. That does not mean that it\u2019s easy to collect, it never is easy. People wait longer to pay, that\u2019s the general nature of the consumer right now. All the trends would tell us that we really have stabilized in that business and we hopefully will see some improvement going forward. We\u2019ll be monitoring that daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, as we always do.", "Tom Conforti", "The second question was on the hotel and how we reduced churn. Steve talked about a few strategies in his section that are all really geared at delivering; I think the term is more heads in beds, for our franchisees. The focus is going to be on enhancing our brand website because increasingly traffic is going through brand websites, ensuring that our connection with our OTAs is full and complete and that the proper level of business is going through OTAs to our sites. These are the key focus areas.", "We\u2019ve also established a dedicated group within our hotel team that, I don\u2019t know what the official name of it is; its objective is to ensure retention of those people we want to retain.", "Steve Holmes", "", "The retention czar.", "Tom Conforti", "", "We have a retention czar, the czar of retention. That group is focused on ensuring that we keep the people that we need to keep. One of the things that we do, do from time to time is arrange payment plans for our franchisee as a way to build cohesion between us and them as they deal with the difficult economic climate in 2009. Those are the major steps improving our web capability, our OTA relationships, and this dedicated group and then ensuring that we build cohesion through reasonable payment plan options we offer from time to time to our franchisees.", "Steve Holmes", "We\u2019ve got to continue to increase that value proposition for franchisees, it\u2019s a focus.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Woronka \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Chris Woronka \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "I was hoping maybe you could give us a little more color on the pipeline of the asset affiliation model. I understand it\u2019s really not probably going to have much of an impact on 2010 but maybe just the size and scope and how you\u2019re infrastructure there, what kind of size pipeline you can handle in the out years.", "Steve Holmes", "The pipeline for what we call WAAM (Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model) is strong. We have about 5,000 units that we\u2019re currently looking at, talking to people about, and are considering for adding to our system. Not all 5,000 of those will happen and there\u2019s a lot that we don\u2019t have on that list yet but probably will happen. ", "I would call the makeup of it pretty diverse, it\u2019s domestic as well as Caribbean. It\u2019s urban as well as golf, ski and beach. It\u2019s kind of a mix of everything. If I were to look at concentrations, there\u2019s a pretty good concentration in the US Southwest. There\u2019s also quite a bit of Florida product but there\u2019s also Caribbean product, there\u2019s product in the Northeast and in the Midwest. It\u2019s really a great array. ", "How do we bring that product on? It\u2019s a function of timing of where we think product would best fit into our system. If we find demand for urban product continues, which is something we\u2019re seeing right now, we\u2019re going to be more anxious to bring in some of that urban WAAM product into our system and make it available to our customers. We have a dedicated group working on this. It\u2019s really coming along very, very well. As I said, Myrtle Beach will be our first, that open sales this month and in a couple months we\u2019ll roll out our Orland product as well. Things are going on course.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research Associates", "Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research Associates", "Can you talk about whether there\u2019s a trade off between long term growth and between increasing your fee for service from 65% and that connection maybe you can give us an idea of where you think fee for service can go and when can you get there?", "Steve Holmes", "", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really a trade off, I think it\u2019s a key component of our growth strategy. The fee for service businesses were growing for the last three years just not as quickly as the vacation ownership business was growing. They were not being fed, frankly with as much capital as the vacation ownership business was being fed. We think there are great opportunities to grow the fee for service businesses.", "Even within vacation ownership there\u2019s a fee for service business within that that we\u2019re not pulling out here which is the resort management business, which is also growing. Year over year the resort management business grew from 2009 to 2010 whereas all other managed businesses including our own management company on the hotel side was now growing. There are elements of that business that we do want to talk about and highlight and we\u2019ll break that out into more detail so you can see it.", "We think it\u2019s really the place that we can continue to grow rapidly in all of our businesses; rental as well as our hotel franchise.", "Tom Conforti", "We\u2019re rationalizing our growth strategy. Our financial plan is simple, let\u2019s grow businesses that have great return profiles and that\u2019s why we\u2019re targeting the fee for service areas to grow; hotels and the exchange and rental. What we\u2019re trying to do in the timeshare business, vacation ownership business is really work to improve the return profile of that business. That\u2019s why we\u2019re managing our balance sheet more conscientiously and we are looking to evolve this alternative business structure. That\u2019s our simple layout of our financial strategy.", "Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research Associates", "Would you call the WAAM program a fee for service? Secondly, for these 5,000 units how many units do you need in the next couple of years?", "Tom Conforti", "", "Absolutely it\u2019s the ultimate fee for service business. It\u2019s structured in a certain way to highly fee for service oriented. If you do the quick math, it depends, it\u2019s going to be a hybrid, it\u2019s going to be some traditional timeshare units are going to be sold because we have three to four years of inventory in our balance sheet and we want to process our balance sheet. ", "There\u2019s going to be a mix of the traditional business that we\u2019re selling, the alternative business model, the WAAM business, the asset affiliation model. It all depends how big we can make that business. It\u2019s not an easy question to get. If we were only selling the alternative business model which we will not be, we would need to sell probably 1,000 to 1,500 units a year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ryan Meliker - Morgan Stanley", "Ryan Meliker - Morgan Stanley", "Thinking about what you said earlier with your breakdown of guidance by the different segments, looking at lodging in particular, it sounds like the system size up 1% to 3% and revenues of around $620 to $670 million. It sound like you\u2019re looking at implied RevPAR of down about 5% at the mid point. If my math is correct there, what do you think that\u2019s going to do to your franchisees, another 5% down in RevPAR when the costs have already been stripped out in terms of foreclosures and risk to property closures etc?", "Tom Conforti", "", "I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re getting the 5% down; our range is 0% to 3% on RevPAR.", "Ryan Meliker - Morgan Stanley", "Revenues are $620 to $670 million and system size is up 1% to 3%.", "Steve Holmes", "", "Our RevPAR guidance is flat to 3% down. We may have other revenues, initial franchise fees and other things in there that you\u2019re not taking into the mix.", "Ryan Meliker - Morgan Stanley", "In terms of the other revenues, how much are they going to be down are you expecting?", "Tom Conforti", "Let me go to your first question because you asked a question of even if its down 3% versus 5% it\u2019s a good question which is what is the impact on our franchisees. Obviously it\u2019s not good, we prefer to see RevPAR pick up at the beginning of the year immediately but the fact is we don\u2019t expect to see that. We\u2019re expecting a more gradual recovery than a quick snap back recovery, particularly in the economy and mid scale segments.", "The good news is that a 3% decline is lot less than a 12% decline. What they\u2019re seeing hopefully is an improving environment on a relative basis. It still is down but it\u2019s not down as much. Through the year we expect to see it improve so that the second half of the year is better than the first. I restated the facts there what we laid out before but we work very closely with our franchisees, we want to see their operations improve, its important to us. ", "We don\u2019t share in their bottom line but we absolutely want them to be successful and that\u2019s very important in a priority of ours. That\u2019s the reason that we\u2019re rolling out some of the initiatives we talked about which is to increase their ability to make sure that their property loaded into the system, in the OTAs, make sure their pricing is appropriate and help them with their yield management. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m specifically addressing your question but those are the kinds of things that we need to do to try to help the franchisees.", "Ryan Meliker - Morgan Stanley", "In terms of the other lodging revenues, what type of change are you expecting in 2010 versus 2009?", "Steve Holmes", "The initial fees we expect and the transfer fees we expect that its going to be relatively consistent with 2009.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Margo Happer", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO; and Tom Conforti, our CFO.", "Before we get started, I just want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking information that is subject to a number of risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These results are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K filed February 19, 2010, with the SEC.", "We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these measures to the comparable GAAP measures is provided in the tables to the press release and is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at wyndhamworldwide.com.", "Steve?", "Steve Holmes", "As you saw from the press release, we had a terrific quarter with each of the businesses performing at or ahead of plan. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.34 above the high end of our $0.27 to $0.32 range.", "Remember that we are comparing with first quarter 2009 which benefited from a roll in of $67 million of previously deferred vacation ownership revenues and approximately $31 million of associated EBITDA. Considering that headwind, first quarter 2009 comparisons are especially impressive. Excluding the 2009 roll in of deferred revenues and the favorable impact of foreign exchange, adjusted EBITDA increased by almost 20%.", "Our continued strong execution and the momentum of the business give us confidence to raise our revenue, EBITDA and EPS guidance for the year.", "Much of the upside is being driven by vacation ownership. As you know, beginning in the third quarter of 2008, we underwent a substantial restructuring to rightsize the vacation ownership business. We closed lower margin sales offices and cut less efficient marketing programs. Our focus is to optimize cash flow and efficiency rather than double-digit top-line growth.", "The magnitude of the change was driven by the upheaval in the capital markets and our desire to be masters of our destiny by reducing our reliance on the ABS market. But the strategic intent, which we outlined in late 2007, was driven by our desire to focus more investment in our fee-for-service businesses.", "The results are impressive. We had the best timeshare business in the world before the downturn, and the business we have today is even better. It's more profitable, more resilient, and it generates more cash. We have dramatically improved the quality of the consumer loans that we underwrite, resulting in a stronger portfolio. And we've made operational changes that simplify the accounting by eliminating the deferred revenue that make tracking the business difficult for some investors.", "On this exceptionally strong base, we are building an add-on business model that will further improve the return profile of the business. Combine this with our fantastic fee-for-service business models, and I think you'll agree that Wyndham Worldwide is well positioned for growth.", "In addition, the overall economy is clearly improving. The decline in RevPAR is moderating. And despite with the doomsday profits predicted, leisure travelers are active. The credit in ABS markets also continued to improve.", "Throughout the downturn, we've proved the resiliency of our business models as well as our ability to execute. And we are confident that we'll capture more than our fair share of the recovery.", "But we're more than a recovery story. We transformed our businesses to generate free cash flow in a sustainable range of $500 million to $600 million annually or about $3 per share per year. That's at least $2.5 billion of free cash flow over the next five years, and we are committed to using that cash to drive shareholder value.", "We will return a portion directly to shareholders through increased dividends, and we'll use the remainder to supplement our earnings per share growth by first investing in the businesses for organic growth; second, making acquisitions of fee-for-service businesses in our industries; and finally, repurchasing stock, which is already underway.", "Now I'd like to discuss the progress we're making in our strategic initiatives, starting with the Hotel Group. Our vision is to be the world's leading hotel company in size, customer value and performance. We believe that strong, well-supported brands and highly-motivated franchisees are a key to achieving our vision.", "As I mentioned last quarter, we are sharpening our focus on execution to take this business to the next level. Similar to our efforts to transform the Exchange business over the last few years with RCI.com, the Hotel Group is launching a series of strategic initiatives, which we refer collectively to as Apollo, with the goal of driving incremental revenue to our franchisees and strengthening the value of our brands.", "We will launch our first four missions in the near term, which involve: number one, improving the overall content of our hotel brands across all channels; number two, improving consumer conversion on our brand websites by enhancing navigation, content, rate availability and technology; three, enhancing and consolidating our reservation system; and four, optimizing rate information for our hotel owners through all distribution channels. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we proceed over the next 18 months.", "We're seeing substantial momentum in the Wyndham brand, gaining great traction, especially in critical major urban and key destination markets. Overall, we've increased the number of rooms by over 16%, adding 12 properties over the past year. We opened 1,115 Wyndham rooms in the first quarter.", "In addition, we recently signed an agreement for the 1,011-room Parc 55 Hotel in San Francisco, which converts today to a Wyndham Hotel. Located near Union Square, this hotel and other recent announcements signify a resurgent presence of the Wyndham brand in major center-city markets.", "The Wyndham Parc 55 recently completed a $30 million top-to-bottom renovation and redesigned that included upgrades for all guest rooms, a reconfiguration of the lobby and front desk and expansion of the hotel's meeting and events facilities to 30,000 square feet. We're thrilled to have this hotel in our Wyndham family.", "And on April 13, we opened a newly constructed 280-room Wyndham Hotel located on 26th Street in New York City.", "Internationally, we continued our expansion in Mexico with the opening of the 198-room Wyndham Casa Grande Monterrey and executed a three-hotel deal in China. Other notable international findings include four new Ramada franchise agreements in China, our fourth management agreement in Bangkok and four new Ramada franchise agreements in India.", "And we continue to in accolades here in the U.S. in the economy segment. Super 8 and Days Inn were recently named two of the top 10 most popular franchises on CNNMoney.com.", "Moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, the business continues to increase EBITDA through superior execution and the strength in the segment's two phenomenal business models. These models are characterized by great brands, strong distribution networks and significant market positions with loyal customer bases and high barriers to entry. From a financial perspective, these businesses are substantially fee-for-service revenue streams with modest capital requirements.", "Last month, I attended timeshare's annual convention known as the ARDA Conference. It was clear to me and I think to everyone there that RCI continues to be the leader in the timeshare exchange industry. Year-after-year, RCI proves its leadership by providing the most innovative technology, marketing and product solutions to both timeshare developers and consumers.", "The 2010 event was no exception. At ARDA, RCI further expanded its reputation as a technology leader with another first in the timeshare industry by announcing its debut into the mobile marketing world of two new apps, the RCI TV application and the RCI SnapBook application. Both are available for free download at the Apple app store.", "In addition, for the first time in its history, RCI launched a premium membership product, RCI Points Platinum, which will begin sales in June and has already attracted several large developers who have signed up to offer this to their existing owners. Priced as a premium to RCI Points, RCI Points Platinum will offer a plethora of lifestyle benefits, including last minute upgrades for larger units, along with a first look at specialty premium inventory.", "Coming off of a very successful 2009, RCI celebrated the affiliation of more than 100 resorts added last year, including a new affiliation agreement with Fiesta Hotel Group that welcomes five properties from the Grand Palladium Travel Club to RCI's global network and the affiliation of two resorts with SkiStar, one of the one of the Nordic region's strongest hospitality brands.", "Already this year, RCI renewed its 17-year affiliation and relationship with Hilton Grand Vacations, which includes 50 affiliated resorts and more than 150,000 members. And additionally, RCI renewed its affiliation with Bluegreen Vacations, which includes 45 affiliated resorts and more than 180,000 members.", "Last month, we announced RCI's newest agreement with InnSeason Resorts, one of the most world-known vacation brands in the New England with seven properties in the region. And just last week, RCI announced nine new resort affiliations across Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam at its 2010 Asia Leisure Real Estates Symposium where over 100 of RCI's Asian affiliates and industry leaders gathered to network and discuss growth opportunities within this important part of RCI's world.", "Our European rental businesses delivered solid results once again, supported by the newest member of the Wyndham Worldwide family of brands, Hoseasons, one of the U.K.'s most recognized holiday brands. We closed this strategic acquisition on March 1 and the integration is moving along on schedule and according to plan.", "Hoseasons is an excellent strategic fit with its fee-for-service model, strong U.K. brand presence and the additional skill that it provides to our U.K. cottage rental business. It offers a wide range of holiday offerings in over 15,000 lodges, cottages, villas, caravans and boats across seven European countries.", "The addition of Hoseasons to our existing portfolio of exceptional vacation brands expands our wide range of holiday rental expenses in Europe from caravans to castles.", "Turning to Wyndham vacation ownership who again had an extremely strong quarter with gross VOI sales of 10% and volume per guest up over 25%. As I discussed earlier, these results reflect the benefit of the transformational changes we've put in place over the last 18 months. The business is more efficient and has dramatically improved its cash flow profile.", "Our performance in 2009, which continued into the first quarter of this year, demonstrated the resiliency in this business model in difficult economic times, and I believe we've proven that it's a highly manageable, predictable business. So we are excited about the sound fundamentals of our business model in good times and in bad, and I'm confident that this business will continue to deliver superior results both in the short and the long term.", "We've spoken before about our new fee-for-service Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model or what we call WAAM. As a reminder, this model offers turnkey solutions for developers or banks in possession of newly developed, nearly completed or recently finished condo or hotel inventory. We will sell this unused or unsold inventory as timeshare points for a fee through our extensive distribution channels.", "WAAM enables us to expand our resort portfolio with little or no capital deployment, while providing additional channels for new owner acquisition and growth for our fee-for-service resort management business.", "As you may now, we began selling our first Wyndham asset affiliation product in Myrtle Beach in March, and sales are ahead of plan. The sales force is enthusiastic about the product offering and so are our customers.", "In fact, average transactions on these sales are running perfectly comparative to our traditional inventory, indicating a seamless transition into our product mix. In short, our customers describe the same value to new resorts enabled by Wyndham as those which we would otherwise develop in finance ourselves.", "We are building a solid runway to allow this part of the business to take off once we work through the bulk of the inventory on our balance sheet. With approximately three years of inventory on our balance sheet and with an additional investment of $100 million to $125 million each year over the next three years, we believe we have sufficient inventory for the next four to five years. At the end of that period, we would like to see the asset affiliation model contributing a meaningful portion of our timeshare revenue.", "Over the next five years, sales from the asset affiliation may augment growth somewhat, but would largely be a trade-off with the company-sourced inventory. It is at the end of the period when this inventory will provide its greatest benefit and that it would significantly alter the return profile of the business.", "Over the long term, we would expect EBITDA growth in vacation ownership in the mid-single digits with an improving return profile. Also, let me remind you that this will include opportunities to grow property management as it fits well with our fee-for-service strategy.", "Before I turn over the call over to our CFO, Tom Conforti, let me say how proud I am of our continued strong results, which demonstrate great business models and committed teams of talented individuals delivering superior execution. We will maintain our sharp focus on maximizing cash flow to drive shareholder value.", "We are about to enter our annual strategic planning process where we will be identifying many of the opportunities to grow the business both organically and inorganically. Since we've established quite clearly the sustainable cash profiles of business, our management team's focus now would be on how to best deploy that cash to maximize growth.", "I will give you additional perspective on our thoughts about growth and how you should expect a clear picture from us over the next three to six months.", "Now, I'll turn over the call over to Tom to go through our results and outlook in more detail.", "Tom Conforti", "Let me begin by echoing Steve's observations regarding the strong execution and ongoing transformation of our company. First quarter revenues and adjusted EBITDA were relatively flat, a significant achievement given the benefit in the first quarter 2009 from the roll in of deferred revenue and associated EBITDA in our vacation ownership business.", "Now I'm going to come back to detailed quarter results in a bit, but first I'd like to follow-up on Steve's point about our growth prospects. As Steve said on the last call, cash is the great enabler. So the critical, strategic question is, what effect will all this cash have on the growth profile of our company?", "We've been working through some hypothetical, what we believe, realistic per share growth scenarios for the next several years. We start with organic growth, which we project at mid-single digits. If we apply the available free cash flow to either share repurchase or acquisition of fee-for-service businesses, we find that the contribution to overall company growth is equal to or greater than the growth from our base business.", "The growth contribution above baseline growth we estimate could add approximately 700 basis points of growth, yielding overall growth of 12 to 15%. We will be working on solidifying our growth plan during our upcoming strategic planning process and will share our more detailed course with you in the upcoming months.", "So let's shift now to look at capital markets' activity in quarter one. We completed a number of transactions including refinancing some debt well ahead of schedule, locking in reasonable rates and pushing out some maturities. We believe these actions strengthened our balance sheet and improved our liquidity position in overall investment grade credit profile.", "We issued $250 of ten-year senior unsecured notes at a rate of 7.38%, and renewed our revolver at a level of $950 million. We were over seven times oversubscribed on the senior unsecured notes, demonstrating strong investor interest. And 18 banks participated in the revolver renewal, again, underscoring the banking community's confidence in our company.", "We used a portion of the senior notes proceeds to repay and terminate our Australian credit facility, with the remainder applied to retiring the $300 million term loan. Now the balance of the term loan was repaid with new revolver borrowings, and as a result, we ended the quarter with $199 million drawn on the new facility.", "We incurred early extinguishment fees of approximately $10 million after tax, and we expect to incur approximately $45 million pre-tax in additional interest expense annually as a result of these transactions.", "Our outstanding debt levels were unchanged. Our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio is three times. We have no significant near term maturities, we have abundant liquidity, and we have significant room under our covenants. Overall, we have an investment grade profile. ", "We also completed a term securitization transaction involving the issuance of $300 million of investment-grade asset-backed notes. The single A rated vacation ownership loan backed notes carries an advance rate of 72.25%, and a coupon of 4.48%, reflecting significant improvement in the asset-backed securities market over the past year, as well as Wyndham's elevated position in the market.", "Net cash from operations was approximately $205 million in the first quarter 2010, relatively flat compared to the first quarter of 2009.", "Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operations less CapEx, equity investments and development advances, increased over 7% to $166 million in the quarter compared with $155 million during the first quarter of 2009.", "Our transformational actions have put us solidly on track in our base business to sustain annual free cash flow of $500 million to $600 million over the next several years, excluding cash payments of course related to contingent tax liabilities. That's $2.65 to $3.17 per share this year.", "We believe that cash is the great enabler and will fuel our growth above and beyond the benefits of the economic recovery. As we look to acquire fee-for-service businesses in our core lodging and exchange and rental segments over time, our free cash flow target could be augmented in the future.", "In addition, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders. In the first quarter, we trebled our dividend. Our overall dividend policy calls for growth in the dividend to at least mirror earnings growth. And as you saw from the press release, we have resumed share repurchases at a pace consistent with our activity prior to the downturn, purchasing 1.2 million shares through April 27 at an average price of $25.10.", "Now moving to segment performance, let's begin with the hotel group. Revenue declined $10 million, reflecting moderating but continued pressure on RevPAR, which was partially offset in EBITDA by disciplined expense management.", "System wide RevPAR declined 6.8% compared with our first quarter guidance of 10% to 13% decline. Now in constant currency, RevPAR declined 8.7% compared to the first quarter. We are cautiously optimistic that we have seen the worse of the RevPAR declines.", "We ended the quarter with approximately 593,300 hotel rooms worldwide, opening over 9,300 rooms in the quarter and terminating approximately 13,700 rooms. Over 20% of the terminations, or 3,145 rooms were related to the exploration of a low-margin contract for ungranted affiliated rooms, which we chose not to renew.", "Now as we discussed on the last call, our ability to reach our long-term room growth rate of 2% to 4% requires that we make retaining the right rooms a top priority, and we are making progress in this area. We've implemented an early warning intervention program that routes termination notices to a special retention group, which has helped us reduce our attrition rate for the quarter.", "System growth trends are improving from last year's first quarter, and the pipeline is holding up well from the end of last year, with approximately 106,500 rooms. We saw an increase in new construction activity domestically in the first quarter, with 13 contract executions in 2010, compared with only eight during the same period in 2009.", "Overall, the new construction pipeline increased 4% based on rooms, since the end of 2009, with over 60% of the increase coming from the Wyndham brand, another indication of accelerating brand momentum. While we believe it's too early to call it a trend, these signs are nonetheless encouraging.", "Wyndham Exchange and Rentals once again delivered excellent results. For the quarter, excluding the net effect of foreign currency, revenue was flat, and adjusted EBITDA increased 3%, primarily reflecting Hoseasons March results, and continued cost reduction programs.", "Exchange revenues in the first quarter of 2010 were flat on a constant currency basis, and up two percent on a reported basis. Now prior to detailing these results, I must call your attention to a change in our Exchange and Rentals drivers, to better reflect revenues in the two pieces of our business.", "Specifically, RCI-member related rentals are now captured in the exchange drivers, whereas we used to include those revenues in the rental drivers. We believe this presentation better captures the full value of RCI members, and aligns with exchange peer practices. So with this realignment, our vacation rentals and average fee for vacation rental drivers will be focused on our European rentals business.", "Now looking at the drivers; the average number of members was consistent with the first quarter of 2009. Exchange revenue per member in constant currency was also flat compared with the first quarter of 2009, and up 4% on a reported basis.", "Higher exchange in member-related rental transaction fees were offset by lower exchange in rental transactions, subscription fees, and travel services. By the way, web penetration for rci.com was 29% in quarter one 2010, compared to 20% in the first quarter of 2009.", "Rental revenues in the first quarter were up 2% on a constant currency basis and up 9% on a reported basis. The acquisition of Hoseasons in March contributed $3 million of incremental revenues.", "Excluding the impact of the Hoseasons acquisition, transaction volumes in the first quarter of 2010 were consistent with the first quarter of 2009, reflecting higher volumes at our Novasol business, offset by a decline in volumes at our Landal GreenParks business.", "In constant currency, and excluding the impact of the Hoseasons acquisition, average net price per rental was up 1% in the first quarter of 2010, primarily reflecting a favorable impact of higher commissions on new properties added to our network in 2010 by our U.K. cottages business.", "Now moving to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, revenues were down 4%, and adjusted EBIDTA was up 4%, reflecting the absence of the previously mentioned roll-in of $67 million in deferred revenue. That was the benefit in 2009. This was substantially offset by exceptionally strong execution and performance in the business, resulting in a 71% increase in adjusted EBIDTA, excluding the 2009 deferred revenue benefit and restructuring from 2009 results.", "Close rates remain stable, and transaction sizes and pricing are strong. Tours were down 10% year-over-year, slightly better than planned, and VPG, which increased 25% significantly exceeded our plan.", "Our strong sales efficiencies reflect our ongoing focus on tour quality, as we continue to refine the database to target only the most qualified prospects as well as the efforts of the best sales team in the industry. It's important to note that we expect VPG growth to moderate as we move through the year and further adjust our tour mix to include greater frontline tour flow to support the long-term growth of the business. ", "Property management revenues increased 10%, and merely reflecting a higher number of managed units. Consumer finance revenues declined 4%, primarily reflecting a reduction in the size of our receivables portfolio, while consumer finance interest expense declined 25%, reflecting a decline in average borrowings and improved rates on our most recent securitization transactions.", "As you know, we're transforming this business and continuing to make great progress in terms of improving cash flow and our return profile. The percent of sales financed through the quarter averaged 54%, down from 58% a year ago, and 64% two years ago.", "On the consumer financing front, we saw significant improvement in the first quarter in write-offs, which declined to a rate of 2.8% of the overall portfolio from 3.4% during quarter 1 of 2009. Overall, delinquency and default rates in the portfolio continue to improve.", "Considering these and other factors, the provision for loan losses was $86 million, or 28% of gross realized sales, down from 31% on a similar basis from the first quarter 2009.", "And note, as we continue to write higher quality loans, and as the economy begins to stabilize, the earnings upside from lowering provisioning could be significant over the next 18 months. We gained approximately $8 million in full year EBITDA to every 100 basis point decline in the provision, as a percent of gross realized sales.", "Now turning to guidance, as Steve mentioned and as you saw from the press release, we're bringing up the bottom of our revenue guidance slightly with a new range of 3.6 to $3.9 billion. We've increased adjusted EBITDA guidance to 805 to $840 million, up from the previous guidance of 775 to 825.", "Adjusted interest expense based on the new capital structure is expected to be 135 to $145 million. And we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $1.56 to $1.71 per share.", "We expect diluted adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter of $0.38 to $0.42. Remember that second quarter 2009 results benefited from a roll-in of deferrred revenue of $37 million resulting in $17 millions of additional EBITDA.", "At the hotel group, our current desk view is that RevPAR could be flat or down slightly at the upper end of the guidance that we provided in February. Bear in mind that some of the immediate turnaround in industry RevPAR is through the luxury in upper upscale segments, which are typically the first to show positive growth coming out of the downturn.", "We primarily operate in the economy in mid-scale without food and beverage segments, which are historically more resilient in a declining RevPAR environment, but slow to improve in an increasing RevPAR environment.", "Travel patterns during spring break were encouraging, and if this trend carries over to the summer months when we derive 30% of our annual royalties, we are optimistic that we could se an improvement in our full year RevPAR performance. However, for now we are leaving hotel guidance unchanged.", "Exchange in rentals revenue and EBITDA guidance remain unchanged. However, we are updating the driver guidance based on the new methodology which moves RCI member related revenues to the exchange drivers, And the whole season's acquisition, which excluding the acquisition-related cost, will be accretive.", "Aside from these changes, our underlying assumptions for the business remain unchanged. Taking the methodology change and the acquisition into account, the new driver guidance is first in exchange. We expect the average number of members as well as exchange revenue per member to be flat", "However, in rentals, we expect transactions to increase 20% to 23%, and average net price for vacation rental to decrease 12% to 15%, primarily reflecting increased volumes at lower rental yields for our new Hoseasons business.", "As Steve mentioned, the guidance increase overall is due to strong vacation ownership performance, and we are upping our revenue guidance to $1.8 billion to $2 billion, and EBITDA guidance to $380 million $405 million. Tour guidance remains unchanged, and VPG guidance will be increased by 100 basis points to a range of 6% to 9% growth. We also expect continued improvements in the loan lost provision.", "Finally, we continue to make very good progress on the resolution of our legacy contingent liability for taxes related to periods prior to our separation from Cendant. We are in active settlement discussions with the IOS, and those discussions are progressing well. We expect any settlement to be within our reserve amount of $274 million, and the vast majority of this issue to be resolved no later than the third quarter and possibly before.", "With that, I'll turn the call back to Steve.", "Stephen Holmes", "Thanks, Tom. Before we open the line for questions, I would like to make a few concluding comments. Overall, this was a strong quarter across all three of our business units. We have robust business models, and our associates are executing our business strategies extraordinarily well.", "The economic environment is showing signs of improvement. In addition, we're seeing tangible evidence of the transformation of our business in the form of strong free cash-flow, which we're deploying to build shareholder value, both directly and indirectly.", "We have tripled our dividend and reactivated our share repurchase program. We will invest in our strong businesses to achieve strong organic growth, and we will look for acquisitions in our fee-for-service businesses that will fuel additional cash and more growth. And as Tom mentioned, we've raised our guidance. ", "In short, we're delivering on our commitments to shareholders, and we will continue to work hard to do so each and every day.", "With that, let's open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.", "Joe Greff - JPMorgan", "With respect to your outlook on vacation ownership, you mentioned you altered your loan loss provision outlook; I believe, quarter ago was 28% of growth sales. What is that going forward for the rest of the year? I know you mentioned 28% in 1Q.", "Tom Conforti", "I don't think we've guidance on loan loss provisions, Joe. And so we just see real positive signs and expect that that number will improve as we go through the next three quarters.", "Joe Greff - JPMorgan", "So if we look at the vacation ownership EBITDA guidance, the upside there is really coming from that. That I guess clarifies that it's entirely the additional upside. And then how much of that is WAAM contribution that you may not have had in the guidance before?", "Tom Conforti", "It's a mix of VPG increase and improvement in loan loss. One of the things that I think our company is seeing in our hotel business as an economy-scale brand that recovers a little slower than some of the upper upscale and luxury brands. But within our timeshare business, we have this loan loss provision as you know, Joe that is influenced by the direction of the economy.", "And as the economy improves and the ground beneath us gets more solid, then our belief is that the loan loss provision will improve. And we shared that for every 100-basis points of improvement in loan loss, its $8 million of EBITDA. So that's a big swing factor, and we're constantly assessing where we should be with that loan loss provision.", "Joseph Greff - JPMorgan", "And then Steve, talking about the Wyndham asset affiliation model, can you talk about how many additional deals beyond what you have at Myrtle Beach and Orlando or kind of in your WAAM pipeline?", "Steve Holmes", "Sure, Joe. There's a tremendous pipeline out there. We do a triage on the pipeline by determining where we would like product, what the quality of the product looks like, and the partner that we would be entering into, to know that they'd be able to provide financing to the end-consumer. We have dozens in the pipeline.", "I think this year it's probably safe to say that we'll probably see three of four more get executed. We may only start selling one or two more because we want to continue to work down our balance sheet. But there's a lot of product out there available.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank.", "Chris Woronka - Deutsche Bank", "Steve, I was hoping we'd talk a little bit about the time share business. And it looks like things are kind of getting better, maybe a little bit faster than you thought there. Are you guys operationally geared to handle that increased demand? I know you have the inventory, but do you have the sale for some things like that to accelerate things a little bit?", "Steve Holmes", "Well Chris, as we articulated before, our goal is not to ramp that business back up to a strong double-digit grower. We've done that before, we know we can do it, but what we're really managing that business for is to maximize cash flow and maximize efficiency. And that's why you see in the results for this quarter, 25% in volume (progress) is phenomenal.", "I mean the sales force did a remarkable job. Now between marketing and sales, they delivered more than we thought they could for the quarter.", "The first quarter is always a heavily in-house quarter because you don't have as many people out traveling for summer vacation. So you tend to see more in-house sales, and the over-exceed would be more easily achieved maybe in the first quarter versus let's say the third quarter, when you've got the summer months included. But we do not plan on ramping that business up back to double-digit growers.", "So to answer your question, we don't have the sales force sitting on the sidelines waiting to launch in. There's a lot of sales people out on the street, we could probably ramp that up. But that's not our goal. Our goal is to continue to improve the efficiency of the business and to produce cash flow. And on those two areas, that business is in A++.", "Chris Woronka - Deutsche Bank", "Then on the lodging kind of the Apollo program, can you just maybe share a few thoughts there in terms of will that mean more voluntary removal initially and then hopefully more units on the backend and what's your financial limit there? Is there any at all in terms of CapEx or investment in the brands?", "Steve Holmes", "Well, our financial commitment is to develop the backbone that will provide these additional features to the franchisees. So our commitment to it is complete. It's also within the numbers that we've guided people towards. We've been working on this project for some time, and now we're coming publicly. So it's been in the work. It's been in our planning. So within the CapEx numbers, we've shown you it includes the launch of our Apollo initiative this year.", "As to the franchise community, hopefully it'll increase the franchise community, because our value proposition will even be stronger to prospective franchisees as well as existing franchisees. This is not a process that will eliminate people. This is a process that hopefully will bring more in. And importantly, as Tom said I think in the last quarter, retention is key. We're very focused on increasing our retention rate. Keeping somebody on is easier than having to go on and find a new hotel.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with FBR Capital Markets.", "Patrick Scholes - FBR Capital Markets", "Now with the timeshare sales intentionally slowing, it looks like generally timeshare property management is becoming a larger part of that business. I'm wondering if you can give me a little color on what sort of margins that you're getting on that type of business and typically how long are your contracts for your timeshare property management.", "Steve Holmes", "Well, the contracts, they're not long, long-term contracts with the property management on the timeshare side like they are on the hotel side. The contracts can be one year. They can be three years. They can be five years. The key is though that we generally keep those contracts from year to year to year.", "There is very little loss rate in our contracts, none that I can think of recently, on the timeshare side. So the length of the contract is not as critical as the fact that we've got good relationships and good books for those properties. And some can go as long as 10 years, but they're generally shorter term. The other part of the question was the margin.", "Tom Conforti", "Patrick, this is the ultimate fee-for-service business. It's a cost-plus business. And so we basically take 10% or so above cost. So this is a business that is the type of business structurally that we love, no CapEx and it's a fee-for-service business, because we're providing the homeowners a service. And that's around 10%.", "Patrick Scholes - FBR Capital Markets", "Is that 10% margin that you're taking?", "Tom Conforti", "Yes, it's actually 10% markup.", "Patrick Scholes - FBR Capital Markets", "Okay, not margin, but markup, okay. And then just one other question. Just now that your balance sheet about three times and you're buying back some shares, what level of debt to EBITDA are you comfortable with?", "Steve Holmes", "We like where we are. We believe we already have an investment-grade profile, all measures, points of that. Internally, we like to keep it in the low-3s. And so when we reported that we're at three times adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, that's about where we'd like to be, maybe a little higher, but in that ballpark of 3 to low-3s.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Kent with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.", "Steve Kent - Goldman Sachs", "Tom, maybe you could talk to, or Steve talk to, this 700 basis points of increased growth in acquisitions and how do you that given the parameters of wanting to still buy back stock, still make them relatively small tuck-in acquisitions? How do you achieve that over the next couple of years, or maybe I misunderstood something?", "Tom Conforti", "Yes, Steve, I really wanted to specify these are per share growth targets. So we have the two levers. We basically did a reasonably simple exercise and said we're solidly brought into the fact that we're going to generate between $500 million and $600 million a year baseline in free cash flow. So the question is what do you do with the free cash flow?", "And so in one scenario, we made certain assumptions about share price appreciation and assumed that all of that cash would be used to buy back. This is again a hypothetical exercise. All of that cash would be used to buy back stock at various levels over the next five years. So we came out to sort of the incremental per share growth of x.", "And then we made an assumption that said if took all of that same cash flow and, as another side of the equation, we purchase EBITDA what we consider to be a reasonable target multiple, we came out with another growth number.", "Now the likely scenario is going to be a hybrid scenario where we buy back stocks and we buy EBITDA over time. And so we basically went through that exercise and came out with that number of around 700 basis points of growth on a per share basis.", "Steve Holmes", "It wasn't 700 basis points just for acquisitions.", "Steve Kent - Goldman Sachs", "So it's by using a combination of making some acquisitions, buying back stocks, that's how you got incremental 700 basis points more.", "Tom Conforti", "I think that's an important exercise to start, because we've spent last few months establishing the cash statement and now we're trying to translate that cash into what we're going to do with it. And initially, it was sort of a broad application of the cash that said about 700 basis points of growth on a per share basis would come about because of that.", "Steve Kent - Goldman Sachs", "Just one more thing on that issue of making acquisitions, I always struggle with this because your multiple is 7 times or so 2011, which is a reasonably low multiple. So how do you make accretive acquisitions if you are trading at 7?", "Steve Holmes", "I couldn't agree with you more that 7 or below multiple, Steve, so I appreciate you saying that. The fact is though that we make acquisitions and we make them better by our business model. So for example, the Hoseasons transaction may have appeared to be based to what they were earning, higher multiple.", "But in our hand, it ended up being an accretive deal because of the synergies and the infrastructure that we can bring to bear. And that is frankly how we have done a lot of our deals over the years, whether it was Hawthorn Suites or Microtel. We've continually brought in deals and made them better by our management, our infrastructure.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And at this time, I'm showing no further questions. I'll turn the call back over to Steve Holmes.", "Steve Holmes", "Okay. Well, thank you very much everyone for spending time with us this morning and have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin.", "Margo Happer", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO; and Tom Conforti, our CFO.", "Before we get started, I want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking information that are subject to a number of risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-Q filed October 28, 2010, with the SEC.", "We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these measures to the comparable GAAP measure is provided in the table to the press release and is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at wyndhamworldwide.com. Steve?", "Stephen Holmes", "Thank you, Margo. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We ended the year a high note with fourth quarter adjusted EPS coming in $0.02 ahead of the top end of our guidance range. For the year, excluding the benefit of deferred revenues we had in the 2009, revenues increased 8% and adjusted EBITDA increased 17%, demonstrating continued strong execution across our businesses.", "2010 was a great year at Wyndham Worldwide. We generated $603 million in free cash flow just above the top end of our range. We used that cash to both grow our businesses and return capital to shareholders. ", "A year ago, we tripled our dividend, and today, we announced another 25% increase, reflecting the real growth of our businesses, our confidence in the future and our continued commitment to return cash to shareholders.", "In 2010, we utilized $237 million to repurchase approximately 9.3 million shares of our common stock. We used another $212 million to repurchase approximately 50% of our convertible notes and related warrants, reducing current and potential future share dilution. And we invested $232 million in our businesses before acquisitions for Fee-for-Service businesses that will drive higher EBITDA and cash flow for years to come.", "So for those keeping score, we returned 42% of our available cash flow to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases, 30% to acquire complementary businesses to fuel future growth and 28% to retired convertible debt.", "On the operating front, each of our three business units exceeded its 2010 plan and made significant progress towards its strategic goals. At Wyndham Vacation Ownership, we drove VPG to new levels and launched our Asset Affiliation Model, signing three deals and generating sales ahead of our expectations.", "In our Exchange and Rental business, we enhanced our leadership position in service rentals with three terrific acquisitions. RCI signed 74 new long-term affiliations and renewed its affiliation with the Disney Vacation Club in a multi-year agreement. Also in exchange, we achieved 29% online Web share, more than doubling our online shares since we began our initiative to enhance RCI.com in 2008. To capture similar success in our Lodging business, we launched the Apollo initiative, which will improve our value proposition to franchisees and consumers and enable us to capture incremental RevPAR and room growth. ", "I'll bring you up-to-date on the most recent achievements in a moment, but first, let me spend a minute on what we're seeing across our businesses and around the world. In general, we continue to see signs of gradual economic recovery. In Lodging, the outlook in the hotel owner community has significantly improved, and we expect asset trading to increase in 2011 as the credit markets continue to improve. The RevPAR rebound that we experienced in the U.S. in 2010 continues to gain momentum globally. ", "Our European Rentals business was also off to a great start in 2011. We believe the significant decline in unemployment in Germany and pent-up demand from December's inclement weather are two contributing factors supporting broad demand, as evidenced by a year-over-year increase of 11% in rental volume, excluding the acquisitions that we made in January of 2011.", "RCI recently held its annual affiliate event in New York. The event brought together more than 55 Timeshare developers and industry leaders to celebrate a year of collaboration and success and to learn more about how RCI can continue to help their businesses.", "While credit markets for Timeshare developers are still in the recovery process, sentiment among the developers who attended the event was markedly positive. Of course, nowhere is the health of the Timeshare industry more evident than at Wyndham Vacation Ownership, where we ended the year with adjusted EBITDA of 32% above 2009, excluding the impact of deferred revenue. So against that backdrop of improving economic conditions, we're focused on ensuring we capture more than our fair share of the recovery and that we continue to fuel our growth for many years to come. ", "Today, I want to discuss four themes that will help ensure we achieve these goals: First, our emphasis on innovation; second, rebound single portfolio towards Fee-for-Service businesses; third, expanding brand presence; and finally, our customer service and associates engagement culture.", "First, let's discuss innovation, a central theme here at Wyndham Worldwide. We're deploying technology in new and creative ways to provide more innovative interfaces and service delivery for business partners and consumers. As you know, RCI has been leading the way on this front and in November, we implemented our most significant technology upgrade ever. These enhancements give members the ability to combine deposits to trade up and to receive change back from an exchange when the trading power of their Timeshare is greater than the trading power of the Timeshare they're trading into.", "These are transformational changes in the vacation exchange industry. We went live with these improvements in November, on schedule and without a hitch.", "Member and affiliate response has been positive. Members love the ability to combine deposits and receive change back and they view these options as fair and member-friendly. Through January, over 75% of exchange transactions resulted in members receiving change back that they can use for future exchanges and approximately 10% of exchange transactions resulted from combined deposits, meaning members were able to exchange into a better unit by combining the Timeshare that they owned.", "The Hotel Group is also leveraging innovative technology to enhance the customer experience. As part of our Apollo initiative, during the fourth quarter, we launched enhanced outsell, which enabled cross selling functionality for all brands across all Wyndham Hotel Group websites. We are also upgrading all of our brand websites. We recently completed test designs for Baymont, Super 8, Days Inn and the Ramada and are in the process of soliciting content from over 6,000 franchisee sites. We expect to launch these sites with mobile website functionality in the summer of 2011 and will follow shortly, thereafter, with the remainder of our brands. ", "Our focus on innovation extends beyond technology to product development as evidenced by the significant process we've made with our Asset Affiliation Model at Wyndham Vacation Ownership. We also introduced product innovations in our RCI business with our premium membership product, RCI Points Platinum, which offers many benefits including opportunities for last-minute upgrades and priority viewing of specialty inventory.", "Next, let me share the progress we've made on rebounds in our portfolio to emphasize Fee-for-Service businesses. Last month, we announced our third WAAM deal at Smuggler's Notch near Stowe, Vermont. Smuggler's Notch is consistently recognized as a top-rated destination for family-friendly vacations. This affiliation aligns with our business model providing vacation experiences for families, facilitates our expansion in New England and provides our owners with another world-class vacation property. And today, we're announcing our fourth WAAM deal at Emerald Grande in Destin, Florida, which adds yet another world-class luxury resort on Florida's Gulf Coast through our Vacation Ownership. The four deals we've announced in the last 12 months including our option to take additional units within these resorts would provide enough inventory to meet our current WAAM target of 15% to 20% of gross vacation ownership sales over the next five years. As importantly, in addition to executing our Fee-for-Service model, these are brand-enhancing product additions, adding valuable infrastructure in important geographic locations to our portfolio.", "As I mentioned earlier, we also successfully completed four acquisitions of Fee-for-Service businesses in 2010. Hoseasons added meaningful inventory to our highly successful U.K. Vacational business. The Tryp brand was a tuck-in opportunity for the Wyndham Hotel Group that significantly enhanced our international presence. The third, ResortQuest, is serving us our platform to enter the U.S. full-service vacation rentals business, which is estimated to be a $10 billion-industry. ", "And in late November, we added James Villa Holidays, a leading and highly recognized brand in the U.K. to Mediterranean villa holiday market for consumers and property owners. James Villa Holidays is second only to Hoseasons in customer and consumer awareness in the U.K. self-catering category. With the addition of approximately 2,300 properties and an excellent reputation, the acquisition gives us geographic and product expansion, growth opportunities in Europe. It provides scale in Spain and Portugal and gives us good representation in Greece. We're happy to welcome James Villa Holidays to the Wyndham Worldwide family. This brings me to our third focus area: expanding brand presence.", "A key goal of ours has been to continue to grow the Wyndham Hotels and Resort brand. Wyndham brand openings were up over 60% in 2010. In the fourth quarter, we opened over 2,000 rooms, reflecting property additions in Orlando, Chicago, Baltimore and Hawaii, as well as international openings, including Los Cabos, Mexico; Panama City, Panama and Surfer's Paradise down in Australia.", "Wyndham Hotel Group has always been focused on growing its system and increasing overall revenues through brand affiliations. These arrangements allow us to increase our overall presence with little or no capital investments. Last quarter, I told you about our alliance with Planet Hollywood. And just last month, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Chatwal Hotels & Resorts to franchise and manage its Dream and Night boutique hotel brands globally. We will position the Dream brand as a full-service lifestyle brand for gateway cities and resort destinations and the Night brand as an affordable chic full-service or limited-service hotel in primary and secondary markets. Adding these complementary brands to Wyndham Hotel Group's portfolio supports our objective of meeting guest needs with our hotel product for every kind of traveler. ", "Of course, innovation and the best products in the world are meaningless without a base of loyal customers and a team of engaged employees. So let me conclude by spending a few moments on our culture. Our Count On Me! service culture and associate engagement are central to everything we do. Wyndham Worldwide\u2019s culture, family-friendly benefits and programs earned us a spot on the highly regarded Working Mother's magazine 100 Best Companies list. Several of our offices including Mexico City, Indianapolis, Orlando, Las Vegas and the New Jersey office here received prestigious 2010 Best Places to Work Awards. In recent, Landal GreenParks was named the most customer-friendly company in the Netherlands based on ratings by the Dutch public. Landal was invited to ring the opening bell on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, an incredible and well-deserved honor and a great example of the power of our associates living Wyndham Worldwide's Count on Me! values every day.", "Before turning the call over to Tom, I'd like to note that excluding the tax benefit we enjoyed in 2010, which were a positive for us in 2010, our guidance this year reflects approximately a 15% EPS growth, which is at the top end of our guidance range. This EPS growth does not assume the application of any free cash flow in 2011 to reduce our shares outstanding. We expect continued improvement in the fundamentals of each of our businesses. And we have great confidence in Wyndham Worldwide's near and long-term prospects. ", "And now I'll turn it over to Tom to review the financials. Tom?", "Thomas Conforti", "Thank you, Steve. The fourth quarter was another strong quarter with earnings coming in $0.02 above the top end of our guidance range. In constant dollars and excluding the benefit of deferred revenues in the 2009, adjusted EBITDA increased 11%, reflecting double-digit RevPAR growth and strengthen our Vacation Ownership business. In addition, our earnings per share benefited from a lower effective tax rate and lower interest expense, partially due to a reduction of value-added tax accruals. ", "Our adjusted results exclude a $9 million pretax charge predominantly related to the elimination of RCI activity in our call center in St. John, Canada. This structural cost reduction is the result of ongoing success in moving more transactions to the Web for our RCI Exchange business.", "We expect another charge of approximately $2 million in the second quarter of 2011 related to RCI exiting this center. And we anticipate approximately $9 million in annual cost savings as a result of the restructuring beginning in 2012. Also excluded from adjusted EBITDA is the $3 million pretax loss associated with the repurchase of an additional 10% of our convertible notes and related warrants in the fourth quarter of 2010. ", "Now, as you know, the convertible bond structure, which includes warrants, generates dilution for share prices above $20. Today, we have repurchased approximately 50% of the notes and this morning, we announced the tender offer for the remaining notes. Following the tender offer, retirement of the warrants could reduce what we believe will be significant future dilution. At year end, share dilution associated with the warrants was approximately 3 million shares.", "Free cash flow increased over 11% to $603 million for the full year compared with $541 million for 2009. And just as a reminder, we define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less CapEx, equity investments and development advances, and excluding the cash payment related to contingent IRS tax liabilities.", "We believe that cash is the great enabler of our long-term business goals and that our sustainable annual free cash flow was $600 million to $700 million will accelerate our EPS growth and enhance shareholder value by supporting further investment in the business, paying dividends and through share repurchase.", "As Steve said, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. Consistent with the dividend policy we established last year, which was to grow our dividend at least in line with earnings. The Board of Directors has authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share, approximately a 28% payout at the midpoint of our 2011 net income guidance range.", "Now, this growth approximates what we believe was our true underlying growth in 2010, adjusting for deferred revenues in 2009 and the extraordinary tax benefits we achieved last year. ", "Now, we also continue to repurchase shares. From the reinstatement of our program last February through yesterday, we have bought 9.7 million shares at an average price of $25.71 a share. We have $246 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. ", "Now moving to operating performance for the quarter. Let's begin the segment review with the Wyndham Hotel Group. Revenues were up 9%, EBITDA increased 25% and margins improved over 300 basis points. This reflected higher RevPAR and corresponding royalty fees, lower bad debt expense and the absence of a $6 million asset impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2009.", "As Steve mentioned earlier, RevPAR recovery has been strong across the globe. Systemwide RevPAR increased over 10% in the fourth quarter. In the U.S., RevPAR improved 8% versus a year ago with the vast majority coming from occupancy gain. In constant currency, RevPAR in China and the U.K. grew 18% and 13%, respectively. These three countries represent 84% of our total system. ", "Excluding the Tryp acquisition, we opened over 54,000 rooms in 2010 and terminated approximately 52,000. Now apart from the 3,145 rooms related to the expiration of a low-margin contract for unbranded, affiliated room, which we chose not to review in the first quarter of 2010, we estimate that approximately half of the terminated rooms were due to financial difficulties for our franchisees. We expect these types of terminations to moderate over time as the economy continues to recover. In general, retaining our strong franchisees remains a key priority for our Lodging business. ", "In the fourth quarter, we opened nearly 19,000 rooms. The franchise sales team did a great job of replenishing the pipeline, which approximated 103,000 rooms at year end. For the year, contract signings were up 9% compared with last year and we executed 363 conversion deals compared with 308 in the 2009, an 18% increase. On the new construction front, the international pipeline increased. However, the tight credit markets continued to suppress the domestic pipeline for new construction.", "Wyndham Exchange & Rentals had a strong year in delivering their financial results, as expected, while completing three separate acquisitions. Revenue in constant currency was up 12% in the fourth quarter, reflecting the acquisitions of Hoseasons, ResortQuest and James Villa Holidays, which contributed $21 million in incremental revenues, as well as higher rental revenues in our Novasol and Landal GreenParks businesses. ", "Adjusted EBITDA decreased 13% in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting the seasonal effects on profits from the three acquisitions, which incurred costs that exceeded revenues by $6 million. Now excluding the impacts from these acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA for WER was flat. Windham Exchange and Rentals performance drivers were consistent with our expectations. The average number of exchange members and exchange revenue per member were relatively flat. Vacation rental transactions were up and average net price per vacation rental was down, primarily reflecting the effects of the acquisitions. ", "Steve mentioned our progress in migrating transactions to the web at RCI. Since the launch of this initiative in 2008, we have captured approximately 130 basis points of margin improvement in the Wyndham Exchange & Rentals business segments. We expect another approximately 120 basis points over the next four years as we continue our technology and program enhancement initiatives. Remember, however, that the impact of this improvement may be obscured a bit in the overall segment performance due to a make shift taking place with our lower margin Rentals businesses, growing more rapidly than the RCI Exchange business.", "Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business once again delivered outstanding results. Revenues and EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 8% and 19%, respectively, excluding the fourth quarter 2009 benefits associated with deferred revenue roll-in.", "These increases reflect strong execution in the business with volume per guests and tours in line with expectations, and tours considerably better than the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter 2010 results also reflected a lower provision for loan losses and higher EBITDA from consumer finance operations. We made good progress in building our pool of lifetime buyers of Vacation Ownership, with over 22,000 new owners being added in 2010. Within WVO, our recurring Fee-for-Service Property Management business, increased revenue 6% in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting an increase in the number of managed units.", "Consumer finance revenues were down approximately 2%, due to a decline in our contract receivable portfolio, while interest expense declined 32%, reflecting lower interest rates on our securitized debt. Delinquency and default rates in the portfolio continue to improve. Write-offs during the fourth quarter declined to 2.51% of the overall portfolio from 3% in the fourth quarter of 2009. The provision for loan losses was $82 million or 22.8% of gross VOI sales net of WAAM sales, down from 26.4% in the fourth quarter of 2009.", "Now posted on our investor website is the comprehensive presentation that highlights the terrific attributes of our Vacation Ownership business, the significant improvements we've made to this business over the past few years and the strength of our asset-like, go-forward business model. In the coming months, you'll be happy to hear that WVO management team will be meeting with the financial community, so you can hear from them firsthand, why we continue be so excited about this business.", "Moving to corporate expenses briefly. Excluding legacy-related items, corporate expenses were up, primarily reflecting foreign exchange, increased data security and IT expenses and tax consulting charges. Now information security enhancements will continue to be an important spending priority for us in 2011 as we face, like many other companies, an increasingly aggressive threat from hackers.", "Our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 27%, reflecting the tax credits we discussed last quarter.", "Now let's turn to 2011 guidance. We'll post the full guidance including cash flow details to our Investor Relations website following the call. To give you the  highlights, revenue guidance remains between $4 billion and $4.2 billion, up 5% to 9% from 2010 and EBITDA guidance is $925 million to $955 million, up 8% to 11% from 2010. Also, we expect annual free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million in 2011 and beyond. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we estimate that the effect of that cash properly deployed, could meaningfully increase our baseline EBITDA and earnings growth on a per share basis.", "Now let's look at each business unit starting with our Hotel group. We expect RevPAR growth to be up 5% to 7% and a 1% to 3% increase in system size. We expect revenues to be between $675 million to $725 million and EBITDA in the range of $200 million and $250 million.", "Moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. Drivers are expected to be up slightly for our Exchange business and significantly higher for our Rentals business. Specifically, in exchange, we expect the average number of members to be flat and exchange revenue per member to be up 1% to 3%, reflecting higher transaction pricing and other member-related revenue.", "In rentals, we expect transactions to be up 18% to 20%, and average net price per vacation rental to increased 18% to 20%, reflecting our recent acquisitions. Now, based on these drivers, we expect Wyndham Exchange and Rentals revenue of $1.375 billion and $1.475 billion and EBITDA of $325 million to $345 million.", "At Wyndham Vacation Ownership, remember that we are concentrating on cash flow generation and a return profile of this business. So based on those objectives, we expect growth VOI sales to be up slightly from 2010 to $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, which includes, by the way,  approximately $150 million in gross WAAM sales. We expected 2% to 5% increase in Tours as we target more new owners and a 2% to 5% increase in volume per guest. We expect total segment revenues of between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion and EBITDA of $470 million to $500 million in 2011.", "Now based on the improvements we've made to credit standards and the improved performance of the portfolio, we are projecting that the provision for loan losses will continue to decline modestly in 2011 to approximately 22% of gross VOI sales, excluding WAAM sales. We expect corporate expenses for the year of approximately $75 million to $85 million, primarily reflecting continued investment in information, security and IT, in general.", "We expect depreciation and amortization to be between $180 million and $190 million, somewhat higher than 2010, reflecting the recent acquisitions and our technology upgrades at Wyndham Exchange and Rentals.", "We expect interest expense of approximately $135 million to $145 million reflecting our current debt levels. Now remember our intention is to maintain a stable leverage ratio, which means we will likely add debt as we increase EBITDA.", "In addition, we expect some charges for the early extinguishment of debt related to the convert tender that I mentioned earlier. These charges are excluded from our guidance and will be excluded from our adjusted results. ", "We expect our effective tax rate for the year to be 39% compared with 34% in 2010. Now remember, the 2010 tax rate was lower due to the benefits from the utilization of multiple years of foreign tax credits.", "We expect to spend $200 million to $225 million in CapEx and hotel development advancements. This is in higher than the recent years, reflecting approximately $50 million to complete the Bonnet Creek hotel near Walt Disney World. However, we expect spending for Timeshare inventory to be between $80 million and $90 million, a significant reduction from the $130 million we spent in 2010. ", "We expect earnings per share for the year of $2.05 to $2.15 with a diluted share count of approximately 181 million shares, which assumes no share buybacks. This translates to approximately 15% EPS growth at the top end of our guidance range, excluding the tax benefit in 2010. Finally, for the first quarter, we expect earnings per share of between $0.37 and $0.41 per share. ", "So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve.", "Stephen Holmes", "Thanks, Tom. While Wyndham Worldwide solid results for the fourth quarter and 2010 reflect the strength of our business model and our team's exceptional execution throughout the company, although the general economic environment is improving, the degree of recovery still remains somewhat uncertain. Nevertheless, we are very confident about our near-term and long-term prospects. We aim to continue to deliver strong results and cash flow and to generate substantial shareholder value. ", "And now, Caroline, we'll take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Lafleur from Hudson Securities.", "Robert LaFleur - Hudson Securities Inc.", "I was wondering if you could, Steve or Tom, give us your thoughts about the Cerberus acquisition of Silverleaf and what sort of the valuation implications are for the Timeshare industry as well as your niche of it? And then also sort of related, if you could update us on your longer-term capital or plan for finding capital partners in your Timeshare business sort of beyond what you're doing currently now with WAAM?", "Stephen Holmes", "I actually we saw your note that went out yesterday on that transaction, maybe the day before. We think it's a great deal for the Timeshare industry. There have been quite a few smart money players who have entered this industry over the last 12 months and we expect that to continue. The business performs exceedingly well even during downtime. So I think people have seen the resiliency of the business, so we're seeing new investors come into the market. We're also seeing investors looking to lend money in this marketplace who are new entrants into the market. So overall, this is very good. With respect to the value, I looked at what you did. We've got a calculation that probably shows the multiple as a little bit higher, but I don't know their business well enough, frankly, to be able to comment on it. It's a great company. It's a terrific customer of RCI and we're very happy for the team there.", "Thomas Conforti", "And then the second question, Bob, was on WAAM?", "Robert LaFleur - Hudson Securities Inc.", "Actually you've talked in the past about your desire to find longer-term capital partners in the Timeshare business sort of beyond when WAAM runs its course in the distressed inventory sort of works its way through the system.", "Stephen Holmes", "Sure. Well, I think we may have called that a programmatic approach in the past. Well, one of the things that we're doing and I did mention it briefly in the script is, we are entering into option agreements with the people that we've cut deals with so far in the four groups, not everybody, but most of them, actually, where we can either -- we have the option to either purchase more or actually have them develop more for us at a set cost. So we do have, as I said, with those options about five years worth of product already lined up for us and so we think that's a part of it. We may still look for a programmatic partner to be a non-developer who buys inventory as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, but the economics are going to have to be right for us on that.", "Thomas Conforti", "Yes. Bob, we said, we were going to target 15% to 20% of our sales coming from the business. As I said in my comment, or I think Steve said in his, with the takedown of the options, we've already reached those targets. We have to think sort of incrementally about where we go from here, I think to Steve's point. And as great opportunities present themselves, we'll definitely be open minded to it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Greff from JPMorgan.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Steve, the free cash flow guidance is $600 million to $700 million for this year and I think your comment was that's also a sustainable growth rate beyond, what get's you this year to $700 million versus $600 million? What happens within the business from a working capital perspective? If you can help me understand that, that will be great.", "Stephen Holmes", "Obviously, we exceeded the top end of our $500 million to $600 million range this year that we have originally put in place. And we always love to be at the top end of all of our ranges and exceed them if possible. Getting to the $600 million to $700 million, it requires good working capital management and that's something that the company is very focused on. As you know, we put in place a program for focusing everyone on cash flow this past year and it will continue to be a focal point. And I think the other kind of the basic or fundamental thing is just pushing EBITDA growth and getting the fundamental to grow. If we can grow EBITDA, that's going to fall down to our cash flow.", "Thomas Conforti", "Joe, besides EBITDA and working capital, this year, we are incurring a slightly higher CapEx number because of the development of the Bonnet Creek Hotel outside of Walt Disney World. And so, if we had a more normalized year in CapEx, we\u2019d probably be closer to the $700 million than the $600 million, but also -- and I think we did this in part purposely, we also have lower investment spending over at WVO for inventory. So that probably be another way that we could squeak out another $20 million to $30 million of free cash flow if we sort of had a normalized CapEx year probably.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then looking at the fourth quarter at Vacation Ownership, what percentage of buyers were new buyers?", "Thomas Conforti", "I think we added about 5,000 new owners in the fourth quarter. The full-year number was close to 22,000.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then final question on Vacation Ownership. In the fourth quarter, the loan loss reserve was, as a percentage of gross VOI sales, was percentage-wise higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. Can you give us help understand that, that geography? Is that customer mix? Is that something else going on? Can you help us understand that?", "Thomas Conforti", "Yes, Joe, I think it's been a fact here historically and I don't have enough historical perspective on it. But I think it's been a factor. I've been educated to understand that in the fourth quarter, because of seasonality considerations that we've always kind of picked it up just a bit incrementally. And so in spite of the fact that there are very positive trends on default rates and such, I think that's a practice that history is born out into the right way to reserve for potential loan loss.", "Stephen Holmes", "And Joe, I wouldn't interpret it as anything changing direction and the momentum that we've seen in improvement there.", "Operator", "Our next question or comment comes from Chris Woronka from Deutsche Bank.", "Chris Woronka - Deutsche Bank AG", "Can we get a little bit more color on the impact that your acquisitions, WER had on the margins in the fourth quarter in terms of seasonality? Is what you acquired this year look a little bit different from a margin perspective in the fourth quarter relative to the legacy stuff?", "Thomas Conforti", "Yes, absolutely. There is a huge seasonality factor and our ResortQuest business is -- of the three businesses that we've bought in WER, the ResortQuest business has the most significant seasonality component to it and so of that $6 million loss we had for the quarter, ResortQuest is a large percentage of that, almost 70% of it. And that just has to do with the seasonal nature of the business, Chris, but it's a business that generates EBITDA. It just doesn't generate it in the fourth quarter.", "Chris Woronka - Deutsche Bank AG", "And just in terms of your thinking about acquisitions this year, is there any kind of implicit change in your priorities? You did a lot on the E&R side last year. I know you expect generally more transactional activity in Lodging, I mean, should we read anything through to that in terms of your priorities or is it still everything kind of gets a look on its own?", "Stephen Holmes", "No, Chris, the priorities remain the same. The ability to execute transaction is really a function of what's out in the marketplace, do we have a willing partner to come to a deal, to close a deal. And so it's -- but our priorities have not changed.", "Operator", "Our next question or comment comes from Amanda Bryant from Susquehanna.", "Amanda Bryant - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Given your adjusted EBITDA guidance of about a 9% growth in 2011 at the midpoint, how much of that is attributable to your four acquisitions that you completed in 2010 versus your Legacy businesses? That will be my first question and my second question would be on your reported RevPAR growth of 10% in the fourth quarter. Is that on a constant-currency basis or is that on an as-reported basis?", "Thomas Conforti", "So your question about the incremental contribution of acquisitions, we haven't given specific mention of numbers on...", "Stephen Holmes", "It's not a large amount for 2011. It's probably less than 2% of our overall EBITDA.", "Amanda Bryant - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Overall growth?", "Stephen Holmes", "Not overall growth, overall EBITDA. Less than 2%, a very small portion of the overall growth.", "Amanda Bryant - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "And then on the RevPAR? On the 10% growth in the fourth quarter, was that in constant currency or on an as-reported basis?", "Thomas Conforti", "Constant currency, yes.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question or comment comes from Steven Kent from Goldman Sachs.", "Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Could you just give a little bit more color on the margins in the Lodging and Vacation Exchange Rental business in the quarter? As you move more and more to Web bookings, I guess I thought I would see higher margins start to come about. So could you just talk about that, sort of where you are in that process?", "Thomas Conforti", "So on Lodging, we had a dramatic margin improvement for the quarter, largely associated with RevPAR, but also some other impairment that we didn't take in the fourth quarter that we took in the fourth quarter of 2009, and some bad debt stuff that went our way. So at WHG, the margin story in the fourth quarter or the Hotel Group was really very positive.", "At WER, we have two, sort of, macro factors at work here. We have the positive incremental movement and margin improvement in our Exchange business because of this movement to the Web and our announcement today of restructuring in our call center in Canada will yield a structural improvement, further structural improvement in margins and our Exchange business. The issue is, there are two factors that are offsetting that somewhat. Factor number one is that the Rental business just has lower margins than the Exchange business and the Rentals business will grow faster especially with the aid of acquisition than the Exchange business. But there's a second factor related to Rental and it's a seasonal factor and that is that when you look at the business on a quarterly basis, which we try not to do, but we know that we need to speak to it, we had seasonal effects. The fact is that in Europe, in our U.S. Vacation Rental business, we just don't have as much revenue in the winter then we do in the summer and the spring. So we have an added compounding effect. It's a seasonal factor that works against us. So that's when you're looking at it on a quarterly basis, but sort of at a macro level, we have these two competing trends of margin improvement and exchange, but faster growth in our lower margin Rentals business.", "Operator", "Our next question or comment comes from Chris Agnew from MKM Partners.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "I wanted to ask about the Rentals business. I think you said you're off to a great start in January, up 11%. First of all, just confirm I think you said excluded acquisitions, and then maybe just to ask, what regions are contributing to the growth? Are you seeing any impact from austerity measures in Europe, any countries, U.K, in particular?", "Stephen Holmes", "To answer your first question, it did exclude acquisition. That was kind of same-store growth that we're seeing in the Rentals. I think that to answer your question about what are we seeing kind of geographically and do we see any austerity measures kicking in and impacting people's travel, we don't. We continue to see strength in the northern regions, in particular. Germany is really strengthening as their unemployment has reached a new low for, I guess, the last 16 years or something like that. So it's definitely in a better place than it was and it's been a difficult market in Germany for quite some time. So that's an improvement. And I think also if you just, Chris, go back up and look at what happened in 2009, frankly, in this business, when people were worried about the world falling apart, and this business performed exceedingly well. And that's the result of the fact that we've got terrific brands, but also terrific products in locations of very high demand. So even when demand may sag in general, the product that we have is still very highly sought after. So it performed well during a really tough downturn and we continue to see it do well now.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "How should we think about the seasonality of free cash flow in 2011? Is there anything, in particular, to note with respect to timing through the year?", "Stephen Holmes", "It should be relatively similar to what it was this past year from a seasonal standpoint. The things that affect our overall cash flow, such as ABS financing and everything, that doesn't work into the free cash flow. That's kind of working into what we would have as available cash flow. So I don't know of any events that I would consider...", "Thomas Conforti", "Bonnet Creek Hotel, which we're going to have to spend the money by the quarter, so that might have an effect, that might distort free cash flow just a bit, but nothing else that comes to mind, Chris.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question or comment comes from a Michael Millman from Millman Research Associates.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "Considering all the discussion that's been going on with America and the GDSs, can you talk about where the percentage of your business that goes to the GDSs in the different businesses? And if you're moving towards or why you're not moving towards more direct connect and what this might mean on the bottom line? And sort of related, you mentioned your Apollo initiative. I'm not sure that's the Apollo GDS you're talking about or related to that, but maybe you can bring that in as well. And I guess related to that, I suppose this is stretching the definition of one question. Google Maps, what that might mean in terms of the use of GDSs or OTAs?", "Stephen Holmes", "We worked very well with the GDSs. We've had them as partners and worked very closely with them. So if you're talking about the situation that airlines may have with the GDSs, that's not the situation that at least we have. With respect to Apollo, the Apollo is referring to was our own internal project. It's a name for our program we're going through to improve our connectivity with the consumers as well as with our franchisee customers to improve our value proposition to the franchisee customers. So it's things like improving our central res system improving our brand.com websites, which kind of went back to your first question as well. The brand.com websites, you said are we trying to go more direct connect? We have always tried to make our sites as good and as efficient as they can possibly be. Because clearly, the most efficient booking for our hotel franchisees, if we can drive it through our own brand website. But it doesn't mean that that's in conflict at all with the GDSs. We still look to move product through to the OTAs and the GDSs. So I don't think our position there has changed at all. We want to have better sites. Finally, on Google Map, which is a real stretch to getting that to the first one, we do use Google Maps in some of our applications if you go in the new, I'll make a plug for the RCI app on iPad and iPhone, you'll see the way you navigate there is with Google Map. So we do use them and it's a great platform.", "Operator", "And I'd like to turn it back over to our speakers for closing comments at this time.", "Thomas Conforti", "Okay. Thanks very much, Caroline. Well, thank you, all, for joining us on the call and we look forward to seeing you and speaking to you again at the first quarter call.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded, if you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin.", "Margo Happer", "Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO; and Tom Conforti, our CFO. ", "Before we get started, I want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking information. This information is subject to a number of risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K filed February 22, 2011 with the SEC. ", "We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these measures to GAAP is provided in the tables to the press release. It is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website at wyndhamworldwide.com. Steve?", "Stephen Holmes", "Thank you, Margo. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We are starting the year on a high note. First quarter revenues increased 7% and adjusted EBITDA increased 13%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter grew 29% and came in $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range. ", "These results reflect continued economic improvement in the U.S. and strong operational performance in each of our businesses. They also reflect the growing benefit from our commitment to ongoing share repurchases. Performance was strong across the company with each of our businesses delivering solid growth in adjusted EBITDA. ", "In the Lodging business, RevPAR [revenue per available room] was up a strong 7%, with gains in both occupancy and rates. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals delivered another great quarter. In Vacation Ownership, we saw a good growth in property management revenues and continuing improvement in delinquency and default rates in the Loan portfolio. ", "Free cash flow was robust in the quarter at over $1 per share. We completed our most successful timeshare securitization deal and also repurchased most of our outstanding convert and warrants, reducing our full-year diluted share count by 2 million shares. ", "And finally, our board authorized a $500 million increase to our share repurchase program. Overall, great results across the board. ", "The World Travel and Tourism Council forecast that over the next 10 years, the global travel and tourism economy will grow by 4.3% per year. This implies that travel and tourism\u2019s share of the global economy will rise to just over 10%. We believe that, that growth will be broad-based, spanning many regions and product offerings. We are strongly positioned to benefit from that growth. ", "Our product portfolio is geographically and demographically diverse. The breadth of our offerings protected our results in the downturn and is now supporting our growth in the recovery. And it will continue to fuel our expansion for years to come. ", "Let me spend a moment on some recent announcement in our space that have generated a lot of questions from investors. The first is the announced spinoff of Marriott's Timeshare business. Over the next several months, we will all hear more about the way this transaction will be structured, and we look forward to the opportunity for investors to get more familiar with the Timeshare business. ", "While recent private transaction has been priced around 10x EBITDA, existing multiples ascribed to timeshare businesses of public companies are still far below the valuations that existed prior to the economic downturn. ", "Another recent development was the filing on March 11 by HomeAway, Inc. for the $230 million initial public offering. HomeAway is an online vacation rental company with 2010 revenues of $168 million. The vacation rentals market is a large and highly fragmented market with significant growth opportunities globally.", "There are 2 operating models in this market today. First is the rent by owner or listings model. In this model, the vacation homeowner lists his or her property on a website for a listing fee. The listings company refers the potential renter back to the homeowner to inquire about availability, make the reservation and process payment. ", "The second model is the professionally managed model. This is primarily how our European rentals and ResortQuest businesses operate. Of course, we also list properties on the Internet and over 60% of our bookings are transacted online. We provide real-time, bookable inventory that we hand-select and annually inspect. ", "Homeowners provide homes to us primarily on an exclusive and commissionable basis. Unlike the listings model, the consumer rarely deals with the homeowner. We process all payments and handle customer service for their stay. When in vacations model leverages our years of expertise in sales, marketing and vacation rental operations. From check-in to check out, consumers can book with trust and confidence because Wyndham is standing behind them every step of the way. ", "Our acquisition of ResortQuest, combined with our leadership position in Europe, makes us the world's largest company in the professionally managed segment of this growing market. Revenues from our Vacation Rental businesses in 2010 were approximately $500 million. We have approximately 93,000 properties in 32 countries, representing over 51,000 homeowners. We are highly trusted by over 1 million families who vacation with us each year. It's an excellent base for continued growth. ", "The worldwide rentals market is estimated at $85 billion, and we think there's plenty of room for both models to grow. Our belief in the potential of this business is evidenced by our 3 acquisitions in this space last year. We look forward to showing both consumers and investors what we can do in this business. So while these recent events are external to Wyndham Worldwide, we think they underscore the strength and advantages of our businesses and business model. ", "Let me now spend a few moments to give you an update on progress in our business units in the first quarter. The Hotel group continues to focus on international expansion. Over the past 2 years, we have accelerated our international development efforts to leverage existing relationships and develop multi-unit deals. We are achieving great success. ", "For example, in the first quarter, we executed 2 deals in Doha, a 246-room Wyndham Grand and a 300-room Planet Hollywood, with the owner of 111 room Ramada Encore that recently opened. All 3 properties are 5-star products in great locations. ", "In March, we signed an agreement to develop at least 10 Super 8 hotels in Poland, with the same owner over the next 5 years. And last week, we announced the master development agreement for more than 75 new construction Microtel hotels in Canada over the next 25 years. ", "A principal of our partner there in Canada was part of a team that signed a master development agreement for the Super 8 brand in Canada back in 1992. They have since grown that brand's portfolio to include approximately 130 Super 8 hotels throughout every province in Canada. We look forward to the team's continued success. ", "Of course, a critical component of our strategy is developing the Wyndham brand. Through organic growth, acquisition and brand strategy, we have grown to over 60,000 rooms carrying the Wyndham flag, double the number that we acquired the brand in October of 2005. When you add in the timeshare units flying the Wyndham flag, the total increases to over 80,000 rooms. ", "We have underway a series of technology and business enhancements aimed at improving the value proposition to our hotel owners. We call these initiatives \"Apollo.\" In our most recent project, we began an effort with our franchisees to improve the content and navigation of our websites. We look forward to launching a beta test next month on one of our brands, and will continue with additional releases throughout the year. ", "Now moving to Exchange and Rentals. Four weeks ago, I attended the ARDA [American Resort Development Association] Conference, which is the timeshare industry's annual trade convention. We had tremendous attendance by RCI's largest affiliates at the conference, and I was encouraged by the number of new, non-US developers that attended this year. ", "We had meetings with developers from India, Brazil, Asia and the Caribbean. Interest in timeshare is growing as is interest in RCI. We are very pleased to announce during the show our new and exclusive multiyear affiliations with the Anantara Vacation Club, one of Asia's premiere developers of luxury timeshare products; Palace Resorts' new Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in the Dominican Republic; and Fairmont Hotels & Resorts' luxurious Fairmont Heritage Place, recently signed an agreement with The Registry Collection. ", "The Registry Collection is RCI's fractional timeshare exchange program, which boasts over 180 luxury properties around the world. The highlight of the ARDA show for me was RCI's selection as the recipient of the Innovator of the Year award, for developing technologies through RCI.com that provides substantially greater transparency in the timeshare exchange business. ", "We built upon that success earlier this month with our recent release of RCI.com. The upgrade included the Phase 1 launch of RCI Platinum for Weeks [RCI Weeks] members, RCI TV enhancements and new tools to enable interaction with Facebook.", "Now let's touch on Vacation Ownership. While the traditional timeshare model continues to perform very well, we are also excited by the progress we are making in our Asset Affiliation Model or WAAM [Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model]. March 10 marked the anniversary of our first WAAM sale. We went in from $0 to almost $70 million in gross sales in 12 months. It's a homerun for us and for developers. ", "WVO [Wyndham Vacation Ownership] has begun a multiyear initiative called Project Voyager, which is designed to improve our inventory and reservation systems. The goal is to get our owners on more booked vacations each and every year. Our owner satisfaction, which is extremely high, is tied to the frequency with which the user vacation ownership. And with higher satisfaction comes multiple benefits, such as higher upgrade sales, improved lead generation, increased on-time payments and most importantly, a better experience for our owners. ", "Through a series of technology enhancements anticipated to be complete in early 2013, we will maximize vacation planning during the booking process, enhance reservations capability and improve our website experience with greater self-service options. We will keep you apprised of additional developments with this project, which we believe will have long-term beneficial impact on our business. ", "Before I turn the call over to Tom, let me repeat that we are confident in the strength of our business models and our ability to execute our operating and financial growth plans to deliver shareholder value. How confident are we? We spent approximately $255 million on share repurchases so far this year, which is more than we spent on repurchases all of last year. And the board has recently increased our current program by $500 million, the largest increase in authorization since we listed on the New York Stock Exchange 5 years ago. ", "And now I'll turn it over to Tom to review the financials. Tom?", "Thomas Conforti", "Thank you, Steve. As Steve said, the first quarter was strong with adjusted earnings per share coming in 29% ahead of 2010 and $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range, due to continued business momentum, sound expense management and continued share repurchases. ", "Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% reflecting improve RevPAR performance, favorable loan loss trends in our Vacation Ownership business and growth in our European Rentals business. Our adjusted net income excludes the following after tax items: an $8 million benefit related to legacy items, a non-cash impairment charge of $8 million to reduce the value of an international joint venture in the Hotel business, an interest cost of $7 million related to the repurchase of the convertible notes. ", "Free cash flow increased to $185 million for the quarter compared with $166 million in 2010. On a per share basis, free cash flow was $1.03 for the quarter compared with $0.89 in 2010. That reflects a 16% increase in free cash flow per share. ", "Going forward, when I talk about free cash flow, I will express it in a \"per share\" term to better reflect the impact of our share repurchase program. ", "So to restate, we believe that cash is the great enabler of our long-term business goals and that our sustainable and growing annual free cash flow of $3.50 to $4.05 per diluted share, based on our diluted share count guidance of 173 million shares, will accelerate our growth and enhance shareholder value by supporting further investment in the business, dividends and share repurchases. ", "Now let's start a review with the capital markets, where we had a very busy and productive quarter with 3 well-executed transactions. First, we issued $250 million of senior unsecured notes at a coupon rate of 5.6%. We used the proceeds to repurchase a significant portion of the remaining balance of our convertible debt and the associated warrants. ", "The rationale was to reduce our fully diluted share count by 3 million shares on an annualized basis and reduce potential dilution as well. Our overall debt balance at quarter end was essentially unchanged from year end 2010 and well within our targeted investment grade range. ", "Turning to the ABS markets, last month we announced a $400 million timeshare securitization with an unprecedented advance rate of 98% and a weighted average cost of 3.7%. The transaction was oversubscribed, enabling us to increase the size of the offering. Overall, the deal produced $100 million more in cash than we had been projecting. ", "Securitized borrowings are shown under financing activities on the cash flow statement, so this had no impact on free cash flow, but it is a significant contributor to overall cash availability. This was great work by our treasury and WVO finance and consumer finance teams, who couldn't have done it if not for the outstanding sales effort of our sales and marketing team at WVO. ", "Now moving to operating performance for the quarter. Let me begin by saying that the integration of our 2010 acquisitions, Hoseasons [Hoseasons Group], the Tryp brand, ResortQuest and James Villa Holidays is going extremely well. We expect each to meet or exceed the earnings targets that were set up at acquisition. Combined, these companies will contribute over $30 million to our 2011 EBITDA. As importantly, they will each contribute meaningful growth for years to come. We are pleased with the significant progress we are making on this front. ", "So let's begin the segment review with both Wyndham Hotel Group. Revenues were up 3% due to improved RevPAR in the 2010 Tryp acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA was up 21%, again reflecting RevPAR improvement and lower costs. Adjusted margins improved fully 390 basis points. RevPAR was up 7.4% reflecting occupancy gains of 5.8% and rate improvement of 1.4%. We saw occupancy gains across all regions in all chain scale segments. ", "We're beginning to achieve rate gains in the domestic upscale and midscale segments without compromising occupancy. This bodes well for the continued recovery in the economy segment, which is 2/3 of our system. ", "We ended the quarter with approximately 609,600 hotel rooms worldwide. Development efforts in the quarter were robust. We terminated 12,488 rooms in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Consistent with our recent experience, approximately 65% of the terminated rooms were related to financial difficulties for our franchisees. So while the tide has turned and we are in the upswing of what we believe will be a multiyear lodging industry recovery, we have yet to see a significant improvement in franchisee financial health. ", "However, as I said on the last call, we do expect these types of terminations to moderate over time as the economy continues to recover. We also eliminated 2,766 rooms related to the impairment of an international joint venture, which I mentioned earlier. ", "Now our partner in the joint venture has an indirect relationship with a Libyan government investment fund. And given uncertainties related to Libyan-related entities, we recorded a write-down of the investment and eliminated the rooms for more aggregate room total, even though the contract is ongoing. The joint venture produced minimal EBITDA last year. ", "We opened over 12,000 rooms, our highest level of activity in any first quarter ever and the pipeline held steady. The development team delivered 160 of this quarter, up 58% compared with a year ago. Now a little over 1/3 of these new deals were internationally based, mostly in China, India and the politically-stable Middle Eastern markets. ", "Wyndham Exchange and Rentals had a good quarter, with the Exchange business performing in line with expectations and Rentals slightly better than expected, despite some softening in the U.K. market. Segment revenues increased to $356 million, reflecting $31 million in incremental revenues from our recent rentals acquisitions and a $2 million benefit from currency in the Exchange business. ", "Excluding the acquisition-related incremental revenues and the impact of foreign currency, revenues increased 8%, driven by favorable pricing and volumes at Novasol. Exchange revenues increased 3% in the quarter compared with the same period in 2010. Average members and exchange members revenues per member both reflected modest increases in the first quarter of 2011 compared with the same period last year. ", "The acquisition of Hoseasons, ResortQuest and James Villa Holidays contributed $25 million of incremental rental revenue during the quarter. Excluding the acquisitions, rental revenues increased 19%, reflecting a 10% increase in average net price per vacation rental and an 8% increase in transaction volume. ", "Overall, adjusted EBITDA for WER [Wyndham Exchange and Rentals] increased 11% in the quarter compared with the same period in 2010, primarily reflecting a higher revenue contribution from Novasol, which primarily services customers in Germany and Denmark and sound expense management. ", "The segment margin, excluding the acquisitions, was 28.9%, reflecting some margin improvement in both the Exchange and Rentals business. However, as expected, the mixed shift created by the acquisitions in the Rentals business resulted in an adjusted margin decline of close to 200 basis points. ", "Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business once again delivered solid results. Revenues increased 1.4%, tours tracked to plan and volume per guests was slightly below plan as we continue to focus on new owner generation. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter 2011 was $96 million, compared with $82 million in the first quarter of 2010. Now this increase reflects the absence of a litigation reserve we took in the first quarter of 2010, lower loan loss provision and strong property management results. ", "Now the Property Management business, which produced $50 million of EBITDA in 2010, continued to produce a recurring fee-for-service revenue stream with revenues growing 10%. Consumer finance revenues were down approximately 3% due to a decrease in our contract receivables portfolio, while interest expense decreased 4%, reflecting lower interest rates on our securitized debt, partly offset by a higher average securitized debt balance. ", "Now remember that higher advance rates improved cash flow but decreased EBITDA, as the interest expense on securitized debt is reported above the EBITDA line. ", "Delinquency and default rates in the portfolio continue to improve. Write-offs during the first quarter were $85 million, down from $96 million a year ago. The provision for loan losses was $79 million, compared with $86 million in the first quarter of 2010. ", "On our quarterly calls, we have been expressing write-offs relative to the overall portfolio and the provision relative to gross vacation ownership interest sales. Some of you have told us that this is not how you think about these figures, so to simplify things going forward, we'll give you the absolute numbers so you can calculate the ratios that are most meaningful to you. ", "Moving to corporate, excluding legacy-related items, expenses increased $6 million, primarily reflecting increased information security and IT expenses. As I said on the last call, information security is an important spending priority. Like many companies, we have faced and will continue to face an increasingly aggressive threat from cyber criminals. ", "We are investing in our systems infrastructure and hiring additional information security staff to address this threat. We will keep you updated on our progress in this important area. ", "Now, let me spend a few moments on guidance. For the second quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.53 to $0.56. As you saw from the press release, we are raising our full year EPS guidance from $2.05 to $2.15, to $2.15 to $2.25, $0.10 increase on both the lower and upper end of the range. The new EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 173 million shares, down from our original guidance of 181 million shares. ", "This new guidance reflects the benefits of our share repurchase program to date and our repurchase of a significant portion of the convertible notes. This guidance excludes any future share repurchases from our $0.5 billion share repurchase authorization increase. We expect to be at the high-end of our full-year EBITDA guidance of $925 million to $955 million, but are not raising our guidance range at this time. ", "While we are seeing good momentum in each of our businesses, there remains economic uncertainty in Europe, especially in the U.K. where austerity measures have dampened consumer confidence. In addition, as discussed, we expect higher corporate costs related to information security and other IT spending, which could somewhat offset our operating momentum. ", "So with all of that, I'll turn the call back to Steve.", "Stephen Holmes", "Thanks, Tom. In closing, I want to reiterate 4 points, then we'll open it for questions. First, the macroeconomic environment continues to improve. This is evident and can increase momentum across our businesses. Second, we continue to execute well and to meet or exceed our targets for revenues, earnings and cash flow. Third, a number of transactions in our industry will provide important independent valuation comparatives for Wyndham businesses, particularly our Timeshare business. And finally, our board approved a new larger share repurchase authorization. ", "With that, we'll open the line for questions. Kelly?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question or comment comes from Joe Greff from JP Morgan.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Tom, your last comment there about what's included for buybacks in the current new 2011 full year EPS outlook, can you clarify that? It excludes future share repurchases, the new authorization, so we're assuming that you'll exhaust what the current authorization. . .", "Thomas Conforti", "Oh no, no. Joe, what the new guidance reflects is only that share repurchase activity that's already taking place.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Got you, okay.", "Thomas Conforti", "At the end of the quarter, right? It does not include any additional shares we might repurchase with the new $0.5 billion share repurchase authorization.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "What was the absolute diluted share count at the end of the quarter?", "Thomas Conforti", "It was -- the absolute diluted share count on average or at the end of the quarter?", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Absolute quarter and net average.", "Thomas Conforti", "169, 170.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Got you. And that's diluted, not basic?", "Thomas Conforti", "I think I already said.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "That is a diluted share count, not a basic share count.", "Thomas Conforti", "That is correct.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Great. And good you can't say enough good things about the recent time term securitization that you did last month. Are you thinking about doing additional securitizations? And do you think the market has changed from the terms that you got last month?", "Thomas Conforti", "It's our intention, probably to do 2 more this year. And we're just breaking new ground all the time, Joe, and we remain highly optimistic that we'll be able to get favorable execution against our next 2, but market conditions can change but at this time, with a great track record that we've had over the last few years and just the conditions in the ABS market, they just pointed very favorable executions.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And my final question, on the lodging side, the growth on the room side, was a bit better than what we were forecasting. Can you talk about what's going on there? Is that just a function of lower churn? Or are you seeing some initial early results from the Apollo initiatives test attempt, maybe it's a little bit too early, but if you can help us understand that, that would be helpful. Thank you.", "Stephen Holmes", "Hey, Joe, it's Steve. Yes, we continue, as Tom said in his note to actually see a little more churn than we'd like to see, because the franchisees continue to be under financial distress. So we were a little bit, I mean, it's in line with our expectations, but we'd like to see more and we think over time as the financial stability of our franchisees improve, we'll be able to actually accelerate. We did have a lot of openings this quarter, and we had the largest quarter we've had, so we're thrilled with that. But we'd still like to see more stability in the base, so that we'd lose less. That's the key objective of our Hotel group is focused on retention, and it's hard to retain if people can't pay us and can't fix up their properties. So that is a focus point for us.", "Thomas Conforti", "And Joe, it's a little too early to see the benefit of Apollo at this point. We're going to launch our first website upgrade, I think in May, if not May, June. With one of our brands, it's going to be a beta test. So too early to tell, but our business is focused on retention. It's the same old story. Our development team does an amazing job bringing rooms in, but at least at this point, we're losing more people because of the financial condition of some of our franchisees.", "Operator", "Our next question or comment comes from Chris Woronka from Deutsche Bank.", "Chris Woronka - Deutsche Bank AG", "Just a quick question on the stock buyback.  You remind us again kind of how you approach that, and how we could think about that. Obviously, you're on pace to do actually over $800 million and no one expects you to do that much for the full year. But what are some of the factors that go into the timing of the repurchases?", "Stephen Holmes", "Thanks, Chris for the question. I'll start off and if Tom wants to add anything, he can as well. Our repurchase program is really built on the fact that we have priorities for capital allocation. The first priority is if we have transactions that could grow, attractively grow our operating business, we would like to do those. Absent those opportunities, we obviously believe our stock is undervalued, and we're actively in the market buying it. Last year we had a lot of acquisition activity, kind of more than we've had for a couple of years and kind of unusually high for us. This year, we haven't seen any acquisition activity and we've become very aggressive at buying back our stock. As we said before, we don't need to build stock up on our balance sheet. We have a $960 million revolver. We\u2019re happy with our leverage. And in fact, as we grow our EBITDA, we could probably grow our leverage a little bit. Grow our debt level, or leverage are about the same. So priorities are the same, capital allocations story, grow the business through good, thoughtful, properly priced acquisitions and return capital to shareholders with excess capital as well.", "Chris Woronka - Deutsche Bank AG", "Great. And just on the WAAM program, I know we've talked a lot about it in the past. Is it something where your -- do you have capacity right now to kind of expand that, and what are some of the factors that might influence your decision as to how and when you do expand that?", "Stephen Holmes", "Well, there's a lot of product out there. So having access to product is I think we've said before is not an issue at all. The question is how quickly do we want to burn off our own balance sheet and what are the opportunities out there relative to markets we want to be in with product quality that we want in our system. We've indicated that 15% to 20% of our sales in timeshare will be through this WAAM product. As I've told others in the past, it could be more, it could be less. It really depends on the best deals out there. I think our shareholders are paying us to be thoughtful and to be as -- take advantage as much as possible of opportunities that exist, but to deliver the best value for all of our shareholders. So where, we could move that up or down, depending on what we see. There's plenty of product out there, but we also want to work off our balance sheet. So I don't know that I'm giving you a great, direct answer to your question, Chris, but that's because we want to retain ultimate flexibility because we feel like we know what's out there, we see what's there and we want to move quickly to take advantage of opportunities if they exist.", "Chris Woronka - Deutsche Bank AG", "Got it. And just finally on ResortQuest. I think you've owned that for about 6 or 7 months now, and you're kind of in the seasonally stronger period. Have you gotten done the things you wanted to in terms of some the changes you wanted to make internally? How do you feel about that kind of heading into the summer?", "Stephen Holmes", "We feel good about the business heading into the summer. To answer the first part of your question, have we done everything that we wanted to do? Absolutely not. There's a lot of technology improvement that we think we can bring to bear a lot of marketing, improvement that we can probably bring to bear because of our size and breadth. In fact, our leadership team from the Exchange and Rental group is down and desked-in right now with the Fort Walton Beach with the ResortQuest team going through some of those initiatives. So we still have a lot to do there. An integration, generally in my experience, takes maybe 18 to 24 months to really get to where you want it to be just because there's so much to do. And ResortQuest has so many great opportunities for us. We're thrilled with the deal and were thrilled with our opportunities, but I would say that we are not done at all with what we think we can do to bring value to that business and improve it.", "Operator", "Our next question or comment comes from Steven Kent from Goldman Sachs.", "Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "A couple of questions for you. Could you just talk about the operating leverage in the Lodging segment, just broadly, and the sustainability of it? Because it's very impressive that you can show essentially 3% or so top line growth and 21% EBITDA growth. And sort of how we should think about that over the next couple of years. And then on the Vacation Ownership side, you did note that you were seeing lower volume per guest. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about that and how the profitability for that lays out over the next couple of years? And then the final thing, just on a financing sales under WAAM, are you moving forward with that? Are you being more aggressive on providing financing to those customers as another way to enhance that business?", "Thomas Conforti", "That's quite a bit, Steve, let me start with question #1. So the operating leverage we think absolutely is sustainable as RevPAR recovers and we manage cost. So the formula in the first quarter was a simple one, RevPAR growth of 7% help drive operating leverage and then we had some cost -- we had tighter cost management. And there were 1 or 2 costs that we incurred, sort of extraordinary costs in 2010 first quarter, that we didn't experience. But in general, there was also cost leverage as well. So we believe that's sustainable. We expect that there's going to be a multiyear, and I think you do as well. Lodging recovery will get our fair share of that. And we'll continue to see operating leverage take place in that business unit, so definitely sustainable. The second question you had that I can recall was WVO and VPG, our volume per guest. And so you know that the nature of that business, Steve, is that there are really 2 distinct sales channels. I mean there are many sales channels, but in general, you either sell to a new person or you upgrade an existing owner. And we are making a concerted effort, a strategically important effort, to make sure that we continue to grow that new ownership base, because as you know the economics of the new owner acquisition are sort of marginal breakeven at the initial sale. But really, the nature of the business is to upgrade that first-time buyer to be a lifetime buyer of timeshare. And now on the upgrade, our margins are more like 40% to 50%. So we want to make sure that we never lose sight of the fact that the upgrade profitability will be ensured, only if we continue to bring in a steady flow of new owners. And this year, we're targeting around 25,000 to 30,000 new owners, which are important for our future growth. And so VPG declines because our tour flow mix shift has been more favorably to the new owner, who is a more expensive owner to secure than an upgrade. And so I think the VPG on an upgrade is over $3,000. The VPG on new owners is around $1,500. And so when you're doing more new owner acquisition, your VPG is bound to come down. But within upgrade and within new owner, within those distinct categories, upgrade was about the same VPG we had last year, so no deterioration in the upgrade component. And on new owners, new owner VPG actually improved somewhat, but it's that mixed shift. The third question you had was...", "Stephen Holmes", "Financing under WAAM. And for that one, for the financing under WAAM, Steve, the -- our goal is to maximize profit, obviously, and do the best thing for the shareholders. We are retaining flexibility to do the financings ourself and capture the spread. And it's had been with the first 4 deals we did, it was a mix of having the financing provided by the partner and us doing the financing ourselves. So will we retain more of the financings? We may retain the financings we may have the financing done by our partners. So it's, as we called it kind of in the past, it's a hybrid model. We can shift it as we feel is most advantageous to us and as the markets exist at a time.", "Thomas Conforti", "In past deals, we've shared in the economics of the financing by capturing the percentage of the financing income that came in. But to Steve's point, because of our unique position in raising capital, I think increasingly we want to be flexible and do it ourselves, potentially.", "Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "But given how compelling the ABS market is, I mean it seems like you can do it. It's very compelling economics. I guess, I'm just wondering if we should see -- if the pendulum is swinging more and more towards where you will step in and do it, given the market's receptivity to some of your financings.", "Stephen Holmes", "Yes, well, Steve, I would give you a rousing yes, if I hadn't lived through the last 2 years, but the volatility that we experienced, which is something that we, nor the industry had ever seen, just makes us a little more cautious. We want to retain the flexibility of being able to have partners who will take on the financing as well, so we always have that backup or that relief valve, if for some reason it becomes necessary. But you're absolutely right. If I were looking at a deal right now, we'd probably be providing the financing, not letting somebody else do it. And Steve, just going back to the VPG question for a minute that Tom answered. One way to look at it numerically, because we all love numbers, is if you look at our Table 3, it shows our tour volume and our VPG broken down by quarter. And what you'll see is that the VPG was down a little bit 2010 to 2011, and the tour flow was up, about 11%. If you go back to 2009, you'll see a similar tour flow level and now our VPG is above what it was back then. Just, so to Tom's point, that our underlying upgrade sales VPG is up, it's just more of a mix issue. You can kind of see it there in the numbers.", "Operator", "Our next question or comment comes from Patrick Scholes from FBR Capital Markets.", "Charles Scholes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Could you just comment if you've seen anything noticeable from your customers as far as spending or visitation behavior in light of some higher gas prices we've seen over the past 2 months?", "Stephen Holmes", "Yes, we have and it's a popular question. The fact is, we went back and did a variance analysis and a comparative analysis for the last -- due to impacted to 1990 with the information we had available and there really is no correlation between our hotel activity occupancy and rate and fuel prices. There are other factors that have more correlation, for example, consumer confidence, I think was one that had more maybe GDP growth, had more correlation but there's really not much correlation. When we look at this in the last downturn, the last increase in fuel prices and what happened with our hotels, what we found is that people may change their travel patterns. If you're up in the Northeast, you might decide that you're going to Washington for vacation instead of down to Orlando, so you cut your trip shorter, but you're still staying in our product. And in fact, as people become more value-conscious, that kind of plays right into our hand because we are a value leisure play.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Millman from Millman Research Associates.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "On the one of VPG, just to what extent can pricing or cost change the amount of new purchases? In other words, if you decided that you wanted 50,000, would there be cost there? Is it all a matter of how much you're willing to pay out? Or there's something else involved in getting new customers? In the WAAM, is there starting to be competition from others for product? And then in the acquisitions, is it basically that you've seen less? Is it basically a sign of an improved economy, and therefore there's less distress for selling?", "Stephen Holmes", "Okay, thanks, Mike. On the first question about VPG and what the impact is and would we think about having 50,000 new customers versus 25,000 new customers, you're correct in the fact that if we wanted to have 50,000, we could probably have 50,000. Having 50,000 new customers means our marketing costs would be higher because we're generating a new tour, and a new tour cost more than an upgrade to generate. In addition, our close rate would go down a little bit because we close higher on upgrade sales than we do on new sales. So VPG would be impacted if we went up to 50,000 new customers. We think we're at the right balance now. We think by adding 25,000, we're freshening our pool of new potential of existing owners that we will have adequate upgrade opportunities running out into the foreseeable future. So we're comfortable at that level. But we could change it around. And we have a higher new sales generation, the customer generation back when we were at $2 billion sales base, for example. On the second question about the WAAM and is there a lot of competition. There are other people who are looking at the WAAM-type model, there's other who are executing on it. The good thing is, it's like going fishing in the spring when the brooks are fully stocked. There's a lot of fish out there, so it's kind of easy to pull them in, because there's a lot of product out there. So I don't think that that's an issue for us at all, frankly. And the third one on acquisitions, and seeing less acquisitions. I wouldn't say that we're seeing less. I would probably say that 2010 was probably a little bit unusual that we get 4 deals done. The fact was there was a lot of uncertainty during the 2008, 2009 time frame, as we all know. We didn't stop working on things. We didn't stop our team from looking at opportunities. And that may have created a little bit of backlog that all got completed in 2010. But we continue to look at opportunities. We continue to be active in this arena. And again, you can't model when they're going to come out. We can't model the opportunity of when the deals are available and will happen. So I wouldn't say that we're not seeing anything or that the market is dry. It's just, we're using this opportunity, a lack of deal, deal closings to buy back more stock. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question or comment comes from Chris Agnew from MKM Partners.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "Thanks for the detail on the different vacation rental models. I wanted to ask you a couple of questions. Is the professionally managed model more established in Europe, where you're -- obviously you've got most of your business, when compared to the U.S. And does that have different implications for growth opportunities and maybe potential acquisition opportunities if you're thinking about both markets? And could you also clarify, you're involved in both listings in professionally managed, but the majority of the business is professionally managed? Thanks.", "Stephen Holmes", "Okay. Chris, it's Steve. The first question, I don't know that I would say that there's more professionally managed in Europe than the U.S. There definitely is a more organized and consolidated professionally managed presence in Europe. In the U.S., a lot of the professionally managed are done by small realtors in a market that happen to manage a couple of homes and they don't tie into any large network. In the Europe and the U.K., it is a much more organized and consolidated effort, so the businesses that we have over there has been around for decades. They basically rolled in a lot of the small people into their network, and their network provides them marketing opportunities far superior to what a local, small realtor could do. So I don't know if I looked at the landscape that I would say that there's a lot more in one market or the other. There probably is because it\u2019s been so well organized in Europe, a larger presence of professionally managed in Europe, but there also exists professionally managed in the U.S. It's just not under an umbrella brand or brands that really presents itself other than ResortQuest. As for the second half of the question, which related to, are we a listings company or are we a professionally managed? We are professionally managed. The reason I mentioned that we still do a good bit of our product, our transactions on the Internet, is I don't want people to think that we aren\u2019t using the Internet as a source for distribution and marketing. We absolutely do, but we don't just take a listing fee from somebody and put their product up on the market, on the Internet and then let the consumer contact the person who put it up on our listing service. We manage the product that we show on our system, which allows us to have this really good inventory, bookable inventory model, where you can go online and immediately book what you want versus going through the process of contacting the owner of the home. Again, we think there's plenty of room for both models in the market. There's a very large fragmented market and so we're excited about the growth of this market overall, and our participation in it.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "Great, thanks. And then if I could ask about your comments, you said some caution on full-year guidance and mentioned U.K. dampened consumer confidence. How important is the U.K. market to you? Were your comments related to anything you're seeing? Or more about what you're hearing about the sort of the broader economy. I mean, if sort of to extend that, I would've thought that vacation rental in U.K. in particular is almost an austerity friendly vacation, given that it's possibly closer to home and better value for money. So I was just wondering what your thoughts were on those topics?", "Stephen Holmes", "Tom, I'll take the second, you take the first question.", "Thomas Conforti", "We did caution, Chris, about what's going on in the U.K. market. We're getting a sense that the U.K. consumer is unsettled by all the austerity measures underway in the U.K. It's an important piece of our Rental business, although not the biggest contributor of EBITDA in our European Rental business. And so we remain cautious. In 2009, we did see the phenomenon you described, which was -- it seems like a recession friendly holiday solution for the holiday traveler in the U.K. And it may turn out to be that again this year. We just see some early signs that make us cautious about projecting that we will be the recession solution for the U.K. consumer. But, Steve?", "Stephen Holmes", "But also, let me be clear, we're guiding to the top end of our EBITDA range, so we are not being cautious on our overall EBITDA. We're saying we're cautious on the U.K. part of the business. So you seem to indicate that maybe it was an overall company indication, but as Tom said in his comments regarding the top end. On the second question, about U.K., let me just add one thing. The U.K. travelers, the second largest market for us to market to in Europe, the German traveler is the largest, the U.K. traveler is the second largest traveler for European travel. I agree with your comment about with the austerity measures, will that modify maybe and make the U.K. travel within the U.K. better. But it can also decrease the number of U.K. to Europe, to kind of an only Europe travelers. So we plan on both of them. So we're pretty well protected, but the fact is, the U.K. traveler may end up staying more within the U.K. versus going to Continental Europe. And that's the reason that we might see some shift there in which case we may have more product to market to the Dutch and German travelers.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "That makes a lot of sense.", "Stephen Holmes", "Okay. And it looks like, Carol, we're out of time, so we appreciate everybody being on the call and look forward to talking to you at the end of the next quarter.

These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-Q filed April 29, 2011 with the SEC. We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these measures to GAAP is provided in the tables to the press release. It is also available on our Investor Relations website at wyndhamworldwide.com. Steve?", "Stephen Holmes", "Thanks, Margo, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report we had another great quarter as we continue to execute our operating and capital deployment plans. Second quarter revenues increased 13%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 17%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter grew 25% and came in $0.08 above the top end of our guidance range. Each of our businesses delivered growth in adjusted EBITDA and performed ahead of plan with particular strength this quarter in lodging and vacation ownership. This strong performance and further visibility into the second half of the year is allowing us to raise our guidance for 2011. Tom will go through the details in a few minutes. In addition, free cash flow is robust in the first half of the year coming in at $3.42 per share. We continue to implement our capital deployment strategy in a disciplined fashion to drive value for our shareholders. In the second quarter, we invested $200 million in share repurchases and July to date, we invested another $50 million. So far this year, we have spent nearly $425 million on share repurchases. Our weighted average diluted share count is down by $17 million from a year ago. This contributed $0.06 of earnings in the second quarter compared with last year. Our results this quarter, combined with our confidence in the short-term and long-term growth and cash flow potential of our businesses, convince us that share repurchase is a very solid investment. Having said that, our first priority is the continued investment in our business to drive earnings growth and increase cash flow in the years to come. Our baseline sustainable free cash flow guidance of $600 million to $700 million a year assumes continuing investment in existing growth projects such as Apollo and our hotel business, RCI.com and our vacation exchange business and voyager and our vacation ownership business.", "We also continue to selectively evaluate potential acquisitions, which we will only pursue if they are strategically compelling and earnings accretive. Now moving to our business unit review. The Wyndham Hotel Group had a great quarter, exceeding our expectations with almost a 10% increase in RevPAR. Most significantly, we are seeing rate improvement across all chain scale segments in the U.S. The lodging recovery is continuing, and I believe we are exceptionally well positioned to capture more than our fair share of that recovery. The development environment is improving, but financing still remains tight. Developers are looking to diversify the composition and geographic reach of their portfolios to include economy and mid-scale properties outside major city centers, which is where the majority of our brands are positioned. And of course, the conversion market is always important in a tight credit environment. Both of these dynamics work to our benefit. We have a well seasoned development team able to capture opportunities both new build and conversion. We are the world's largest hotel franchisor based on a number of hotels with over 7,200 properties, which translates to almost 613,000 rooms in our system. We offer individual franchisees as well as multi-property developers a strong network of market-leading brands. Our brands cover every segment, and we have a broad geographic reach. As we have discussed before, we are strengthening this exceptional base through a series of technology and business enhancements we call Apollo aimed at further improving the value proposition to our hotel owners. We recently began an effort with our franchisees to improve the content and navigation of our websites. We launched our first beta test with the Baymont brand in June. Our early results are encouraging. Response times improved threefold, and conversions were up 30%. In another hotel group highlight, J.D. Power and Associates recently released the results of its annual guest satisfaction survey. For the 10th consecutive year, Microtel leads the economy/budget segment. In fact, Wyndham Hotel Group's economy/budget brands took the first 3 positions in the segment.", "Now moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. From a rental industry perspective, we were pleased with the enthusiasm of investors over the recent HomeAway IPO. As a reminder, there are 2 operating models in the vacation rentals market. First, there's a rent-by-owner or listings model used by HomeAway and others. In this model, the vacation homeowner lists his or her property on a website for a listing fee. The listing company refers the potential renter back to the homeowner to inquire about availability, make the reservation and then process the payment. The second model is the professionally managed model. This is primarily how our business operates at Wyndham Vacation Rentals. Approximately 60% of our bookings are transacted online. We, rather than the homeowner, control the inventory. We have uploaded in our system on a live and realtime basis. We hand-select and inspect the inventory. Homeowners provide homes to us primarily on an exclusive basis. We process the payments and handle the customer service. And unlike the listings model, the consumer rarely deals with the homeowner. We are the world's largest company in this professionally managed segment of this growing market. We expect 2011 revenues from our vacation rental business to be over $700 million and transactions to exceed 1.3 million. We have approximately 93,000 properties in 32 countries, representing over 51,000 homeowners. We have tremendous scale, which we continue to expand. Integration of our most recent acquisitions, James Villa Holidays and ResortQuest, is progressing very well with both businesses ahead of our earnings expectations. We are making great progress on integrating our systems and leveraging best practices in the inventory distribution strategies across all of our businesses. We are also the market leader in the exchange industry. While tempered growth in the timeshare industry has produced some headwinds for our exchange business, we have been able to drive growth through innovation resulting in a stable high free cash flow business. Through the end of 2010, our migration to online transactions has improved our exchange margin by over 130 basis points. The enhanced online experience also increases the overall value proposition to our members through greater flexibility, functionality and better online content. Online transactions in the second quarter of 2011 were 38% of total transactions, compared with 27% in the second quarter of 2010.", "Now let's discuss the segment that's been receiving a lot of investor attention, vacation ownership. We had great response through an initiative Tom started about a year ago in repackaging this story. We recently had the management team out on the road, and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We're happy for the investor acknowledgment because we knew this timeshare business is a great business, and we also know that we have the best timeshare business in the world. Wyndham Vacation Ownership is a highly evolved and highly adaptable business model, resulting from years of innovation and operational excellence. With approximately 815,000 owners, 21,000 units and 160 resorts, we have the scale to fully leverage market opportunities such as WAAM, our asset-light model. Our owners have been investing in our points-based products for more than 20 years. They know it, they love it, and they buy more. Our points products offer owners a diverse range of vacation experiences, including CLUB WYNDHAM Access and Presidential Reserve in both resorts and urban locations. We have a seasoned team of sales professionals, and we have an execution-based culture led by an exceptional management team. They have met or exceeded our expectations quarter after quarter even during the economic downturn. The fruit is really in the numbers. Over the past 5 years, which everyone would agree, was pretty tumultuous, volume per guest is up approximately 50%. Adjusted EBITDA is up approximately 45%, and the EBITDA margin has increased by over 750 basis points.", "Let me transition now to a broader Wyndham Worldwide story. We recently completed our annual strategic reviews. Our 5 main strategic initiatives remain the same with the top 3 being to growth cash flow, rebalance our portfolio to emphasize our fee-for-service businesses and increase market share. Since we established these strategic initiatives in 2009, we have remained on course and have delivered against each of them. And we continue to find and pursue new opportunities for growth that are consistent with these initiatives. For example, the distressed real estate market has created a great opportunity for Wyndham Vacation Ownership to acquire high-quality inventory at very attractive prices and drive improved margins. In addition to our asset-light opportunities, we're shifting a portion of our existing development budget to the purchase of inventory in a distressed real estate market. This initiative supports our strategy of optimizing the capital deployed to the vacation ownership business, while extending the tail of the inventory already on our balance sheet. In addition, we are exploring a new concept, WAAM 2.0, which is a hybrid asset-light solution. Under the WAAM 2.0 concept, we will sell third-party inventory for a commission, but we'll finance the receivables. This will enable us to take advantage of the great spreads and high advance rates that we as a company are best able to realize. Within Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, we continue to innovate RCI to drive margin as well as member and developer satisfaction. The Vacation Rental team is laser focused on building out the U.S. rental platform. We'll do this by applying our best-in-class strategies to grow organically and with small tuck-in acquisitions. In Wyndham Hotel Group, in addition to important initiatives to drive our core U.S. business such as Apollo, we are pursuing an aggressive growth strategy around the world. For example, we are the largest U.S. hotel company in China with over 50,000 rooms. We expect to double that number in the next 5 years, and our long-term vision is to have a footprint in China that rivals our presence in the U.S. And in key U.S. states, we are planning to -- cities rather -- we are planning to invest approximately $200 million in mezzanine and other financing over the next several years to support the growth of the Wyndham Hotel and Resorts brand. This entire strategic framework is consistent with our target of generating baseline free cash flow of at least $600 million to $700 million a year. This is approximately $3.50 to $4.10 per share based on our diluted share count guidance for 2011. I'm very optimistic about the future at Wyndham Worldwide and look forward to updating you as we execute these strategies. ", "Before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to note a significant milestone. Next week, we will celebrate the 5-year anniversary of our listing on the New York Stock Exchange. At that time, nobody anticipated that a few years later, we all would experience the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. What we did know was that we had great businesses, great people and great potential. We are proud of what we have accomplished during this period. Between dividends and share repurchase, we have returned nearly $1.7 billion to our shareholders over the past 5 years. The cumulative impact of our share repurchase activity over this period has been a 17% reduction in our share count. This, combined with our growth, has driven significant increases in key metrics on a per share basis", "Just to put a few numbers around it, revenues are up 38%. Adjusted EBITDA is up 87%, impressive results. With all 3 of these businesses in great shape and the economy continuing to recover, we're even more optimistic about what we can do over the next 5 years. Tom?", "Thomas Conforti", "Thanks, Steve. Our second quarter results reflect continued momentum and execution across our businesses and our ongoing commitment to return cash to shareholders. Adjusted EBITDA increased 17%, and adjusted earnings per share increased 25% compared with the second quarter of 2010. These results reflect improved RevPAR performance and lower bad debt expense at the Wyndham Hotel Group, growth in our Wyndham Vacation Exchange and Rentals business, higher sales and a reduction in the loan loss provision at Wyndham Vacation Ownership, and the meaningful impact of our ongoing share repurchase program. We came in $0.08 above the top end of our guidance range. Each business performed better than our expectations. In addition, there was some benefit about $0.03, primarily in lodging, from the timing of expenses in the quarter which we'll give back in the second half of the year. Share repurchase, which is excluded from our guidance, also contributed to the b. Free cash flow increased to $595 million or $3.42 per share for the first 6 months in 2011. ", "[Technical Difficulty] ", "great enabler of our long-term business goals. For 2011, we expect free cash flow of $3.50 to $4.10 per diluted share based on our diluted share count guidance of $171 million. We expect to continue to grow this important measure in the future, accelerate on our growth and enhancing shareholder value by supporting further investment in the businesses, share repurchases and dividends.", "Let me begin our quarterly operating review with the Wyndham Hotel Group, which had a great quarter. Revenues were up 7%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 32%, driven by RevPAR improvements and lower bad debt expense. Adjusted margins improved 660 basis points. Systemwide RevPAR was up 9.7%. Now excluding the Tryp acquisition and in constant currency, RevPAR was up 5.8%. As in the first quarter, we saw occupancy gains across all regions and domestic chain scale segments. Encouragingly, we saw rate gains across all chain scale segments domestically and across all regions except for Asia-Pacific. We believe the recovery is in full progress in all lodging segments, including the economy and mid-scale segments. We ended the quarter with approximately 612,900 hotel rooms worldwide, and development efforts in the quarter were robust. We opened over 16,000 rooms, while terminating approximately 12,800 rooms in the quarter in line with our expectations. The development team executed over 150 deals this quarter, up 6% compared with a year ago. The total pipeline consisted nearly 111,000 rooms, up 3% from a year ago. 64% of the pipeline is international, up from 49% a year ago. The new construction pipeline is up 10%, all international. Now all of this is a good indication that we are successfully executing our international growth strategy. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals had another good quarter in spite of difficult market conditions with exchange and rentals results slightly better than expected. Segment revenue increased to $361 million, reflecting $53 million in incremental revenues from ResortQuest and James Villa Holidays, and a $19 million benefit from favorable currency translations. Now excluding the acquisition-related incremental revenues and the impact of foreign currency, revenues increased 3%, reflecting higher rental revenues in our Novasol and Landal GreenParks businesses, growth in exchange and the year-over-year change in the classification of some contra revenue items to expenses. Excluding currency impacts, exchange revenue in the second quarter increased about 2% compared with the same period in 2010. Consistent with our expectations, the average number of members remained flat. Excluding currency, exchange revenue per member increased 1%, reflecting an increase in other transaction revenue, resulting from some of our recent innovations at RCI.com. Now remember in the November 2010 RCI.com release, we enhanced our Weeks exchange program by providing more transparency to our members and change back on an exchange of lesser value. Change back deposit credits can be combined, along with timeshare deposits, to trade up into a higher value timeshare. In addition to the benefit of creating additional transactions, there is a fee for that service which is already providing some revenue gain. Vacation rentals revenue increased 57% to $180 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the same period of 2010. Now our most recent additions, U.S. based ResortQuest and U.K. based James Villa Holidays contributed $46 million of incremental rental revenue during the quarter, and foreign exchange movement had a $15 million favorable impact on vacation rental revenue. In constant currency and excluding the acquisitions, rental revenues increased 3%. The average net price per vacation rental increased 5%, primarily driven by a higher yield at our Novasol and Landal GreenParks businesses. Transaction volumes declined slightly due to difficult market conditions in the U.K. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals' adjusted EBITDA increased 5% in the quarter compared with the same period in 2010, primarily reflecting the benefits of the ResortQuest and James Villa Holidays acquisitions. Excluding the acquisitions, EBITDA was flat. Now we're pleased with that during these difficult economic times in Europe. Our European rentals business remained stable, while others in the market had revenue and profit declines.", "Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business once again delivered strong results. Compared to the prior year, revenues increased 7%. Tours were up by 9%, and VPG increased 3%. Year-to-date, we have added over 12,000 new owners into our system, and we are ahead of our new owner goal of 25,000 for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter 2011 increased 25% to $130 million, compared with $104 million in the second quarter of 2010. The increase reflects great sales results, lower loan loss provisions and a growing contribution from our property management business. Property management fees grew 8% in the second quarter of 2011, compared with the comparable period in 2010. As you know, this business, which produced $50 million of EBITDA in 2010, provides a recurring fee-for-service revenue stream and steady, reliable growth. As anticipated, consumer finance revenues were down 3% due to a decrease in our contract receivables portfolio. However, interest expense decreased 21%, reflecting lower rates on our securitizations, which were partly offset by higher advance rates on our recent securitizations. Remember that higher advance rates improved cash flow but decreased EBITDA as we report the interest expense on securitized debt above the EBITDA line. Portfolio performance continues to improve somewhat. Write-offs during the second quarter were $75 million, down from $90 million a year ago. The provision for loan losses was $80 million, compared with $87 million in the second quarter of 2010. So we continue to see improvement in these important measures but at a moderate pace.", "Now moving on to corporate. Excluding legacy related items, expenses increased $9 million, primarily reflecting increased information security and IT expenses. We are investing in our systems infrastructure and hiring additional information security staff to address the serious and increasing threat of data breaches, targeting the hospitality  industry. We will continue to keep you updated on this important progress.", "Now let me review our activities in the capital markets where we had another busy and productive quarter. Last week, we announced the closing of a new $1 billion revolving credit facility to replace our $980 million facility, which was scheduled to mature in October of 2013. The maturity date of the new facility is July 15, 2016. There is no change to the overall corporate debt balance as a result of this transaction. Now the financing extends the credit facility to a 5-year term and has more favorable pricing terms, which further strengthens our liquidity profile and decreases our ongoing interest expense. All of our historical relationship banks participated in the financing, and several new participants were added, demonstrating the banking community's confidence in Wyndham Worldwide. Last month, we announced the renewal of our securitized timeshare receivables conduit facility. Our prior conduits were 1-year terms, and this is a 2-year  facility. This further strengthens our liquidity and balance sheet position and highlights the broad support enjoyed by our timeshare ABS program. The new facility maintains capacity of $600 million.", "Now I'd like to spend a few moments on guidance, and we're going to post this to our website and email it to you following the call. For the third quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.86 to $0.89, assuming a share count of 168 million shares. As you saw from the press release, we are increasing our full year revenue guidance to $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion, and our adjusted EBITDA guidance to $960 million to $975 million. We are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance from $2.15 to $2.25 to $2.32 to $2.40. The new EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 171 million shares, down from our original guidance of 181 million shares and our most recent guidance of 173 million shares. This new guidance reflects the benefits of our share repurchase program through the second quarter. The guidance excludes any further share repurchases. We have approximately $345 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization. We are narrowing the range on our D&A guidance by $5 million on the high end. The new range is $180 million to $185 million. Interest expense guidance has been reduced to $130 million to $135 million, reflecting lower borrowing cost and higher capitalized interest. We expect our tax rate for the year to be a little lower than expected at about 38%, and we think most of that reduction will come in the fourth quarter. Please note that the implied fourth quarter earnings per share guidance is $0.38 to $0.43 per share. Remember when considering year-over-year fourth quarter comparison that we benefited from an unusually low tax rate of 27% in 2010, and that the historic seasonality of our WER business has changed due to the acquisitions we did in 2010. Now drilling down to the business unit level. At the hotel group, we are increasing our revenue guidance to $710 million to $730 million, and adjusted EBITDA guidance to $208 million to $215 million. Our RevPAR guidance increases 100 basis points to 6% to 8% year-over-year growth, and room guidance remains unchanged at 1% to 3% year-over-year growth. We expect hotel margins to moderate for the remainder of the year, reflecting planned increases in advertising spend compared to last year and timing differences, which I touched on earlier. Based on the new guidance, the implied full year margin improvement in the hotel group is about 150 to 175 basis points for the year. Exchange and rentals revenue increased to $1.46 billion to $1.5 billion, and we're bringing up adjusted EBITDA to $343 million to $353 million. Exchange drivers remain unchanged. Average net price per vacation rental increases to 25% to 27% year-over-year growth. And rental transaction guidance decreases slightly to 16% to 18% year-over-year growth. The decline in transaction guidance is attributable to soft demand at our U.K. cottage business while the uplift in prices due to improved yield and the impact of currency in the first half of the year. Note that guidance assumes currency rates as of June 30. We're also raising vacation ownership revenues to $2 billion to $2.1 billion. We're bringing the EBITDA range up to $495 million to $510 million, reflecting a narrowing of the VPG guidance to 2% to 4%, and an increase in tour flow of 5% to 8% from last year. We now expect corporate expenses to be $90 million to $95 million, primarily reflecting increased information security costs as well as higher employee and bonus cost. We expect CapEx to be $225 million to $240 million, reflecting higher information technology and security cost. But we also expect vacation ownership inventory spending to be within our original budget of $80 million to $90 million. And finally, we are confident in our free cash flow guidance of $600 million to $700 million or approximately $3.50 to $4.10 per share in 2011. And all of this points to another great year of financial and operational performance for the company. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve.", "Stephen Holmes", "Thanks, Tom. In summary, let me just reiterate a few key points. Overall, we delivered strong year-over-year growth in revenues, adjusted EBITDA and EPS in the quarter. And our free cash flow per share was up 31% in the first half of the year. We continue to deploy our cash flow to enhance shareholder value. And finally, based on our year-to-date results and outlook, we're raising our full year EBITDA and EPS guidance. And now with that, Laurel, we'll take some questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Joe Greff.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Within the timeshare segment, we saw a better than expected -- better than our expectation tour flow improvement. Did that result in a shift in terms of repeat buyers versus first-time buyers? Can you talk about that within the quarter?", "Stephen Holmes", "Yes, Joe. Tom and I will expect the -- the increase in tour flow was in fact driven by first-time buyer marketing activity. As we said previously, we have a target for first-time buyers of around 25,000 new members coming in as first-time buyers. We're running a little bit ahead of that now. There's been a heavy focus down in Orlando within the marketing group to drive those first-time buyers in, and the results were frankly a little bit better than our expectations as well. So they're doing a great job down there, but you're absolutely right.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Great. And then I think I heard Tom correctly talking about property management fees were up within timeshare, we're up 8% year-over-year. Do you think that's a sustainable growth rate?", "Thomas Conforti", "Yes. It feels about the right growth rate, Joe. We expect that growth rate to be mid to upper single digits. A part of it is coming from some of the restructuring of pricing agreements that we have with some of the HOAs. So we expect to continue to have that as a good contributor to the growth of this business as we go forward in the mid to upper single digits as we go forward.", "Operator", "Robert LaFleur.", "Robert LaFleur - Rodman & Renshaw, LLC", "You're at $595 million of free cash flow for the first half of the year. Your target has been $607 million to $700 million. You may have addressed this, I missed a little bit of the call. But obviously, you're practically there. What does cash flow look like in the back half of the year? I mean, you would assume that you would be something substantially higher than $607 million, $700 million for at least this year, unless there's something that's going to affect the cash flow negatively in the back half of the year.", "Thomas Conforti", "Bob, so there are 2 issues that are working to make the second half of the year less than the first. Number one, typically, we spend more CapEx in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. So that's an important contributor. And as you know, we raised our CapEx guidance a bit. The second part is the seasonality of the rentals business. As you know, the way our rentals business in Europe works is we get cash early, we hold on to the cash, and then we pay the homeowner in the second half of the year. So the benefit that we get in the first half of the year of receiving cash early is the offset is in the second half of the year. And then finally, as we pointed out, there's about $50 million in our free cash flow number that's associated with the settlement that we had with the U.K. government on an outstanding value-added tax issue and on a cash flow basis that was a $50 million benefit for the quarter. So those are the 3 factors why we think that $600 million to $700 million is still the right number and still a very strong number on a per share basis.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Amanda Bryant.", "Amanda Bryant - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Just within your timeshare segment, 2 questions. First, what was the customer's propensity to finance in the quarter? And then second, can you just provide us with a little bit more color on the purchase of distressed inventory?", "Thomas Conforti", "Yes, the first question, the answer was around 50 -- low 50, so about 52%. And Steve, you want to...", "Stephen Holmes", "Yes, on the distressed inventory, Amanda, there's, as we've said continually through this downturn, there's a lot of product out there that's available. And we've been evaluating whether to acquire some of that product or whether to complete the product we have with our balance sheet and move it forward. And we're seeing some offers that are just so compelling, that we we'll probably do a little bit more purchase on the distressed side and hold off finishing the inventory. We kind of look at it as a -- on a return on investment basis, which one are we going to get the best return for. And right now, taking advantage of what's out in the marketplace is marginally better than what we have in our balance sheet to finish. So we'll get around to finishing what's on our balance sheet. It's just as I said, it pushes the tail out on how long we can produce sales from our existing balance sheet and completing the product that's on there already. But there are a lot of great opportunities out there in markets that we've wanted to be in or in markets where we already have presence but we could use more product.", "Amanda Bryant - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "So how much do you think you'll spend on distressed inventory this year, as it relates to your overall expectations for CapEx spend within that segment?", "Stephen Holmes", "Well, we've guided to, I believe, $80 million to $90 million total spend. It will be within that number, and I wouldn't anticipate it being a large portion of that number this year means we're already in the second half of the year, writing the deals, getting it done, executing and closing and funding sometimes take a little bit longer. So maybe a larger portion of our 2012 spend than it is in the 2010 spend, but our goal is still to be in that range that we've given you longer-term for annual spend on our inventory of $135 million, $130 million, so we want to be in that zip code, and this will include some of the distressed inventory purchase.", "Operator", "Next question is from Patrick Scholes.", "Charles Scholes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "I just have a couple of questions related to the loan loss provision. First of all, what was that loan loss provision percentage in the second quarter, and how much incremental EBITDA did you receive from lowering that?", "Thomas Conforti", "Incremental EBITDA versus last year?", "Charles Scholes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Yes, versus last year, correct.", "Thomas Conforti", "I think the provision dropped $7 million, right? If I remember right. Great question, though.", "Charles Scholes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Okay. And roughly what is that provision percentage, what was it in 2Q, and what does your full year guidance assume that the full year will be?", "Thomas Conforti", "Hold on for a second, Patrick. Hey Patrick, let us get back to you. I want to make we're answering the exact that you have, and we're going back and forth here on the exact numbers. So we'll come back to you on it, okay? That's it.", "As a percentage of gross realized, I think, it's going to be around 21%, 22%, is that what you're asking?", "Charles Scholes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Yes.", "Thomas Conforti", "Okay. So 21%, 22%.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Chris Agnew.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "Just going back to distressed inventory. Just wondering, can you give us any sense of how it impacts cost of goods sold maybe o a per development basis?", "Stephen Holmes", "Well, it will have a positive impact, and that's part of the reason that we're pursuing it. As to what -- much it will lower our cost of sales, it's kind of hard to say. It kind of goes back to the question that Amanda asked before of how much will we do of it, and I don't know if we can handicap that for you right now, Chris, to be honest. I think that this year, we're running the cost of sales around 21%. That's already several hundred basis point -- a couple of hundred basis points below where we are running in previous years. So we've already seen some improvement by taking advantage of both the WAAM deals that we've done as well as some of this distressed inventory. So I mean, we would hope to be able to lower that the cost of sales below where we are now. But I don't want to point towards a way lower number because we do have a lot of product that we're still moving through on our balance sheet, and so it should moderate it somewhat, Chris, but I can't be specific on an answer for you.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "One quick follow-up if I may. Just on the vacation rental business, exclude FX and acquisitions, where you saw a deceleration from the nice growth you've got in the first quarter, and I think you touched -- is that really just the U.K. business and the impact that you're seeing in the U.K., or are you seeing a weakening in the stronger North European businesses that you have?", "Thomas Conforti", "I would say it's clearly the U.K. and in our Dutch business also is feeling some effects but they're growing year-over-year. So I would point largely to what's going with the U.K. but acknowledge that there is -- it is a challenging environment in all of Northern Europe.", "Stephen Holmes", "And Tom told me the other day, he never wanted to say this as CFO. But the rain in Holland isn't helpful either.", "Thomas Conforti", "The weather in Holland has not been great.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our final question today comes from Michael Millman.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "You mentioned that your exchange businesses -- membership business is kind of flat suggesting the industry is flat. You're growing -- can you talk about what's going on in the industry consolidation? I guess a little bit related to that, the distressed inventory. Is that being bought by other timeshare from other timeshare developers? Or is that general condominium, hotel kind of product that you're able to get and then convert to timeshare?", "Stephen Holmes", "Okay. Well, on the general industry, it is still growing. The industry is growing. It's just not growing at the pace it was several years ago. So a lot of the big players like ourselves and Marriott,and Hilton and Disney are all continuing to sell products and therefore, there is growth in the industry. It's just not as fast as the growth historically was, and it really unfortunately is a story of the haves and have-nots. The larger companies have access to capital. The smaller companies do not yet have access to as readily available capital. We see new players coming into market all the time. We've seen new players, when I say new players, I mean new financing sources coming in. Hopefully, that will continue to fuel some of the smaller players who have had a difficult time accessing capital. There are some terrific operators out there who just can't access the kind of capital they need in order to sell timeshare and finance the receivables that, that sales generate. So it's still -- we still see improvement, but it's going to take some time as we previously said for that to return. As to the distressed inventory question, it's really, Mike, it's a combination of both. It's other developers who are looking to sell off portions of their development because they are unable to access that financing that I was speaking of. But it's also projects that were developed as whole ownership condos that are being converted into timeshare. And again, as long as it's in the right place, the product quality is right, and we can give an experience to our consumers that is consistent with what the Wyndham Vacation Ownership wants to provide, then it makes sense for us. Okay, and so thank you, all, very much for joining us. I think, Laurel said that was the last question in the queue. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter.", "Operator", "That does conclude today's presentation. Thank you, all, for joining.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over now to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Ma'am, you may begin.", "Margo C. Happer", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO; and Tom Conforti, our CFO.", "Before we get started, I just want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking information. This information is subject to a number of risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-Q filed August 1, 2011, with the SEC. We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these numbers to GAAP is provided in the table to the press release, and it is available on the website -- of our investor relations website at wyndhamworldwide.com. Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Margo, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report strong performance again this quarter. Compared with the prior year, third quarter revenues increased 14%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 19%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter grew close to 40%. ", "Each of our business units exceeded our expectations. The Wyndham Hotel Group benefited from RevPAR increases driven by improvements in both occupancy and rate. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals delivered strong results despite the turmoil in Europe and benefited from the acquisitions we made last year. And our timeshare business, Wyndham Vacation Ownership, once again exceeded expectations, delivering EBITDA growth of over 20%. ", "In terms of capital allocation, we committed $300 million to repurchase 10 million shares of our stock during the third quarter. In October to date, we have repurchased an additional 1.4 million shares for $40 million. This reflects our confidence in the growth and the sustainable cash flow of our businesses. ", "And as you saw from the press release, we have given you the first view of our 2012 outlook. We expect EBITDA growth of 6% to 8% and EPS growth of 10% to 14%. We expect 2012 free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. ", "We will allocate capital to drive shareholder value, and that includes investing in our businesses, paying dividends and share repurchases. We have a well-established proven track record of successful acquisitions. We know how to value businesses. We know how to integrate acquisitions, and we know how to build successful momentum. ", "Last year, we enhanced our fee-for-service revenue streams with 3 acquisitions in the rental space and one in lodging, totaling $232 million. Hoseasons, which we acquired in the first quarter of 2010, is now fully integrated into our systems, contributing to adjusted EBITDA 20%, ahead of our expectations last year. The other acquisitions, James Villa, ResortQuest and TRYP are also outperforming our expectations, producing over 30% more EBITDA in 2011 than we expected when we completed the deals. ", "This year, our capital deployment has been more focused on share repurchases. Through October 25, we have invested over $715 million in share repurchases. We have reduced our weighted average diluted share count by $22 million -- or by 22 million shares or 12% from the third quarter a year ago.", "Now moving to the business unit review. At the Hotel Group, industry fundamentals continued to improve, with the recovery tracking to our expectations. During the quarter, we saw continued improvement in both rate and occupancy, and we believe the overall health of the franchisee base continues to strengthen as we've seen improvement in bad debt trends. Tom will address this point in more detail later.", "We had a number of significant hotel openings recently. Most notably, the Wyndham Grand at Bonnet Creek in Orlando, our wholly owned hotel, opened September 30 both on time and on budget. The hotel, located within the Walt Disney World resort gates, is managed by our Wyndham Hotel Management group and is next to our 1,149-unit Bonnet Creek timeshare resort. The hotel is being well received by both guests and vacation ownership members, and the transient booking pace has been robust. ", "Also in the Hotel Group, we continue to make significant progress on Apollo, our series of technology and business initiatives. These initiatives were designed to transform the reservation experience for consumers and to maximize our contribution to franchisee performance. We achieved a significant milestone recently with the completion of the content solicitation initiative. This involved a complete overhaul of the information and images of 7,000 properties worldwide.", "The backbone of Apollo is the relaunch of our various hotel brand websites, which began this year with the Baymont and Travelodge brands. The conversion results have been terrific for these first 2 brands. We are planning a series of rollouts for the additional brands in the coming weeks with the majority of our hotel brands having new websites by the end of the year. This is one example of how we are working to enhance our brand positioning and value proposition.", "Now moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. Our North American rentals business is taking off, and our European rental business continues to perform well despite the recent political turmoil and the economic challenges in Europe. In North America, ResortQuest is performing significantly better than our expectations. In the third quarter, we bolted on 2 small vacation rental acquisitions, one in Colorado and one in Florida, adding over 1,500 new rental units to our platform in those 2 high-demand markets. We now have over 7,000 rental units in North America and nearly 99,000 units globally.", "On our past 2 earnings calls, we talked about the consumer benefits of our full service vacation rental model as compared to the listing model. Today, I want to share an example of how our full service model is superior when challenges arise. ", "ResortQuest has years of experience in emergency management planning that came into play when hurricane Irene hit in August. Irene's path was forecasted to move directly over our Delaware operations. We began evacuating guests on the Thursday before one of the highest occupancy weekends of the year. By the weekend, mandatory evacuations were ordered for all Delaware locations where ResortQuest properties reside. ResortQuest rerouted its call center operations to Northwest Florida. They guided visiting guests through evacuation and safety instructions and contacted guests who were scheduled to arrive over the weekend.", "ResortQuest employees more than 1,000 miles away put in overtime to ensure the highest level of support to its customers in a time of need. The extra effort went a long way to comfort guests and property owners, and ResortQuest's ability to leverage its vast inventory allowed arriving guests, in many cases, to postpone travel to future dates without penalty. This level of service is fundamental to ResortQuest and the professionally managed value proposition. ", "Now looking at the exchange business. At RCI, we recently completed another significant release of the rci.com web enhancements. We began this transformational journey in 2008 with web penetration of 13%. Today, our web penetration is 39%. On October 15, we brought even more simplicity, speed and efficiency to the vacation exchange experience with another major milestone technology upgrade. This included a new property information management platform as well as a new enhanced search function for our Points members.", "In addition, we launched an innovative recommendation engine technology where members see realtime vacation suggestions that best fit their unique travel preferences. We are transforming RCI from a high-touch, high-cost, call center-based business into a innovative, industry-leading, technology-driven company.", "These enhancements build on other innovations such as the trading power transparency and change back benefits of our Weeks enhancement upgrade we implemented last November and previously discussed. Combined, these are, for RCI members, what they need to transact with us on the web and through mobile devices. We expect these innovations to help drive membership, transactions and margins.", "Now let's turn to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which also has a long history of innovation. In the early 1990s, we were among the first to introduce a point system for timeshare owners and have continued to lead the way with many product development initiatives. We are once again breaking new ground in sales and marketing. ", "As you know, unlike other lodging products, timeshare is not a demand-driven business model. And since timeshare is sold rather than sought, finding good prospects has always been key to our success. In recent years, Wyndham Vacation Ownership has been especially focused on finding highly qualified prospects who meet our credit standards. ", "To that end, we recently launched a fully proprietary and innovative credit worthiness prescreening program. The program has increased the efficiency of our model by identifying the most qualified prospects for our sales people. The results already speak for themselves, eliminating thousands of otherwise un-prepped profitable sales tours and resulting in significant cost savings. This program is now live at close to 3/4 of our offsite marketing locations, and some locations are realizing BPG lists of applicable tour types in excess of 30%. This is truly a new way of doing business for Wyndham Vacation Ownership, and we believe it is unlike anything employed by our competitors. ", "The team who conceived and developed this initiative won our inaugural Chairman's award for innovation at Wyndham Worldwide. Earlier this year, we launched a formal recognition program for something that we believe will have long -- we believe we have long excelled at: coming up with innovative ways to improve our business. We received 81 award nominations across our business units and corporate teams, reflecting the great energy and enthusiasm for innovation in the company. ", "Innovation was also recognized in RCI last year when the team was honored for the industry-leading Weeks enhancement rollout, which garnered widespread recognition for promoting transparency in the timeshare exchange process. Whether it is WAAM, points-based timeshare or the rci.com initiative to name a few, we have a long track record of innovation.", "Sustainability is another area of innovation, and it is a core value here at Wyndham Worldwide. And so we're proud to be -- to recently be ranked among the top 100 greenest companies in the U.S. by Newsweek magazine. We were #1 among hotels and restaurant companies. This follows closely on our recent recognition as an S&P Carbon Disclosure Index leader. I couldn't be more pleased by the progress we're making. ", "Of course, another top cornerstone of our company is our Count On Me! service culture. Wyndham Hotel Group is energizing Count on Me! through an innovative new program designed to ensure the leaders of the business walk a mile in the customers' shoes. 80 members of our Hotel Group senior leadership team recently completed 3-day work visits at our franchisees' hotels. We have received fantastic feedback from franchisees and employees who are coming back with a deeper understanding of customers' needs. I am very proud that through outstanding service innovation, our company continues to shine in operational performance.", "Before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to take a minute to reflect upon the broader economic -- macroeconomic environment. In 2012, we expect moderate economic growth in the U.S., continued economic difficulties in Europe and higher growth in the developing markets. This is the underlying basis for our 2012 plan and budget. But regardless of the environment, as we showed in 2008 and 2009, our businesses are built for performance in all economic conditions. ", "Further, we are fiscally conservative. We have an investment grade profile. Our balance sheet is strong. We have a well stacked capital deck with no significant near-term maturities. And while the ABS market has performed very well in recent months, it's a bonus to our business, not a necessity. Our securitized conduit facility, which isn't up for renewal until June 2013, has ample capacity to fund the business for over a year before we even consider our operating cash flow or our revolver.", "Finally and maybe most importantly, we expect to sustain baseline annual free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. Tom and I have great confidence in that number and in the future. ", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results reflect continued momentum and execution across our businesses and our ongoing commitment to thoughtful capital allocation. We came in $0.05 above the top end of our guidance range, with share repurchases contributing $0.03 to the bp. ", "Free cash flow increased to $699 million or $4.11 per share for the first 9 months in 2011 compared with $564 million or $3.03 per share during the same period in 2010, which excludes a $145 million cash payment related to our contingent IRS tax liabilities. The 36% increase in free cash flow on a per-share basis reflects the strong operational performance of our businesses, solid working capital management, the impact on our share count from our ongoing share repurchase program and a $67 million benefit from a refund of value-added taxes and related interest income.", "During the first 9 months of 2011, we generated $779 million in available cash, which we defined as free cash flow plus net proceeds from securitized borrowings. Now we spent 86% of that money on share repurchases, 10% of that cash on dividends and 3% on M&A. While we expect higher CapEx and working capital requirements in the fourth quarter, it is clear that our free cash flow generation for the year will exceed our expectations. We expect our free cash flow in 2011 to be about $725 million or $658 million if you exclude the value-added tax refund and related interest income.", "Now let me begin our quarterly operating review with the Hotel Group, which had a solid quarter. Revenues were up 9% compared with the third quarter of 2010, driven by RevPAR improvement. Now a portion of that increase also reflects the reporting reclassification of $12 million related to certain reservation fees which had no impact on EBITDA but reduced margin by approximately 180 basis points. EBITDA was flat, reflecting the unfavorable timing of higher marketing cost and preopening costs for the Bonnet Creek hotel.", "As we've mentioned on our previous 2 calls this year, timing difference in marketing spend can have a significant impact on the Hotel Group's quarterly financial results. While timing was favorable in the first half of the year, it's going against us in the second half. Now to smooth out the impact, if we look at nine-month results, we see a 7% increase in revenues and a 16% increase in adjusted EBITDA. This is being driven by continued improvement in lodging fundamentals, including improving bad debt trends. ", "Now returning to the quarter, systemwide RevPAR was up 6.3% or 4.8% in constant currency. The RevPAR increase came from occupancy and ADR gains of 3% each. We saw a strong rate performance as well as occupancy gains across all regions except Asia Pacific, which was down slightly due to a difficult comparison in Shanghai, the site of last year's World Expo. We're encouraged that rate has returned and appears to be sticking. ", "We ended the quarter with approximately 611,200 hotel rooms worldwide, up about 1% from a year ago. This modest increase included the loss of a Ramada master licensor in the U.K. that filed for bankruptcy. The effect of this was the loss of 24 hotels or 2,676 rooms from the system. Excluding the loss of the Ramada master, terminations were in line with our expectations, and openings were up about 8%. Overall, we believe the financial health of our franchisees has been improving steadily throughout the year. Our year-to-date bad debt expense for the Hotel Group has improved by $6.6 million. ", "We're seeing continued growth in the development pipeline as well, with good contributions from some strong international markets. The total pipeline consists of 114,600 rooms, up about 7% from a year ago. 62% of the pipeline is international, up from 47% a year ago. The new construction pipeline is up 14%, however, all international. We are concentrating our new construction development efforts in China, India and Brazil, all high-growth markets. ", "Now moving on to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. Revenue was up 32% in the third quarter of 2011 compared with the same period of 2010. Recent acquisitions contributed over $90 million of incremental revenue in the quarter. A weaker U.S. dollar favorably impacted revenue by $16 million in the third quarter of 2011. So excluding acquisitions and the net effect of foreign currency, revenue for the segment was flat.", "Adjusted EBITDA increased 30% in the third quarter of 2011 compared with the same period in 2010, driven primarily by the impact of acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions and the net effect of foreign currency, adjusted EBITDA in quarter 3 2011 was flat compared to the same period in 2010 as growth in our rental businesses was offset by a decline in our exchange business.", "In constant currency, exchange revenue decreased by 3% in the third quarter. The average number of members was flat, and exchange revenue per member decreased by 2.2%. This reflects a continued shift in the mixed clubs, which have a lower propensity to transact and the timing of sales promotions compared to the prior year. The exchange business continued to drive operating efficiencies through prudent expense management and continued success in driving transactions online. For the quarter, the mix of online transactions in our exchange business increased from 28% during 2010 to 39% during the last quarter. ", "Vacation rental revenue increased 61% in the third quarter of 2011 compared with the same period of 2010. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency, vacation rental revenue increased 2% in the quarter, and average net price per rental was up 1.4%, primarily driven by higher yield at our Landal parks business. Transaction volumes, excluding acquisitions, were flat compared with the third quarter of 2010. ", "So in our minds, this quarter once again demonstrated the resiliency of our European rentals business. The current economic challenges in Europe, as we all know, are ongoing. So despite those challenges, our vacation Exchange and Rentals business continues to deliver solid results. This consistent performance is a reflection of the strong execution of our management teams and the strength of our global product offerings.", "Moving on to the Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business once again delivered exceptional results. Compared to the prior year, segment revenues increased 5%. Growth vacation ownership interest sales were up 10.4%, reflecting a 5.3% increase in tours and a 5.6% increase in VPG. ", "EBITDA in the quarter increased 21% to $149 million compared with $123 million in the third quarter of 2010, and margin improved 360 basis points. These results reflect great sales momentum in both traditional and WAAM sales, higher VPG and lower commission rates and cost of sales. Consumer finance revenues were down 2% due to a decrease in our contract receivables portfolio. However, interest expense on securitized debt decreased 22%, reflecting lower rates, partly offset by higher advance rates. Now remember that higher advance rates improve the company's available cash but decrease EBITDA as we report the interest expense on securitized debt above the EBITDA line.", "Write-offs in the portfolio during the third quarter were $73 million, down from $77 million a year ago. So the good news is that we saw a slight improvement in the performance of the portfolio. However, based on our experience during the 2008, 2009 downturn, we have concluded that it's prudent to maintain a slightly higher reserve balance. Therefore, in the third quarter, we booked a $96 million provision for loan loss compared with $85 million in the third quarter of 2010. This brings the reserve, relative to the overall portfolio, to 11.9%, up from 11.1% at the end of second quarter 2011 and 10.8% at the end of 2010. This means that we'll end the year slightly higher on the provision than we had originally expected, somewhere around 23% of gross realized sales.", "Our third revenue stream at Vacation Ownership, property management, also showed good strength. While property management revenues were flat, profit was up 6%, reflecting higher efficiencies. ", "Now turning to the ABS markets. In August, we announced a $300 million timeshare securitization with an advanced rate of 92% and a weighted average coupon of 4.01%. The transaction was oversubscribed, enabling us to increase the size of the offering. The terms of this financing were among the best ever for an ABS deal by Wyndham Worldwide. We were pleased, but not surprised, to see continued investor support for our program given the strong performance of our portfolio. ", "Finally, corporate expenses increased $3 million in the quarter, excluding legacy items, which primarily reflects the increased information security and IT expense. We continue to invest in data security to address this serious and increasing threat of data breaches facing all businesses today.", "Now I'd like to spend a few moments on guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.40 to $0.44, assuming a diluted share count of 158 million shares. As you saw from the press release, we are narrowing our full year revenue guidance to $4.225 billion to $4.275 billion, our adjusted EBITDA guidance to $965 million to $975 million and our G&A guidance to approximately $180 million. We are increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $2.41 to $2.45. ", "The new EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 167 million shares, down from our most recent guidance of 171 million shares. This new guidance reflects the benefit of our share repurchase program through the third quarter. The guidance excludes any further share repurchases. We currently have approximately, as of yesterday, $515 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.", "One final note on 2011. When you do the math, you'll see that we expect adjusted EBITDA to be slightly down in the fourth quarter when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Now this is explainable. It reflects the seasonality of our larger rentals business, continued unfavorable timing of higher marketing cost at the Hotel Group and increased information security cost here at corporate. ", "Our 2012 outlook indicates continued momentum in the businesses and significant growth enabled through free cash flow. We expect revenues of $4.425 billion to $4.6 billion, EBITDA of $1,030,000,000 to $1,055,000,000 and adjusted earnings per share of $2.72 to $2.82, assuming a diluted share count of 160 million shares. The share count assumption includes our repurchases through the end of the quarter, third quarter 2011.", "So let me conclude my remarks by reminding you that our capital allocation mantra is that cash is the great enabler. And our philosophy is simple. First, our current leverage ratio reflects an investment grade profile, plus we will seek to maintain our current leverage ratio. This means as we grow EBITDA, we will prudently add debt. Second, we will not retain cash on the balance sheet beyond our basic liquidity needs, which we believe are minimal. We will continue to deploy our significant available cash flow in a timely fashion to enhance shareholder value. ", "And then finally, we will increase dividends at least at the rate of growth of earnings. That translates to a cash commitment for dividends of approximately $100 million in 2011 based on our current payout. With all investment accounted for in the business, we will use the remainder of cash for share repurchases and growing our business. ", "And with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Tom. In summary, I'd like to reiterate a few points. Over the past several years, we have refined and sharpened our business model and capital allocation strategy. From the beginning, we have instilled and reinforced a culture of innovation and execution throughout the company. Our net result of this process of continuous improvement is a company with a solid and sound proven business and capital allocation strategy, which leads to strong, sustainable free cash flow and outstanding track record of operational and financial performance and innovation. And most importantly, great people. We believe this is a powerful formula for creating sustainable shareholder value as we move forward.", "With that Kelly, let's open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Greff from JP Morgan.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I have a quick question on tuck-in acquisitions. Obviously, last year was a very big year, and this year, the focus has been taking capital, deploying it into buyback. Are you currently seeing anything out there of any good values that makes sense? Are you warm in any M&A? And then is there anything out there, from an M&A perspective, that you think could be more favorable or generate better returns for you than buying in stock?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Joe. I think that there are a couple of thoughts within the questions that you asked. One, are there deals out there? Yes, there are deals out there. Are they at a value that are attractive to us? Well, we haven't executed anything this year, so that might indicate that the values have not been in the zone. But more importantly, you can't really model opportunity. You don't know when the deal is going to come at the right value that makes sense for us. We're very disciplined. As I noted in my prepared comments, we execute extremely well on acquisitions. We know how to do it. We know how to do it right, but we also know how to be disciplined about it. So I can't -- so the second part of your question I can't really answer: Is there anything out there that might be of interest, that might be better at buying back stock? What I can tell you is that we're constantly looking. We're constantly reviewing, and we're a serious partner to look at transactions. But we are disciplined, and I think people recognize that and understand it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I know, Tom, you touched on it briefly, but would you mind commenting a little bit more on how you're thinking about your leverage ratio. And will you guys continue to lever incremental EBITDA and maybe that's 3 times that you've noted in the past. And then I have a follow-up on your VOI inventory if you don't mind.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Sure. So right now we're split rated. We're investment grade by S&P. We're one notch off of investment grade with Moody's with a positive outlook, so we're encouraged by that qualification. And we think, in this environment, it's really important to remain investment grade. We want to remain investment grade. And so we don't really believe that we need to de-lever when we grow EBITDA. Effectively, it we weren't to add that equivalent level of debt, then we deceptively will be de-levering. We're -- because of our business models, Carlos -- Carlo, we don't think we really need to de-lever, because they're all structure, degenerate cash flow, and so we feel quite good at staying at that level. And right now, the ratio is around  3 to 3.3x EBITDA that we're trying to manage to. So as we look at it simplistically, if we were to add $70 million or $80 million of EBITDA next year, then along those lines, assuming that the environment stays reasonably normal, we would seek to add another couple of hundred million dollars of debt to our balance sheet or thereabouts. Again, the reason we're comfortable saying that is because our business models are structured in a way that generates significant amounts of cash flow, and we have ample levers to pull if we needed to, to sustain or even enhance that cash flow if we wanted to without impacting the momentum of the business.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Great, that's helpful. And then in terms of your -- the 1.1 billion of VOI inventory as of 3Q, that was virtually unchanged from 2Q levels. Do you guys kind of have an update on the expected life of that inventory?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "It's a subject of lively debate here. We've said that we believe we -- I think in our Q, we said that we believe we have enough inventory with some incremental investments to about 2015. What's happening a bit, Carlo, is that because our COGS are improving in this business, our rate of takedown on inventory in the balance sheet is slowing just a little bit. Or our sales aren't, but because our COGS are not at 25% as they were historically but closer to 20%, the takedown in inventory was just going to be -- it gives us flexibility. We have a ton of flexibility on how we can manage inventory going forward. We're -- we feel like we have a great deal of flexibility for many years to come. But Steve, do you have a...", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, I would just add, Carlo, that we are -- every quarter, we look at kind of an outlook of what the inventory will look like running through our sales machine for the succeeding 12 months. And we adjust it and tinker with it, and that impacts how much WAAM we do, how much we pull down off our balance sheet, what our investment pace is to complete the inventory to pull down off the balance sheet. So we're very mindful of kind of what our return is going to be for the capital we're putting out or doing more WAAM deals and allowing the inventory to sit on the balance sheet. So we're trying to manage it as thoughtfully and as efficiently as possible.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Patrick Scholes from FBR Capital Markets.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "A couple of questions here. First is on distressed timeshare inventory. Past couple of quarters, you've discussed that you're actively looking for that. Have you actually been able to go out and purchase anything that you would view as distressed? And if so, how should we, as far as analysts, think about the product cost of purchasing distressed versus the product cost of building?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, Patrick, from a product cost standpoint, it's clearly going to be a lot less than the 25%, as Tom mentioned before, that we historically have run. It's going to be at that 20% or below level probably if we can acquire it. The way I would characterize the market is there's a tremendous amount of product out there. Not all product is easy to deliver on, because maybe there's some that's already been sold in a regime that requires some time to convert it to timeshare. So it's not as if it's sitting out there on a shelf to just be picked and brought into our inventory. But on the other hand, there's a tremendous amount of product out there. So we are constantly looking. We have a team that travels around the country looking at product, turning over rocks, finding the best possible product for us. So I would characterize it as there is a lot of product out there. One of the dynamics that you see in place is when the downturn hit in 2008, 2009, there were a lot of funds that were pulled together to buy distressed inventory. They bought the inventory. They've been sitting on it for 3 years now, and it's not moving very much. They don't see the recovery happening. And so there are opportunities now to harvest some of that off, because people want to move their investments along, and they want to reallocate capital. So I think that there will be and we will continue to see, the industry will see a lot of product kind of flowing and available. But it all takes work, because it requires -- there are usually broken situations that need to be fixed, but that's something we happen to be pretty good at.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Good. Just 2 more questions here. One, in your prepared remarks, you have talked about taking, adding more screens as far as the credit quality of your timeshare buyer. How have FICO scores been tracking of the new buyers? What's been the trend on that?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "The trend has been upward, and that's a function of a couple of things, Patrick. One is this credit worthiness prescreening that we're doing. That will have an impact. But that probably, frankly, over the last couple of quarters, have had less of an impact than the fact that we increased the downpayment amount. And that, by it's nature, requiring people to put more cash down, tends to filter towards a higher FICO score customer. So we would -- we think we'll probably continue to see a FICO score improvement over time.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Are you about 700 right now for your typical new buyer?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "It's a little bit above 700.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay. So it's good. That's done better. And then lastly, on the -- your new Bonnet Creek hotel, what are your long-term plans for ownership on that? I mean, will you eventually sell it? Or do you think you own it perpetuity? And then in that regard, what was your actual cost to build and open the property?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, the -- I'll let Tom handle the cost of the property as he may have that handy. But the property -- I'll give a little bit of a sideline. I was down there, actually, on Monday night for a conference that we had down there. It was -- it's a spectacular property, and it's set right in our timeshare resort area. It -- our long-term view of the property from an ownership standpoint is we're not in the business of owning hard assets. We're not in the business of owning hotels. It's not something that we necessarily want to do long term. However, the market, at this time, is not attractive for selling. We're going to get a great return on this asset. We feel very comfortable with it. It's a great complementary piece to our timeshare business down there, with 1,400 timeshare units around it. But I would say that if the right offer came, we would probably consider selling it. Having said that, we're now marketing -- marketing it now. It's on our balance sheet. We've -- for the interim term, we've assumed that we'll be owning it.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes. And Patrick, the amount of money we spent was around $125 million on the hotel.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Amanda Bryant from Susquehanna.", "Amanda Bryant - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "You've obviously made great strides migrating customers to the web at RCI. How high can web penetration realistically go? And what, if anything, can you do to grow your exchange membership base?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, Amanda, from a \"how high can it go\" standpoint, we're not actually sure how high we can get it. It really is a function of how much our customers want to migrate and use that forum. We're up to 39% in the exchange business. If you look at it as a proxy of our rental businesses in Europe, they run 60%, 60-plus percent. And so there's -- if that's a line to use as a marker, we are doing things to make it more attractive to book online, and so I think we'll continue to skew that way. And I think as more people get familiar with using it and the transparency that it gives and this recommendation engine, which is really cool -- if you've stayed on beachside resorts before and you're looking for one, it will come up with recommendations that fit your capabilities and the dates that -- your point capability as well as the dates that you want to travel. So it's going to be a different way for people to transact, and we think it will draw people there. The other part of the question was on growth?", "Amanda Bryant - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "How to grow the exchange membership base?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes, the membership base. Well the membership base is really a function of developers selling more timeshare. And right now, the environment is still what it was 2 years ago, which is the medium and small developers having a hard time getting access to capital. Therefore, it's difficult for them to finance the receivables they generate when they sell timeshare, and therefore, their sales are off pretty dramatically. The big guys are still selling and still doing very well. Those of us who access the ABS markets, obviously, that's been terrific. And there are a number of the large players in our industry who don't even use the ABS market. They just work off their own balance sheet. So for the big guys, it's still good. For the little guys, it's still challenged. We need those little guys to come back to really drive membership base growth. We'll win a few and lose a few affiliates over the years. We always have, and we always probably will, but the real difference maker will be when development comes back online and we see those smaller developers selling more product. I think that the online capabilities we have now and the flexibility that we're giving our members might attract some that have lapsed to come back on when they see that they can really learn how to use the product better, and they can have more flexibility, and they can have more control over their own destiny. I think that will help re-attract members who have lapsed, but to see new ones come on board will require the development at the mid to small developer level.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Chris Agnew from MKM Partners.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to ask about the credit worthiness prescreening program. How much impact did you see in that in the quarter? And how much more room for improvement from this initiative do you think you have going forward? And then I have a quick follow-up on loan loss provision.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Sure. Well, the credit worthiness program is in rollout phase right now. As I said, we're at about 75% of our offsite sales locations. So I don't have sitting in front of me right now the specific impact. We did see an improvement to the marketing cost in our timeshare division. Kind of hard to, with this kind of small piece of information, to equate the marketing cost decreases to that specific program. But we do expect it to have a significant impact, and we will talk about it going forward once it's fully integrated into the -- across the board. So I don't mean to be vague. I just don't have a specific impact, because it's been such a short period of time, and it's not fully integrated across our system.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Got it. And then just on the loan loss provision. I mean, you did mention that it's -- you're being prudent based on 2008, 2009 experience. But I mean are you seeing actually anything in the data, whether what write-offs or performance of receivables that's giving you any cause for caution?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "We actually saw improvement in our portfolio during the quarter, Chris, and I think that's the most important thing. We are -- we've mentioned this on past calls. There has been a recovery. If you recall where we're at into 2009, I think we were at about 30% of gross CLI. We're down to 22% to 23%, which we consider to be meaningful improvement. But we've -- have cautioned people that our buyers haven't returned, and their practices haven't returned to the pre-2008, 2009 behavior. And therefore, we were trying to moderate expectations at how immediately we would go back to the levels that we saw in 2008, which were around 17% or 18% gross CLI. So we see, in general, the trends to be encouraging. And -- but we're -- again, we've cautioned people to expect a moderate improvement, a slow and moderate improvement in our buyers, not an immediate return to pre-2008 levels.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.", "Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I just had some broad questions on margins and some of the -- and the fourth quarter EBITDA decline. So first on the fourth quarter EBITDA decline, I don't completely understand the seasonality issue or the timing of higher marketing cost at the Hotel Group or information security. I mean, those seem like relatively modest expenses, yet it's putting pressure on the overall EBITDA. So that's number one. And then just broadly on margins, you mentioned earlier that your cost of goods sold is going lower, from 25% to 20%, and I don't understand why that's happening. I think that's for timeshare. And is there really a bigger opportunity -- margin opportunity for timeshare sales because we're -- because you're really moving to more asset, like, financing more of this? And is that being offset by paying for higher fees or product cost to the property owner?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Okay. So let's answer your first question first, which was the fourth quarter decline in EBITDA?", "Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Right.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes. Okay. So as you know, we made acquisitions in the vacation rental business. The vacation rental business is a highly seasonal business where the EBITDA is generated in quarters 2 and 3, and you basically sustain losses in the quarters 1 and 4. It's not losses, just marginal profitability. So as we sort of double down a bit, last year, on these European vacation rental businesses, we saw an exacerbation of that seasonal effect, just bigger businesses or a larger commitment to a business where there are losses in the fourth quarter. So that -- I think that's pretty easily understood. At least, I understand it. The second issue is information security costs. I think on every call that we've made this year, Steve, every quarterly call that we've made, we said that we were investing in information security. Really, we kicked off the initiative at the third quarter of last year, but we really have increased investment spending on information security, which is a corporate expense, significantly this year. I mean, it's -- the incremental spend on information is measured in the tens of millions of dollars, incremental spending against last year. So if we're doing more of that than we had at the end of last year, where the program was more of nascent program and now, a fully functioning program, that would seem to indicate that we're going to spend more in information security on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the fourth quarter than we did last year. And then the final issue is the timing of marketing spend. And so the timing of marketing spend which -- this is directed strictly at our hotel business. We have benefited in the first half of year by delayed marketing spend, where we received the royalty equivalent for marketing spend from franchisees but underspent the amount of money that came in. And in the third and fourth quarter, we're effectively spending that money, which was already taken in previously but reflected a benefit for us in the first half of the year. Now it's working against us, because we're spending more than we're actually taking in on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but that's because money is accumulated in the first half of the year that we're spending in the second half of the year.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Right. And as we mentioned on previous calls, Steve, part of the beat in the Hotel Group in the first and second quarter were specifically related to timing of marketing, which we mentioned because we knew this was a question of timing, not a question of the profitability for the full year.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes. So I think that was the first question as it related to why is the fourth quarter EBITDA coming down. I think the second quarter had to do...", "Stephen P. Holmes", "The only other thing I'd add to that is bear in mind that the fourth quarter overall is about 50% less than the third quarter. So when you have these impacts, like IT, additional spend, it has a more meaningful impact on a much smaller base. I'm pretty sure it was about margins, I think. And you're right, Steve. It's in the -- the cost of goods sale, which was your specific question, is in the timeshare business. The reason that it's 20% versus 25% is some of that distressed inventory that we have picked up and we've been able to flow through our P&L and sell, it's just a matter of basically managing the environment. Well, to be quite honest, the real estate group and the timeshare group have done a great job of managing our costs and our sales down. In addition, our efficiency has gone up, so we're actually selling more efficiently, which means that if you have the same base of cost with a more efficient sale, you also will dry down your cost of goods sold.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes. The other thing that I think is really important for everyone to realize, and we talk this on our visits with investors and analysts, is that there is a structural bias to lower cost of goods sold in this business. And that's because when we take back inventory for defaults, we resell them at considerably higher prices than they were first sold. So as long as people keep returning to us, we'll always be able to sell them inventory that's returned to us because of our points base system at a higher price than the price of the original inventory. And so I think there is a structural bias to a lower cost of goods sold. I don't know how low it's going to take us, but Steve, our plans are that one of the drivers of EBITDA performance in this business as we go forward will be continuing lowered cost of goods sold over the next 5 years.", "Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "If I can just follow up though, vacation rental margins were a little bit lower this quarter. And I guess I'm trying to balance out what sounds like many efficiencies being created on the RCI side being offset by the acquisitions, if I'm getting that right. When do -- when does the efficiencies on the RCI side offset some of the these -- it sounds like lower margins on the acquisitions of the rental business?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, it's pretty basic, Steve. The rental business has a lower margin, proper margin than the exchange business. The rental business is growing more rapidly than the exchange business. So as long as the rental business with the lower margin is growing faster than the exchange business with a higher margin, there'll be some pressure on margin within that overall unit. And as I've said, I think a year ago, our goal for that business was to try to keep the overall segment, Exchange and Rentals, at a constant margin by being more efficient on the exchange side as we grew the rental side. And depending on how quickly that rental fees grows, we may or may not be successful in achieving that goal, but that has been our goal for that business. Hopefully, this year kind of sets a level that will be add going forward, because we didn't have any acquisitions that we've done this year, but I can't predict what we're going to do in the future.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Harry Curtis from Nomura.", "Harry Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Two quick questions. You talked about, a little bit earlier, about the pipeline of distressed timeshare inventory. Can you talk a little bit more about the competition there is for that product? It's probably not too intense now, but are you getting any sense that some of the other timeshare companies are beginning to filter into that strategy as well? And then the second question is when you consider the amount of cash flow that you have available for repurchase in 2012, how -- will it be greater, about the same or somewhat less than 2011?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay, Harry. The -- as I said before, there's a lot of product out there. I think any good idea has followers, so I'm sure that others are following. And in fact, I know others are following the -- our WAAM concept in looking at products to be brought in on a -- on our -- what we call our WAAM basis. I don't think it's significant though, because there's so much out there. We're, frankly, more efficient than anybody else. So I think we're probably -- as we've been in the past, probably the most likely buyer of product that we want to get our hands on. We will continue to be very critical of the product quality that we bring in. Not that others wouldn't be, but we're going to keep a very close eye on product quality. So I think that there will be other people in the market doing this. They are there now, and I think they'll continue to be. But I don't think that's at all an impediment to our ability to bring product on board. I think the bigger impediment, frankly, and the bigger timing issue is what I mentioned before. You've got a, let's say, a whole ownership condo development that only sold out 5% of their inventory. It's sitting there, 95% unsold, but the homeowner documents say that they can't do timeshare. So that 5% that's bought previously has to kind of open their eyes and say, \"If we don't agree to allow a timeshare regime to come in, we're going to sit with this half-baked product. And it's going to be very difficult for us to improve the product and keep it up, because you got 95% of the product sitting, owned by some bank that really doesn't want to invest in it.\" So that's more the process of this distressed inventory situation, and I think that we're -- we've been in the midst of it for now, a couple of years. We know what needs to be done. We know which ones are likely to be able to move, and we will continue to work the marketplace.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Harry, your second question was on 2012 cash flow, so let's look at the components for a second. Free cash flow, we're guiding is going to be $600 million to $700 million last year. This year, we set it $725 million. But $67 million of that $725 million is a onetime benefit that we got from recovering some bad payments that had been made previously along with associated interest. So if you take the $725 million and you subtract out $67 million, you get to -- what's that number? It's like $660 million? Okay, something like that. Thanks. So around $660 million. So I'd say that free cash flow right now is probably going to be, ballpark, on an aggregate, our guidance is $600 million to $700 million, it's in the ballpark, on free cash flow. One of the benefits we got this year that enabled to spend a little extra on capital allocation was our advance rate differential on our ABS transactions was materially better this year than it was last year. And we shared previously that that advance rate differential benefited us to the tune of around $100 million plus of incremental cash. Now our advance rates this year have been 92%, 98%. We're not encouraging anyone to model anything better than that. And so maybe that advantage that we had in 2011 won't accrue to us in 2012. We're not sure. It's too early to tell. And then the final question is what will we do in continuing to maintain our leverage ratio. Right now, I think our guidance is for an incremental $70 million to $80 million of EBITDA. So if we were to lever on top of the $70 million to $80 million of EBITDA, that would generate another couple of hundred million dollars, potentially, of available cash. So I think that's pretty consistent with this year. So I think at a year-to-year comparison, maybe the only difference will be -- and I'm talking in approximations here. The only difference will be that we're not counting on better advance rates than 98% advance rates.", "Harry Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And any meaningful difference in acquisition activity?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Hard to project. As Steve said, you can't project these things. But Steve, do you have...", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Harry, we're you talking about the acquisition of inventory or acquisition of companies?", "Harry Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Companies.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Of companies. Yes, again, like Tom said, we can't predict what that's going to look like. We don't know what opportunities will be out there, but we'll continue to be disciplined around it.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from Joe Greff from JPMorgan.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Tom, do you plan on accessing the securitization market in the fourth quarter? And if so, can you talk about what sort of size of the offering that you're thinking of?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Joe, hard for me to answer that question for legal reasons, but we generate about $1 billion of receivables here. In general, we do 2 to 3 deals a year, so hard for me to answer the question, big guy.", "Operator", "I am showing no further questions.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "All right. Well, thank you very much. Thanks to all for joining us today, and we'll speak to you after the fourth quarter.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Bye.", "Operator", "Thank you. And that concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the call over to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Margo C. Happer", "Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO; and Tom Conforti, our CFO.", "Before we get started, I just want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking information. This information is subject to a number of risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-Q filed October 26, 2011, with the SEC. We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these measures to GAAP is provided in the tables to the press release. It is also available on the Investor Relations of our website at wyndhamworldwide.com. Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thank you, Margo. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us and welcome to our 2011 year-end call. It was a great year for Wyndham Worldwide. We produced adjusted EBITDA growth of 13% and adjusted EPS growth of 25%. We generated over $750 million of free cash flow and over $1 billion in available cash. These results and our long term earnings and cash flow outlook give us confidence to raise our dividend by 53%. This increase is consistent with our policy of growing our dividend, at least at the rate of growth of our business. ", "During 2011, we repurchased 17% of our outstanding shares for $902 million, buying 28.7 million shares at an average price of $31.45. Since our launch as a public company in August 2006, we have repurchased 65 million shares for $2 billion at an average price of just under $31. Operationally, we continue to execute against our strategic initiatives throughout our company. At Wyndham Hotel Group, Apollo, our series of initiatives aimed at improving our value proposition to our hotel owners, is well underway and we are seeing measurable success, which I will discuss in a moment. At Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, our RCI team delivered yet another series of technology upgrades to our web capability, increasing customer satisfaction, online share and operating margins. We also made significant progress growing our North American rentals platform with the integration of ResortQuest, exceeding our expectations. And we continue to achieve record efficiency levels at Wyndham Vacation Ownership with margins up over 250 basis points and an EBITDA increase of 17% for the year. ", "Before going into 2001 (sic) [2011] results, let me spend a few minutes on what we're seeing in the economy and within our sector. Despite many macro twists and turns in 2011, the geographic and demographic diversity of our businesses and the resiliency of our fee-for-service business models provided a stable base for us to grow. We expect that also to be the case in 2012. In 2011, hotel industry demand hit a new all-time high, with more room nights sold than ever before. However, rates charged for hotel rooms have not recovered to pre-2009 levels. The net is that RevPAR improved during 2011 and we believe this positive trend should continue in 2012. ", "  According to a study conducted by Atmosphere Research Group in October, while only 29% of U.S. travelers favorably viewed their 2011 financial condition, 43% believe their finances will be better in 2012. And travelers who expect their finances to improve outnumber those who are pessimistic about their finances by more than 2 to 1. Most travelers expect to take the same number of trips, which is 7 on average, in 2012 as they did in 2011. They also expect to spend about the same amount of money on travel as last year, which is about $3,200. This is consistent with the continuing, gradual recovery we foresee in our U.S. businesses, which contribute nearly 70% of our EBITDA. In the hotel group, we finished 2011 ahead of expectations and we expect a strong 2012 with RevPAR increases of 5% to 8%. In our Exchange and Rental business, 2011 was our first full year with ResortQuest and North American Vacation Rentals market. This business is running ahead of our plans, with great momentum carrying into 2012. RCI held its annual affiliate event in New York last month. The record attendance indicates that interest among timeshare developers is strong and growing. New sources of financing for the overall timeshare industry are still evolving, and the mood was more optimistic than I've seen in a long time. And of course, our own timeshare business continues to exceed expectations. Despite some significant dips in consumer confidence during the year, our timeshare owners continue to demonstrate the value they place on vacations with arrivals at our resorts reaching an all-time high. And our sales force demonstrated its ability to sell the product, as volume per guest also reached all-time highs. So in the U.S., we expect to see a continuing gradual improvement in the economy. ", " ", " In Europe, however, where the majority of our Vacation Rental businesses are based, the economic climate remains challenging and the future uncertain. In this region, which is about 15% of our EBITDA, we continue to see the shortening of booking windows and pressure on yields as customers become increasingly value focused. Despite these challenges, the strong value proposition of our products and the strength of our established local brands lead us to expect that our European Rentals business will remain stable in 2012. ", " ", " Against this economic backdrop, we continue to focus on 2 areas to increase shareholder value. The first is a focus on execution. That means ensuring we execute to capture more than our fair share of the U.S. economy recover. We expect our domestic RevPAR, for example, gains to be ahead of the industry. Great execution also means taking steps to mitigate the impact of a potential economic downturn in Europe. As always, we'll be disciplined in discretionary spending, and we'll continue to invest in our resilient fee-for-service businesses. ", " ", " One final comment on execution is that we have strong operating plans that leverage our competitive advantages and we are adaptable to changing conditions. We've proven our ability to operate in difficult conditions over the last 5 years and we expect nothing less in 2012. The second area of focus is capital allocation. In 2011 we returned $1 billion of available cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We have a well established capital allocation plan, which includes investing in our businesses through acquisitions, paying dividends and share repurchases, and we will continue to execute against that framework. Tom will discuss this more in detail later.", "Now let's take a look at our business units in more detail. Wyndham Hotel Group continues to make great progress in executing its online strategy as part of its Apollo initiatives. Online bookings are a growing portion of the hotel reservation process and now account for about 1/3 of total hotel and lodging industry revenue. Study show consumers are spending on an increasing amount of time shopping and comparing hotel options online, often visiting between 8 to 15 different websites to make an informed decision. Our goal is to capture a maximum amount of that traffic and to ensure that page views result in booking click-throughs or conversions. We've developed a comprehensive multifaceted plan to drive more room nights to our hotels through our online direct distribution channels. The launch of our new hotel brand websites and improved content were the first steps. Most of our brand websites have now been updated. Results are excellent with conversion rates up on average 20%. ", " ", " In December, we piloted TripAdvisor ratings and reviews on wyndhamrewards.com. Industry research indicates that up to 1/2 of consumers will not book a hotel without reading a review. Making ratings and reviews readily available on our own sites ensures consumers don't have to leave our site to get that information. Initial results of the pilot are positive. We plan on adding TripAdvisor ratings to all our brand websites in 2012. We have also launched an umbrella cross-brand website, wyndhamhotelgroup.com, which is designed to aggregate traffic and provide a vehicle to attract consumers who are looking to shop all of our brands on one site. These efforts are supported by another initiative under our direct strategy, our investment along with 5 other hotel companies in roomkey.com. We believe roomkey.com will provide consumers with a trustworthy and uncluttered way to compare and book hotels through a superior hotel shopping experience, while driving bookings directly to our own online channels. roomkey.com provides a new cost effective channel for our owners and will better meet the needs of consumers who currently shop across multiple sites before booking. ", "  ", "Wyndham Hotel Group will be rolling out additional initiatives over the course of the year, including new mobile sites and apps, all designed to drive more online businesses and develop a more profitable channel mix for the owners of our hotels. Of course, we have had much success in driving online transactions within our Wyndham Exchange and Rentals unit where over the course of 3 years, we have built the best online timeshare exchange and club servicing platform in the industry. We are pleased with the results of our latest rci.com enhancements introduced in October. As we've explained previously, this release includes several major milestones such as improved search functionalities like points members and the innovative recommendation engine, which provides proactive travel recommendations to members based on their individual preferences. The results since launch have been measurable, with favorable feedback from users and increases in points transactions and web share. In the fourth quarter, we saw a 7% increase in points transactions, and we continue to see the resulting improved efficiency in our exchange operations, with online transactions share growing to 39% in the fourth quarter compared to 30% in last year's fourth quarter and 13% when we started the project. ", " ", " On the rental side, we made great progress in growing our North American rental business in the fourth quarter by integrating 2 acquisitions in key Colorado and Florida markets. ResortQuest finished off a great 2011, meeting revenue goals and exceeding earnings expectations by capitalizing on the operating synergies within Wyndham Worldwide. In 2012, we expect continued growth in our North American rental business, with additional synergies expected to drive improved efficiency and growth in earnings. In addition to organic growth, we hope to add to this business through select acquisitions in 2012.", "We're also pleased with the performance of our Vacation Rental businesses in Europe. As you know, we have many well-established brands with loyal customer bases across the U.K., Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. Despite the challenging conditions, our businesses remain stable. We expect the same for the upcoming year as Europeans continue to look to Vacation Rentals as a great value, and our product is located where they want to vacation.", "Finally, turning to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which had another great year, generating over $500 million in EBITDA. The businesses outperformed our expectations every quarter since we rightsized the business in late 2008. In addition to achieving significant efficiencies, the team has continued to refine its business model to support our corporate focus on fee-for-service businesses that generate significant free cash flow. The first step was establishing Wyndham asset affiliation model, or WAAM, which offers turnkey solutions for developers or banks holding newly developed inventory, which we sell for a fee through our sales and marketing channels. In 2011, with healthy conditions in the ABS market, we introduced what we call WAAM 2.0, where we sell not only the inventory, but also offer consumer loans. WAAM 2.0 has continued to evolve. Our goal is to capture the attractive spreads available through financing and preserve our capitalized operating philosophy. We signed our first WAAM 2.0 deal in December 2011, and expect to start sales in the third quarter of 2012.", "Last quarter, I spoke of a new marketing initiative on our timeshare business, which enables us to better target new buyers. As you know, new owner acquisition is an important strategy for Wyndham Vacation Ownership. It's critical that we maintain a healthy pool of lifetime buyers of vacation ownership as new owners drive upgrade sales in the future. I'm pleased to report that during 2011 we added approximately 27,000 new owners exceeding our goal. We expect continued strength in 2012 as we remain focused on generating high quality tours and improving our already high efficiencies. ", "  In summary, 2011 was a strong year across the board, and I'm excited about 2012 and our ability to continue delivering value to shareholders. Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to comment on our Count On Me! culture at Wyndham Worldwide. We just received results from our biannual employee survey. Our employee engagement scores ranked with best-in-class companies. This indicates that Wyndham Associates are committed, loyal and proud. They have a strong sense of personal responsibility in delivering a great experience for our customers and great results for the company. And while it's gratifying to see the survey results, I wasn't surprised because I see the real proof everyday in the action of our associates and every quarter in our results. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Thanks, Steve. I'm going to focus the bulk of my comments today on our fourth quarter results and 2012 guidance. As far as our results for 2011, let me echo to Steve's comment that 2011 was a terrific year and that the fourth quarter ended on a good note. Our fourth quarter results reflect continued strong business unit execution and our ongoing commitment to focus on generating cash and making smart capital allocation decisions. We came in $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range, reflecting the impact of the fourth quarter share repurchases, as well as lower interest expense, D&A and taxes. ", " ", " Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the impact of $44 million of non-cash impairment charges related to the lodging business, was flat compared to the same period of 2010, and slightly better than our expectations. Remember that we had expected quarter 4 EBITDA to be down year-over-year reflecting, among other factors, the seasonality of our larger rentals business, continued unfavorable timing of higher marketing costs at the Hotel Group and increased information security costs at corporate. ", "  Free cash flow increased to $754 million for the full year. Now excluding the one-time VAT refund and related interest income of $67 million, free cash flow normalized to $687 million for the year. As you know, I have said often that cash is the great enabler. We will use our significant free cash flow to support growth and build shareholder value. This will enable us to invest in the business, including acquisitions, pay dividends and repurchase stock. We expect the deployment of cash flow, combined with the organic growth of our businesses, to generate annual earnings per share growth approximating 20% a year over the next 5 years. ", " ", " As Steve noted, the Board of Directors has authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.23 per share, which is a 32% payout at the midpoint of our 2012 net income guidance range. In addition, we repurchased 6.7 million shares of stock in the fourth quarter, spending $225 million. In 2012, through market close last evening, we purchased an additional 1.5 million shares for a total of $60 million. We continue to believe that share repurchase offers a compelling return. ", "  ", "Now moving to operating performance for the quarter. Let's begin the segment review with our Hotel Group. Revenues are up 15% compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. Now a portion of that increase reflects a reporting reclassification of $15 million which had no impact on EBITDA. Excluding reclassifications, revenues were up 6% reflecting improved domestic RevPAR, and incremental revenues from our newly opened Wyndham Grand Hotel in Orlando. ", "  As mentioned earlier, we had non-cash writeoffs at the Hotel Group in the fourth quarter. Let me take a minute to walk you through the components of this non-cash charge. First, when we purchased the Wyndham brand in 2005, we allocated a portion of the purchase price to approximately 60 of the existing franchise and management contracts, creating an intangible asset on the balance sheet. The brand has evolved over the past 6 years and many of those original contracts are no longer in the system. As a result, we have recorded an asset impairment of approximately $14 million. We now have 100 hotels in the Wyndham Hotel and Resorts brand, and nearly 70% are new flags since acquisition.", "Second, we have determined that we are unlikely to realize expected returns from investments at 3 managed properties, and we believe the prudent course is to write down the investments by approximately $30 million. These investments made at the height of the market were primarily related to development advances and management agreements. Now again, these are non-cash asset impairments. Excluding the impact of these charges, adjusted EBITDA was up 3% reflecting RevPAR improvement and lower bad debt expense, partially offset by the unfavorable timing of marketing costs, which we described in our third quarter call. RevPAR recovery continued in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, system-wide RevPAR increased 5%. Now in the U.S. fourth quarter RevPAR improved 8.4% versus a year ago, reflecting improvements in both occupancy and rate.", "International RevPAR was down 3% due primarily to the rapid growth of lower RevPAR hotels in China and some softness in Europe. We ended the year with 613,100 rooms in the system. Excluding the Corinthia and Ramada U.K. terminations, which we disclosed in the previous quarters, the system size increased by 1%. The pipelines sit at nearly 112,000 rooms at December 31, 2011, down slightly sequentially, reflecting strong room openings of close to 15,000 in quarter 4.", "For the full year, contract signings were up 15% compared with 2010, and we executed 399 conversion deals compared with 363 deals in 2010, about a 10% increase.", "Wyndham Exchange and Rentals did a great job of delivering their financial results despite FX headwinds and a difficult economic environment in Europe. Total revenue in constant currency was up 4% in the fourth quarter reflecting acquisitions, which contributed $14 million in incremental revenues. Excluding acquisitions and the net effect of foreign currency, revenue was flat. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $4 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of acquisitions in foreign currency. The impact of the acquisitions of Vacation Rental businesses, which have seasonally light sales in the fourth quarter, exacerbated quarter-to-quarter comparisons. Reflecting negative foreign exchange impact, exchange revenues decreased by 2% in the quarter. The average number of members was flat. In constant currency, exchange revenue and exchange revenue per member were also flat. ", "  Vacation Rental revenues increased 10% in the fourth quarter compared with the same period of 2010. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency, Vacation Rental revenue was flat, with average net price per rental up 5% and Vacation Rental transactions down 5%. This reflects active yield management offset by volume declines at our Dutch and U.K. businesses, consistent with the lower consumer confidence in those regions.", "Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business once again delivered outstanding results. Revenues in EBITDA in the one in the fourth quarter of 2011 both increased 6% with tours up 8% and volume per guest up 4% versus the fourth quarter of 2010. We also benefited from higher WAAM conditions. We made good progress in expanding our pool of lifetime buyers of vacation ownership. In 2011, we welcomed 27,000 new WV owners to the Wyndham family, that's a 23% increase compared with 2010 and has exceeded our goal for the year. Our property management business continued to contribute predictable recurring fee-for-service revenues in 2011, producing $56 million of EBITDA. Consumer finance revenues in the quarter were down slightly, reflecting the decrease in our contract receivable portfolio. And interest expense was flat. ", " ", " Looking at portfolio performance, delinquency and default rates were flat. Accordingly, the provision for loan loss was flat and writeoffs during the fourth quarter were $75 million. As Steve mentioned, we signed our first WAAM 2.0 deal. Now the accounting for these transactions will run inventory through our balance sheet on a just-in-time basis. We'll record the inventory on the balance sheet at registration and pay for the inventory shortly after each sales transaction. Going forward, we will refer to this type of deal as WAAM/Just in Time. This arrangement will enable us to capture the attractive consumer finance EBITDA, while optimizing the balance sheet and cash flow. ", "  Now moving to corporate. Excluding legacy related items, corporate expenses were higher, primarily reflecting increased data security and higher employee-related- costs. Now let's turn to our 2012 guidance. We're going to post full guidance details including cash flow to our Investor Relations website following the call. To give you the highlights, revenue guidance remains at $4.4 billion  to $4.6 billion, up 4% to 8% from 2011, and EBITDA guidance remains at $1,030,000,000 to $1,055,000,000 up 6% to 8% from 2011. Because of share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2011, we are raising our EPS guidance for 2012 to $2.85 to $3, with a diluted share count of approximately 153 million shares, which assumes no additional share repurchases in 2012.", "Those ranges translate to approximately 18% EPS growth at the midpoint of the range. For the first quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.53 to $0.56 per share. Now please note that as cash flow and share repurchase continue to be an important part of our investment thesis, we have considered whether to include share repurchase in our guidance assumptions. We've decided to adhere to our current practice of not doing so to allow for investment in our business, including acquisitions when opportunities present themselves. We view share repurchase as an attractive opportunity as well, of course, which we will weigh against M&A opportunities in our capital allocation decision process.", "Now let's take a quick look at guidance at each of our business units, starting with the Hotel group. This year, our growth expectations for the lodging business reflect, in part, our decision to charge a higher licensing fee to our timeshare business for the use of the Wyndham brand, which we believe has been of tremendous benefit to our timeshare business over the past few years. Additionally, we expect increased contributions from our recently completed Wyndham Grand Hotel in Orlando. Excluding these new items, the normalized EBITDA growth rate for the Hotel Group for 2012 would be 8% to 10%. In addition, we expect RevPAR to be up by 5% to 8%, and a 1% to 3% increase in system size. We expect revenues to be $835 million to $875 million and EBITDA in the range of $260 million to $270 million.", "Moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. In exchange, we expect the average number of members to be flat to down 2%, primarily reflecting the loss of an affiliate with approximately 60,000 members. This affiliate's requests resulted in a situation that was no longer compelling for us. We expect exchange revenue per member to be flat to up 2%, reflecting higher transaction pricing in other member-related revenue, offset by negative currency impacts.", "In rentals, we expect transactions to be up 4% to 7% and average net price per Vacation Rentals to be flat to down 3%, reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Based on these drivers, we expect Wyndham Exchange and Rentals revenue of $1.44 billion to $1.51 billion, and EBITDA of $335 million to $355 million. Note that our growth expectations in Exchange and Rentals continues to be mid-single digits through 2015. The 2012 guidance reflects the current foreign exchange headwinds and the macro-environment challenges in Europe. ", "  ", "Finally, moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. We expect gross DOI sales to be up slightly from 2011 to $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion, which includes approximately $120 million in gross WAAM sales, a 1% to 4% increase in tours as we target more new owners and a 2% to 5% increase in volume per guest. We expect total segment revenues of $2.15 billion to $2.225 billion, and EBITDA of $515 million to $540 million. Excluding the increased licensing fee to the Hotel group, we expect a normalized growth rate at vacation ownership in the mid-single digits.", "Based on the improvements we've made to the credit standards and the performance of the portfolio, we are projecting that the provision for loan losses will continue to decline this year to $315 million to $335 million. Regarding our outlook for the ABS markets, 2011, of course, was our best year ever. We were able to obtain an average advance rate of 95% based on the quality of our portfolio and favorable market conditions. Each of our deals included a BB tranche. Going forward, we may choose not to access the BB market for each and every deal due to higher costs to secure investor demand. Accordingly, we expect 2012 advance rates to normalize in the high 80s.", "We expect corporate expenses for the year of approximately $93 million to $100 million, primarily reflecting continued investment in information security and IT in general. We expect depreciation and amortization to be $185 million to $190 million, somewhat higher than 2011, reflecting the opening of our Wyndham Grand Hotel in Orlando and technology investments. We expect interest expense of approximately $135 million to $140 million. Now remember, our intention is to maintain a stable leverage ratio, which means our goal would be to add debt as we add EBITDA. Our interest expense guidance assumes our current debt profile. Any additional debt will incur, of course, additional interest expense, and we'll update our guidance when and if appropriate. ", " ", " We expect our effective tax rate for the year to be 38% consistent with 2011. We also expect to spend $195 million to $210 million in CapEx. This is slightly higher than our 5-year plan baseline, which is about $180 million to $200 million. We expect to get back to those levels in the next year or so. We expect to spend between $110 million and $120 million in timeshare development in 2012, up from the $80 million we disclosed in 2011, and closer to our projection of a $150 million average over the 5-year period starting in 2011.", "Based on our current forecast, we expect free cash flow to be in the $600 million to $700 million range. With financing activities, we expect that 2012 available cash could be close to $1 billion. We will use that additional cash, of course, to invest in the business including M&A and a return to shareholders through additional share repurchase. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Tom. As I think about the macro environment and our opportunities for 2012, I feel good about where we are positioned. We continue our track record of exceptional execution across all of our businesses. We continue to generate strong cash flow and we continue to deploy that cash to maximize shareholder value. With that, Shirley, let's open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Our first question comes from Joe Greff with JPMC.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Two quick questions here, one on the lodging side and then one on vacation ownership. I think you'd mentioned earlier on the hotel side you expect your domestic RevPAR growth to outpace the industry. I was hoping one, you could just give us some rationalization on why do you think that, and maybe where you think the industry growth is going to be in '12. And then on vacation ownership on WAAM 2.0, or WAAM/Just in Time, did that change, when you look at the next couple of years, how big WAAM could potentially be as a percentage of overall vacation ownership revenues? I mean, could it be larger than, say, 15%? Those are my questions.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "With respect to RevPAR outpacing, there's a couple of things contributing to that. First of all, the initiatives that we've put in place over the last several years, these Apollo initiatives that we've talked about, are really starting to kick in now. Our websites have been upgraded and they needed to be upgraded and they've been upgraded. And some of the other online initiatives will continue to drive traffic to those websites and we hope to convert and capture more. So I think that is one element of helping. The other element helping is our mix. As we add more Wyndham product, which we have a very good pipeline of, that Wyndham product comes at a higher RevPAR, so just the general mix of us should lift us above the average if you looked at just our component pieces. So that's really the reason for the RevPAR, what we think will be an outpaced RevPAR performance. And we've been doing very well in our online efforts. With respect to WAAM 2.0, or WAAM/Just in Time, that is a relatively manageable number for us, as we've told you in the past. We try to balance taking off of our balance sheet product, as well as taking advantage of a marketplace that's attractive right now. Do we think it could be more than the 15%? Over time, Joe, it definitely could be. The reception for this WAAM product that we're providing has been very strong from developers and banks who own the product. So I think we have a great kind of model that's out there. And now we have a year and a half of actually proving that it works well. The people that we do business with are very happy. We have repeat customers now in the WAAM world who want us to do more product with them. So I think that we have a great model to move that business more towards the asset light that we've talked about in the past becoming less asset dependent, taking down the balance sheet and increasing their ROIC on that business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Quickly on VOI inventory, obviously, if we look at it, it hasn't declined much in the last year. How long right now are you guys thinking about the current level of inventory, how long that could last? And then a quick follow-up, if you wouldn't mind. Could you tell us how you're thinking about your financing propensity in 2012 and beyond?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Could you repeat the second part of that? I didn't catch the second part.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, just wondering what kind of your expectations are for financing propensity in  2012 and beyond?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay. Well, on the inventory -- and I'll let Tom handle the financing propensity. On the inventory we probably have somewhere between, I don't know, 6, 7, maybe more years worth of inventory because you're right, it only came down about $100 million this year. And that's a result of the fact that as we do upgrades, we take product back and then we sell that product to our system, and the fact that we've had very attractive opportunities not in the marketplace. I would expect to continue to see that kind of decline. And when you look at what we have on our balance sheet right now, you just kind of do the math you probably come to the -- we have at least 6, 7, maybe more years worth of inventory. Now that could be drawn out further and the tail could be extended if we do more WAAM product. And again, that's part of the balancing act that we see. We're seeing the market real time and making decisions about what's the best thing to do with the inventory that we have. So I would expect to see the inventory number to continue to come down, but it's not going to come down precipitously in any one particular year.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes. And Carlo, on the propensity to finance, I assume that you're directing that to our propensity to finance within the timeshare business. And so I think that's a managed target for us, Carlo. We do try to manage and target the amount of financing we do to like mid-50s, 53% to 55%. I don't expect that that's going to increase over time. We're not seeking to grow our balance sheet. Our #1 objective in our timeshare business is to manage it for cash flow, and I don't see it shrinking further. It seems like we've struck a good balance in the mid-50s to finance the business, so I wouldn't expect much change here.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with FBR Capital Markets.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Just a couple of questions here. First on foreign exchange hedging, can you give us the latest update where you stand with that, and is there any way to quantify that for us?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "So the FX impact year-over-year, if you were to compare the average FX rate or the average euro rate, as far as the euro and pound sterling against our 2012 guidance assumptions, it's probably cost us $13 million, $12 million to $13 million. And so that's what's built into our guidance range. As it relates to hedging practices, we have as a philosophy that we act appropriately and modestly in our hedging and so we typically hedge a quarter out. And this year, we may do a little more to protect against the downside of a significant euro depreciation, but it's not going to be a material type of spend on our part. So Europe counts for about 15% of our business. That's where most of the FX movement takes place. So I think we're measured in our efforts to hedge against the euro or the pound sterling.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then just 2 more questions here. Could you give a little color on the lodging margins for the fourth quarter. I noticed that over the past year they've been sort of all over the place, while increases and then a margin decreased in the fourth quarter. Could you just give it more color, I guess,  on the fourth quarter, what was driving that?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes, Patrick, there are 2 things that were driving it. Number one was our loyalty program, Wyndham Rewards. In 2010, we were recovering some of the previous investment we had made. In 2011, we did -- and so that led to a bit of the deterioration on our margin. And then as we said in our organized comments, there was a timing of marketing-related costs that had a significant impact. If you recall, the chronology in 2011 in the first half of the year we cited the timing of marketing spend as an advantage to margin. In the second half of the year, we attributed some of the margin deterioration to the timing of marketing spend. So those are the 2 most important factors. We would expect that margins in 2011 will improve in our Hotel group as RevPAR increases and we keep expenses in check.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "And then just lastly, sort of an open question here concerning the acquisition environment. 2010 you were very busy, 2011 was quiet for you. Want to share your general thoughts on the acquisition environment as it relates to 2012 and going forward.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, Patrick, it's always a tough thing to do. We kind of put our finger up in the air and see where the wind is blowing. And obviously we don't dictate the environment that's out there. We're somewhat reactionary to that environment. I would characterize going into this year kind of feeling like going into 2011. There hasn't been a tremendous amount of activity during 2011. The deals that we saw were overpriced. We were disciplined as we always are and passed on many of the deals that we saw. And going into this year, the environment does not feel a lot different. There are deals that are out there, but if they're at the prices that we can rationalize and that make sense for us, we will consider them, but if not, we'll pass on them. We certainly have another terrific use of our free cash flow, which is to buy back our stock, which we think is undervalued right now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Agnew with MKM partners.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Wanted to dig a little bit into the European Vacation Rental business and ask when's the main booking season? At what point do you get better visibility into 2012? And then a couple of other areas there. Is the weakness that you saw in volumes, is that really sort of longer distance Vacation Rentals, sort of non-European struggling down to southern Europe? And are you seeing -- you mentioned the U.K. being weaker, have you seen any uplift because of the euro versus the pound?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "A lot of questions in there. I'll take a first shot at answering them and then if I missed something, Tom can fill in. As for when the bookings are most heavily done, it's generally in the first and heavily in the second quarter. So it's the first half of the year, obviously teeing up for the summer. Booking windows have, in general, diminished. So they're definitely shortening. People are shopping around more, waiting for good deals, so to speak. And so we expect to be in the same kind of a pattern with maybe a little bit of a push to the later period for the bookings for this year. With respect to the U.K. situation, I can't say that we've seen much of an increase with the euro-pound trading, but again it's kind of early game here so it's a little hard to define exactly what will happen. We also have the Olympics over in London this year, as you know. We're not sure what the impact of that will be. And so we're watching it very carefully and watching the booking patterns to determine if we think there will be an impact and if we need to make any movement on pricing. And as for the long haul versus the short haul, I can't say that I've seen anything that has really directed that to be the issue. Some of our packaged deals to southern Europe have been a little bit lighter coming out of the U.K., but it's also a function of the booking window getting tighter because we may see more of it in the second quarter.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "And if I could ask a follow-up for Tom, I'm Just thinking about the balance sheet. I think you said before you wouldn't want to de-lever over time. So as you think about EBITDA growth this year and next, what's your thought process on adding that to stop you de-levering?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes, so Chris, our simple rule of thumb when we speak to investors is for every $1 of EBITDA that we add, we'd like to add $3 of debt. We just have to pick the right market conditions and the timing to get it done. So I think we ended the quarter at the low end of our credit range that we've talked to our rating agency friends with, and so I think we have some room and some flexibility to do some things in the near term.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Amanda Bryant with Susquehanna.", "Amanda Bryant - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Just a quick follow-up on the Vacation Rentals segment. What is the actual length of the booking window in that segment and how does that compare to basically the same time last year?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, I mean it's -- the booking window is basically dependent, Amanda, on how for the booking is done in advance of the heavy travel season in the summer. And historically, the business has been kind of that booking, as I said, has been spread over the first and second quarter. If I would try to guestimate for 2012 how much would that booking window slide, it would probably be measured in weeks not months, because you've got a bulk of the business all coming within, essentially, a 2-quarter period of time. So we're not suggesting that the booking is changing from being all in January to being all in June, but it's just sliding to be a tighter window towards that heavy summer travel. So depending on which market we're in, the inner Dutch market, for example, we saw a more dramatic tightening of the booking window in 2011 than we saw in 2010. The U.K. window in 2011 was not real dissimilar from 2010. So it really depends on market, but it's not a full quarter slide. It would be probably measured in weeks or a month, not multiple months.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "And the compression, Amanda, is not happening necessarily exclusively because of what the economic conditions in Europe are now. It's been -- we've seen some form of compression taking place for a number of years now, so this is not necessarily a reaction to what's going on in Europe, but we think more of a secular trend in the business.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes, as technology becomes more available, people dig for more information before they make their purchase decision.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.", "Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just 2 questions. First, on cash flow for 2012, I think, Tom, you said it was $1 billion but it included financing. I just wanted to understand what that was a combination of, securitization, more leverage given the increased EBITDA and then just flat out free cash flow. And then the second thing is on CapEx for 2012 spending more on timeshare build, I guess, how do you balance that versus what seems to be a very robust WAAM environment? So why spend any money on building physical timeshare in anticipation when you can seem to use WAAM more aggressively?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "So, Steve, I'll handle the first question, it's Tom. So our free cash flow guidance range is $600 million to $700 million, the rest will come from financing. In 2011 we benefited from an exceptional ABS market and our advance rates were, on average, 95%. When Steve mentioned that we generated $1 billion in available cash last year, more of the difference was attributable to ABS advanced rates. In 2012, we don't see advance rates improving above last year's rates. It's practically impossible. So you should interpret the difference being that at some point in time, we'll raise additional debt based on our incremental EBITDA.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes, and Steve, with respect to the question on inventory, why buy versus just selling what we have on our balance sheet. As we've said in the past, most of what we have on our balance sheet, some of it is completely finished inventory and we're selling that. Some of it requires an additional capital spend in order to complete it for us to be able to sell it. So there's additional fresh capital go out to finish those projects. I think, and as we've said in the past, this is kind of one of those things that we're paid to do. We have to look at what's available out in the market, what we have on the balance sheet, the location of the inventory, the quality of the inventory, there's a lot of factors that go into it and this is a conversation that Tom and I have with the guys who run the timeshare business and our Chief Real Estate Officer on a regular basis. So there are situations where we feel that it's more advantageous to go into a market that we've been trying to get into for a while where the pricing hasn't been appropriate, where now we see that pricing available and  we say, \"Okay, well let's grab that market at some place that we feel like we need more product based on what our customers are telling us.\" Because we ask them were would they like to go, where would they like to see more inventory. So there's a lot of factors that go into it. At the end of the day, we feel like we're doing an optimum job managing the capital allocation for inventory versus spending the finished building versus buying. And it's one of those things time will tell whether we've made good use of the capital. I think we're seeing the cost of sales go down, which is one of the results of being opportunistic out there in the market.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "And it's shrinking our balance sheet as well.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "And we're shrinking the balance sheet. So we're kind of doing them both at the same time than just balancing it.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura.", "Harry Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Two quick questions. First of all, I hate to just harp on Vacation Rental. I'm just wondering, how did the forward bookings look in Europe this time versus last year?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, forward bookings are, and again, early season so I don't want to state that this is the conclusion that we should take for the full quarter because, as I said, we book out the second quarter as big as the first quarter. It's not a whole lot different. There are definitely some softer spots. The U.K. has been softer, and again, we don't know everything that's impacting that and we're not doing anything dramatic at this point because frankly, we don't think there's a need to do anything dramatic with respect to pricing. We feel that we will see the results kind of bleed in over the next few months. So I am trying to answer this question in a different way than it's already been asked, just to give you some other additional color, but we really can't tell a whole lot. As we've said, we think that, that will be a challenge region. However, we've also said that we think that because of the business model we have and where we have our product, we will be stable in that market. And I think stable is the new up in that market. And so we're feeling pretty good about how we're positioned. And also, as we've shown in the past, we have always been resilient and able to adjust and adapt our model to whatever the market conditions are. So when we saw the decline in 2009, our businesses there grew. We shifted, we brought product in different locations and we managed to find growth in that market, which others were not seeing growth in. So we are calling for a stable euro out there. We're making that call based on what we're seeing right now.", "Harry Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. And then just following up on Steve's question on the WAAM business. It seems like there's a reasonable amount of developer and bank inventory today, but as you look out 2 to 3 to 4 years, that inventory is likely to dwindle because the amount of building over the next couple of years probably dwindled. So how are you going to refresh that inventory? Or not you, but how would you get -- how would you see it developing over the next few years?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Harry, I love the question that looks out 3 to 4 years. It's fantastic. I think there's a couple of things that I would say about that. One is the WAAM model -- and we said this before, I think actually before you were involved in our story. We talked about the WAAM model developing, and it's something that's existed for a while. We did a deal probably 5 years ago now during the peak of good times where we brought in product under a WAAM model. We didn't call it WAAM at the time because we weren't focused on that as a market initiative, we focused on that opportunity as just being opportunistic. We brought in a project in Panama City Beach, Florida and did it under this WAAM model. So the model has always been out there and available. I think even during good times there will be opportunities. And I think during the good times, it'll probably shift a little bit. It'll be away from the product that is on the market, that is weighing the market down right now with too much whole ownership condos. It'll shift to being developers who are now developing new product who are building a hotel, some whole ownership condos and they want also some timeshare product in the mix. And we will be a great partner for that person who wants to develop it. Timeshare owners spend time in their units, that's a fact, and they tend to spend more per stay on ancillary things like restaurants and theater tickets and other activities than a normal hotel stay does. And so the timeshare owner is a very attractive person to have in the mix of the development. So I think it shifts from being taking maybe what people are calling broken deals to becoming additive to other people's transactions over time.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "Just following up and then going on, on the U.K. softness. Are you talking about U.K. as a rental destination, were you talking about U.K. as buyers? And then my other question relates to, if you could discuss what you see as positive and negatives toward a merchant and agency models and which way you're headed and what kind of difference in costs do you see for you for those models?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, on the U.K., one, Mike, I would say it's both. It's the U.K. consumer. The bulk of the travel in the U.K. is the U.K. consumer. There are some German consumer traffic coming into the U.K., but I think that -- I don't know what the percentage is off the top of my head, but it's relatively high within U.K. Going outside of the U.K., the consumers traveling outside is what I was talking about. We saw some softness going to southern Europe from the U.K. So I think I would define it as being more the U.K. traveler. The German traveler continues to be strong. But again, it's not a huge part of U.K. With respect to the OTAs and other agency-type bookings, they're our partner. We work with them closely. We feel that there's a place for agency delivery within our distribution channels and we frankly embrace it. Having said that, we would love to get more done on our own websites because it's the most cost efficient way to deliver business for our hotel owners, and therefore, we are trying to drive more ways of finding traffic onto our websites to book directly for the direct booking. So they're complementary to us, they're our partners, but we also like to find ways to drive business to our own websites.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "Just to follow-up on that, I was kind of wondering about some of the OTAs, you use both a merchant model and an agency model. I was kind of looking at that as opposed to your own rental?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, the merchant model for the most part is done directly with the hotel, and it really flourished during the post 9/11 tragedy, where hotels were just basically dumping product, trying to fill the rooms. I think most hotels found that, that is not a very efficient way to do it and they took a long time to recover from giving control of their inventory to somebody else. So I think that if, again, you're asking a forward-looking statement, I think the agency model is where you'll see more work in the future. You'll see more agency model push versus the merchant model. But you really should be asking that question to the guys who are running that business as opposed to me. ", "Okay. Anything else, Shirley, or is that our last question on the queue ?", "Operator", "And at this time I'm showing no further questions.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "All right. Well thank you all very much for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you at end of the first quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.", "Margo C. Happer", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO; and Tom Conforti, our CFO. ", "Before we get started, I just want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking information. This information is subject to a number of risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K filed February 17, 2012, with the SEC. ", "We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these measures to GAAP is provided in the tables to the press release. It is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website at wyndhamworldwide.com. Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Margo. Good morning, everyone. We're starting the year with great momentum. First quarter revenues increased 9%, and adjusted EBITDA increased 8%. Significantly, adjusted EPS for the quarter grew 36% and came in $0.04 above the top end of our guidance range. ", "These results reflect strong operational performance in each of our businesses and the benefit of our share repurchase program. We continue to successfully execute against our operating plans with strong performance across the company. Lodging and Vacation Ownership each delivered double-digit EBITDA growth, excluding the intersegment license fee for the Wyndham brand name. ", "In Lodging, RevPAR was up 7% with continued gains in both occupancy and rate. Vacation Ownership had an outstanding quarter, supported by a strong consumer travel in the U.S. and continuing progress in optimizing marketing efficiencies. ", "And Exchange and Rental was highly effective in managing a difficult operating environment in Europe, as well as limited growth in the broader timeshare industry. Free cash flow was robust in the quarter at $1.30 per share, a 26% increase from the first quarter of last year. As you know, our capital allocation philosophy is to invest in our businesses at attractive returns and then to return the cash to shareholders. We continued delivering cash to shareholders again in the first quarter, repurchasing 3.6 million shares of our common stock and increasing our quarterly dividend by 53% to $0.23 per share. ", "In addition, this morning, we announced that our board has approved an additional $750 million to be added to our share repurchase authorization. Over the past few years, we have achieved shareholder returns in excess of the industry and market benchmarks due to: first, the strength of our largely fee-for-service business models; second, our proven ability to optimize all of our businesses through superior execution; third, our focus on growing free cash flow; and finally, our capital allocation that includes an increasing dividend and the repurchase our shares. ", "We are very proud of what we've achieved, but we know that we have much to accomplish. As people in our office will tell you, my question usually is, what have you done for me lately? As management, it is our job to drive the growth of our business because a business without growth has diminishing value. ", "So let me tell you why I'm optimistic about our prospects for this year and beyond. First, while we're cautious about Europe, we continue to see a global economic recovery in line with our expectations. We had 2 significant customer events earlier this month, our Global Hotel Convention and the American Resort Development Association or ARDA Conference. ", "Our hotel convention, which is held every 18 months, brings together owners for all 15 of our widely known Lodging brands. More than 5,000 owners and managers, as well as 130 suppliers, were in attendance, and we were able to get a very hands-on read of the state of the global hotel industry. ", "Since our last conference in September of 2010, there's been an obvious improvement in the mood and outlook of our franchisees and partners. Many of our suppliers saw increased order and lead activity, and almost without exception, the owners and managers I spoke with strongly felt that things were improving. ", "And hotel owners are looking to invest in their hotels as well. So in addition to the numbers we are seeing, this is great confirmation that, for us, the Lodging recovery is firmly established. ", "The mood was positive at the ARDA Conference as well but a bit measured, as the small to medium developers continue to have limited access to capital. Attendance at over 2,500 was strong, and we were encouraged by the number of new developers, both domestic and international. Interest in timeshare continues to grow around the world, which bodes well for RCI and Wyndham Vacation Ownership. ", "As I mentioned earlier, the current economic environment in Europe is challenging our efforts to grow our Vacation Rental businesses. We expect our European Vacation Rental business to remain stable overall due to the strength and resiliency of our portfolio of established brands and customer bases, as well as our strong, experienced management teams. ", "First quarter performance was consistent with these expectations, and our full-year outlook for Europe remains unchanged. ", "Let me now spend a few moments giving you an update on the progress in our business units in the first quarter. Wyndham Hotel Group continues to make progress in executing its Apollo initiatives, which is a series of technology projects focused on improving our value proposition to franchisees. ", "Our franchisees will be able to measure our results by the number of direct room nights we deliver to overall bookings, primarily through our online strategy. Our goal is to capture the maximum amount of online traffic and then convert these online visitors to staying guests. Remember that the launch of our new hotel brand websites and improved content were the first step in our Apollo plan to drive more room nights through our online direct distribution channels. ", "Preliminary results have exceeded our expectations with brand booking increases averaging over 10%. As we discussed in the last call, in 2011, we piloted TripAdvisor ratings and reviews on wyndhamrewards.com. Industry research indicates that up to 50% of consumers will not book a hotel without reading a review. Making ratings and reviews readily available on our own brand sites ensures consumers don't have to leave our site to get that information and ultimately book with us. We saw an approximate 30% increase in bookings during the pilot period. ", "This past quarter, we rolled out TripAdvisor to the majority of our websites and will be fully implemented by the end of May. In conjunction with the rollout, we launched Wynn Review, a suite of tools and services designed to help our franchisees manage their online ratings and reviews. We expect our affiliation with TripAdvisor, one of the first in the industry, to drive conversions, as well as support brand quality. ", "We are also excited about our new mobile websites. By the end of next year, it is expected that more people will access the Internet using a mobile device than a computer. Research indicates that nearly 65% of mobile bookings are made on the day of arrival, many within 5 miles of the hotel. ", "Based on the narrow booking window of our consumers, as well as the distribution of our hotels, we feel this represents a significant opportunity for us to capture the on-road connected traveler. We've designed our mobile sites with the end-user in mind, providing a robust interface along with geographic search capabilities. We've made great progress, and we believe we are among the leaders in the industry in these efforts. ", "In addition to important initiatives like Apollo that drive our core business, we are pursuing a worldwide growth strategy that leverages our strong and diverse brand portfolio, as well as our global footprint. For example, last year, we had great success in leveraging relationships to pen multi-unit deals, and we expect an acceleration of those efforts this year. ", "As we previously reported, to support the growth of our hotel system, we are planning to provide mezzanine financing and other financial support over the next several years. ", "Now moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. I want to take a moment to commend the Rentals team, which, despite the headwinds in Europe and a disappointing ski season in the U.S., grew revenues 3% and transactions 2% organically. The challenges in Europe were felt most significantly at the Hoseasons Group in the U.K., while Novasol, which is in Denmark, and Landal, in the Netherlands, continued to post solid results. ", "While it's too early to get a clear read on the summer season, bookings in the shoulder seasons are ahead of last year, which is an encouraging sign. But as I said earlier, our outlook for European rentals remains cautious for the year. We continue to make significant strides in our Vacation Rentals integration, which is key to our strategy to build a strong North American platform and gain market share, as well as improve margins in this rapidly growing industry. ", "In the second quarter, we expect to launch 2 significant initiatives: First, in North America, we will consolidate 23 rental websites into a single improved site; second in Europe, we will integrate the inventory and reservation platform of our U.K. cottages, parks and lodges brands into a common property management system, a change that will enable further yield management and operational efficiencies. ", "RCI's commitment to providing the best tools in the industry to its members and affiliates was showcased at the ARDA convention. RCI was honored with 10 ARDA awards, including the coveted ACE Excellence in Customer Service Award. ", "Coming on the heels of the major enhancements to rci.com over the past 18 months, including trading power transparency and new online search tools, RCI continues to innovate with the introduction of several new programs, including online tour generation, which will provide affiliates with a new source of qualified sales prospects using RCI's robust platform for lead regeneration and sophisticated screening tools, and the timeshare online listening center, which is a social media monitoring command center, providing our affiliates with a proactive service that protects and promotes their online brand reputations while improving customer service to our owners. The strength of RCI's technology continues to pay off with online transaction penetration growing to over 40%, up more than 400 basis points from last year.", "Now moving to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which is always -- which is also a recognized industry innovator. Results were stellar at WVO with volume per guest increases of 10% and tour increases of 8%. We're seeing great results from our latest initiative to drive efficiencies, our credit prescreening program. As you know, timeshare is a sold rather than a sought product, and finding good prospects is key to our success. So last year, we introduced the proprietary creditworthiness prescreening program. The rollout of this program is now effectively complete, and it has increased our efficiency by identifying the most qualified prospects for our salespeople. ", "We believe that the credit prescreening program was a meaningful contributor to the 10% lift in VPG and that this will be another game changer for us in the industry. Great innovation, focused management and terrific execution delivered truly outstanding results at WVO. ", "Finally, we continue to make progress on the Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model or WAAM. Developer interest is strong, and we recently signed our first WAAM agreement for our WorldMark by Wyndham product. Located in the south mountain region of Arizona near Scottsdale, our 5th WAAM deal is a purpose-built timeshare project that will nicely complement our 3 existing Arizona locations within the WorldMark portfolio. We expect to start sales on this product in the fourth quarter. ", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom to review the financials. Tom?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Thanks, Steve. Let me start with some brief comments on the business overall and then add some perspective to the quarter's results. ", "First, I have a basic business philosophy that says success is never final. The results of this quarter are an outcome of the strategic initiatives in place at each business unit and the overall company initiatives that we continue to advance and refine over time. We had a terrific quarter, as Steve said, with adjusted earnings per share coming in 36% ahead of first quarter 2011 and $0.04 above the top end of our guidance range, due to the strong execution at each of our business units and the benefit of share repurchases. ", "Well, as you know, we are focused on growing our free cash flow and deploying it effectively to enhance shareholder value. Free cash flow increased to $193 million or $1.30 per share for the first 3 months in 2012, compared with $185 million or $1.03 per share during the same period in 2011. ", "For the year, we expect that our available cash flow, which includes proceeds from our debt offerings, will be approximately $1 billion. We repurchased 3.6 million shares of stock in the first quarter of 2012, spending $150 million. ", "Year-to-date through yesterday's market close, we have purchased a total of 4.4 million shares for $190 million. We continue to believe that share repurchase offers a compelling return. And with the $750 million increase, as of market close yesterday, we have $940 million available in our share repurchase program. ", "Our capital allocation policy has been consistent since our launch as a public company in August 2006. First, we'll use our cash to invest in our businesses up to the point that the return is compelling. Second, we'll pursue accretive fee-for-service acquisitions in our core businesses such Hotel and Vacation Rental. And then finally, we'll distribute cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. ", "Now before we get to our operating performance for the quarter, let's review our recent capital markets activity. We completed a number of transactions and pushed out terms on our unsecured debt financings at record low interest rates. We believe that these actions strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity position, while maintaining an overall investment-grade credit profile. ", "So first, we completed a $650 million tender offer for a portion of our senior notes maturing in 2014 and 2016. Our 2014 notes carried a coupon rate of 9 and 7/8, and we were able to bring down our notes coming due in 2016 from $800 million to $357 million. ", "These notes were replaced with the issuance of $950 million of senior unsecured notes maturing in 5 and 10 years, with a weighted-average coupon of 3.84%. We also reduced our revolver borrowings by approximately $170 million. The combined impact of these transactions increased our unsecured debt outstanding by over $125 million. Now that's consistent with our plan to maintain leverage as our EBITDA increases. ", "We will use the extra funds for our strategic initiatives and share repurchases consistent with our capital allocation policy. The debt repurchase resulted in a pretax charge of $106 million, which has been excluded from our first quarter 2012 adjusted results. ", "In addition, even with our $125 million increase in debt, our net interest expense will decrease by approximately $10 million in 2012 or $13 million on an annualized basis. ", "Turning to the ABS markets. Last month, we announced a $450 million timeshare securitization with an advanced rate of 87.5% and a weighted average coupon of 3%, another record low. As expected, the advanced rate was lower than our 2011 transactions, as a direct result of our decision to opt for a lower overall coupon rate. ", "Had we opted to issue a BB tranche, similar to our deals in 2011, our advance rate would have been higher, but so would our overall coupon rate. We believe we've hit the sweet spot of the current ABS markets, combining a record low coupon with a slightly lower but still very attractive advanced rate. ", "Now moving to the operational performance for the quarter, let's begin the segment review with our Hotel group. Revenues were up 24% compared with the first quarter of 2011. The increase reflects RevPAR improvement, incremental revenue from the Wyndham Grand Hotel in Orlando, and higher revenue from licensing fees charged to the company's Vacation Ownership business. The revenue also includes -- the revenue increase also includes a $10 million increase reporting clarification [ph], which had no impact on EBITDA. ", "Adjusted EBITDA increased 23%, largely reflecting RevPAR increases, the recently opened Orlando Hotel and incremental intersegment licensing fees offset by higher marketing costs. ", "Systemwide RevPAR increased 7% in the first quarter, but domestic RevPAR improved 9%, reflecting roughly equal gains domestically in both occupancy and average daily rate. ", "International RevPAR was up 3%, led by favorable performance in our Asia-Pacific region, primarily China, while European RevPAR slowed somewhat. We ended the quarter with approximately 609,300 hotels worldwide, flat compared to the same period last year. ", "The pipeline at March 31 sit at nearly 108,200 rooms, up 6% over the last year. For the first quarter, we added over 220 new deals to the pipeline, a 12% increase compared with the first quarter of 2011. ", "Now let's take a look at Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. The business unit demonstrated great resiliency in the face of difficult economic environment in Europe and limited growth in the broader timeshare industry. Segment revenues were $361 million in the first quarter compared to $356 million in the first quarter of 2011. Excluding acquisition-related revenues and the impact of foreign currency, revenues were flat. Exchange revenues decreased 3% in the quarter or 2% in constant currency compared with the same period of 2011. This reflects a 2% decline in our average number of members due to the expected nonrenewal of an affiliation agreement, which would have resulted in a situation that was no longer compelling for us. ", "Exchange revenue per member was flat in the quarter compared with the same period in 2011. Vacation Rental revenues in the first quarter of 2012 were up 6% compared to the first quarter of 2011. Excluding the contributions from acquisitions and the net effect of foreign currency, Vacation Rental revenues increased 3%. ", "Organic transaction volumes in the first quarter of 2012 were up 2% compared with the first quarter of 2011, driven by the growth at our Novasol and Landal GreenParks business as well as our ResortQuest business in the U.S. This was partially offset by a decline in volume at our Hoseasons Group business in the U.K. due to weak economic conditions. ", "Average net price per rental was flat in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the prior year. Overall, adjusted EBITDA was flat in the quarter compared with the same period of 2011. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange, adjusted EBITDA was down 2%, reflecting the economic challenges in Europe. ", "Now moving onto Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business delivered an outstanding quarter. Compared with the prior year, segment revenues increased 11%, reflecting increased VOI sales. Tours were up 8%, driven by improving efficiencies, and volume per guest was up a robust 10%, reflecting the positive impact from our credit prescreening program, improved close rates and enhanced product offerings, which drove an increase in the average amount purchased per owner. We expect VPG growth to moderate somewhat throughout the year as we lap the rollout of the credit prescreening program. ", "Consistent with last year, we expect to add 27,000 new owners in 2012. In our WAAM business, commissions were up as we shifted the mix of sales to the new WAAM deals with higher commission rates. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter 2012 was $103 million, up 7% compared with the first quarter of 2011. The improvement reflects the strong increase in VOI sales. Now if we were to exclude the higher intersegment licensing fee paid for the use of the Wyndham brand trade name, adjusted EBITDA would have been double-digit at 11%. ", "Consumer finance revenue was flat versus the same period last year. Delinquency and default rates in the portfolio continue to improve although at a slower rate than we would like. Write-offs during the first quarter were $80 million, down from $85 million a year ago. The provision for loan losses was $96 million compared with $79 million in the first quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting higher sales but also the limited improvement in portfolio performance. On a relative to sales basis, the provision was flat compared to last year. ", "Finally, corporate expenses, as well as interest expense were in line with our expectations and consistent with last year. Now let me spend a few moments on guidance. Assuming no additional debt transactions, we expect our interest expense to decline for the full year from $135 million to $140 million, to $120 million to $125 million, reflecting our first quarter capital market transactions. ", "As a result of this lower interest expense and first quarter share repurchases only, we are raising our full-year adjusted EPS guidance from $2.85 to $3, to $3 to $3.15. The new adjusted EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 149 million shares, down from our original guidance of 153 million shares. ", "Remember that our earnings per share guidance excludes any share repurchase beyond March 31. Our 2012 EBITDA, revenue and driver guidance remain unchanged. ", "Finally, for the second quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.82 to $0.85 per share based on a diluted share count of 148 million shares. ", "And with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Tom. Before we open the line for questions, let me reiterate a point I made a little bit early in my discussion, and that is that this management team is proud but never satisfied with the company's achievements. We still see many opportunities to take the company to the next level and drive additional value for our shareholders. This mindset is evident in the energy and momentum of each of our businesses and in the wide range of innovative initiatives across the company. We continue to create and deliver new and better services for our business partners and customers, strengthen our consumer brands and drive revenues, earnings, cash flow and shareholder value. ", "With that, Shae, let's open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Joe Greff.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I have a question for you. My first question relates to Vacation Ownership. If I look at -- in the quarter, gross VOI sales less WAAM, that was $357 million, up nicely from $302 million, I believe, from last year. Yet when I look at the cost of Vacation Ownership interest in your Table 2, those costs were down nicely, $28 million versus $32 million from a year ago. So I was hoping you can help us understand the drivers behind that. I know that the $28 million to $32 million, that's a net number, net of recoveries. So I guess my question is, what's driving that? Is that more recoveries? Or is it really that the cost of timeshare to be built? Is that coming down? Are things being built out more cheaply? Or is it a combination of 2? If you can help us understand that, that would be great.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well actually, Joe, it\u2019s Steve. It's a combination of the 2 plus a third factor that may have actually even been more impactful for the quarter, and that was the pricing that we're achieving. As you know, we raise price on a frequent basis of the points that we're selling, and we\u2019re also premium pricing points under some of the new kind of product offerings that we have and with the new levels of ownership platinum and VIP ownership that we have, presidential ownership. And so prices is a portion of this that is adding to the other 2, which is inventory that costs a little bit less and, as you mentioned, the recovery of some of the product that has been defaulted on by either people who have loans to us or HOA maintenance fees that are lacking payment. Anything else, Tom? That covers the waterfront, I think.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "All right. And then Steve, for you. You talked about some of the initiatives within the hotel segment over the next several years, looking at providing mezzanine financing. Can you just talk about that a little bit in terms of how much capital you're thinking about on an annualized basis? And when do you think you'll start to kind of start providing mezzanine financing to developers?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes, that's a great question, Joe, because we don't know. It really depends on opportunity. And we\u2019re constantly out in the market looking to see if there are great transactions we can bring in to enhance essentially our Wyndham brand through possible use of mezzanine financing or other financial support initiatives. We haven't done very many of them. We do them on a regular basis, so we are providing some development advances, but nothing that's so meaningful that we've called it out. A while ago, we said that we were setting aside like $200 million dollars for these type of mezzanine and development advances, just to kind of throw a number out there, but we haven't come close to using anywhere near that over the last couple of years. And I don't know what it will come to look like in the future. We feel like we've got great momentum with the Wyndham brand right now. We're seeing a lot more opportunities than we ever saw before to bring them in. And playing at that level, the upscale level, frankly, the table stakes were set before we entered that upscale market, which is, there are development advance, mezzanine financing that you need to do in order to get those management contracts. So I'm sorry, I don't have anything more precise to give you because, as you know, it's kind of tough to model opportunity of what will come up for us in the future.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Steven Kent.", "Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Couple of questions. Can you just sort of give us some sense -- in the beginning of your commentary, you said that you were seeing improving travel trends. And in the past when travel trends have improved, you have sometimes accelerated your timeshare sales by design. Do you now feel, though, that you're sort of in this right timeshare sales range, sort of balancing quality of customer, lack of CapEx needs, sort of with the right growth rate? So if you could answer that question. Then, Tom, could you talk a little bit about -- the stock prices had a good move, Are you becoming more price sensitive on repurchasing shares? Where do you come out on that?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay. So I'll take the first one, and then Tom can take the second one. The improving travel trends converting into more timeshare sales is a positive. You're absolutely right, Steve, and it may have had some impact on the fact that our tour flow was up above our guidance range. But also contributing to it is the -- is this credit prescreening program that we're using now and other kind of marketing efficiencies that we\u2019ve brought to bear. So it's kind of hard to separate how many more people are we getting because of the improved travel. We know that our timeshare resorts are slightly more occupied in 2011 than they were in 2012, and that trend seems to be working in our favor. More people in our timeshare resorts mean there are more people for us to talk to about adding more product to their portfolio so -- buying more of our points. So there is a benefit to it. Steve, it's an insightful question, but I can't kind of tease apart the pieces because we've got a lot of things moving to try to drive efficiency in our sales process. We are not pushing timeshare harder though to kind of part of your point. It's not like we have the accelerator down on full on the timeshare sales. As we've said, we'd like to keep that to a mid-single-digit grower.  Now we've been beating that continually because this is a horse that's running very fast and efficiently, and we're not going to stop it or slow it down, but we're not feeding it any more capital. So the horse is running at a high speed without requiring any more capital. We\u2019re happy with that. And a part of it is because of what you're talking about, greater travel trends. More people traveling to Orlando mean there's more people that we can meet at our marketing offsite offices to bring them in to take tours. But we limit the number of tours, so I wouldn't say it's an overwhelming factor. So kind of a long answer to a short question, but there's a lot involved in that dynamic that you identified.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Steve, you want to weigh into Steve's second question as well, which had to do with share price and\u2026", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Sure. We obviously -- the board just approved another $750 million because we feel that there's still tremendous opportunity. If we look at what we've done so far with our share repurchase program, we have probably increased the value of what we bought by 50% percent. Now the stock\u2019s gone up little bit from what we paid for the stock that we bought. The stock\u2019s gone up a little bit. We still think it's undervalued, so we still have a lot of confidence and will continue to deploy the capital to take advantage of what we think is a great investment opportunity.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I just had 2 questions. First, in the Lodging segment on the margins, could you guys kind of try and extrapolate the impact maybe the Wyndham Grand had on segment margins in the quarter? And then I had one quick follow-up.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes. The bigger factor on margins had to do with incremental marketing expense. But I'm-- it had really no discernible -- Bonnet Creek at this point had no discernible impact on margins at all, Carlo. The real impact on margins for the quarter -- and we believe that our hotel business will have good margin progress by the end of the year, but at least at this quarter basis, we had higher marketing spend than we had last year.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "That one hotel, Carlo, is not that large when you look at it relative to our overall revenue.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Right. So then in terms -- on the Vacation Ownership side, with tour flow up during the 1Q, are you guys seeing any mix shift of new VOIs sold versus reloads? And then could you clarify what you spend on inventory in the quarter?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "I think we spent $8 million -- $7 million on inventory in the quarter. So the second question is easier. The first question had to do with, are we changing the mix between upgrades in first-time buyers?", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Are you seeing any kind of mix with tour flow up substantially as it was in the quarter?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "No. It's remained consistent with what recent trends have been. It\u2019s about 65%-ish upgrades and 35% new owners.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bob LaFleur.", "Robert A. LaFleur - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Just wanted to ask you about the acquisition environment in Vacation Rental, particularly in Europe, and wondering if the sluggish conditions over there actually create more acquisition opportunities for you. Maybe some long-time owners see this as a good opportunity to get out. Just wondering about your thoughts on that.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Bob, it's a great question. We have in the past seen more activity flow when markets have been stressed. Frankly, that's one of the reasons we're able to buy ResortQuest at the right price finally here in the U.S. When the Deepwater Horizon oil started hitting the Gulf Coast, it put pressure on that business, and we're able to get it at a, we thought, was the right price after having looked at it for a very long time. In Europe, we\u2019ll have to see if the opportunities develop. We are constantly looking at deals, just to be clear, in Europe and in the U.S. and the rental side. So it's not like we are out of the market. We're in the market, and we just haven't found anything recently that's been in the right price zone for us to be able to move on. If this brings the price zone down to a more reasonable level, then we could be more active there, but we have nothing to report now.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So you're saying that there's stuff that is available, they're just not at prices you like? Or are there just not things available?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "The former, not the latter. There are things available. Just like in general M&A, there's always things that are available. And we're very disciplined about how we look at these deals, and we don't move on a deal unless we think it's worthy of a capital allocation.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Agnew.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Just a question, another question on the Rental business. And I wonder if you could give us any color on booking trends. Were they later this year versus previous years? And what's the sort of level of visibility you have in looking into the summer, again, compared to previous years?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes. Chris, and as I said in my comments, we see the shoulder season performing fairly well. But when you talk about the summer, which you rightfully point out is the important part, that's really where our money is made is in the summer in the rental business. It's still too early to tell. The booking windows have gotten shorter and shorter in Europe like they've gotten in the U.S., basically driven by technology. Because so much information is available now, people wait later to make their bookings. And so we don't have the great visibility into the summer yet. But the shoulder season is good. It's up -- it's actually ahead of last year. U.K., definitely -- just to give a little bit more color. U.K. definitely the most challenged of the markets over there. But probably the best performing market, I would say, is Denmark, with the German consumer and the Spanish and Italian product that we have. So there are pockets of strength and pockets of weakness. Frankly, as you know, as well as any of us, Europe isn't a single entity. It's a collection of countries. And so we see pluses and minuses throughout, but the most challenged is now in the U.K.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Great. And then if I could follow up on something Tom mentioned on VPG pace. I think you said that it would moderate later in the year as you lap the credit prescreening. I was just wondering if you could expand on that as sort of how that happens and when you actually start lapping it.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes. I think we'll start to lap it in the third quarter, Chris. We introduced credit prescreen in the third quarter of last year, rolled it out in the fourth quarter. And so some of the advantage that we're getting is related to credit prescreen, so the benefit derived will be offset. That incremental benefit that we're getting in the first quarter and second quarter will be offset. Now it isn't the only driver of our VPG increase. We did make some product enhancements to our VIP product level, which we believe impacted our ability to close on transactions. A more desirable VIP package, more people wanted it. It enabled our sales force to close more transactions. And also it resulted, as we understand it, because the VIP program and package was viewed as more valuable, the price was raised for -- or the point levels were raised for what qualifies as a VIP qualifier, and that resulted in people spending more money to achieve that VIP status, and that helped our -- the average price per transaction. But those were the key drivers.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "And frankly, the guys down in Orlando and the entire Vacation Ownership sales force has just performed at an exceedingly high level. We gave guidance of 2% to 5% VPG growth for the year. This came in this quarter at 8%. That is monster -- I'm sorry, 10%. Tour flow is up 8%. That is monster increase, and kudos to them for what they've accomplished, and they continue to be innovative in pushing the envelope. So they continue to basically outperform even our expectations.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "And then just to clarify, you've maintained your guidance for tour flow and VPG for the full year?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "I didn't hear the question, Chris. What was it?", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "I think you said in the call that you're maintaining your guidance for VPG and tour flow for the rest of the year?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "All of our operational drivers, we\u2019re maintaining our guidance, yes.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "First quarter is a little too early to call a big change, but it was a great quarter.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Harry Curtis.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "A couple of quick questions. First of all, tax rate was 30%. Based on your guidance, it's typically been in the higher 30s. What are your thoughts on an annualized number?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Well, we're holding to our guidance, Harry. But that lower first quarter rate had to do with the charge related to the refinancing. So we'll take a look at it for subsequent quarters.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. Second question is, I was surprised that your timeshare inventory didn't decline a bit. Given the level of sales, I would have thought that it would have come down maybe $100 million or so. And if you could walk us through the math as to why that really didn't change much.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Harry, last year, which we viewed as a highly successfully year. In 2011, our inventory levels came down $80 million for the full year. And so our guidance has been, as we've described, sort of the longer-term trends on our balance sheet, that the expectation should be over the next few years that our inventory levels for the year will decline comparably to what happened in 2011. And so our inventory decline was in line with what our expectations were internally.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And last question. You really outperformed well in the economy segment in your Lodging business. Smith Travel was up about 6.7%. Can you walk us through the reasons for that outperformance?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, we\u2019ll give you -- Harry, this is Steve. We'll give you some of the thoughts that we think are contributing to it, and part of it is the Apollo initiatives that we've been talking about for about 2 years now. We've dramatically improved our websites. We were behind the curve before. Now we're right up on it. I think that definitely helped our performance, plus the fact that we have been -- and you see it in our numbers -- frankly, we've been weeding out some of the weaker franchisees who have not been reinvesting in their properties. So our unit growth has not been what we've wanted. We still feel comfortable with our guidance for this year with the unit growth. But over the last couple of years, we have not had the unit growth that we would historically have seen. And that's in part because we've been terminating a lot of products. It isn\u2019t -- we've been bringing in a lot. We've had a lot gross additions, but we've been terminating a lot. So I think those 2 factors and there's many others that probably contributed to it, but I think definitely the Apollo initiative is having an impact. We expect it have an impact on RevPAR. We expect it to have an impact on the conversion rate of people coming to our websites and then booking with us. And so that is definitely a factor, and we expect that to continue. And that's why, frankly, when we gave guidance for 2012, our guidance was ahead of where some of our peers were in this sector, as well as where some of the industry pundits were. And it\u2019s because we think we're going to start seeing the impact of that Apollo initiative start having true bottom line positive impact.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And when you think about your pipeline, because of that outperformance, is it having a positive impact on applications for conversions?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "We definitely -- our pipeline is up. Part of the up this year -- this quarter in pipeline was international, but there is good flow of applications. We have been doing very well, frankly, during the downturn. We've been chasing deals and pulling a lot of deals in. I would love it if it got easier, but I'm sure our franchise development guys would tell me it's not easier than it was before. But I think, good -- people want to be with winners and having good momentum is a good thing to have.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our next question is from Michael Millman.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "Could you give us your thoughts regarding the increasing -- the environment which is seeing increasing couponing, OTAs with increasing last-minute deals? And the impact on not only the hotel business but also the rental business in both, I guess, pricing and maybe promotions?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Mike, you ask every quarter about the OTA business, not our business, but our perception hasn't really changed. We do business with the OTAs. We put product through them. We view them as a partner. And the last-minute deal-making that OTAs make, frankly, a lot of our hotels do the same thing. If they're not filling in, they feel like there's opportunities to improve their yield. So I don't think that there's anything that we've seen in what they're doing that is really much different from what we've seen in the past. I haven't heard our team in the Hotel group mention them as being a detrimental factor at all. Anybody else, Shae?", "Operator", "And at this time, sir, I show no further questions.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay. Well thank you all very much for joining us. We look forward to talking to you about the second quarter, and have a wonderful spring. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today's conference call. At this time, you may disconnect.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "I would now turn the call over to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Margo C. Happer", "Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO; and Tom Conforti, our CFO. Before we get started, I want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking information. This information is subject to a number of risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-Q filed April 25, 2012 with the SEC.", "We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures to GAAP is provided in the tables to the press release. It is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website at wyndhamworldwide.com. Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Margo, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report we had another great quarter as we continue to execute at a high level in an uncertain global economic environment. Second quarter revenues increased by over 4% and adjusted EBITDA was up over 10%. Adjusted EPS was up 36% and came in $0.02 above the top end of our guidance range.", "Wyndham Hotel Group and Wyndham Vacation Ownership each delivered double-digit EBITDA growth. I'm also pleased with the efforts of our Wyndham Exchange and Rental teams, which was in line with our expectations, producing stable results despite the economic challenges in Europe and limited growth in the broader timeshare industry.", "We continue to deploy capital to drive value for our shareholders. So far this year, we've spent nearly $70 million [ph] on dividends and $400 million on share repurchases. Our second quarter weighted average diluted share count decreased by $23 million from the same period last year. From our inception as a public company on August 1, 2006 through yesterday, we repurchased 73.8 million shares at an average price of $32.60 per share.", "Equally important for long-term shareholder value is our ongoing commitment to invest in our business to drive earnings growth and increased cash flow in the years to come. Our baseline sustainable free cash flow guidance of $600 million to $700 million assumes CapEx of approximately $200 million, about half of which is used to fund growth projects such as Apollo and our hotel business; rci.com and Vacation Rentals reservation and website integration in our Exchange and Rental business; and Voyager, a program to optimize our reservation system in our Vacation Ownership business. We also continued to selectively evaluate the potential acquisitions, which we will only pursue if they're strategically and economically compelling.", "Now moving to our business unit review. The Wyndham Hotel Group had another great quarter, with adjusted EBITDA growth of 12% and domestic RevPAR gains of nearly 8%. We made some significant development headway in the second quarter, planning a deal with Hospitality Properties Trust or HPT, a 20-hotel portfolio comprising 3,000 rooms throughout the U.S. All of the properties will be rebranded as Wyndham Hotels, with the remaining 16 properties to be rebranded Hawthorn Suites. The conversions are scheduled to occur next week, providing growth for 2 of our brands and adding 20 properties to our managed portfolio. We are pleased to partner with HPT and hope to work more closely with them in the years to come. We look forward to updating you on similar deals going forward.", "We are aggressively pursuing many tracks to grow the total number of hotel rooms in our system, including investing in our brand's market position, focusing on multi-deal contracts, both for conversion and new construction, and increasing retention of our existing franchisees. Essential to all of our strategies is improving our system contribution and the resulting value proposition to our franchisees. We will achieve this primarily through the Apollo initiatives, which we have spoken about before. We've made significant progress over the past 2 years with one of our key Apollo initiatives, brand.com. Revenue and room nights across the brand portfolio are up approximately 20% from this channel year-to-date, in part due to improved content and web functionality.", "On the international front, over the next 4 years, we -- excuse me, over the next 5 years, we expect annual system size growth of 8% in EMEA, 15% in Latin America, and our highest growth market will be APAC, where we expect our system size to almost double by 2016. This is from an exceptionally strong base in the region, particularly in China where we have close to 60,000 rooms. The long term vision is to have a footprint in China that rivals our presence in the U.S. We are also seeking to grow in India and other countries such as Singapore and Thailand on an opportunistic basis.", "Of course, brand equity is the foundation for growth. We are especially pleased with our rankings this year in Consumer Reports' annual travel issue. From Microtel and Wingate, we're ranked #1 in their segments. In the budget segment, Microtel topped the list for the third time and was joined in the top 5 by Super 8 and Days Inn.", "Now moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rental. In constant currency, rental revenues in Europe for the quarter were flat compared with the second quarter of last year. This was a significant accomplishment given the tough macroeconomic conditions. Year-to-date, European Vacation Rental revenues increased by 1%. As I said before, we've assembled a collection of the best vacation rental product in the right locations, which provide great value to a variety of consumer segments throughout the many different European markets in which we operate.", "We continue to be confident with the resiliency of this business because of several factors: the outstanding value proposition of our products; the strength of our brands and our management teams; the concentration of our feeder markets in northern European economies; our ability to retain homeowners and attract homes -- for homeowners who are looking to -- for rental income, in fact, many of our properties are drive-to destinations; and the operating flexibility of our mostly fee-for-service business model.", "In total, approximately 95% of our European Vacation Rental volume comes from our Landal GreenParks, Hoseasons and Novasol brands. Each brand is a market leader, and the majority of the consumers are driving to the product. Nearly 90% of Landal consumers are from the Netherlands and Germany, while Novasol generates 80% of its customers from Germany and Scandinavia. In our British Hoseason cottage and parks business, over 95% of customers are from the U.K.", "Our Vacation Rentals are an outstanding value and represent an affordable family vacation option. To put this value proposition in perspective, in 2011, our European Vacation Rental business had an average daily rate of $140. This is for the inventory that is predominantly single-family homes with multiple bedrooms, living space and full kitchens. This compares to the same $140 average daily rate for a single hotel room in Europe.", "In the technology side in Europe, we launched a new integrated reservation platform for our U.K. cottage and parks brands, enabling greater efficiency in our internal process, as well as our ability to drive inventory utilization.", "Beyond Europe, in the second quarter, our North America Rental teams continued their strategic focus on innovation, with key accomplishments including the consolidation of 23 separate ResortQuest websites into a single enhanced platform under the Wyndham Vacation Rentals brand umbrella.", "In RCI, our business development teams have added over 75 resorts to our system through midyear. We announced several outstanding new affiliations, including the Baha Mar Residence Club, which will provide RCI members with access to more than 300 luxury Caribbean units, managed by such world-class brands as Rosewood and Mondrian.", "In the technology front, we completed another successful release of rci.com, which included an upgrade to an innovative click-to-chat functionality with multiple language support. From when we started the project in the first quarter of 2008 to the end of 2012, we expect our migration to online transactions to improve our Exchange and Rentals margin by over 225 basis points. Enhanced online experience also increases the overall value proposition to our members with greater functionality and better online content. The result is that online transactions in the second quarter were 41% of total transactions compared with 13% when we began the project 4 years ago.", "Finally, let's turn to Vacation Ownership. WVO continued to achieve stellar results, with revenue increasing 5% and EBITDA increasing 15%. Tour flow and volume per guest remained strong, aided by our credit prescreening tool. In addition to achieving significant efficiencies, the team has continued to refine its business model to support our focus on free cash flow. Our first step was establishing the Wyndham vacation -- the Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model or WAAM, which positions us to offer turnkey solutions for developers' or banks' holding inventory, which we sell for a fee through our industry-leading sales and marketing channels. In 2011, with healthy conditions in the ABS market, we introduced WAAM 2.0, where we not only sell third-party inventory, but also offer consumer loans. Our goal is to capture the attractive spreads available through financing and preserve our capital lite operating philosophy. We signed our first WAAM 2.0 deal late last year and began sales in the second quarter of 2012. Tom will walk you through the accounting on this later.", "Finally, regarding a corporate matter. As you may know, we are in litigation with the FTC regarding Wyndham Hotel's data security and privacy practices in relation to data breaches that occurred from 2008 to 2010, in which a limited amount of consumer information at some Wyndham Hotels and Resort branded properties may have been accessed. Let me first say that we've cooperated fully with the FTC in its investigation of these data breaches and that safeguarding consumer information is a priority for us. We believe the FTC's claims are without merit, and we will vigorously defend our position. Regardless, we do not believe that the outcome of the litigation will have a material effect on our company.", "But before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to note a special anniversary. Next week, we will celebrate the 6th year anniversary of our listing on the New York Stock Exchange. I'd like to take a moment to evaluate our performance for shareholders over those years.", "Between dividends and share repurchases, we have returned nearly $2.7 billion to our shareholders through the end of the second quarter. A cumulative impact of our share repurchase activity over this period has been a 29% reduction in our share count. And our total return to shareholders including dividends has been 81% compared with 21% for the S&P 500. We're never being satisfied. We know we still have great opportunities to build on these accomplishments. Tom?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Thank you, Steve. Let me start with brief comments on the overall quarterly results, and then provide some detail into business unit performance and guidance.", "As we've said in the past, our results are the outcome of sound strategies that we continue to advance and refine over time, stronger operational execution at each of our business units and disciplined capital allocation. Overall, our second quarter results, again, were strong, with adjusted earnings per share coming in 36% above the same period in 2011 for the second quarter in a row and $0.02 above the top end of our guidance range. These results reflect solid performance in our Lodging and Vacation Ownership businesses and a meaningful impact from our ongoing share repurchase program.", "We continue to generate high levels of free cash flow and, consistent with our capital allocation strategy, return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases while actively seeking value-enhancing acquisitions in our core businesses. In the first 6 months of 2012, free cash flow increased to $567 million or $3.83 per share, compared with $544 million or $3.13 per share during the same period in 2011, excluding the impact of $51 million of VAT refund received last year. We expect that our available cash for the year, which includes net proceeds from ABS financings and assumes we'll calibrate leverage to our increased EBITDA, will be approximately $1 billion. [ph]", "With our strong free cash flow, we repurchased 3.8 million shares of stock in the second quarter of 2012 for a total of $190 million. Taking into account the additional 1.1 million shares purchased thus far during quarter 3, we have $733 million remaining in our current share repurchase authorization.", "Now moving to operating performance for the quarter. Let's start with Wyndham Hotel Group. Revenues were up 23% and adjusted EBITDA increased 12% compared with the second quarter of 2011, reflecting an increase in franchise royalties and higher intersegment fees for the use of the Wyndham brand. Excluding the intersegment fees, adjusted EBITDA increased 5%. The revenue increase also included $10 million of reporting reclassifications and $11 million of incremental global franchise conference fees, both of which were fully offset by expenses.", "Domestic RevPAR improved by 8% in the second quarter, while systemwide RevPAR increased 5%. North American RevPAR improvement was driven primarily by an increase in the average daily rate, further evidence of a positive trend in pricing power in our segments. This bodes well for continued Lodging recovery. Internationally, RevPAR was up 2% in constant currency.", "The system size was essentially unchanged, with gross openings of 15,500 and terminations of 16,400. Openings were in line with expectations, while terminations were higher than expected as a result of some proactive steps on our part to address underperforming franchisees. Note that we expect 3,022 rooms from the HPT transaction that Steve mentioned earlier to enter the system on August 1. Net overall pipeline activity is up 3% year-over-year and 5% sequentially.", "Now let's look at Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. Again, this quarter, our Exchange and Rentals business demonstrated solid performance in the face of a difficult European macroeconomic environment and limited growth in the broader timeshare industry. As Steve articulated, we have great confidence in both our Exchange and Rental businesses based on the quality of the management teams, product offerings and our mostly fee-for-service business models. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions, revenues for the quarter were flat compared to the same period 2011. Excluding acquisitions in foreign currency, adjusted EBITDA was up 5%, but flat if you exclude a $4 million claim settlement related to the Gulf oil spill.", "The constant currency second quarter Vacation Exchange revenues were flat. Exchange revenue per member increased by 2% in constant currency compared with the same period in 2011, primarily due to higher Exchange fees. Average number of members declined 2% in the quarter due to the expected nonrenewal of an affiliation agreement at the beginning of 2012.", "Vacation Rental revenues were down $10 million for the quarter, unfavorably impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar. If you are to exclude the impact from acquisitions and the net effect of foreign currency, Vacation Rental revenues were flat. Transaction volumes were down 3% due to weak economic conditions in Europe, offset by a 4% increase in the average net price per rental, primarily driven by a higher yield at our Hoseasons Group in the U.K. and Landal GreenParks business in Holland.", "Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. The business again delivered another outstanding quarter. Compared to the prior year, segment revenues increased by $29 million or 5%, primarily due to the positive impacts of higher VPG and increased tour flow. Year-over-year gross VOI sales increased by $48 million or 12%. Year-to-date, we have brought 13,500 new owners into the system, an increase of 10% over the same period in 2011 and consistent with our annual goal of 27,000 new owners.", "WAAM 1.0 volume was $18 million for the quarter. In addition, as Steve mentioned earlier, we began selling WAAM 2.0 products in June, with volume of $12 million by quarter end. As a reminder, the accounting for WAAM 2.0 transactions will run inventory through our balance sheet in a just-in-time basis. So we'll record the inventory on the balance sheet at registration and pay for the inventory shortly after each sales transaction. Note that at the end of the second quarter, approximately $60 million of inventory on the balance sheet was related to WAAM 2.0.", "WAAM 2.0 enables us to capture the attractive consumer finance EBITDA, while optimizing the balance sheet and cash flow. Combined WAAM 1.0 and WAAM 2.0 revenues showed a 58% increase over the same period of 2011. Consistent with our commitment to provide timely disclosures, we have added the break out of WAAM 1.0 and WAAM 2.0 to Tables 3 and Table 9 of our press release.", "Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $150 million, up 15% compared with the second quarter of 2011. The improvement reflects the strong increase in VOI sales. Now if we were to exclude the higher intersegment licensing fee paid for the use of the Wyndham brand name, adjusted EBITDA actually increases 19%.", "Consumer finance revenue was flat versus the same period last year. Writeoffs during the second quarter were $77 million, slightly up from the $75 million a year ago. The provision for loan losses was $100 million compared with $80 million in the second quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting higher sales and limited improvement in portfolio performance.", "Now while the portfolio remains strong overall, we had hoped to see more improvement in performance by now. We've looked closely at the limited improvement in portfolio performance over the past few months and attribute it primarily to the pace and strength of the economic recovery. But while there's nothing that we can do about the economy, we have dramatically improved our buyer profile. In addition, we believe there are 2 other factors at play here: first, recent portfolio performance has been affected by an organized third-party scam where fraudulent representatives were calling our customers and encouraging them to default on their loans. We have worked with authorities, and these parties have been indicted. We believe this issue is now under control. Second, we are seeing an impact from some owners holding balances higher than historic norms. Typically, loan performance diminishes as loan balances increase. And these loans are affecting overall portfolio performance. We are putting plans in place to mitigate the effect of these very manageable issues, and we'll keep you updated as we progress.", "ABS capital markets remain robust. On July 19, we closed a $300 million timeshare securitization with an advanced rate of 90% and a weighted average coupon of 2.66%, another great execution. We couldn't be happier with the results.", "Finally, corporate expenses, as well as interest expense were in line with our expectations.", "Having completed our 5-year plan review process, we are solidly on course with our long term goals. We are committed to EBITDA growth of 6% to 8%, with high single to low double-digit growth in the Hotel Group and mid-single-digit growth in the Exchange and Rentals Group and Wyndham Vacation Ownership. We expect sustainable annual free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. We remain committed to an investment grade profile, which will enable us to increase debt by $300 million for every $100 million that we add in EBITDA. The result is $1 billion of available cash to deploy each year to increase shareholder value. 2 years ago, we shared that the deployment of that cash through M&A and share repurchase would result in compound annual EPS growth of between 17% and 21% over the subsequent 5-year period. Well, we're well on our way to achieving and exceeding that goal.", "Now finally, I'd like to spend a few moments on guidance. Full year revenue guidance is unchanged. We are, however, raising the lower end of EBITDA guidance with a new range of $1,040,000,000 to $1,055,000,000. In the business units, we expect Vacation Ownership and Lodging revenues and adjusted EBITDA to be at the high end of their respective ranges. We expect Exchange and Rentals revenues to be at the low end of its range and adjusted EBITDA to be at the midpoint of its range. Also, we expect corporate expense to be at the high end of the numeric range, while depreciation and amortization will be at the low end of the numeric range.", "Business unit driver guidance remains unchanged. We are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.10 to $3.20. Our prior guidance was $3 to $3.15. The new adjusted EPS guidance is based on the expected diluted share count of 147 million shares. Remember that our earnings per share guidance excludes any share repurchase beyond June 30, while some analysts' estimates factor in estimated repurchases in the second half of the year.", "In the third quarter, we expect earnings per share to be $1.07 to $1.10. This is below the consensus, reflecting differences in both share repurchase assumptions and seasonality between the third and fourth quarters. However, our guidance for the second half of the year is consistent with Street expectations.", "With that, I'll turn the call back to Steve.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Tom. So in summary, this was another excellent quarter in what has become a very strong track record of success. We've accomplished much during the past 6 years, a period that's included severe financial and economic upheaval and ongoing economic uncertainty. As I have said many times, we have a phenomenal business model, with strong brands and outstanding associates executing our strategies. And I know these attributes will serve us well, fueling our growth and shareholder value for years to come.", "And with that, Shirley, we'll take any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Joe Greff.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "This is Joe Greff from JPMorgan. A few questions here. Steve, can you just -- and Tom, can you talk about how ripe the current environment is for acquisitions? Obviously, in the past, stresses created some opportunities which you've acted on. Can you talk about what you're seeing currently, how ripe the environment is for opportunities? Then I have a couple of follow-ups.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Sure. Well, the acquisition pipeline, whether the market is stressed or not stressed, has been fairly consistent. We've probably seen a little more activity recently, more deals seem to be coming to market, but it's not a dramatic change in the volume of our activity. And really, kind of what has to change is the expectation of the other side because we're very disciplined, we're not going to chase anything, so if deals don't make sense, they're not going to fit in to our plan. But I would probably characterize it as, the pipeline is a little bit stronger than it was last year at this time.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then can you talk about your VPG expectations for the second half? And then when you look back at the second quarter, was there a difference between, say, the beginning of the second quarter versus the end of the second quarter? Was it stronger in the earlier part of the second quarter and tapered off at the end of the second quarter?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "You're saying, of this year, the VPG in the second quarter, it was earnings that's sort of trending inter-quarter, is that your question?", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes, correct.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay. I don't believe so. I think it was pretty consistent throughout the quarter. But...", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Correct.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes. That was -- yes.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes. And we remain -- I think our guidance is 5% to 8% -- 2% to 5%, I apologize. 2% to 5% percent. We think it's likely that we're going to come in close to the top end of the range. But we don't expect any significant change in the second quarter than we had in the first quarter on VPG.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "And as we talked about before, Joe, you noticed obviously, tour flow and VPG kind of go together. We could have a very few tours and a very high VPG and not be happy with it. So it's a bit of a balancing act. But that group down there has done just a spectacular job of driving tour flow and of -- and the quality of the tour flow that's coming in. And they are very adaptable. They adjust to circumstances as they arise.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then my final question. The HPT deal. Can you talk about what your expectations are for fee contributions in the Hotel Group for the second half of this year, I guess, August 1 going forward? And maybe what that run rate is on an annualized basis for year 1?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Sure. Joe, it's 20 hotels. So it's not going to move the needle dramatically. It is a managed deal, so we'll be getting management fees for those 20 properties. It is positive, but I wouldn't -- we're not adjusting our numbers for anything that's coming in. In fact, in our rooms guidance, as we've been working on this for quite some time, this basically was built in on our rooms guidance. And it's part of the reason that we're comfortable that we're going to get the growth that we've been talking about during the year to deliver in the second half -- through the second half of the year by December 31.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Kent.", "Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "It's Steve Kent with Goldman Sachs. I -- just following on a little bit on that. Just on the Vacation Rental business. I know that you mentioned to me that, that business actually has held up very well. I was wondering again sort of through the quarter whether there was any change there and especially on the European side. And, I guess, I would note that it does look like the average price per vacation rental and vacation rental transactions did look like it declined a little bit. And then separately, maybe for Tom on the securitization market, it seems very strong. Is that helping timeshare -- other timeshare developers accelerate their sales, which could then boost the old RCI membership business?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay. Well, I'll let Tom address the ABS part of the question. I'll start to tackle the European Rental question. Again, looking within the quarter, because I think it was your first question, did we see any trending? Within markets, we do see trending every month and every week, and that's because of weather. I mean, the weather has been miserable. For those who watched the British Open recently, the announcers just kept talking about how miserable the weather has been over there. And that -- we never complained about the weather, but that does have an impact. So when you see trending, the economy has something to do with it, but the weather does as well because people are driving to these locations. So do we see any trending? Steve, I wouldn't say there was any trending that I would say was meaningful. We saw pockets that were stronger as the period went on. We saw pockets that were a little bit weaker. But nothing that I would say was giving us any reason to pause, frankly. And with respect to the pricing over there, I think if you take out the FX impact, you'll actually see that the average price increased about 4%. So that business definitely is being impacted by foreign currency translation. We feel really good about how those brands performed over there. The management did a terrific job. We didn't panic and try to drop price at all. They held price, and the transaction volume picked up and we ended up the quarter very strong. And I will make one comment, Steve, because I don't know if was on your question or not, but you did ask me the last quarter, looking into the -- because we have pretty good booking visibility into this summer for the Rental business, and we feel it's pretty consistent with what we've seen so far that we're not going to see a huge uptick, but we're not seeing any decline that we think is meaningful. I think we'll be stable in that business just as we've been calling for all year long.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Steve, I would just add to Steve Holmes' comments that we have seen a compression in the booking window, so -- but as Steve said, we have good visibility into the booking trends for our key period, and we're optimistic that we'll deliver what we've promised we're going to deliver in this business. I think your question around the ABS question, if I heard it correctly was, have things gotten so robust that others in the timeshare industry can access the market as well. Was that the nature of your question, Steve?", "Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Right, Tom. And then in turn, that will be a positive for you because then, those customers would want to be part of the RCI network.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes. We haven't seen that level of openness in the ABS market at this point. We are regular participants in issuing ABS debt. The execution on this last transaction, the results from this last transaction were as good as any results we've ever had. But we don't see it at this point necessarily carrying forward to smaller puncture developers. We're trying to aid in any way we can to accelerate that process, but it isn't readily apparent that the market's open for that level of developer.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes. [indiscernible] beyond what we previously talked about, Steve, which is there was a -- 2 groups that got deals done, I think, in the first quarter. But in the second quarter, there was no new product that came in. But 2 groups that had not historically been regular issuers in the ABS market did access in the first quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Just with respect to your VOI inventory, could do guys maybe provide a little bit more granularity on how you bridge the gap between the last quarter and this quarter as it relates to your billed cost, obviously your COGS and recoveries?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Well, I'm not sure. In the first half of the year, our inventory has come down around $40 million to $50 million on inventory. Your specific question has to do with bridging between quarters?", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, exactly. If you're between the first quarter and the second quarter. And kind of how much you spent to build inventory in the 2Q as, obviously, the levels have come down a little bit?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes. I mean, I think that's a little more granularity than we'll cover. We'll talk to you offline about that if we could, Carlo.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, no problem guys. And then if you wouldn't mind, when you look at your domestic RevPAR, if we were to exclude Orlando, how would you guys kind of have that tracking?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Now there's the -- for all of our brands, you're saying across-the-board?", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay. Yes, I think that we have seen some regional strength and weakness without a doubt. The southeast was a little bit weaker, the -- I'm talking just domestic here. Domestic southeast was a little bit weaker this quarter than some of the other areas. But I don't see anything there that I would say, \"Wow, that's a big aha.\" Again, we don't use weather as an excuse, but there was some weather-related conditions in the southeast during the second quarter, which probably impacted people's travel patterns. We saw it on the panhandle of Florida. We also saw it in Florida in general. But Orlando has been strong, and our hotel down there, the Bonnet Creek property that we own, is doing very well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "This is Patrick from Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. Just a couple of questions for you. On your current $1.1 billion of inventory. In your view, if you weren't to purchase or build anything new, how many years do you think that would last you at [Audio Gap]?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Well, we would have to purchase, as we've said in the past, Patrick, around $150 million a year to finish some inventory in our balance sheet. But we believe that, that investment, which we've talked about in the past, plus what's on our balance sheet would give us the equivalent of 4 to 5 years worth of inventory.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "And I -- this is Steve. I feel that there's probably more than that, personally. I know 4 to 5 is kind of where we come out, and that's what we put in the Q, and that is arithmetically where you end up. But we do take product back from people. We do end up increasing our WAAM participation over the last couple of quarters. In fact, as Tom mentioned, that increased from Q2 last year to Q3 this year. So I think we probably have more than 4 to 5 years, personally. But that's arithmetically where you come out. And to Carlo's question before, we spent in the second quarter about $23 million on inventory, so -- in that neighborhood.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Is it a fair assumption to say with that 4 to 5 years that at least over the next 1 to 2 years, your target of $150 million, $175 million for inventory spend, I mean, that's still for the next year is going to be your target?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Absolutely.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes. Probably the next few years and beyond.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, okay. And then just 2 more questions here. You talked about consumer finance revenues reflect year-over-year though overall revenues for the segment were up. Is that because new buyers have a lower propensity to borrow or you're continuing to tighten the credit standards on that?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Overall, receivables are down from where they were last year. It's a combination of all of the above really.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And lastly here -- just 1 sec. In the Lodging segment, you had higher intersegment licensing fees for the use of the Wyndham brand trade name. Can you just give me a little more color exactly what that is, I mean is that a one-time gain?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "No, Patrick, it is the fee that's charged by our Hotel Group, which owns the intellectual property of Wyndham to our timeshare and Exchange Rental businesses, it's a much smaller number for Exchange and Rentals. But for the timeshare business, there's an intersegment charge. And it's an ongoing charge.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes. And, Patrick, we've always had that charge. It was increased as -- in part as a result of the -- frankly, of the Marriott Vacations spinoff. They had a value that they were attributing to the brand, and so our property -- our intellectual property people have been looking at it and having third-parties look at it, felt that we were probably, frankly, undercharging the -- for the use of the brand. And obviously, it's a valuable asset, and we want to make sure it's well-protected.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  Our next question comes from Christopher Agnew.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Christopher Agnew from MKM Partners. First question, I wanted to ask about Vacation Ownership. And your tour growth slowed sequentially in -- from the first quarter despite an easier comp. And to hit the high end of your tour flow guidance for the full year, assuming it's unchanged, would show quite a steep deceleration in the second half. And I was just wondering if there's any specific thought process behind that.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "No. We don't see anything that would indicate that the tour flow would be changing dramatically and that there would be a dropoff. I think that with tour flow, it's a -- as we've talked about before, it's a manageable undertaking for us. We've got great marketing programs that drive the tour flow, great partners who are driving tour flow in. And we can kind of turn the spicket on and off as it's needed. And so, no, we feel very comfortable with the guidance that we've given and we've been coming in a little bit ahead of the guidance. And I think what it was, 1% to 4% was our guidance for the -- and so we're comfortable with that range. We're probably beyond the top end of it.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, Steve, if you could maybe expand a little on the strategy for driving growth in APAC. I mean, are [Audio Gap] to take all brands, maybe think about China in particular? And is it a franchising strategy, would you look at some management? And are these master franchise agreements?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Sure. Well, Chris, it's not all of the brands. We're -- we've taken many of the brands over, but not all the brands over to APAC. In fact, the head of our Hotel Group, Eric Danziger, is over in China this week and was there last week instead of this week, as well, down in Australia. So it is a high level of focus for us. We have both managed agreements with the Wyndham brand and in some cases, Ramada, with their 4-star full-service properties. We have master franchise agreements for both Days Inn and Super 8 in China. And then we have direct franchising relationships with the other brands. And so, it really is -- it's an amalgamation of different approaches. I think for the most part, I think our master license agreement for Super 8 is working extremely well. The brand has grown rapidly over there, and so we're comfortable with that model for Super 8. And we'll evaluate the other models as we move forward and find the one that works best. We expect to see a relatively significant increase in our development -- business development group over there over the next 3 or 4 years, and that will impact, obviously, our growth in that market.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nikhil Bhalla.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "This is Nikhil Bhalla from FBR Capital Markets. I have a question on just looking at your dividend payout as a percentage of your net income, obviously it's a much lower number, 30% or so. At what point do you start to favor more dividend payout and that as a way of returning cash to shareholders rather than just share repurchases?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, we've -- Nikhil, we've increased our dividend dramatically over the last 2 years. I'm not sure what the percentage is but it's big.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "We tripled it 2 years ago. We increased it by 25% last year. And then this year, we increased it by 53%.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "50%. So we've increased it, obviously, dramatically. And our stated intent is that we will increase it in line with the growth of our earnings. And that, obviously, is enhanced by the fact we don't have as many shares outstanding. So we -- because we're buying back shares -- so it means the dividend grows more rapidly than our earnings growth does. And we evaluate this on a regular basis with our board. And stay tuned, we'll be looking at it going forward.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "And just a follow-up question on Europe. Did you see an impact or any movements due to the Pentecost holidays? I believe that impacted Europe both in May and June. And then final thoughts on any positive impact from Olympics.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, I think the Olympics one -- I'll leave Tom to answer the Pentecostal one. The Olympics, we're not really seeing much of anything. I mean, it's really kind of a jump ball in most people's mind about what kind of the impact. The Olympics will start on Friday. We'll have with the market over there. The summer is a travel -- is a busy travel time in the U.K. as it is. And we're not seeing anything that would suggest that the Olympics are having a big impact. Did you hear anything about the...", "Thomas G. Conforti", "About Pentecost, no, I didn't. But we didn't see -- there wasn't a trend that we can discern.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "No.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Harry Curtis.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "It's Nomura. A couple of quick questions. First of all, I'm just trying to understand the math behind the RevPAR a little bit better because if international, in a constant currency, was up 2% and the U.S. or domestic was up 8%, it sounds like there was -- I mean, there must have been a drag somewhere -- probably, currency. How big a currency drag was there in the quarter?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "So Harry, it was -- first of all, let's explain the international number then we'll answer the currency number for a second. The international number really is a mix effect, and that is our largest growing market. China also has a much lower RevPAR than some of our more established international markets. And even within China, some of our lower RevPAR brands, specifically Super 8, are growing more rapidly than our higher RevPAR. So it's an interesting dynamic. And that really what we're seeing is international growth being impacted by a significant, sort of like a double mix shift effect, where your market with the lowest RevPAR is growing the most rapidly. And then within the -- within that low market, your lowest RevPAR is growing the most rapidly, and that's Super 8. And so, it was -- so without FX, it was 2%. And with FX, it was down 1.5% international RevPAR. Excuse me for a second, Harry. Okay, so I think that's really -- so it's without FX, it was 2%, and with FX, it was down about 1.5%.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. And then just wanted to follow-up on the system size, and I understand that, that growth is accelerating in the back of the year, partly due to HPT. But I'm trying to get a sense of some of the attrition that has occurred over the past 2 or 3 quarters. Is that just natural attrition or are you actively attempting to prune the underperformers in your portfolio?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "No, it's both, frankly, Harry. We do have natural attrition, which are properties that are just leaving the system for whatever reason. They're being taken out of hotel stock in the marketplace or they're going through a significant repositioning of themselves. But the -- but there's also a significant amount of what we consider to be attrition that is kind of self-inflicted. We're knocking properties out because their quality is not keeping up or they're not paying, and that has always been the case. There's been a higher level of self-inflicted attrition, where we're making the decision to kick people out over the last several years, frankly, not just the last couple of quarters, last several years as the economy has been so difficult for the hotel owners and they have not been investing in our properties. Now we're hopeful that we will see a turn on that. As we reported last quarter, I think that the quarter before we've started to see some improvement in the receivables from our hotel franchisees. So we're optimistic that there will be an improvement of that. The good news is the adds have been very healthy. We've been adding a lot of properties. The problem is we've been taking out a lot, and that's been leaving us relatively flat. We feel that based on our pipeline and what we see as visibility for the second half of the year, they will be able to get to that growth range that we have designated.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And just as a follow-on. Is there an attractive ROI whereby you provide financing to your brands so that it helps them renovate? Is there any kind of return that might make sense there?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "In general, the answer is no, because it's a very slippery slope, Harry. If we started becoming the lender of last resort to the hotel industry, we might be able bring in some properties, but all of a sudden now, you'd be viewing us as a bank. And I don't think we're set up to be a bank and be a lender to the hotels. So could there be a good return? Yes, there could be a good return. Is that our business model? No, it's not and has not been our business model. We do as everybody does, Marriott and Starwood and Hilton in the upper upscale level, we provide development advances to properties to try to bring them on. We've done that in some of our new construction product, the Wingates that we've brought on. So we do it on a selective basis, but to become a general lender to the industry, it's just not our business. We're not wired or set up to do that.", "Operator", "And at this time, I'm showing no further question.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay, Shirley. Well, thank you very much, and thank you, all, for being on the call. We look to speak to you in the next quarter. And have a great summer.", "Operator", "Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "I will now turn the call over to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Margo C. Happer", "Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO; and Tom Conforti, our CFO. Before we get started, I just want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking information. This information is subject to a number of risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-Q filed July 25, 2012, with the SEC.", "We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these members -- measures to GAAP is provided in the tables to the press release. It is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website at wyndhamworldwide.com. Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Margo, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results reflect continued strong operations, as well as our ongoing commitment to deploy capital to increase shareholder value. While there's some noise related to FX in the numbers this quarter, especially in Exchange and Rentals, on a constant currency basis, revenues and adjusted EBITDA increased 6%, and adjusted earnings per share increased 24%.", "Each of our business units exceeded our expectations. The Wyndham Hotel Group benefited from domestic RevPAR increases. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals continued to deliver solid results despite the economic turmoil in Europe. And our timeshare business, Wyndham Vacation Ownership, continued to drive tour flow and VPG growth while delivering on our new owner goals.", "In terms of our capital allocation, in addition to 2 tuck-in acquisitions we completed in the quarter, we used $133 million to purchase 2.6 million shares of our stock during the quarter. Year-to-date, we have purchased 10.9 million shares for $522 million. This reflects our consistently strong cash flow and our confidence in the company's prospects. We continue to believe that our stock is a great investment. Our capital allocation philosophy is consistent and is built to drive shareholder value. We will invest in our core businesses, pay dividends, repurchase shares and do opportunistic accretive acquisitions.", "Now moving to our business unit review. At the Hotel group, industry fundamentals continue to improve, albeit at a slower pace. While RevPAR recovery seems to be moderating, we believe development opportunities are expanding. This bodes well for room growth as we go forward. With our strong array of brands, we are exceptionally well positioned to capture franchise and management opportunities, giving owners the ability to choose the right flag to best maximize their assets.", "For example, in India, we led with Ramada, an established international brand, and then introduced the Wyndham, Days Inn and Howard Johnson brands. In China, we began in the '90s with Days Inn and Howard Johnson master franchises and added Super 8, again a master franchise, and then Ramada as a direct franchise in 2004. Since then, we have introduced Ramada Encore, TRYP and Wyndham, resulting in a total presence of over 63,000 rooms.", "Looking at more recent opportunities. I just returned from a 7-day trip to Brazil and Uruguay to visit the large customers and prospects for both our RCI and hotel businesses. There is strong hotel and timeshare growth in Brazil right now, and our participation in that growth is another great example of how wide brand footprint creates enhanced development opportunities. We are in Brazil with our TRYP by Wyndham brand and have seen great demand for our other offerings, including Ramada, Super 8, Days Inn, Howard Johnson and Wyndham.", "Developers understand the value of our distribution capabilities, as well as the opportunity of our multiple brand strategy, and they are eager to partner with us. Building strategic alliances with multiunit developers has proven successful in growing international regions. Also, in the Hotel group, we continue to make excellent progress on Apollo, our series of technology and business initiatives that aim to improve the value proposition to our franchisees by maximizing our system contribution.", "In August, we relaunched the Wyndham Hotel and Resorts website, completing the most complex project of our brand.com initiative. We have now completely revamped 13 brand websites, significantly enhancing features, functionality and content for over 7,000 properties. Room nights resulting from brand.com initiative are up 17% versus prior year on both a year-to-date and a quarterly basis. In another phase of Apollo, we are embracing the significant shift to mobile devices by improving our click-to-chat functionality, which simplifies the booking process and enhances the consumer experience.", "Now moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. During the seasonally largest quarter of the year, the team continued to do a great job, despite the challenges in Europe and limited growth in the broader timeshare industry. Four of our 5 European rental businesses had increases in transaction volume without significant discounting. This speaks to our leadership in the industry and our ability to grow transactions.", "Here's how our service rental model works. All of our properties are backed by the Wyndham service commitment, giving both owners and consumers peace of mind in their rental experience. We provide our owners and guests with a high level of service, from marketing to managing their calendar, handling the booking and payment process, providing check-in and checkout services and maintaining quality standards through property inspections.", "This is very different from the listings model, which typically provides only online marketing, leaving it to the owner to field inquiries from prospective guests; update and maintain their availability calendars; provide key holding, check-in and checkout services to guests; address service and property issues for guests during their stay; and ultimately, handle the collection process. We have over 40 years\u2019 experience in vacation rental and follow a disciplined approach to developing new markets.", "The development model in Europe was designed to minimize risk in the early stages and maximize profit once the market is ready. Initially, we analyze the market and establish a network with local tourist organizations to help develop demand. We then test our brand in the market on a small scale. We begin property recruitment efforts through partnership with third parties in the market, such as travel agents, with minimal internal cost and risk. Once critical mass has been reached, we will make a full-scale entry to realize the potential of the market.", "This is a tested and proven approach, and Croatia is a great example. We entered Croatia in 2004 and sold less than 200 weeks. In 2012, we're the market leader, and we have already sold over 30,000 weeks through September. The key to our strategy in Europe and in the U.S. is applying best practices across our businesses and leveraging our core competencies in marketing and analytics.", "We also supplement growth through M&A. For example, in August, we continue to expand our vacation rental business in the United States with the acquisition of a leading vacation rental company located at the main entrance to the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. This is America's busiest national park, attracting over 9 million visitors each year. We think the acquisition is a great addition to our portfolio.", "Moving to the Exchange business. We've just completed the latest release of rci.com, which delivered several new advancements, including web enablement of our points exchange transactions on mobile devices, the ability of -- to cross-sell products using predictive modeling to provide offers uniquely tailored to our members\u2019 needs and wants and the introduction of the first fully transactional and translated Chinese website in the global vacation exchange industry. This is the final major release of our successful 4-year rci.com mission, which has greatly enhanced the value we bring to our members, as well as our efficiency.", "rci.com has launched several industry firsts, including RCI TV, enhanced search, RCI Platinum, trading power transparency, combining deposits and change back. We are on track to reduce call volume by over 30% from the inception of the project through year-end 2012, and we expect a total reduction of almost 40% by 2015. We've driven online web share from 13% to currently over 40%, and it's still climbing.", "Now let's turn to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which had a busy and productive quarter. In September, we acquired Shell Vacations, which brought us approximately 115,000 owners and 19 managed resorts in North America. WVO will now operate Shell Vacation Club, a leading points-based club system, featuring a wide variety of member benefits and travel options.", "As Tom will discuss, this tuck-in acquisition has a healthy rate of return, is immediately accretive to earnings and will generate meaningful cash flow. With strong fee-for-service revenues, the acquisition was consistent with our capital-light strategy. We look forward to building upon Shell's many achievements and continuing the growth of its highly successful vacation club by providing outstanding quality, value and customer care.", "The timeshare business is attractive because it is a business that has great returns, high customer satisfaction and a great future. Interestingly, the demographic is broadening. Recent buyers are younger, and the ownership base has shifted slightly in terms of marital status with a lower percentage of married owners and a higher percentage of singles.", "According to ARDA's recently released biannual consumer survey, the typical timeshare owner today has medium household income of $74,000. 89% own their primary residence. 64% do not have children at home, and 58% are college graduates with over 1/3 of those owners have graduate degrees. The ARDA results also show that 83% of timeshare owners say their experience is good to excellent.", "Timeshare owners love the product for a variety of reasons, including resort locations; saving money on future vacations; the overall flexibility of the product, including the opportunity to exchange; and the discipline of taking vacations every year. Clearly, timeshare offers an attractive value proposition for consumers. This bodes well for our own timeshare business and also for RCI.", "Finally, as you saw from the press release, we have given you the first view of our 2013 outlook. Revenue, EBITDA and EPS growth is consistent with our long-term strategy. Our investor theme has been, \u201cExcellent execution and powerful cash flow drive dependable growth.\u201d Two years ago, we laid out a plan that resulted in EPS growth of 17% to 20% over the following 5 years with the proper allocation of our strong and sustainable annual free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. We are well on our way to achieving that plan and much more.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Thanks, Steve. Overall, our third quarter results were solid with adjusted earnings per share coming in 20% above the same period in 2011 and $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range. These results reflect the sound strategies that we continue to advance and refine over time, strong operational execution in all of our businesses and the impact of our ongoing share repurchase program.", "Through the first 9 months of 2012, we generated $682 million or $4.61 per share of free cash flow compared with $636 million or $3.74 per share during the same period in 2011. Now, that excludes the impact of a $67 million benefit from a VAT refund and related interest income received late last year. We used the majority of our year-to-date cash flow to repurchase shares. We repurchased $133 million in the third quarter for a 9-month total repurchase of $473 million, plus an additional $49 million in October.", "As Steve mentioned and consistent with our capital allocation strategy, on September 13, we acquired Shell Vacation ownership club and property management group. The purchase price was $96 million net of cash, plus $157 million of debt primarily related to consumer loan receivables. This tuck-in acquisition will increase our vacation ownership fee-for-service property management EBITDA by approximately 10%.", "From an earnings perspective, the deal will be minimally accretive on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter, and we expect it to add a few pennies to our 2013 EPS. On the balance sheet, you'll see an increase of approximately $126 million in consumer finance receivables and an increase in inventory of about $41 million related to the acquisition. We expect after-tax unlevered returns of close to 20%, which, of course, is above our hurdle rate.", "As you saw from the press release and as Steve mentioned, currency had a significant effect on the results in the third quarter. When we evaluate business unit performance, we look at the results in local currency and exclude the impact of foreign exchange. In accordance with GAAP, our reported numbers include this effect, so where meaningful, I shall highlight results in constant currency.", "At Wyndham Hotel Group, revenues were up 12%, and adjusted EBITDA increased 28% compared with the third quarter of 2011, attributable to domestic RevPAR gains, our Wyndham Grand Hotel in Orlando and higher intersegment fees. Excluding the higher intersegment fees, adjusted EBITDA increased by 21%. Domestic RevPAR improved by 5% in the third quarter, driven equally by increases in the average daily rate and occupancy. Systemwide RevPar increased 2% with a 5% decline in international RevPAR offsetting the stronger domestic results. In constant currency, systemwide RevPAR is up 3%.", "Now the decline in the international RevPAR reflects a mix effect, driven by the growth in Asia, our lowest RevPAR region. Over the past year, we have increased the number of hotels in our Asia-Pacific region by 26%. This rapid growth has a dilutive impact on systemwide RevPAR due to Asia Pacific's relatively low RevPAR compared to North America and other international regions. Compounding the effect, our lower RevPAR brands, specifically Super 8, are growing more rapidly than our higher RevPAR brands in China. This creates an interesting dynamic where system growth can reduce RevPAR while increasing earnings.", "To further the point, on a reported basis, RevPAR in Asia Pacific was down 9%. However, same-store RevPAR was up 1%. Excluding the mix effect, same-store international RevPAR was up by 2% in constant currency. System size was up 1% year-over-year with net openings of 11,500 rooms, partially driven by multiunit deals, such as the recent Hospitality Properties Trust transaction, which consisted of 20 properties and 3,000 rooms throughout the United States.", "As Steve mentioned earlier, emerging markets, such as Brazil and China, are driving international room growth, which now accounts for nearly 28% of the portfolio, compared with 26% during the same period in 2011. Overall, pipeline activity is down 5%, both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily related to the openings in our Asia-Pacific region. Our overall development efforts remain on track.", "Now let's look at Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. As Steve said, despite the challenges in Europe and limited growth in the broader timeshare industry, the business had another solid quarter. Excluding the effect of foreign currency and acquisitions, both revenues and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter were flat compared to the same period in 2011. In constant currency, third quarter vacation exchange revenues were flat. The average number of members declined 2%, reflecting the nonrenewal of an affiliation agreement at the beginning of 2012, while exchange revenue per member increased by 1% compared with the same period last year.", "Looking at rentals. Excluding the net effect of foreign currency and acquisitions, third quarter 2012 revenues compared with the same period in 2011 were flat. Transaction volumes were up 3%, primarily driven by better penetration in recently developed Novasol markets and improved results in our Hoseasons Group business despite continued softness in the U.K. market. These gains were offset by a 2% decline in the average net price per vacation rental, reflecting a mix shift to lower-priced markets.", "Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business delivered another strong quarter. Compared to the prior year, revenues increased by $49 million or 9%, primarily due to positive VOI results. Year-over-year, gross VOI increased by $47 million or 10%. The improvement reflects a 5% increase in both VPG and tour flow. The VPG increase was attributable to both higher pricing due to better yield management and improved close rates, resulting in part from our credit prescreening program. Tour flow reflects a focus on marketing programs directed to new owner generation. Year-to-date, we have brought almost 22,000 new owners into the system, an increase of 5% over the same period in 2011, and we are on track for our annual goal of 27,000 new owners.", "Total gross VOI sales from WAAM increased to $62 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared with $38 million in the prior year, a 63% increase. This growth reflects sales of the second phase of one of our initial WAAM projects near Orlando. The first phase, launched 2 years ago, was the WAAM 1.0. This new phase is WAAM 2.0. We believe this demonstrates both the success of our overall WAAM program and developers' interest in various WAAM models.", "Consumer finance revenue was flat versus the same period last year. Write-offs during the third quarter improved somewhat to $71 million, down from $73 million in the prior year. The provision for loan loss was $124 million compared with $96 million in the third quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting higher sales and challenges in portfolio performance, which we discussed with you last quarter. These challenges reflect higher default levels due to larger loan balances and some third-party fraud affecting loan defaults. Remediation plans are in place, and we are monitoring the situation closely. We expect the provision to moderate going forward, and we will keep you updated on our progress.", "Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $155 million, up 4% compared with the third quarter of 2011. The increase primarily reflects the revenue increases, partially offset by higher sales and marketing expenses related to the increase in VOI sales and higher intersegment licensing fees for use of the Wyndham brand trade name. Now excluding these higher fees, adjusted EBITDA for WVO was up 7%.", "Now on a corporate financing front, we recently launched a new commercial paper program. This program, which is already in use, allows us to borrow short-term funds at even lower rates than our revolving credit facility. Overall debt levels will be unaffected by this facility.", "As Steve noted, our long-term corporate goals remain unchanged. We are targeting annual EBITDA growth of 6% to 8%, high-single to low-double digit growth in our Hotel group and mid-single digit growth in the Exchange and Rentals group and Wyndham Vacation Ownership. We expect sustainable annual free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. We will continue to manage our balance sheet metrics consistent with an investment grade profile, which enable us to increase debt by $300 million for every $100 million that we add in EBITDA.", "Now I'd like to spend a few moments on guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 to $0.61, assuming a diluted share count of 143 million shares. As you saw from the press release, we are narrowing our full year revenue guidance range to $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion and our adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $1,045,000,000 to $1,055,000,000.", "We are also narrowing our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.15 to $3.20 per share. The new EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 146 million shares, down from our most recent guidance of 147 million shares. This new guidance reflects the benefit of our share repurchase program through the third quarter and excludes any further share repurchases. We currently have approximately $608 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.", "Now let's touch on a few modifications regarding final 2012 driver guidance. For the full year, we expect RevPAR to come in at the lower end of our guidance range, while tours and VPG will come in at the upper end of our guidance ranges.", "Our 2013 outlook reflects continued momentum in the businesses. We expect revenues of $4.9 billion to $5,050,000,000; EBITDA of $1,125,000,000 to $1,150,000,000; and adjusted earnings per share of $3.50 to $3.60 a share, assuming a diluted share count of 143 million shares.", "The share count assumption includes our share repurchase through September 30, 2012. Also assume that our 2013 EPS guidance's higher depreciation and amortization expense based on the Shell acquisition, as well as a some capital projects and IT initiatives being put into service. We'll give you, of course, full guidance on our February call. Finally, we expect free cash flow of between $600 million and $700 million in 2013 and available cash of close to $1 billion.", "So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Tom. Before opening for questions, I want to note that this is our 25th quarter reporting as a public company. I am both pleased and proud that the team has delivered optimal results each and every quarter, despite some pretty tough macro headwinds. Shareholder feedback that is gratifying to hear is, \"You did exactly what you said you would do.\" I know our outstanding team will continue to deliver excellent results and execution, which will enable us to continue delivering on our promises to you for years to come. I look forward to keeping you posted on our progress. Thank you for your continued support.", "And now, Shirley, we'll open for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Kent with Goldman Sachs.", "Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Two questions. First, can you talk about upside to free cash flow? You've made several acquisitions, so why shouldn't we see free cash flow start to go higher or at least the guidance start to move higher? And then on the provision for loan loss, Tom, you mentioned that you're working on some issues there. But I was wondering, what are you doing or what kind of specific measures are you taking to start to track that down a little bit over the next couple of quarters?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Great, Steve. Steve, do you want to cover the first one?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, on the free cash flow, Steve, frankly, we'll probably be over $700 million this year. Don't know what for sure we'll be at next year. There's a lot that goes into free cash flow, so trying to nail it down to be too precise is difficult. But I think it's safe to say that we feel comfortable with that range, and if we beat it, we beat it. We just don't want to be creating an expectation that's too high. There's taxes in there. There's a lot of things that move around that we don't want to be subject to not being able to deliver exactly what we say we're going to deliver. But I don't think it indicates any sort of a slowness of the growth of the free cash flow. I think we're right on target with our free cash flow.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Then on the second question, Steve, on portfolio performance, so we've isolated 2 issues, the underlying causes of some of the portfolio performance. One is large balance loans. Typically tend -- people with large balance loans typically tend to default more frequently. And our team in Las Vegas and -- our teams in Las Vegas and Orlando have worked on tightening up some of the underwriting standards on how we lend out money and to whom we'll lend money. So we hope that the tightening of those underwriting standards will help us to both retain momentum in VPG, while dealing with some of the large balance loan situation. As it relates to the second factor, which is this organized fraud activity, we had started some months ago to pursue very aggressive legal tactics with some of these third parties. We feel like it's a bit like a whack-a-mole situation. But we think that we've addressed some of the major sources of this fraud activity in a pretty significant way. So we expect to see improvement in that area, probably more rapidly. Within the next few months, we expect to see some improvement.", "Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just to follow up, Steve, on the free cash flow part of the story, on the -- when you acquire -- some of the acquisitions you've made, though, those are free cash flow generators, right? I'm trying to think of some the stuffs you've done, and they don't seem like they would require a lot of CapEx or any other PP&E, so that's why I was asking the question. Is that true for the most part of anything you've acquired in the past 12 months or so?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "You're absolutely right. All of the acquisitions that we've done are cash flow generative, so they will be adding to our free cash flow. It's just we don't want to get ahead of ourselves, and that's basically the reason we left the guidance the same on free cash flow.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMC.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "The contribution from WAAM 2.0 is a little bit higher than what we had thought, and I\u2019m presuming that's going to be a bigger part of the business and certainly bigger than 1.0. But you can correct me if my premise is wrong on that. I guess my question on that is this. Is there a margin mix issue? Is there a margin differential between revenues related to WAAM 2.0 and WAAM 1.0? And then I have a follow-up question.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Joe, we're definitely on the path to WAAM 2.0, so your baseline assumption is completely accurate. Not that we wouldn\u2019t selectively do 1.0, but we are walking with great momentum on the path on 2.0. There is no margin differential between either model. There will be some optics on our balance sheet that look a little different. On the WAAM 2.0, think of WAAM 2.0 as like a just-in-time inventory model, where as it will go, inventory will appear on our balance sheet. There won't be a cash expenditure for that inventory. When we sell a WAAM 2.0 ownership right, we will almost simultaneously pay for the inventory and provide the inventory to the buyer. So it's a much more efficient cash flow model. Some of the optics on balance sheet -- and we'll start to get into it more as it becomes a bigger part of our business -- will be a bit different. The revenue classification will be gross VOI. It won't be commissions. So you'll see the commission line on our financial statements start to wane a bit. But from a margin perspective, it's going to be improved, of course. The interest income that we get on WAAM 2.0 is a whole different business category, so the margin that we -- the VOI margin that we get will be comparable, but the interest income, of course, will add incremental EBITDA that we wouldn\u2019t have received had be only been a WAAM 1.0 participant.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. And Tom, in your remarks discussing the VO performance in the third quarter, you said VPG, higher price, improving yield. It was in part related to some of the credit prescreening initiatives that you guys talked about for over a year now. But you used the word \u201cin part.\u201d What were some of the other reasons that drove that improved VPG performance?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Steve, do you want to...", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, there's a number of factors that go into that, Joe. You also have close rate, if we improve the close rate. VPG is a little bit like RevPAR because you have the price that you're selling it at, but you also have the number of deals that you close. So there's other factors that go into it, but we were trying to highlight the ones that we recently talked about and the fact that we are seeing impact from them. But I mean, frankly, the sales machine is working on all cylinders. We couldn't be prouder about the effort that these guys have put forth and that they continue to deliver on, so it's a variety of factors.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then my final question, Tom, you kind of talked about some project capital stuff that's should be incremental to this year's CapEx number when discussing your 2013 guidance. What is your 2013 project CapEx or guidance? I mean, this year, it was between $195 million to $210 million. Where is that relative to that number for next year?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "We haven't given that guidance yet, Joe. And I think I mentioned the higher D&A because our CapEx levels over the last couple of years have been a little higher than they were historically. And that's why we're seeing a little bump in D&A, but we'll talk about it in February. Steve and I are both really keen to support any initiatives in our business units that are compelling economic investments in our core business. And so if we felt like increasing it over the last 2 years was the right thing to do, we'll let you know in February what it looks like, but we continue to be really supportive of investing in the business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just a quick housekeeping question. During the quarter given the acquisition, were you guys restricted from buying in stock for a longer period than usual?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "No, we -- generally, if there's activity that's taking place, we'll put a 10b-5 in place like before the earnings are announced or when we go into our quiet period. But no, there's nothing that restricted us.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then getting back to one of the prior questions, if you look at kind of the incremental flow-through on some of your timeshare business in the quarter, it looked like the conversion EBITDA from some of the incremental revenues in that segment were a little bit weaker, and I just wanted to understand a little bit more maybe why that wasn't flowing through at kind of the normal rates or normal margins. Is there any more color you guys can provide on that?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes. Our margin was a little light. In part, it was because of this intersegment fee that we charge, that our Hotel group charges. That was worth about 3/4 of the difference. But there was also the provision effect. We've increased our provision above and beyond what we did in 2011. So those are the 2 factors, Carlo. I mean, there was a bunch of gives and takes. But in general, operations was a plus. Portfolio was a minus, and then the intersegment fee was the minus.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Great, Tom. That's really helpful. And just in terms the provisions, is kind of that 25% level of sales what we should be looking at going forward? Or is there anything as we look out that would make that change?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "My reaction would be if these remediation plans we have work, and we believe they will work, then we'll see a moderating of that number over time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Agnew with MKM Partners.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Question on inventory. I guess I was surprised to see that not come down a little bit more in the quarter, especially given the strong VOI pace. And then a separate but maybe related question on WAAM 2.0. How do you expect that to impact inventory as you grow that within your mix?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Chris. Well, Tom, you can jump in here, too. I think the only thing that really impacted inventory not going down was the fact that we added some inventory on the Shell transaction, which offset the decline that you normally would have seen for the quarter. I think that's the only thing that impacted...", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes, absolutely.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Our spend level was not...", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Our spend level is actually consistent with where it was last year, so no, that\u2019s not it.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes. On the WAAM piece, you're right, Chris. There's an impact on WAAM 2.0, where, as Tom said, it's like just-in-time inventory. It comes on the balance sheet and flows off as we do the sales. So in any particular quarter, there could be a slight increase in inventory because of WAAM 2.0, but it's not going to be meaningful. Our kind of objective remains the same, which is we want to take our balance sheet down, we want to sell what's on our balance sheet. But we'll continue to take advantage of these WAAM 2.0 opportunities or WAAM 1.0 opportunities and, we think, most effectively manage that cost of sale element of our balance sheet -- of our P&L.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "And then a question on lodging. Several of the brands\u2019 RevPAR was well above average, and I'm just wondering how much is attributable to Apollo. And I don't know if you can quantify that in any way, because I know that you've rolled out different Apollo initiatives across the different brands at different times.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes, it's tough to be really precise, Chris, and we did look at this quite a bit. And let me just give you a little bit of color because maybe it'll help explain some of those increases. The third quarter is obviously a huge quarter for us because it's the big leisure travel quarter. And if you look at where we were up and where we were down, basically the Pacific Northwest, the West and down into the South into Texas was very strong during the quarter, in the U.S., obviously. Less strong was in the -- on the East Coast and towards the Northeast. So I think there were maybe shifts in some leisure travel during the quarter versus the quarter last year. But it wasn't massive, and it was very hard to tell what is specifically related to our Apollo initiatives. We know that we saw increases of the bookings through our websites. That definitely has picked up. But we don't know how many of those we would've gotten on the call center. We don't know how many of those would have been drive up, so it\u2019s a little bit difficult to tell with specificity. But I think the biggest barometer is what we hear from our franchisees. And we just had Howard Johnson franchisees in here yesterday, and there was good enthusiasm with the group. So I think they're seeing the results of some of these initiatives we're putting out. The TripAdvisor on our websites, as well as the various initiatives we've taken with Apollo.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "I see that the number of rooms in your portfolio jumped up nearly 2% quarter-over-quarter after basically being flat over the prior 2 years. What's driving that? Or what drove that in the third quarter? Is it signings, conversions, stability of financing?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks for the question, Patrick. There's a few things that are impacting it. One is we executed that HPT transaction that Tom spoke about in his comments. That brought on, I think, around 3,000...", "Thomas G. Conforti", "3,000.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "3,000 rooms. In addition, as Tom said, our pipeline is down a little bit because we did have some good strong openings in Asia. Openings internationally, and particularly Asia, are difficult to time. There's factors that are not as readily predictable as in the U.S. that we're trying to monitor closely, plus the fact that we do have master franchisees over there, which gives us a little bit less control on the timing, a little more subject to their availability to get those properties open and in the system. So there -- it's mostly that, but -- mostly those 2 factors, but the fact is that we have been talking all year that we would see an increase in rooms by the end of the year in part because we saw the HPT transaction coming. But also, there are a number of other opportunities that we're looking at that are large bolt -- conversions. As I said, I think RevPAR may be moderating. It's still growing, but it may be moderating a little bit. But we definitely see the growth in room opportunity as improving, and so we will be aggressively pursuing that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nikhil Bhalla with FBR.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Tom, just a question on when you're talking about the system size being a little bit dilutive, as you open new hotels internationally, to RevPAR. How should we think about the ramp in the new hotels that are opening up across the international locations? I mean, do you expect the ramp to be a little bit stronger at this point than what one would expect to see in the U.S.?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "It's a great question, and we've discussed it internally in preparation for the call. Our pipeline in Asia Pacific, while heavily influenced by our lower RevPAR brands, will start to be influenced over the next 12 to 24 months by Wyndham branded hotels, which will be much higher RevPAR impact than what our Super 8 produces in China. China will continue to be an engine of growth. So the bias in the calculation to a faster growing Asia-Pacific region, that phenomenon will be with us for a while. But the compounding effect of the lower RevPAR brands also contributing to that dilutive effect, I think that phenomenon over time will moderate because we do have a significant number of higher RevPAR hotels in China opening over the next 12 to 24 months.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Got it. And Steve, one follow-up question for you. You mentioned about U.S. RevPAR growth slowing down. Any color you may provide, what in your view may be causing that and how you see that shape up in the fourth quarter?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, we are leaving our guidance the same for the year. We were just saying we'll probably be at the bottom end of that guidance. So we don't see any cliff coming where things are falling off dramatically. We just see us a slower RevPAR growth. I think it's attributable to the fact that we've had a recovery in the hotel industry. There are more new starts now going on in the industry, probably impacting more the urban market than our market quite frankly. But we're starting to see some additional hotels being built. I don't think that this is, frankly, anything unusual. And in our planning, this is basically what we forecasted was there'll be a decline in the growth rate of RevPAR as the recovery continues. So it's pretty much predictable if you look at it over many years of cycles.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Got it. So construction activity, is that ramping up? Are you seeing some construction financing come back for some of the mid-scale brands and lower?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "A little bit, not dramatic, but a little bit. We've -- it's funny in our properties. Because we have a lot of economy products, we continue to see new construction happening, even during the middle of the downturn. And I would get a notice every week about another Microtel or Super 8 that was breaking ground. So there's always been a little bit out there. There's been some activity. It's picking up a little bit but not dramatically. I think more we've seen some of the urban markets like New York, where we've seen some new construction opportunities surfacing that had been silent for 2 or 3 years or more. So I think, as I said, I think most of it\u2019s going to be, right now, more immediately in the urban market.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bob LaFleur with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Robert A. LaFleur - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Tom, Steve, you guys were aggressive buyers of your stock in the 20s, in the 30s, in the 40s and 50s. Can you talk a little bit about your thinking about how far we might be from that inflection point where buying back stock might not be the highest and best use of your capital?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "All right, Bob. We're not there. I don't know what else to say. We don't put a target as to where we think the stock should be. As I've said before, I think, on these calls and I know I've said it in investor meetings, we look at this on a quarterly basis with our board. We present them with an analysis that shows what we think the intrinsic value of the stock is. We're not there. We're not close to it, so we think that there's still a lot of room. As I said, we think our stock is a great investment. So we've been pretty consistent with our point of view and continue to be.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Just going back to WAAM 2.0 for a minute. Was -- the sector was responsible for a good chunk of the timeshare revenue gain. And what I'm wondering is if you expect those kinds of sequential increases to continue and, specifically, if you could give us a sense of the pipeline of projects that are -- that should feed those sales going forward.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Harry. I don't think sequentially it's going to ramp up dramatically. And frankly, if we didn't tell you what was WAAM, you wouldn't know because WAAM 2.0 gets just reported the same way as our normal sales do. So you wouldn't really notice a difference. We're just describing it because we've said that we would update people on our WAAM progress. We have a number of deals that are still in the pipeline. The way we build our pipeline for deals is we look at our sales plan, what we expect to do over the upcoming years, and we back into what inventory we need and what locations. So I think I mentioned on the last call that we will look at 150 deals this year. We're only going to do a couple of them because they're exactly what we want. But that doesn't mean that half of them didn't make sense and couldn't be done in the future. So there's still a tremendous amount of opportunity out here. I think that this WAAM 2.0 or whatever our next iteration will be -- and we're constantly tweaking and improving this process. This group down in Orlando and our real estate team here in Parsippany are incredibly innovative and come up with new ways of approaching this, so stay tuned. I'm sure we'll be talking about other ways that we find access to inventory that is on a capital-light way that can improve our cash flow and the dynamic of the business.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "For the projects that do make it through and get approved, is there a common thread, characteristics that you're looking for? Is it a location? What are the features you're focusing on?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, they have to meet our minimum requirements, which is we need to know that the location is something that's desirable for our customers, the owners of our timeshare. The quality has to be right. The amenities has to be -- they have to be right. So it's really -- think of it as we're going out to look for a new construction site, and we want to find all of those aspects that make the site right. We look for the same thing in the projects. That's why some of them don't make the grade. And as we go through this process, we identify them, and sometimes we're talking with people about things that we might consider doing in 2 or 3 years and letting them know that they're still in the queue for us, but we're not prepared to execute a transaction with them yet because we just don't want to be too far ahead and then eliminate ourselves from other opportunities that become available.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And so last question is I think you mentioned that you looked at 150 deals to put 2 into the system. Are there another 150 that you think are fertile enough looking ahead? Or is -- do you think the pool of candidates is smaller, larger, about the same?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Let me rephrase what I said before, just in case I didn't say it clearly. We looked at 150. At least half of those probably would have qualified for deals with us, and we only did 2 of them. So there's still a lot of product out there. We only looked at 150. Our guys are constantly traveling. If they -- if we added more people or we added more days to the year, we would have more product to look at.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "Discussing the U.S. hotel market, could you, a, on revenue -- on RevPAR moderating, break that down between ADR and occupancy? And also, regarding East Coast, West Coast, maybe you can give us same-store sales. And then I have another question.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "All right, Mike. With respect to occupancy and ADR, I think they were relatively equal this quarter. Occupancy, ADR, that\u2019s all in the tables to the earnings. But I think they're relatively equal. As to East Coast, West Coast, the West Coast -- I mean, it's hard to get real specific, Mike, because I know the Pacific Northwest was up like 9% or something like that, and we were down a little bit on the -- in the Northeast. So it wasn\u2019t like we were up 25% somewhere. There were just some areas that were stronger, and that may reflect, frankly, weakness in 2011 that now is recovering and showing better in 2012. I think in the Pacific Northwest, that is one of the factors influencing it was that was weakened in 2011. So I don't think there's -- I mean, I'm trying to give you a little bit of that color, but I don't think there's a lot more that would be insightful for you. And Smith Travel, obviously, comes out with a lot of information on this as well.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "And the other question is regarding mobile devices. Could you give us some idea of what -- how that differs from historic -- history regarding the length of stay and if it's new customers, existing customers, whether it's -- how much is direct versus third party and any other color that might be helpful?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Sure. I mean, mobile is becoming a bigger and bigger portion of the booking machine. And what we did was -- what I spoke about was we added a click-to-chat feature, an easier-to-use click-to-chat feature, it was always kind of there, but it was clunky, to our mobile sites. What we're trying to encourage people to do is we're making it easier for them to contact us and book their room. If you go to our mobile sites right now, Super 8, Days Inn, whatever you might want to look at, there's a very easy express check-in button on the site where you can book based on the location you're at right now. It'll bring up the closest properties, and you can book it with basically one click and let people know that you're coming. So we're just trying to make it easier. Our travelers are largely car-bound travelers domestically, and we just want to make it as easy as possible. So when you pull over to the side of the road to look at your mobile phone and book your reservation, that it\u2019s as easy as possible and you can get back on the road.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "I guess I was looking for more -- a little bit more color on whether the customers differ in a number of characteristics or any characteristics.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, I don't have statistics on that right now. But the -- I would be willing to bet $1 that it's a younger demographic that's on the mobile phones than is on the reservations line. And we know that, I guess, another factor is that, I think I said this last quarter, that like 2 -- almost 2/3 of the bookings that we do are done on the day of arrival, and many of it is done within 5 miles of the hotel. So that's for the mobile bookings. So the mobile is the most immediate type of booking rather than just driving up to the hotel. So the immediacy is there, and my guess is it's probably a younger demo than you'd see in the normal either online or reservations booking.", "And thanks, all of you, for spending time with us. We appreciate the opportunity to share the results and look forward to talking to you at the end of the next quarter. Thank you.", "Operator", "And this does conclude today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Margo C. Happer", "Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO; and Tom Conforti, our CFO. Before we get started, I want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to a number of risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-Q filed October 24, 2012 with the SEC. We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these measures to GAAP is provided in the tables to the press release and is available on the Investor Relations section at our website at www.wyndhamworldwide.com.", "Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thank you, Margo. Good morning, and welcome to our year-end call. Once again, 2012 was a great year for Wyndham Worldwide across all of our businesses. I feel that I'm repeating myself each quarter as we talk about our performance. And while the view in the rearview mirror is great, the view out the windshield is even better. As you saw in our release this morning, we are raising our dividend and our earning guidance for 2013. We are also increasing our baseline sustainable annual free cash flow target to $750 million. So our outlook is positive.", "This morning I'd like to take a couple of minutes to reflect on what is driving these results and why this success is sustainable. In addition to having great businesses, strong brands and fantastic associates, we have also utilized our healthy cash flow to invest in the future growth of our businesses. We have continuously said that we would invest in our businesses through both M&A and CapEx, as well as return capital to shareholders through an increasing dividend policy and share repurchases. Our capital allocation policy is working. The investments in our businesses have put us in a position to be more efficient and drive future growth. Innovations such as program interaction or rci.com and our Vacation Exchange and Rentals business, our asset-light model, WAAM, and our timeshare business and our Hotel group Apollo program are examples of seeds that have been planted for future benefit, and we continue to plant more seeds. Our operation momentum has never been better.", "I will address some of the opportunities in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom to review our financial performance and our outlook for 2013.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Results were excellent in the fourth quarter and full year 2012. Year-over-year fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was up 14% and adjusted earnings per share increased 34%. These results reflect strong operational execution in all of our businesses and the benefit from our ongoing share repurchase program. During 2012, we repurchased 9% or $12.9 million -- excuse me, 12.9 million of our outstanding shares for $623 million at an average price of $48.30. In addition, our strong results, coupled with our long-term earnings and cash flow growth outlook, give us the confidence to announce a 26% increase in our dividend.", "Let's take a quick look at business unit performance. Wyndham Hotel Group had an exceptional quarter. Excluding higher intersegment fees, revenues increased 16%, and adjusted EBITDA increased 41%. These increases were primarily attributable to RevPAR gains and cost savings. RevPAR was up 4% globally and 6% domestically in the fourth quarter. As we've discussed in previous quarters, as we grow internationally, specifically in countries such as China, there will be a dilutive impact on global RevPAR. We opened 66,000 new rooms in 2012, our highest level in 10 years, and terminations were down 5%, resulting in a 2% net increase in system size.", "At Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, excluding the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions, fourth quarter revenues were flat, and performance was in line with expectations. We are especially pleased with European rentals revenue results, which remained stable despite the macroeconomic challenges in the region. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions, was up 3% driven by call center efficiencies resulting from our ongoing rci.com improvements. Adjusted EBITDA excluded $14 million in charges in the quarter, primarily related to trademark asset impairment of recently acquired brands, as we've decided to transition all of our North America vacation rental operations to the Wyndham Vacation Rentals brand over the next few years.", "At Wyndham Vacation Ownership, excluding the Shell contribution, business unit revenues increased by 6%. For the fourth quarter, year-over-year gross VOI sales increased 6%, reflecting a 6% increase in tour flow and a 3% decline in volume per guest due to the expiration of a VIP incentive marketing program and tighter credit underwriting standards. Revenues from our fee-for-service property management business increased 24%, primarily reflecting the Shell acquisition. Consumer finance revenues for the fourth quarter increased by 5% compared to 2011, reflecting portfolio contributions from the Shell acquisition. The provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter 2012 was $89 million or 21% of gross VOI sales, down from 22% of gross VOI sales in the fourth quarter of 2011.", "We continue to adjust our lending standards to achieve the optimal mix of sales and credit performance. For the full year 2012, excluding the increased licensing fee to the Hotel group and the Shell acquisition, adjusted EBITDA increased 10%, another terrific year. We added over 28,000 new owners, surpassing our goal of 27,000. 2012 also capped a great year of WAAM growth and expansion, with WAAM sales up 40%.", "Now let's turn to our 2013 outlook and guidance. We're going to post full guidance details to our Investor Relations website following the call. We are increasing revenue guidance slightly to $4,925,000,000 to $5,100,000,000. That's up 8% to 12% from 2012. We are also raising full year EBITDA and EPS guidance. Adjusted EBITDA guidance is now $1.14 billion to $1.165 billion, an 8% to 11% increase from our 2012 results. The increasing guidance reflects operating initiatives in the business and recent acquisitions. Adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2013 moves to $3.57 to $3.70, reflecting the higher EBITDA assumptions and share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2012. We expect the diluted share count of approximately 140 million shares, which, per our standard guidance policy, assumes no share buybacks in 2013. That translates to approximately 11% to 15% EPS growth in 2013 before 2013 share repurchases.", "Now let's take a quick look at guidance for each of our business units. As I've mentioned, we'll be posting full guidance details to our Investor Relations website and on a Form 8-K following the call, so I'm just going to cover the highlights. Starting with Wyndham Hotel Group, we expect another strong year. At the guidance midpoint, we expect revenue growth of approximately 9% and adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 10%. Regarding hotel drivers, we expect RevPAR growth of 4% to 6% and room growth of 2% to 4%. We expect Wyndham Exchange and Rentals revenues at the midpoint of guidance to increase 10% and adjusted EBITDA to increase 7%. Now excluding FX movements and acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA would be up slightly for the year, reflecting the weak economic conditions in Europe and the continued challenges in the broader timeshare industry. We expect average numbers of members in our exchange business to be flat and exchange revenue per member to grow 1% to 3%. We also expect rental transactions and average net price per rental to each grow 6% to 9%.", "For Wyndham Vacation Ownership, we expect total segment revenue growth of 10% at the midpoint of the revenue and EBITDA ranges. Excluding the Shell acquisition, timeshare growth is mid-single digit, in line with our long-term plan. We expect tour growth of 5% to 8% and VPG growth of 2% to 4%. We expect the provision for loan losses to decline slightly to approximately 22.4% of gross VOI sales, down from 23.6% in 2012.", "Companywide, we expect depreciation and amortization to be $217 million to $222 million, higher than last year, reflecting 2012 acquisitions, new business unit facilities and various capital and IT projects. We expect to spend between $250 million and $260 million in CapEx. Now our maintenance CapEx level is roughly $110 million, consistent with last year. The increase in growth CapEx reflects planned investments of approximately $30 million at the Rio Mar Hotel and $15 million for a Chicago hotel timeshare project, both of which Steve will discuss in detail shortly. We expect to spend $120 million to $130 million in timeshare development in 2013. Now that's up from $71 million in 2012 but still below the expected average annual spend of $150 million that we've targeted in the past.", "Importantly, as Steve mentioned, based on our current forecasts and the strong momentum in our business, we are raising our target for annual baseline sustainable free cash flow from $600 million to $700 million to a target of $750 million, with the reminder that cash can deviate more easily in any given year than earnings. For the first quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.64 to $0.67.", "We would note that there are some differences between our outlook and some analyst models with regard to share repurchases and seasonality. On a business unit level, WVO will have difficult year-over-year comparisons in the first quarter based on an exceptionally strong quarter 1 in 2012 and the timing of some expenses on the sales side.", "Now switching to activity on capital markets transactions. As we all know, the market for corporate debt today remains very strong. Today, we will announce an any-and-all tender for 2 tranches of outstanding senior notes totaling $500 million. The transaction will be contingent on our ability to refinance the tender debt.", "I'd like to finish by reiterating our strategy to deploy cash flow to increase shareholder value through growth, dividends and share repurchases. As Steve has discussed, the momentum in our business is quite strong and the deal pipeline continues to be strong. Our focus now and always is to maximize shareholder return.", "And with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Tom. Before we turn the call over for questions, I'll take a few minutes to discuss some of the forward-looking opportunities that will enhance our growth and reinforce our optimistic viewpoint. At WVO, our timeshare business, we launched our movement to an asset-light model with our WAAM program. Since its inception in 2009, we modified the program and continue to find creative ways to transition from capital-intensive product development. The latest example of that transformation is the recent acquisition of The Alex Hotel on 45th Street in New York City by Guggenheim Partners. We will manage the hotel while we prepare to convert it to timeshare. As we are ready for the inventory, it will be delivered to us, and we will pay for it at that time. We are looking to expand this relationship to possibly have a partner purchase some of the existing unfinished inventory, which is on our balance sheet, which will then be finished and returned to us as needed.", "Another great example of a creative application of our WAAM model is our recent deal with HPT for Hotel 71 in Chicago. This 350-room hotel will undergo a renovation and will be converted into a Wyndham Grand. A portion of the hotel will be converted to timeshare and leased to WVO for timeshare use. Similar to the project in New York, this deal will give us an entr\u00e9e into an urban market for tour generation and sales. As we have seen in San Francisco, Seattle, New Orleans and other cities, urban locations are highly desired by our timeshare customers.", "The creative approaches adopted by WVO are not limited to inventory procurement. As you know, marketing and tour generation is the lifeblood of the timeshare business. In this regard, we have some great long-term marketing affiliation partners, and we are pleased to add another to the mix. We have entered into a relationship with Margaritaville, Jimmy Buffett's lifestyle brand to create MARGARITAVILLE VACATION CLUB by Wyndham. The demographics of his customer base is a great match for our product, and we will have Margaritaville resorts starting with the conversion of a 34-acre property we control in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. This represents a great new source of owners for WVO.", "The Exchange and Rental business also has much to look forward to in 2013 and beyond. We will continue to refine and improve the rci.com experience for members and affiliates. The functionality and transparency of this program is truly transformational in the timeshare exchange industry. In the rental business, the 4 tuck-in acquisitions we completed since August 2012 will add to our growth and represent new markets for the organic growth of this business. We see some macro challenges in Europe during 2013 in the rental business, but we believe we have budgeted and planned for these challenges appropriately in our guidance. Our team has done a remarkable job navigating in a very difficult market and delivering for us.", "In the Hotel group, 2013 will be a year of continued growth. We recently obtained full ownership of the 600-room Wyndham Grand Rio Mar Resort in Puerto Rico, a resort we have managed since 2007. The purchase price was approximately $100,000 per key for this ocean-front, upscale resort. We will leverage our mixed-use model by converting roughly 1/3 of the existing hotel rooms into Vacation Ownership units.", "We have also recently completed several notable transaction with hotel REITs and ownership companies that bring both conversion of properties into our brands. An added benefit is that we will be managing some of these properties, expanding our presence in this arena. Deals with HPT, FelCor and Colony bring hotels into our Wyndham Hotels and Resort brand, as well as Hawthorn Suites by Wyndham and Baymont Inn & Suites. In addition, adding Wyndham branded hotels in Boston, Houston, New Orleans, Philadelphia, San Diego and other great markets make these relationships an important source of targeted geographically attractive growth.", "As I said at the beginning of this call, we are very optimistic about the future. We have built a strong foundation and are beginning to harvest some of the benefit from that foundation now. We expect this momentum to carry us well into 2013 and beyond. And now, Shirley, we'll take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Joe Greff with JPMC.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Tom, you mentioned that the deal pipeline is strong with the cost of debt continuing to be at very attractive levels. Are you thinking about doing larger, let's say, tuck-in type of deals? Or can you kind of talk about the profile of those deals in the pipeline that you're looking at? And then my second question, relatively easy question, is corporate expense was a bit higher in 4Q we modeled. I don't know if you talked about that in your prepared remarks. But if you can help us understand there if there was anything onetime. And then I guess, we'll wait for the Investor Relations website to have the details of the guidance but what corporate expenses -- you're thinking about corporate expenses in '13?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay. Joe, it's Steve. I'll take the first one. I'll let Tom take that easier second question that you referred to. On the deal pipeline side, the deal pipeline is about the same as it was last year. It was pretty strong last year. We got a deal -- a couple of deals done. It's -- we're not looking at anything that is much different from what we've done in the past, but when we talk about tuck-ins, tuck-ins can be larger than $80 million or $30 million or $20 million. They could be like the Shell deal was or they can be larger than that. So I don't want to make you think that the pipeline is huge. On the other hand, we're not tied basically to the size deals we've done in the past. I don't see us -- I don't see something out there right now that would push us towards a transformative deal, to be honest. I think there are opportunities for us that are great, what we consider to be tuck-ins that will add to the growth of our business.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Joe, on your second question -- if you have a follow-up for Steve, of course. But on your second question, it's the same story that we've talked about in the past. There are costs related to information security. There are higher personnel costs in the quarter because it was a terrific year for the company, and there were a couple of onetime things. But I wouldn't say that the expense growth in the fourth quarter on corporate expenses was attributable to a couple of onetime events. And then on 2013 guidance, right now we believe we're going to end up somewhere between $115 million and $120 million.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.", "Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Sure. The first [indiscernible].", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Are you there, Steve, or you have us on mute?", "Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Can you hear me?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes, you're in now.", "Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Sorry about that. So can you [indiscernible] more about how you...", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Steve, you must be on a cell phone that's not quite connected.", "Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So a couple things. First, on how you're thinking about new hotels, we've noticed the pickup in getting the Wyndham brand out there on the full-service front and in some cases, even paying or putting in a little bit of key money and buying some of these assets or at least paying a little bit for management fees. Should we start to think of that also because, at the same time, you're converting some of these hotels into timeshare, so do you sort of think about these things as we may have to pay up a little bit or we may have to pay to get into some of these hotels in some of these major cities, but then we're offsetting that and reducing our CapEx into some of these major hotels by selling it out as timeshare? And sort of talk about this circle between all of these things together. And then at the same point, just give us a little bit more color on the lower default rates in this quarter and what's going on there. Some of the issues that you faced in Q2 and Q3, are they dissipating?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay. I appreciate the first question, Steve, because that is something that we've been working on and talking about, frankly, for a long time, which is our mixed-use model. And unfortunately, while we had a great idea of how to execute the mixed-use model, the economy got in our way to a degree, and so while we had a great plan in place and we had some great kind of deals lined up, when the credit markets turned upside down, it got tough to continue to do deals. So while we got the Bonnet Creek transaction done in Orlando, we really didn't have anything else to talk about. What you're seeing now is the -- is kind of the evolution of that mixed-use model where we can take product like the Rio Mar in Puerto Rico, which we've been managing for a while, around which we own quite a bit of land, get control of the asset, turn some of it into timeshare. And you're correct. By doing that, we do lower the cost of our investment in the asset, and we can get timeshare in that asset and then timeshare around that asset and grow it out to be a mixed-use development like we have in Orlando. Similarly, the deal in The Alex Hotel in New York, as well as the Hotel 71 in Chicago, they're a little different, but they both get us into markets that we've been trying to get into for a long time. And I think the head of our real estate group told me the other day he's been trying for New York City for 15 years, and now we finally found a deal that works in New York for us at the right price point, in a great location with a product that will fit timeshare beautifully. And so it's a -- it's possible to use it as a hotel for a while and then over time, convert it to timeshare product. Same in Hotel 71 in Chicago where, in that case, we've created a lease environment where we'll lease the product and make it available to our timeshare owners. So yes, you're absolutely right. The timeshare hotel mixed-use concept is one that we've been trying to get off the ground for a while. We now have gotten it launched, and why, I think you'll see more of this going forward.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Steve, on your second question on the portfolio, the provision did come down a bit from last year in the prior quarter, and here's how we see it. We had shared that there were 2 core sources of the issue. There was this organized third-party activity, and then there was the issue of large loan balances. We feel like we're starting to make progress against -- a little more progress against these third-party groups that are defrauding our owners, and so that's -- that, we hope, we'll continue to see some improvement on. The large balance loan issue is something that's going to take a little while longer, we believe, to get right, but our guys are working on it, and it really is at the top of everyone's objectives for the year, to bring this together. So interpret the fourth quarter results as the beginning of some progress but much more work to do.", "Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And Steve, if I could just follow up on your comments. Just to be clear though, you continue to look at all sorts of ways of building that inventory from the most asset-light part of WAAM to potentially this mixed use to really -- I just want to sort -- I want to understand where you are on the spectrum of all of these different opportunities. Or are you truly optimistic at this point because you can make the math work in the different scenarios?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, we are opportunistic. I think it's kind of our charge is to be as creative and as opportunistic as we can for shareholders to drive the greatest value for us. We're trying to do things asset light. We prefer to keep the cash as long as we can. As long as the deal can be structured sensibly to be -- to work for us, we're willing to do that. And the added benefit that -- I guess, I didn't answer part of your question, Steve, when you talked about, are you willing to do these to get into markets. The answer is yes, we've been probably more aggressive at making key money available to get into some key markets. That's not the standard that we'll have forever, but it is the way that you -- it is kind of the price of entry to get into some of these markets. I think the combinations of assets changing hands, as well as the strength of our brand improving as we've done a lot to shore up the delivery and the value proposition for the Wyndham brand. So I think that, yes, you're going to see us do -- hopefully, creative things that can drive both the size of the Wyndham brand in the U.S. and around the world but also, get us into opportunities where we might be able to unlock markets that we previously have not been able to get into for both timeshare and for the hotel business. But we'll continue to build some of our own product. As I said, we're thinking about possibly bringing a partner in to take some of our inventory off our balance sheet that's unfinished, finish it up and in the next few years, deliver it back to us. That will free up capital that we can do other things with. So I think the -- we're kind of trying to optimize our capital allocation and get the most out of what we have.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Two questions here. The first is, can you give us a little bit more color on the VPG falling by about 3% year-over-year? How much did the acquisition of Shell play into that? And then additionally, as far as a loan loss provision, what is your rough target going forward? I know in the past, you've said around 20%. Is that still unchanged?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay. I'll -- it's a Steve. I'll take the first one, and then Tom will handle the loan loss one. On VPG, just to set the stage on that one and to go back to what we've talked to before, all -- many of our drivers are interdependent. Occupancy and ADR play off of each other. A number of transaction on rental and net rental price play off of each other. Similarly, within the timeshare business, tours and VPG play off each other. We could have a lot more tours, and we might have a lower VPG. We could have fewer tours and maybe a higher VPG. So I just wanted to kind of put a little bit of caution out there that there can be movement in those, and we've said that there might be movement in the past. To specifically answer your question though, the Shell transaction accounted for about, I think, 1/3 of the decline, and the rest of it was just the fact that we -- our tour mix was a little bit different. We had some marketing programs that changed, and we're constantly doing that and shifting marketing programs to optimize. So I wouldn't read too much into the VPG decline in the quarter. Just like we've said back when VPG shot up dramatically, we've said don't read too much into a dramatic increase in VPG. It just means some of our programs are working differently, and we're getting a little bit of a different result. The important thing is looking at the revenue production of the business and the ability to control our marketing costs and our cost of sales.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Just a quick follow-up on that part. In your  prepared remarks, did you -- I may have missed it. Did you give a VPG growth rate guidance for 2013?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes, 2% to 4%.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "2% to 4%, okay.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Anything else on that one, Patrick?", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "That's all.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Okay. And as it relates to provision, we are targeting a lower number next in 2013 than we did in 2012. It's about a 120 basis point difference, 23.6% in 2012 versus 22.4% in 2013. Look, it's our hope and desire that, that number be as low as possible, and in the past, we've had our provision be lower than that. We have a higher quality ownership base than we've had in the past, so some of the real important elements of what determine portfolio performance have been improving. But we don't have a crystal ball to say that it's going to be 15% or 20%, but we're going to do all that we can to continue to exercise those practices that enabled us to bring that down as much as possible while retaining the sales momentum that obviously is the key driver for this business.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Appreciate the color. One last follow-up question concerning the V -- excuse me, the Vacation Ownership margins in fourth quarter. Looked like they fell about 200 basis points. Remind me again, was that going against a very tough comp? How much did adding Shell into that, into the margin mix impact that?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "There was some G&A involved in it. Our VOI, our core business was flat. There was some timing on some G&A spend that didn't work in our favor. That's probably the largest driver of all. But keep in mind that there is a higher licensing fee as well, Patrick, which is worth about 80 basis points of the 200 basis points. So it's those 2 factors. It's that intersegment fee that they pay the Hotel group, and it's the G&A.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Agnew with MKM Partners.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Just to start off with maybe a bigger-picture question, your EBITDA margin guidance implies -- or your EBITDA guidance implies margins that are flat to down in 2012, which is against the trend of consistent margin improvement and maybe a little confusing given that the higher-margin businesses appear to be growing faster. And I was just wondering if you'd give me a -- provide a little bit of color there. I know you'll give the details later.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Sure. I think largely, Chris, it's a mix issue. And we can go through each one of the businesses, but take the hotel business, which is growing rapidly, part of that growth is coming in managed and the owned product, which has a lower margin than the franchise than -- particularly the U.S. domestic franchise business. So it's a little bit of a mix in that case. In the case of Exchange and Rentals, again, a mix issue to a degree we're bringing in more rental. The rental growth is faster than the exchange growth, and the rental growth -- rental business has a lower margin than the exchange business. At WVO, I think it's pretty consistent. I don't think it's...", "Thomas G. Conforti", "We're going to be up a little. Our margin guidance is up a little.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Up a little bit. Okay.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "All right, so did that kind of answer it for you, Chris?", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Yes. No, that was perfect. And then on the rental business, you mentioned that 4 tuck-in acquisitions were adding to the growth. Can you give us some color how much of that's coming from the acquisitions.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "For 2013?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes, the incremental EBITDA from those acquisitions -- or total acquisitions including Shell, I think, is $20 million, $20 million plus. So -- but that's incremental. That's not the annualized EBITDA contribution but the incremental contribution year-over-year.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Is that for the overall company? I was kind of asking about just your -- I think you gave guidance for rental transaction growth, 6% to 7%.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Rental's about $10 million.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Less than half of that, yes. Less than half.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Less than half. Okay. Perfect.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I was just hoping you guys -- with the updated free cash flow guidance to $750 million, could you guys maybe review your uses of capital, i.e., your leverage ratio? And do you expect to keep that constant? Or should we potentially expect more returned capital to shareholders x any kind of acquisition activity?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, our -- we haven't changed our capital allocation policy, Carlo, so it's the same. We will keep our leverage ratio around 3.2%, the way that the agencies calculate it, or 3.3%. And that will allow us to add on more debt as we increase our EBITDA, which we've said we would do because we don't look to improve that rating, but we want to stay where we are right now in investment grade. So that does give us a little bit more available cash, kind of cigar box cash of what we have available to do things with. We're increasing the dividend, obviously, by 26% as we announced this morning, so that's a little bit of additional use of capital. We will look to do M&A transactions if they make sense, and that's always kind of a -- it's a little bit of guesswork because you can't model opportunity. You don't know when the other side is going to say it's time to move on their business and to sell their business. So we continually look, and if the price is right and it makes sense, we move on transactions. But we would also -- will also keep a very active share repurchase program in place. We have about $0.5 billion still left on our existing authorization, and if we need to go back for more, we'll go back to the board and get more authorization.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Great. That's helpful. And if I could just ask one follow-up, with respect to your Vacation Ownership buyers, are you guys seeing or forecasting any shift between new and existing buyers relative to 2012 as we look ahead to '13?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "No, not really. It's going to be about the same ratio of about 2/3 upgrade, 1/3 new buyers.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "I would add to that though just one thing, Carlo. The Margaritaville deal, which I mentioned, is a neat deal because it obviously -- Margaritaville has a huge following. Buffett has a huge following, and their demographic is probably just slightly above the average demographic of our buyer. And so we think we have this opportunity to tap into a very attractive buyer who will find real value in our product and the experience they can have. So we're constantly looking for ways to shift the owner base and find new buyers. We're hopeful that, that will have an impact, maybe not in 2013 but certainly in 2014 and beyond.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nikhil Bhalla with FBR.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Just a question on currency, if I look at the U.S. dollar, it became a little -- the dollar essentially lost some strength in the fourth quarter of last year, and that trend appears to have intensified in 1Q. And when you think about your rental business in Europe, I mean, how do you see currency impacting your guidance, what you gave this morning for 2013?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Well, Nikhil, you're very precise in your analysis because one of the reasons that we increased our guidance from our initial outlook, but it's a small contributor, was the weakening of the dollar against the euro, is worth a couple million dollars so -- but we've already reflected that in our upgraded guidance.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Got it. Okay. And just general trends in Europe on the rental side, what you're seeing, if you could just give a little more color on what consumer behavior is at the moment versus where it was, say, in the third quarter of last year.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Sure. Well, it wasn't bright and rosy in the third quarter of last year, and it doesn't continue. It continues that motive, not being bright and rosy. There are some markets that are doing better than others. Take the U.K. for example. We saw -- we've seen good activity of U.K. travelers actually traveling out of the U.K. to Europe. U.K. within U.K. has been a little bit weaker starting the year. Some of the other markets, frankly, there's ups and downs, and there's trade-offs. I don't think I would highlight any other one as being really all that meaningful so far, but as I said, we have tried to kind of handicap that within our guidance because we know, just like we knew coming into this year, there would be some challenges. We know going into 2013 that there will also be challenges in those markets, and some will be weaker than others. So we try to take that into account, but it's hard to handicap something that is as volatile as the European market has been for us.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Sure. And just a follow-up question, Steve, is your overall view right now that Europe is sort of not getting worse but not incrementally improving? Or do you, just by looking at the data, you see -- do you feel there's still another leg down at some point?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, we think it will continue to be challenged. When you say a leg down, Europe is a collection of countries. So will a particular country have a leg down? I have no doubt that there will be slips during the year. I'm not going project -- I'm not an economist. I'm not going to project what's going to happen in each one of these markets. And that's why I said we've been cautious about how we're approaching that market. Obviously, it doesn't stop us from doing transactions in the market because we did a transaction in 2012 to acquire a U.K.-based rental company because in the long run, this is -- these companies will do great. Europeans value their vacation. They value their travel. Germany is the largest travel market in the world. So there is a lot of pluses over in Europe, but we're just -- we're cautious, and we don't believe that there is an upswing coming imminently. So we assume it's going to be kind of hard going, and our team is -- which, as I said, they've done a phenomenal job managing this business in Europe. All the people involved in the business have just done a remarkable job. We -- they're charged with doing the same thing now in 2013.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  And at this time, the question comes from Bob LaFleur with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Robert A. LaFleur - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "A couple things. One, Tom, can you just walk us through the major changes and the components of free cash flow that get you from the previous midpoint of $650 million to the current $750 million? Is that all just better EBITDA production for the business? Or are there other moving pieces in there? And then the second question, I'm just curious on the Margaritaville transaction, what are the basic economics there? What are you -- how do you get paid? How do they get paid? And just how does that whole relationship work? I mean, I don't need the specifics because I know the exact terms are probably confidential but just the basic structure of the deal.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes. Bobby, on the first question, you've given the answer, which is much of it's coming from improved cash EBITDA and continuing to work away at our inventory number. Those are really the 2 levers that we're focusing on. I mean, it isn't any more complicated than that. We are raising CapEx for the year because there were a couple of important projects that Steve talked about that need some additional CapEx, but in spite of that, we're pretty comfortable. We ended 2012 at around $795 million of free cash flow so -- and we looked out into years beyond 2013, and Steve and I, we're confident that with our projections for the next few years that instead of saying, $600 million to $700 million every year, we'd say $750 million is our new target. So we're pretty confident that we'll be able to deliver those numbers.", "Robert A. LaFleur - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Was there a tax issue going floating around in the free cash flow number? Somewhere I -- I seem to recall it being either a onetime contributor, but has that been taken out or...", "Thomas G. Conforti", "We did have a cash tax benefit in 2012 related to the tendering of debt that we did at the beginning of the year, and I think that was worth $20 million to $30 million of benefit. But we have talked in the past that our cash tax rate over time will increase, but in spite of that, we have the confidence that we do to raise our target to $750 million. Steve, did you want to take a crack at the second one?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes. On the second question, Bob, you're right, we're not going to disclose a lot of details about the transaction, but the -- about the Margaritaville transaction, but we have a number of large marketing relationships like this, Caesars, Outrigger, Universal Studios, and each one is a little bit different obviously because each partner is different. And what each partner is trying to accomplish is different. Margaritaville, the Jimmy Buffett's organization, has a desire to grow their base of customers. They have very loyal customers. It's a terrific franchise. So our deal with him is built upon mutual effort to create a base of owners of the MARGARITAVILLE VACATION CLUB by Wyndham, and as part of that growth, we'll both share in the success of that growth. So for Margaritaville, it'll be through a marketing fee and participation in our program. From us, it'll be building this base of customers who are not only loyal timeshare owners but also loyal Margaritaville fans.", "Robert A. LaFleur - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Is -- and last question, is there any read-through on this transaction into the entertainment at the next Wyndham Analyst Day?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "I wouldn't go that far.", "Operator", "At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I'll turn the call back over to the speakers.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay, Shirley, thank you very much. Well, we appreciate everybody attending the call this morning, and we look forward to speaking to you on the first quarter call later this year.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Margo C. Happer", "Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO; and Tom Conforti, our CFO.", "Before we get started, I want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K filed February 15, 2013, with the SEC. We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these measures to GAAP is provided in the tables to the press release and is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at wyndhamworldwide.com.", "Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Margo. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter call. I am pleased to report another great quarter resulting from strong operating performance across our businesses and enhanced by our disciplined shareholder-friendly capital allocation philosophy. We made great progress in the quarter on a number of strategic growth initiatives throughout our businesses. In the Hotel group, we had our best first quarter ever for room openings supported by several bulk conversions of existing hotels to our brands. This is a sign that we are gaining greater traction in multiple property owner relationships, which is expected to be a driving force for growth going forward. Nowhere is this more evident than with our Wyndham brand, where we've grown our footprint by over 30% since the first quarter of 2012, and in our managed portfolio, where we have doubled the number of properties in the past year.", "We believe these achievements are due, in good part, to our Apollo initiative, which is about driving reservations to our owners at the lowest possible cost. We are making significant progress in this area. Since we launched Apollo in the first quarter of 2010, we booked more than 27 million incremental room nights and over half of those are through our direct channels. This is translating to positive owner and developer feedback and consequently, to overall system growth.", "In Vacation Ownership, we continue to lead the industry in innovation, specifically, we are changing the approach of timeshare development with the Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model or WAAM. We announced the WAAM concept 4 years ago and to date, have launched WAAM 1.0 and WAAM 2.0, producing over $350 million in VOI sales. Today, I am pleased to announce that we recently signed a purchase and sale agreement, which we expect to close in the second quarter, for our first WAAM 3.0 transaction. With WAAM 3.0, we are directing a financial partner to make strategic investments for our future use. This could be either ground-up development or using inventory from our balance sheet. In this transaction, our partner will purchase from us land and work-in-process on a project located in Las Vegas and finish the development on our behalf, delivering it to us on a just-in-time basis. Total proceeds to us will be approximately $80 million.", "When we first announced our asset-light model, we targeted 15% to 20% of VOI sales through this structure because we wanted to work down the inventory already on our balance sheet. The success of our already initiated WAAM deals, both for us and for our partners, moves us forward in our transition from capital-intensive product development to a greater emphasis on asset-light by effectively monetizing inventory on our balance sheet. We are in the process of completing other light-structured transactions, which we hope to announce in the near term. We believe that the majority of our timeshare sales within the next 3 to 5 years could be in an asset-light form.", "The Exchange and Rentals business is off to a good start this year as well. Results in the Exchange business were especially strong as innovations introduced through rci.com drove additional revenues. With our technology advantage, we are gaining a bigger share of consumers' wallets and enhancing our services to affiliates. And with -- and the results are compelling. Last year, RCI added nearly 100 new affiliations and 150 new resorts to the portfolio. We bring better resorts to exchange members and better technology through affiliates and consumers. This is our formula to drive revenue and market share for years to come.", "In the Rentals business, we continue to make great progress in our global expansion. We've increased our footprint in the U.S. vacation rental market by almost 60% since we entered the market in 2010. And the integration of our most recent tuck-in acquisitions is going very well. We consolidated 32 U.S. websites into one on the newly upgraded wyndhamvacationsrental.com (sic) [wyndhamvacationrental.com] platform, which now gives consumers the ability to easily search our entire global inventory on one website. We encourage you to visit wyndhamvacationrentals.com (sic) [wyndhamvacationrental.com] to view the array of product we have available now.", "Above and beyond websites, we are committed to improve yield management, which is essential to help offset the economic challenges in Europe. We are leveraging our 39 years of RCI experience in revenue management and analytics to achieve results where others can't. For example, we are in the process of rolling out enhanced pricing tools in our U.K. Cottages business that we believe are the first of their kind in our industry. Using real-time reporting, we can monitor demand and automate price changes. This will enable us to maximize price and occupancy and to enjoy premiums where we should, and discounts only when and where needed to drive occupancy.", "Throughout the company, we continue to drive performance through a combination of sharp execution of our business unit plans and value-creating capital allocation. On the execution front, innovation such as rci.com and Apollo are driving improvements in the value propositions of our businesses while WAAM and transactions such as the Shell acquisition are supporting our growth strategy and generating strong cash flow. When we layer significant share repurchase on top of that, the result is a proven durable formula for continued performance.", "And now I'd like to turn the call over to Tom to review the results.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Thanks, Steve. First quarter results, once again, came in strongly, with adjusted EBITDA up 7%, and adjusted earnings per share, up 18%. The year-over-year EPS increase is attributable to strong operational execution across our businesses and the benefit of our share repurchase program. Let me spend a few minutes on the highlights of the quarter and then we'll get into your questions.", "Our Hotel group had an excellent quarter with revenues up 20%, and EBITDA up 18%. Top line and EBITDA gains were attributable primarily to higher RevPAR, a nice increase in system size and the addition of our second owned hotel, the Rio Mar, to our portfolio. RevPAR was up 4% globally and 6% domestically in the first quarter. International RevPAR was flat and was negatively impacted by China performance where, as we've discussed in previous quarters, our economy segment is growing faster than higher RevPAR brands.", "As Steve mentioned, room openings were exceptional with over 14,000 rooms coming into the system in the quarter. We also did a great job of sustaining the pipeline which, despite the high openings in the quarter, remained flat from year-end. At our Exchange and Rentals segment, excluding the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions, first quarter revenues and adjusted EBITDA were both up over 1%. We believe these are good results given the economic and consumer confidence environment in Europe and stagnant trends in the broader timeshare industry. In constant currency, exchange revenue was up over 3% driven by higher exchange revenue per member, reflecting growth and exchange fees from new products, price increases and growth in affiliate club servicing revenues.", "Rental acquisitions contributed $7 million of incremental Vacation Rental revenues, but had no impact on EBITDA for the quarter due to seasonality of those businesses. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Rental revenues were flat as we were able to offset lower transaction volumes in Europe, particularly in the U.K. and Holland, with enhanced yield management efforts that Steve discussed. In our Vacation Ownership business, revenues and adjusted EBITDA were each up close to 10%. Now excluding the Shell acquisition, adjusted EBITDA was up 5%, primarily reflecting an improved provision for loan loss and the benefits associated with a favorable legal settlement, totaling $11 million. Gross VOI sales were flat, reflecting a 10% increase in tour flow, offset by an 8% decline in VPG. VPG was down due to difficult comparisons resulting from an exceptionally strong upgrade marketing program last year as a mix effect of lower Shell VPGs. While we are holding our VPG guidance for the year, we expect to come in at the low end of the range. Regardless, we're confident that we can mitigate any weakness in VPG by cost controls and the many other levers we have to employ in this business.", "The number of new owners added increased 5% from the first quarter of last year, which also was reflected in VPG trends. Growing the new owner pool is an important component of sustaining the overall business and comes with the trade-offs of lower VPG. WAAM sales for the quarter were $49 million, a significant increase from the $17 million in the first quarter of 2012, reflecting higher WAAM 1.0 sales as well as the inclusion of $13 million of WAAM 2.0 sales. Property management revenues significantly increased, reflecting the addition of the Shell portfolio. Remember that these fee-for-service revenue streams were an important rationale for the Shell acquisition, but as in the Hotel business, property management revenues include reimbursable expenses, which reduce the overall reported margin. Defaults in the quarter were down 3% and the provision for loan loss was $84 million, down from $96 million 1 year ago. Relative to sales, that's a 200 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2012. We are seeing good progress in portfolio trends, especially around slowing cease and desist activity.", "Now let's spend a few moments on the quarter's balance sheet and capital markets activity. On the ABS front, we completed a $300 million timeshare securitization with an advance rate of 91% and a weighted average coupon of 1.77%, another terrific execution. Earlier in the quarter, we successfully tendered for $446 million of our 2018 and 2020 senior notes and exercised the make-whole option to redeem the remaining $43 million outstanding of our 2014 notes. We also repurchased $42 million of our 2016 notes on the open market. To replace these notes, we issued $450 million of 2.5% senior unsecured notes maturing in 5 years and $400 million of 3.9% notes maturing in 10 years. In total, we replaced $530 million -- $531 million of debt with a weighted average cost of 6.75%, with $850 million of debt at a weighted average cost of 3.16%. The debt repurchase transactions resulted in a pretax charge of $111 million, which has been excluded from our first quarter 2013 adjusted results. The transactions were assumed in our interest expense guidance issued in February. We also added approximately $120 million of debt associated with The Alex Hotel in quarter 1. While this debt is legally our partner's, it is consolidated on our balance sheet in accordance with GAAP and counts in our leverage ratio with the rating agencies.", "In total, our debt level at the end of the first quarter was nearly $360 million higher than it was at the end of 2012 and our leverage ratio was temporarily above our targeted range. As part of our financial policy, we remain committed to an investment-grade rating. Our leverage will return to our target range over the remainder of the year as EBITDA increases. Overall leverage is expected to remain higher than 2012, consistent with the company's commitment to add leverage as we grow EBITDA.", "Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.69 per share compared with $1.31 per share last year. We spent $140 million to repurchase shares, about $105 million for repurchase premiums on the tendered debt and nearly $50 million in hotel development advances. Based on today's guidance in our baseline, sustainable free cash flow target of $750 million, we expect around $5.45 in free cash flow per share in 2013.", "As you saw from the press release, we are bringing up the bottom of our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $0.03 based on our quarter 1 share repurchases. For now, we are holding at the top end of our range. It's early in the year and, just as significantly, currency movements relative to our original assumptions are creating headwinds, causing a $10 million change in our full year EBITDA expectations since our guidance just 2 months ago. Our full year share count guidance is now 138 million shares. This excludes any share repurchase beyond the first quarter of 2013. For the second quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.87 to $0.90. We would note that there are some differences between our outlook and some analyst models with regard to future share repurchases. On a business unit level, year-over-year comparisons for -- in the second quarter will be challenging for the Hotel group due to the expense timing, for WVR due to a claim settlement related to the Gulf oil spill that we recognized in 2012, and for Vacation Ownership as it continues to lap the upgrade marketing program of 2012. As a reminder, our full year earnings and driver guidance are posted on the company's website at www.wyndhamworldwide.com. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Tom. Tom and I have the pleasure of talking about the performance of our company, but it is the focused execution by our associates that deliver the results. We all share with pride the strong culture we are building in Wyndham in just the last 6 years since our listing. Examples of this culture are the recognition as one of the top 100 greenest companies in the U.S. as ranked by Newsweek; among the top 50 companies for executive women by the National Association of Female Executives; a perfect score of 100 in the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Index; and just last night, we were named among DiversityInc's top 50 companies for diversity in the United States. It's our employees living our core values that are reflected in these accolades and enable us to consistently deliver great results. It's a great foundation from which we continue to grow. And now, Shirley, we'll take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Greff with JPMC.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Steve, with regard to your introduction of WAAM 3.0, this purchase and sale agreement with the financial partner, can you talk about how the economics would work? What percentage of economics that you would get? You also mentioned there are other like-structured deals in the pipeline, is it with this same financial partner or with others? And then I have a couple of follow-ups.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay. Well, thanks for the question, Joe. The WAAM 3.0 is similar to WAAM 2.0 in that we will be providing financing to the end consumer. So unlike WAAM 1.0 where the partner was providing the financing, in this case, it will be very -- economically very similar to WAAM 2.0. The real differentiation is that we're bringing in a financial partner to take down the inventory. So one way to look at it might be that with WAAM 2.0, we were basically capitalizing on a market that had a lot of excess inventory out there and there were tremendous opportunities and we were being advantageous with our purchases. With WAAM 3.0, we're being more strategic with our purchases and we're also establishing basically something that we've wanted for a while, which is basically a programmatic approach to doing it, where we can kind of time out our inventory build. With respect to the additional deals that we're working on right now, they could be with the same partner, it's not required, there's several people who have expressed interest in this offering that we're now making. But we hope to be able to do more with the partner we're working with right now. They understand our business, they kind of get the way that the business operates and they've been great partners. So we'll have to see what the future holds.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Great. And then, another couple of follow-up questions here. In Lodging, in the revenue segment, if we're looking at your Table 4, the owned hotel segment jumped up a lot and I know that's inclusive of the Rio Mar, but the line item below that, ancillary revenues, also jumped a lot on the year-over-year basis, maybe less so on a sequential basis. I guess what exactly is that? How much of that is pass-through and what's the margin or flow-through on that? And then with the Rio Mar, I know that boosted revenues, is that positively contributing to EBITDA yet? Is that EBITDA positive?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "What was the last question, Joe?", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "With respect to the Wyndham Rio Mar, is that contributing on an EBITDA basis? Is that EBITDA positive yet?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Joe, it's Tom. Rio Mar did contribute positive EBITDA in the quarter, it's a seasonally positive quarter for Rio Mar. It was worth about $3 million. And most of that ancillary revenue is kind of pass-through revenue, low margin revenue and so, there really isn't much EBITDA gain from that at all. In fact, that's a contributor to our margins sort of being stagnant for the quarter.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then my final question, going back to Vacation Ownership, if we exclude the impact of Shell on VPG, what was the year-over-year performance in volume per guest?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "It -- we would be down 7% in VPG, so it was worth around 150 basis points.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Steve Kent with Goldman Sachs.", "Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just a quick one. I'm following up on Joe's question on the strategic partner. Can you name who this strategic partner is? Is it a real estate developer? Is it a former timeshare developer? Just some sense for that. And then, more importantly, I guess I'm just a little concerned about the timeshare sales pacing, you put more people through the tours but the number of customers who are essentially buying slowed down. You did say that the upgrade cycle is slowing. Does -- is that -- are you reaching the maximum or are you reaching sort of the full potential of that? And should that ratio of sales that are going to upgrades versus new customers start to decline? And what are the implications of that to profitability?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, I'll start and then Tom can add anything he wants to add. On the first question, Steve, it's a financial partner. It's not somebody who's a timeshare developer or who's been in timeshare in the past. It's a financial partner that's taking the assets and finishing them off and making them available to us. On the second question about VPG, VPG, we've said in the past, has always been kind of a difficult thing to say that it's always going to be moving in one direction. We've had quarters in the past where VPG has been down quarter-over-quarter. It's not an indication that there's any sort of an issue with producing EBITDA for the company, what it means is there could be some mix changes. So yes, you may see more VPG decline as we push new sales, which is part of what's impacting this quarter, so we are ramping up our new sales. But that's a function of what we see out in the marketplace, what our marketing programs are producing. So there's a lot that goes into that. I think the bottom line is the VPG decline, and we've said this last quarter as well, is just one element to this business. Tour flow was up 10%. VPG happened to be down. And so it is a bit of a balancing act. And as we noted, Shell is a piece of that, that VPG decline as well. So I don't know, Steve, if I answered...", "Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I guess my only concern is, is that the -- selling the upgrades was a relatively low marketing expense part of the story and I'm just wondering if on a go-forward basis whether margins will be compressed if you have to shift more. Tell me if I'm wrong, I thought it was like 60-40 or 70-30 at one point upgrades versus new customers, whether that shifts, whether that could have an impact on the margins in this segment.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, it -- you're right. I think \u2013 was it 65-35.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "65-35.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "65-35. You're right in the zone there. The -- there are higher marketing costs associated with new sales. It costs more to get a tour to come in -- get a couple to come in and do a tour as a new customer than it does somebody who's staying at our resort. So there is a marketing cost differential. Again, it's just one component of what we have. There's a lot of levers within the business and ability to control some cost and take cost down. This was all within our plan and we're kind of at the bottom end of our VPG. But as we watch through what's happening, we're obviously -- these guys are very good in Orlando who manage this business, they're constantly adapting and adjusting to what they're seeing in the marketplace. And so I don't think it's an indication that there's a slowdown. I think it's -- what it's an indication of is we're taking advantage of different marketing channels. And we had an absolute killer VIP program, marketing program last year. It definitely outperformed our expectations, and I think we were talking about it last year as being -- just the results have been extraordinarily good. So I wouldn't read too much into that. I think it's just where we've got a tough comparison because last year was so strong and we are focused on bringing in new customers. If the new customers come in at a higher marketing cost, well, then it's incumbent upon us to adjust other costs to make the levers all work.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Agnew with MKM Partners.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Wanted to ask a follow-up question on WAAM 3.0 and how this impacts your development margin versus WAAM 2.0 and non-WAAM transactions. And also, can you clarify what you mean by total proceeds of $80 million? Is that effectively amount of the inventory that's involved?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "On the second question, the answer is yes. It's the inventory and land that's on our balance sheet that we'll be selling off in order to have our partner take it and complete it. The -- with respect to the first part of the question, the economics are not a whole lot different. If we held the property ourselves, we would have to develop, then we'd have the cost of carry to develop the property. So if you look at our average cost of capital, it's above what the cost is to have a third party develop it for us. So from an overall basis, we think this is a smart thing to do because it's holding our capital within the house. We're not having to put the capital out until we need to put it out. And it gives our model more of a kind of a just-in-time manufacturing feel to it. And actually, turns a little bit more into kind of a fee-for-service business because we're not having to sit with a huge amount of capital on the balance sheet. Now the balance sheet won't go down immediately, it'll go down over time as the product is taken off and sold. But it's -- it will give us a chance to de-asset-heavy our business.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Got you. And if I could ask a follow-up on the VPG, and I might have missed this, when did the -- your promotion last year, which really drove VPG, when did that end and you start lapping that? And also, if just throw in another one on credit scores. At ARDA this year, there was quite a lot of discussion about the industry reaching back down to customers with lower credit scores. And I'm just wondering where you stand with respect to that?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Chris, it's Tom. So the promotion lasted for 3 quarters last year. And our commitment to sustain credit scores where they've -- with progress we've made over the last few years remains steadfast. So we're going to continue to seek FICO stores above 700 for the most part.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "My questions pertain to the loan-loss ratio coming down substantially year-over-year. Did you -- and I think you alluded to this on the previous question, did you tighten credit standards further? And if so, did that have an impact on sales volumes? Or was the loan-loss provision coming down more of a -- more due to previous sales or loans performing better than initially expected?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Patrick, it's Tom. We had diagnosed the issue with portfolio to be -- it did have 2 causes. One was this third -- organized third party activity to defraud and the second was the large balance loans. We talked about tightening our underwriting criteria to deal with large balance loans. We tightened it, we loosened it a bit more. And so I wouldn't attribute the improvement in portfolio to improvement on large balance loans just yet, but neither was the tightened underwriting criteria a significant factor in VPG. So where we've really made progress and we've seen a discernible change in the underlying cost of portfolio is around this organized third-party activity. We've made serious inroads as we felt we would to slow the level of defaults that are taking associated with this cease and desist activities. And so we thought that was a -- that would be the first area that we could deal with because it's more easily dealt with, and I think we've addressed it pretty aggressively. So we're happy with where we ended up in the quarter with the provision.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Thank you for the color, and then just one more question here concerning WAAM 2.0. You had a very strong start to sales, though it seemed to have faded a bit. Where do you see that opportunity going forward?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "I think it'll still be out there, it'll still exist. And we will continue to pursue those opportunistic deals that come up and our available. We may flip some of our 2.0 to 3.0 if we feel it's in our best interest to have a partner take it on, because it's bleeding in over a longer period of time. For example, the deal we did in New York is really kind of a 2.0 deal, the Alex Hotel that we're converting and selling these timeshare. So it's -- we'll continue to use both.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Bob LaFleur with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Robert A. LaFleur - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "I was wondering if you could just -- again, going back to 3.0 here. What exactly are you selling to the partner? Is it -- and what combination of land and/or work-in-progress is it? And I guess I was confused by your comment that it's something that's going to phase. So that leads me to ask you, is this one project you're selling to them or is it across multiple projects? Just a little bit more on understanding the logistics of the whole thing. And then a related question, if this deal is $80 million and you're working on additional 3.0 projects with what you have on your balance sheet, can you give us the sense of the order of magnitude? Is this half of the potential volume of these type of transactions, 1/3, or any color you can give us on that?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, it is one project that we're talking about right now, Bob. But there's other projects, as I've said, that we're working on. It is a combination of land and building, but I honestly don't have in front of me right now the percentage that was land. It's a project that's out in Las Vegas that we began construction on prior to the downturn. And we put it on hold because we didn't want to pursue more development and we were switching our capital allocation philosophy around that time. So it was -- it's been out there. It's been available for us. We now have an opportunity to finish it. It's going to be a terrific product when it's done. But it's -- it will be done by somebody else, finished up by somebody else. When I say it's going to be phased in, it's because there is still construction that has to take place. It's going to take a while for them to complete it. So we'll get the $80 million now and then when we start needing the product, we'll take the product down and we'll pay for it over time as we need it. I just got handed a number, actually, of the $80 million, $65 million is building and $15 million is land. So those -- to answer your first question, Bob.", "Robert A. LaFleur - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then -- okay, that -- it wasn't clear because I wasn't clear whether the $80 million was coming in over time or the inventory would go out over time, so that makes perfect sense.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "The $80 million will come in when we close.", "Robert A. LaFleur - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay, a, when do you think that's going to be? And b, is that $80 million additive to -- because that's essentially free cash flow, is that additive to the $750 million or is that part of the $750 million for this year?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, I'll answer when it's going to close and then I'll ask cash-flow Conforti to talk about the cash flow impact. But it -- we expect it to close in the second quarter. There's some zoning issues that we have to get complete and other things in order to close the transaction. But we did sign the purchase and sale agreement.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes. And Bob, the $80 million is above and beyond sort of our core forecast of $750 million.", "Robert A. LaFleur - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then the last question that did is can you give us an order -- a sense of order of magnitude is, like how many more of these potential deals are there given what's on your balance sheet? Is this half of what you have? 1/3? Anything you can give us on that.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Bob, probably closer to 1/3 of what we have. So there is more on the balance sheet that we can use this format for. And that's land on our balance sheet that we know we're going to develop over time. It's in great locations, but it's going to be there for a while. We know that, and that was the planning when we acquired control of some of these parcels of land.", "Robert A. LaFleur - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then, I promise, the last question. Is there any sort of WAAM application for completed inventory that's on your balance sheet, any sort of bulk sales, sale leaseback type arrangements? Or is this 3.0 kind of the way you're looking at dealing with stuff that's already on the balance sheet?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "I don't -- this is the way that we're thinking about dealing with what's on our balance sheet, not that 3.0 as the last iteration of what we will have. And the reason that we keep redefining it is we're trying to make it easy to follow kind of the steps that we're taking and the differences that these make to the way that we're kind of evolving this program. But I can pretty much guarantee you that there will be a 4.0 at some time and it's going to be a different form from what we have right now. But I don't -- I'm not going to say that it's going to be something coming off our balance sheet. That's not necessarily the next program that we'll roll out.", "Robert A. LaFleur - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "So it sounds safe to say that the completed inventory that is on your balance sheet right now is likely to stay there and just get disposed through traditional channels, is that fair?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "That's correct. That's correct.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Just changing gears a little bit. Can you give us some sense of how your bookings look for the Vacation Rental segment in the second and third quarters, particularly in Europe?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay. Well, Europe is a tale of many countries, I'll put it that way. And there are parts of the market that have actually been performing very well in advanced bookings and there's parts that have been weaker. To kind of break it down for you so you have a sense of the strengths and weaknesses, the Southern European product has been moving very well, which basically indicates that Northern European travelers to Southern Europe are booking at or above the expectations that we have. The Northern to Northern European travel has been a little bit slower and we have seen over the last several years a slowdown in the booking pattern where the bookings get closer to the date of arrival, so we're monitoring that. And that's partially also -- I've mentioned before, Harry, this yield management system that we're rolling out in our U.K. Cottage business. Part of the reason for doing that is with the booking patterns changing, we need to be better at managing the inventory that we have available. And that's, for this industry, quite a shift because the normal way of doing it in this industry is you set a price with your home that you have or cottage that you're giving to us, and that price is set and it doesn't really move during the season, the rental season. Now we're going for more flexibility with the owners to give us the flexibility to help them move price to take advantage of opportunities. And that might be premiums at some times, it might be discounts at other times based on those patterns. So I think this shortening of the booking window, which we have seen in the hotel industry over the years and we're now seeing more in the Rental business, is something that we think is a trend that will stay in place. With the amount of product that's available online now, it just makes it so much easier for people to kind of monitor what's available, what's out there and then book when they want to book. So hopefully, that kind of addresses the question.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Yes, just one quick follow-up on that. Just generally speaking, do you think that your forward bookings, just on the books today versus this time last year, are above or below last year or about the same?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "It's so early, Harry. I mean, we've said -- like we said last year, I think somebody asked this question in the first quarter, the first quarter is, you're booking basically spring, which is not the heavy period. The summer is the heavy period, and so the second quarter is usually where we see the bulk of those summer bookings coming in. So it's really too early, frankly. I'm not evading the question, it's just too early to tell.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. And then my second question, just going back to timeshare. The legal settlement, I'm not sure if I got the number right, was that about $11 million? Is that what you said?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "It was, yes, $11 million.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Yes. Okay. And that was -- okay. And so, if you back out the Shell acquisition and the legal settlement, would your kind of same-store results have been somewhere in the high 90s EBITDA? Does that sound about right?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "It's hard for me to do the math off the top of my head on this one, Harry. Let us get back to you on it, okay?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes. I think, Harry, what you'll see if you back those out is that it was probably fairly flat for the -- down slightly for the quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just quickly with respect to the free cash flow. I was just wondering being up nicely this quarter despite having spent a little bit more on the maintenance side, is there anything one-off in that item for the 1Q '13?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Not for first quarter. It was the EBITDA performance and then some improvement in working capital associated with our receivables over in the timeshare business.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just with respect to the legal charge. Where does that come in? And has that, along with the $10 million in EBITDA -- sorry, headwind from FX, is that -- are both of those currently contemplated in the same EBITDA guidance as prior?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Everything's -- yes. Everything's contemplated.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes. Frankly, the legal settlement, which is really a component of 2 things, we settled for less than we had reserved for and we received reimbursement of some legal expenses that we have, that's what's in that number. So those are things that hit us in the past that we got reimbursed for, basically, in the current period. Those were in our forecasts when we laid it out in our EBITDA guidance for the year, so that was already in there. What wasn't in there was the $10 million of headwind that we're having on the foreign currency. That's the piece that's flipped the most over the last 2 months.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Correct. Yes.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Understood. And then, just if I could ask one quick follow-up. With respect to inventory spending in the 1Q, do you guys have a number for that?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Inventory spend.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "We'll get it for you in a second, Carlo.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "We'll get that for you. We don't have it off of the top of our heads, Carlo.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "$23 million, Carlo.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "2-3?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "See, I was quick to respond to your question.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "I think you may have touched on this earlier but I was curious as to what you see or what do you expect to see the impact of this sequester in terms of maybe timeshare stays or hotel booking changes or anything else that you see or trying to work around.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Mike. We don't see a big impact from the sequester. If -- most of our customers in the hotel side drive, some fly, so I guess they may be delayed in getting to where they're trying to get to right now. But it doesn't impact the fact that they still need a hotel room when they get there. So we have not seen anything that I would say is meaningful from the sequestration.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "And that's true also of the timeshare stays?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes. We don't -- I mean, obviously, our busy season is coming up in the summer when we're chock-a-block full, but we don't see any change in our occupancy on the timeshare side.", "Operator", "At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the speakers.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay. Well, thank you very much, all, and we will look forward to speaking to you on the second quarter call.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now turn the call over to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Margo C. Happer", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO; and Tom Conforti, our CFO.", "Before we get started, I just want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to a number of risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. The risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-Q filed April 24, 2013, with the SEC. We will also we be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these measures to GAAP is provided in the tables to the press release. It is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website at wyndhamworldwide.com.", "Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Margo. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter call. As you saw from the press release, we had another great quarter with adjusted EBITDA growth of 6% and adjusted EPS growth of 13%, reflecting strong execution and operating momentum in each of our businesses. We also continued to drive value for our shareholders through disciplined capital allocation. Based on our strong cash flow and what we continue to believe is great value in our stock, the Board of Directors has added $750 million to our share repurchase authorization.", "Tom will go through the details on the quarter, but I'd like to point out a few highlights. In Vacation Ownership, we closed our first WAAM 3.0 deal in Las Vegas, and we're seeing strong monthly sequential improvement in VPG from the first quarter. The Exchange and Rental business is performing very well in a difficult operating environment with improving yields in Europe and revenue increases from new products in the Exchange business. And the Hotel group continues to execute its plan, achieving solid adjusted EBITDA growth.", "Next week marks the 7-year anniversary of our listing on the New York Stock Exchange. I'm proud of what we've accomplished so far. We've taken great businesses and made them even better. But I'm even more excited by what lies ahead. We recently completed our annual 5-year strategic reviews, and we're very excited about the opportunities before us.", "Let me make a few comments on our strategic direction in each of our businesses. Since the spin, the Hotel group has established itself as a full service hotel company, adding hotel management expertise to what was already the largest hotel franchisor in the world. We've gone from 11 brands in 48 countries to 14 brands in 67 countries. And there's plenty of runway left. We have a strong pipeline, of which close to 60% is international today compared with just 25% when we went public. We will continue to focus on increasing our value proposition to our franchisees and consumers through enhanced technology and marketing. And while we see great potential for all our brands, we will continue to investigate opportunities to add new brands to our portfolio.", "In the Exchange and Rental business, we are focused on inspiring world-class service, leveraging technology, expanding into new geographic markets, developing new products and improving analytics. All of these are evident in the progress we've made at RCI. We continue to increase the value to our affiliates and members through our industry-leading technology, which has improved service delivery and resulted in innovative product offerings. Innovation and technology continues to pay dividends, increasing margins and growing revenues.", "As a side note but very relevant to RCI's growth prospects, ARDA, the timeshare association, recently published its 2013 State of the U.S. Vacation Timeshare Industry study. We are encouraged that 2012 marked the first significant increase in timeshare industry sales volume since the low mark in 2009 and the largest increase since 2007. Trends in the industry point to a continued rebound from the lows experienced during the global economic downturn.", "In the Vacation Rentals business, we have successfully acquired 9 businesses in the last 3 years. And importantly, they are performing better than our expectations. Vacations rentals is estimated to be a $65 billion global market. According to PhoCusWright, more than half of the market in Europe and the U.S. is professionally managed. With over 100,000 vacation rental properties now under management, Wyndham Vacation Rentals is the undisputed global leader in managed vacation rentals with exciting potential to grow.", "Now turning to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. We've dramatically improved our already impressive traditional timeshare business. We have reduced marketing spend, improved margins, tightened our credit underwriting standards and are limiting the capital deployed while improving the bottom line. The result has been a stronger business with better cash flow.", "In addition, we've completely revolutionized the timeshare industry by introducing a fee-for-service model, which results in even better cash flow and returns. We introduced the Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model, also known as WAAM, in the spring of 2009. Our first iteration, WAAM 1.0, is a pure asset-light fee-for-service model, where Wyndham Vacation Ownership uses its sales and marketing platform and expertise to sell completed inventory for third-party developers.", "WAAM 1.0 has great returns, but there's a trade-off. Since we don't finance the consumer purchases, we give up EBITDA and growth. To address this issue, we introduced WAAM 2.0. In WAAM 2.0, Wyndham Vacation Ownership purchases completed inventory from a developer on a just-in-time basis, allowing us to finance the sale and capture the attractive consumer finance spread. In addition, it significantly collapses the time the asset is on our balance sheet, improving overall cash flow and returns compared with our traditional model. With WAAM 3.0, as with 2.0, we purchase the inventory on a just-in-time basis and we finance the consumer purchases. But in this case, we are working with a financial partner to make strategic investments for our future use.", "This inventory is built to our specifications. It could either be ground-up development or using inventory from our balance sheet. In our first WAAM 3.0 transaction, our financial partner for this deal, Guggenheim, purchased from us land and work-in-process in Las Vegas for $87 million in cash and in note. They will finish the development and deliver it to us on a just-in-time basis.", "We have approximately $180 million of land and work in process remaining on our balance sheet after the Las Vegas transaction, most of which is suitable for WAAM 3.0. In addition, we are already in discussions on ground-up development opportunities utilizing the WAAM 3.0 model. As we said on the last call, we believe that the majority of our timeshare sales within the next 3 to 5 years could be in an asset-light form, significantly improving the cash flow and returns from the business, a primary strategic focus of Wyndham Vacation Ownership and Wyndham Worldwide overall.", "Now before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to take a moment to comment on our performance since we listed on the New York Stock Exchange 7 years ago. Between dividends and share repurchases, we have returned nearly $3.5 billion to our shareholders. The cumulative impact of our share repurchase activity over this period has been a 34% reduction in our share count. This, combined with our strong operating performance and growth, has driven significant increases in key metrics on a per-share basis.", "Just to put a few numbers around it, revenues are up over 85%; adjusted EPS, up close to 120%; and free cash flow is up by over 235%. Our total shareholder returns over the last 7 years, including dividends, is more than double that of the S&P 500. Most importantly, we see great opportunities in all of our businesses for future growth.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Thanks, Steve. Second quarter results were strong, with adjusted EBITDA up 6% and adjusted earnings per share up 13%. These measures were better than our expectations, reflecting improved timeshare results, strong performance in our European rentals and timeshare exchange businesses and lower-than-expected corporate costs. We also stepped up our share repurchase activity, spending $175 million in the quarter.", "Let me spend a few moments on the highlights of the quarter, and then we'll get to your questions. In the Hotel group, revenues were up 12%, primarily reflecting revenues associated with hotel management reimbursable expenses and revenues from our owned hotels. Adjusted EBITDA increased 5%, primarily due to higher royalties and ancillary fees.", "A higher number of managed hotels and the resulting increase of revenues associated with reimbursable costs, which have no impact on EBITDA, caused margins to decline 200 basis points. RevPAR was up 5% domestically but only 2% globally in the second quarter. International RevPAR was down 6%, partially reflecting faster growth in lower RevPAR regions, as well as faster growth in lower RevPAR brands within China, namely Super 8.", "Our Exchange and Rentals segment performed better than our expectations as well. Revenues increased 8% over the second quarter of 2012. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions, second quarter revenues were up 4%. Now excluding foreign currency, acquisitions and a $4 million Gulf Coast claim settlement in the second quarter of 2012, EBITDA for the segment was up 3%. We're very pleased with these results given the economic and consumer confidence environment in Europe.", "On the exchange side, our revenue was up over 4% in constant currency, driven by higher exchange revenue per member, reflecting growth in fees from innovative new products and services. We're also pleased with the renewal of RCI's affiliation with Fairmont Hotels & Resorts and its luxury private residence club. The relationship has expanded to include resorts in Mexico and Dubai, adding quality destinations to our Registry Collection program.", "On the Vacation Rentals side, revenues were up 13%. Now excluding the impact of acquisitions, rental revenues were up 5% for the quarter, reflecting a 4% increase in average net price per rental and a 1% increase in transactions. These results were driven primarily by yield management strategies at our Hoseasons Group and Landal GreenParks businesses. Foreign currency had no impact on quarter 2 Vacation Rental revenues compared to the prior year. Rental acquisitions, however, contributed $13 million of incremental Vacation Rental revenues.", "And our Vacation Ownership business, revenues were up 11% and EBITDA was up 7%. Shell had no material impact on EBITDA as integration-related expenses offset normal operations. The EBITDA increase primarily reflects improved VOI sales, lower cost of goods and a lower provision for loan loss.", "Gross VOI sales were up 5%, reflecting an 11% increase in tour flow, partially offset by a 4% decline in VPG. The VPG decline reflected the mix effect of lower Shell VPGs, which accounted for almost half of that decline and the difficult comparisons to an exceptionally strong upgrade marketing program in the second quarter of 2012. We're getting great traction from our summer sales tools and VPG improved each month throughout the second quarter. The number of new owners added increased 4% from the second quarter of last year. Remember, growing the new owner pool continues to be an important component of our overall business model.", "WAAM sales for the quarter were $45 million, a 50% increase from the second quarter of last year. Now we report WAAM results separately so you're able to track our long-term progress on these initiatives. Keep in mind that WAAM sales move up or down on a quarter-to-quarter basis, depending on the mix of available inventory and our overall sales plan. But importantly, we expect that the long-term trajectory will be significantly positive.", "Property management revenues significantly increased, reflecting the addition of the Shell portfolio. Remember that these fee-for-service revenue streams were an important reason for acquiring Shell. However, as in the hotel business, property management revenues include reimbursable expenses, which reduced the reported margin.", "Defaults in the quarter were down over 5% and the provision for loan loss was $90 million, down from $100 million a year ago. Relative to sales, that's a 200 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2012. We continue to see good progress in portfolio trends, especially around slowing cease-and-desist activity, which we have discussed with you all in the past.", "Now let's spend a few moments on the quarter's balance sheet and capital markets activity. On the ABS front, we just completed our second timeshare securitization transaction for the year, a $325 million offering with a 98% advance rate and a weighted average coupon of 2.68%. The high advance rate reflects the successful issuance of a BB tranche. This is our first BB tranche in almost 2 years and is a good indication of the support we have in the market despite the recent increase in the underlying interest rates. We are very pleased with the execution of the financing.", "Now recently, we've had a number of questions regarding interest rate sensitivity, especially as it relates to the consumer finance spread in our timeshare business. First, our securitized term notes are at fixed rates, so in the near term, our interest rates sensitivity is quite low. For example, looking out to 2014, we estimate that an immediate 100 basis point rise in near- to mid-term interest rates would increase our consumer finance interest expense by under $8 million. And of course, with a business that produces $600 million of EBITDA, we would look to mitigate any such impact.", "Adding to a strong track record of capital markets transactions, we renewed our revolving credit facility for another 5 years and upsized the capacity by $500 million to $1.5 billion. Stronger relations with our bank group, coupled with exceptional business performance, enabled us to simultaneously expand the revolver to increase our available liquidity and reduce the all-in funding spread.", "Free cash flow for the 6 months of 2013 was $4.77 per share compared with $3.84 per share last year, a 24% increase from the first 6 months of last year. Now this reflects the timing of working capital and deposits on bookings for summer arrivals from the 3 vacation rental acquisitions we completed last December and January. Our payments to homeowners on these bookings occur in the third quarter.", "In addition, our WAAM 3.0 sale of Las Vegas resulted in $87 million in cash, which you will see in financing activities on the cash flow statement, contributing to available cash but not free cash flow as we had originally thought. With a sustainable free cash flow target of $750 million, we expect around $5.50 in free cash flow per share in 2013.", "As you saw from the press release, we are raising our EPS guidance based on our second quarter share repurchases and a slightly reduced tax rate. Our new range is $3.66 to $3.76, up from $3.60 to $3.70. We expect our full year tax rate to be 37%, down from 37.25%. Our full year share count guidance is now at 136 million shares. Remember, this excludes any share repurchases beyond the second quarter of 2013.", "We are increasing our earnings per share guidance in spite of currency movements that have worked against us this year, creating $15 million in EBITDA headwinds based on FX rates as of December 31, 2012. Please remember that we raised our EBITDA guidance already in February of 2013. We are reiterating our business unit revenue EBITDA and driver guidance, except at Vacation Ownership, where we are increasing tours from 5% to 8% to 6% to 9%. We also now believe that VPG will be flat to down 2% for 2013.", "For the third quarter, we expect earnings per share of $1.33 to $1.36. Remember that our outlook does not assume any additional share repurchases while some analysts' models might. As a reminder, our full year earnings and driver guidance are posted on the company's website at www.wyndhamworldwide.com.", "And with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Tom. Before we open the call for questions, let me sum up. We've come along way in 7 years as a public company, and we continue to have many exciting opportunities ahead of us. We have delivered for our shareholders and expect to continue to deliver because we have powerful elements in place to create value.", "We have an outstanding team and a great culture. We have clear plans and a commitment to outstanding execution and game-changing innovation. And we are focused on generating free cash flow and optimizing the deployment of that cash to drive value. Going forward, you can expect us to continue to do these things while at the same time, constantly looking for opportunities to improve our business model and create additional value.", "With that, Shirley, let's open the call -- the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Joe Greff with JPMC.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "You mentioned that you saw improvement sequentially throughout the quarter on the VPG front. I was hoping maybe you can elaborate or give us some numbers on a monthly basis? I guess, my question is, did you see it turn positive year-over-year by the time you got to June? And then I have a couple of follow-ups.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, Joe, we don't go through monthly VPG numbers. Let me just give a couple of comments related to what happened during the quarter and Tom can elaborate if he'd like to. We have a couple of factors impacting VPG, as we talked about. The first is the Shell acquisition brought in a product that has a lower VPG than our Wyndham Vacation -- Resorts product. So we've got a little bit of a negative impact from that. And then we have the lapping of the marketing program that we ran last year. Absent the Shell impact -- negative impact, we probably would've been pretty close to flat by the end of the quarter. But again, we're not giving monthly numbers. So yes, there was an improvement, but I'm not going to say it turned around and became positive. But then again, I wouldn't expect it to become positive because we do have a Shell impact that we're dealing with.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "And Joe, the Shell impact is worth about 150 basis points of the VPG decline.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it. Okay, great. And then 2 other quick ones. If I look at your P&L cost Vacation Ownership interests, down $10 million year-over-year. Can you help us understand what drove that and how sustainable is that relationship?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "You're talking about the provision or the cost of goods sold?", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "The COGS, so $32 million this 2Q versus $42 million a year ago.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes, Joe, you know that, that number can vary quarter-to-quarter based on the source of the inventory. And in this quarter, I think we had some favorable sources of inventory. And we think that it's a good, really strong number. I think last year, we ended up at around 18% or 19%. We'd like to see improvement on the 18% or 19%. So it'll vary quarter-to-quarter. The 16% was a pretty strong number.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Last question here. You mentioned that Shell had some integration expenses in the quarter. How much was that?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "A couple of million dollars.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "A couple of million, Joe.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. So not huge.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Kent with Goldman Sachs.", "Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So 2 questions. First, Tom, you mentioned essentially if rate's going higher, it only hurts you by a relatively modest amount. But I just wanted to understand that a little bit better. Are you factoring in what that might do to timeshare sales? Meaning if the consumer has a higher interest rate on other parts of their financial statement, does that impact sales? And also would you keep essentially the monthly price to the consumer the same and offset it with some of the other expenses? And then you mentioned that you continue to pivot from existing owners to new owners. Do you have the percentage in the quarter? Or could you give us some general guidance of where that's been? It's been 60%, 70% existing upsells to -- where has that gone in this quarter?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, I guess, I'll start with the -- there were so many questions in there, Steve, I've got to keep track of all the questions that were in place. With respect to the interest rate and the impact that it might have on a consumer from having higher interest rates on the rest of their basically portfolio or costs, we haven't seen that to be a factor in the past. We haven't seen the consumer change very much their buying pattern based on what's happening in their world. And evident what happened when we saw the downturn in the credit crunch, timeshare sold very well during that period. And it wasn't just us, it was everybody in the timeshare industry that had access to capital did well during that period. So I don't think that -- I don't envision a knock-on effect from interest rates going up. The impact to us, Tom was making the point, is relatively low. We only say that because people have been asking questions about it because there is a big portion of our portfolio that's locked in at a fixed cost. So it would take a long time for anything meaningful to happen to our costs. And if it went up that dramatically and if it had that big of an impact, of course, we can either do 1 of 2 things. We can lay off that increased to the consumer by increasing the financing costs that we charge or we've got a business that produces over $0.5 billion of EBITDA, $600 million of EBITDA. We'd try to find other ways to mitigate that cost increase. And do you want to comment on the -- what was the last...", "Thomas G. Conforti", "The last one was about new owners versus upgrade. So Steve, I would react to one word in your question, which is the word pivot. Pivot implies you're changing direction. At least, that's what it implied when I played basketball. And so I think the verb pivot is a verb that doesn't apply here because I think we're staying the course. We expect that upgrades will be the majority of our business. We want to grow new owners and we want to grow new owners profitably. We're looking for ways to grow new owners profitably because as you know, the long-term sustainability of the business is dependent on constantly replenishing that upgrade pool. So I wouldn't say we're pivoting. But I'd say we're kind of driving to the hoop on this one and kind of keeping our direction and our balance, what it's been in the past.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes. And just to add to that one thing. We've been talking about our new owner goals for the last couple of years. So this is nothing new. And we've been consistent with what our new owner goals have been, increasing them a little bit as our sales pace has increased. But we feel like we're right on -- like Tom said, we're right on our plan, we're not changing our plan.", "Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So Steve, Tom, is the plan, just remind me, to get to like 50-50 existing versus new? I'm not sure I remember what the goal was.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "It's 2/3, 1/3, Steve. It will be more likely 2/3, 1/3. It may be a few basis points higher than that as we uncover new sources for new owners. But it's not going to materially be different than what everyone's become accustomed to.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "And a great example of that, Steve, would be our relationship with Margaritaville, where we will begin selling a Margaritaville product probably this year or later this year. And we have an opportunity to market to a whole new customer base, people who we have not maybe touched before. And that may drive our new owner numbers up a little bit. We wouldn't be upset by that, as long as we can manage the marketing costs to still deliver the kind of earnings that we're expecting to deliver. So we're constantly looking for new avenues to bring in new owners and build new relationships. Margaritaville is one example of that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Just a little bit more color on your international RevPAR results. It looked like obviously international dragged down the overall average. How did you fare in Europe as far as a RevPAR growth rate? And how did Asia fare? That was the first question. Secondly, if you could give us a little bit more color on the year-over-year increase in room count. How much was -- of that was sort of organic new growth versus acquiring management contracts? That's it.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Do you want to take a crack at the first one, Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes. I mean, international RevPAR, Patrick, was definitely down. And it was kind of down, I would say, somewhat broadly. There were pockets in Europe where there was negative comparisons. There are pockets in Europe that were up. Same thing was true in Asia. There are parts of Asia that were up, parts of Asia that were down. So I wouldn't say that there was one area that we could point to. We highlight China because we have so much growth in China. We have the combination of RevPAR impact being maybe a negative comparison, but also we're adding properties that are in the Super 8 zone more quickly than anything else, which has a lower RevPAR. So we've kind of got a mix impact in China, as well as whatever pressure that market happens to see. I think as we said last quarter for the rental business, there's been pressure in Northern Europe versus Southern Europe this year than we saw last year, more pressure in Southern Europe than Northern. But Southern Europe wasn't devoid of challenges as well. Spain, for example, was down, but also Germany was down. But there were also markets that were up. So it was kind of a mixed bag, to be quite frank. Year-over-year room count, it -- there's not much that's from management contracts, I would say. There were some large deals that we did in the second quarter, but if you are asking -- I mean, in the first quarter, but if you're specifically asking about the second quarter, I can't think of any large management contract deals. It was all just our normal organic sales, I believe, in the second quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Agnew with MKM Partners.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "First question on inventory. With the majority of timeshare sales in asset-light form in the next 3 to 5 years, what sort of inventory would you estimate would be required to support that model? And then should we start to see inventory come down a slightly faster pace going forward?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Chris, on that, we've given guidance that we're sticking to at this point, which is we expect to spend about $150 million on inventory investment each year on average between now and 3 to 4 years out. So we're not changing that. As we make -- and in the last couple of years, our numbers always come in a little light. I think last year, it was around $70 million or $80 million. So we're always keeping an eye on our balance sheet. We're always trying to do more with less. But right now, for the purposes of your models and planning, let's stick to the $150 million.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then on your good cost control in Vacation Ownership and you mentioned lower cost of goods, I'm wondering if you could give just a little more color, granularity. What drove that?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "As Tom said, it's really a mix of the inventory. We have different areas geographically that we bring inventory in that may have a different cost of goods sold. And the various deals that we do bring in different cost of goods sold. So there's no -- I don't think there's one thing to point to and say, \"Gee, that's why it was down this quarter.\" As Tom said, it's kind of bounced around. We used to talk about a 25% cost of sales a few years ago. And then we brought it down to about a 20% cost of sales. And I think 20% long term over 5 years might be a pretty good number. Right now, we're running, as Tom said, about 18%, 19%. We think over the next few years, we might be even able to do better than that. It's 16% now. But I think anything in the zone of kind of 16% to 20% is probably pretty good. And I feel like we're really delivering well on that business. So we have a very creative, very determined group in the real estate department that is very mindful of our costs and making sure that we're matching it up well.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "And if I can ask one last question, and sorry, it's got 3 parts. But just in terms of M&A, can you describe -- or how would you describe the current transaction environment? And which business do you see more near-term opportunity? And then on Lodging, you mentioned new brands. So just wondering, is there any specific geographic or chain scale or business area that you're targeting in particular?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Sure. Well, the M&A environment, I think, is based on what we see, pretty similar to what it was earlier this year and last year. There's some deals out there. They may not be appropriately priced for us or anyone. So there aren't as many deals getting done as maybe could be available. I think that, that's pretty consistent. Clearly, the IPO market is going to create opportunities for some of those companies to come to market versus trade on a sale basis. But that's something that we've seen over the decades in the deal side. As for areas that we're focused on, it's all going to be on the fee-for-service side, like the hotel side and the rental side. We did the last deal, the large deal we did with Shell, was done on the timeshare side. But remember, that was really done for the fee-for-service management side more than anything else because they had a great group of managed properties that we're bringing into the portfolio. And as for the last question was about hotels, is there any chain scale or geographic region? We never handicap that. We keep our eyes open. We have people who are constantly in contact with opportunities. And geography doesn't matter to us as long as the potential is strong in that market. And chain scale, it doesn't really matter. Again, as long as there's potential to grow and we can drive that business, we really feel that there's no one in our industry who is more efficient on bringing on brands. And therefore, we think that we can be competitive in any opportunity that's out there. It just has to work for us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bob LaFleur with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Robert A. LaFleur - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "A question about the VPG differential with Shell. Is that a function of a lower price point product? Is that a function of selling efficiencies that are not up to where the broader Wyndham system is yet? Could you maybe just give us a little more insight as to that differential?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes, Bob, it's a number of points. But I think most importantly, I think it's the frequency and focus on upgrades at Shell that hasn't been the same as ours. And so I think it's mostly attributable to upgrades.", "Robert A. LaFleur - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then sort of broadly on VPG, obviously selling efficiency is a big point about that. Could you talk a little bit about changes you're seeing in close rates among the different channels, sort of maybe what's going on in the reload channel versus the front-line channel as far as the close rates in selling efficiency?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes. Not much of a difference, quite frankly. We did see some improvement in close rate in the first half of this year. But I wouldn't say that it was differentiated between front-line and upgrade sales. And so no, I don't -- I can't point to anything and tell you that there's one specific area where we saw dramatic improvement. I tell you, we have a phenomenally good sales team that does a great job of educating our existing owners on the product and how they could be more efficient at using it, which is part of the reason that there's so much in upgrade sales. And on the front-line side, we continue to improve our process for selling, which now includes we're moving more towards a podium presentation, where there are group discussions of what the product is, so there's a very clear understanding of what it is that we're selling. And then an individual salesperson will get together with a couple to discuss the product and whether it fits for them. But we create an educational environment that is more of like a classroom setting, where the delivery of the description of the product can be very consistent and -- which again helps the sales process.", "Robert A. LaFleur - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "How much of the improvement in close rates do you think is attributable just to sort of a healthier consumer? And how much of it is sort of proactive measures that you're taking to aggressively improve your sales efficiency?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "I guess, the answer to that question would depend on who you ask. If you ask our salespeople, they would probably say it's because they're doing such a great job at selling. And that probably is a big part of it. But I think also we saw -- it's kind of -- close rate is kind of interesting. We saw an increase in close rate during the global economic crisis, if you recall. And the reason that -- at the time that I personally think there was a reason for the increase was there was a more dedicated traveler out on the street. So when you -- when the economic crisis hit, people who were very tight on money and travel wasn't important to them, they didn't travel. Therefore, you had a more dedicated traveler out there, so maybe that impacted our close rate. It's a very difficult thing to tell because we don't -- we interview people when they don't buy or when they do buy. But it's very hard to tell what's the real reason that they didn't buy. So it's a tough question, Bob, to answer that you're asking because we don't have specific statistics on it. We only have a feel. And I think our feel right now is, yes, we're doing a great job selling and we're presenting a terrific product. The flexibility of our product is unparalleled, and that also helps sell the product.", "Robert A. LaFleur - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And one quick question just on the loan loss provision came in quite nicely in the quarter. You said you made a lot of headway with the fraud issue. How much more improvement can we expect in that line until it gets to back to some sort of \"normalized level\"?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "The line meaning what, defaults associated with that fraud activity?", "Robert A. LaFleur - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "That and sort of your loan loss provision as a percentage of sales. It's been trending down. How far should that -- how long should that trend continue? And where would you expect it to stabilize?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes. Look, I think there's always room for improvement on our default trends. We've made a big dent in this fraudulent activity. There's still some of it going on. But we're down considerably from where it was at its peak, which drove our provision in 2012. So I'd give ourselves decent marks there. We have more work to do. And we still have the issue of the larger the loan balance, the higher the default rate. And we need to continue to think about that. So I would expect that we'll continue to make improvement, but we still have some work to do.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nikhil Bhalla with FBR.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "I wanted to ask you and just a little bit more about Europe and what's going on there. I mean, clearly, on the rental side, you saw some improvement there. Any color on what's really driving that? Is it just sentiment in some ways? Is it promotions? Any other color?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Sure, Nikhil. Just a couple of points of reference. We've seen a shortening of the booking window or compression of the booking window in Europe, which has been relatively dramatic and more pronounced recently. And what that does is it means that basically people are waiting later to book their holidays. So it's a little bit more difficult to predict what that pattern is going to look like. But people are booking. And so we've seen basically an improvement in sentiment in Europe, particularly in the more affluent traveler, which does hit some of our travel dynamics, particularly the longer-distance travel from the U.K. So in general, we're seeing an improvement in the consumer sentiment and travel pattern. That is not necessarily reflected in the overall consumer confidence surveys in Europe, which is why sometimes we don't match up well with that and it's hard to correlate the 2. But we are seeing an improvement in the desire to travel in their bookings, but again on a compressed basis so that we're seeing it come up more quickly. That's part of the reason why the yield management systems that we're putting in place in Europe are so important. We've seen this pattern developing over the last several years, where the booking window is compressing. A compressed booking window makes it even more important to have good yield management so that you're not dropping your rate or you're not doing the promotion that you refer to too early, that you're actually getting a better sense of when you should be rolling out promotions or when you should be moving pricing. So it's an area, Nikhil, that we're very focused on. We've got a terrific team that's working on this, and we think we'll continue to see good results from our yield management efforts over in Europe.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Just a follow-up question there. Do you feel that with the dislocation in the Middle East, maybe some of the vacation market that would've probably gone to the Middle East overall is now staying back in Europe and perhaps helping your business?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Boy, I don't know. You've gone one level too deep for me. I'm sure somebody in our group would have an opinion on that. Tom and I are both shaking our heads. I don't know. It's an interesting question.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "James Villa is performing a little better, which does take the Brits out of the U.K. and into the other parts of Europe. But I don't know the effect on the Middle East.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Got it. And just a final question there. With the Olympics comparisons maybe getting a little bit difficult in the third quarter for some of the hotels there, any potential impact for you there?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "With respect to, did you say, the Olympics?", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Yes, last year.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "From last year.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes, from last year. We don't anticipate -- I don't remember that being a reason when we went through our business unit review at the Hotel group for any impact. So I would say probably not.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just quickly, I just wanted you -- I know you guys spent some time talking about it. But just in terms of the COGS, I know you guys mentioned favorable inventory sources. Were there any true-ups or anything in that number this quarter that would also have made it a little bit irregular on a go-forward basis?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "There are always true-ups, Carlo, in the way that we account for COGS in that business. But the driver was the source of inventory that we chose.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then in terms of the $180 million in land on the balance sheet that you guys mentioned, how are you thinking about the timing of that over time, when you start thinking about trying to monetize that? Is that something we should be looking for over the next 12 to 18 months? Or is it a much longer-term process?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Some of it, yes. We had mentioned on our earlier call that we were working on -- I think the earlier -- first quarter call that we did mention we were working on deals, other deals, that were on our balance sheet that would reduce those levels further. So some of it will happen, but our goal is to do as much of it as we can. And I think it'll sort of unwind itself. Certain deals will get done sooner rather than later within this year or within 6 to 12 months. And the rest of it, over time, we'll find ways to monetize it.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Great. And then just one last follow-up as it pertains to the balance sheet and obviously, the buyback authorization. Are you guys -- or I guess, the right way to ask would be how are you contemplating just in terms of ratings and the importance of maintaining an investment-grade credit over time just as you continue to buy back obviously with EBITDA growth underlying?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "We hold that objective as a very important objective. And we will do everything in our power to stay within that objective. And we have a bunch of cash on our balance sheet this quarter related to the seasonality of our Vacation Rental business that brings down our credit ratio a bit. So our goal is to stay there if we can.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "As you're familiar with, Carlo, we, like all companies, communicate with the rating agencies on a regular basis. So what we're doing, we feel comfortable, is within the boundaries of their comfort level as well.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura Securities.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Just to follow up on some of the questions related to the loan loss. In your guidance, what's assumed for your loan loss in the second half versus last year?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "I don't have the number off the top of my head, but maybe someone can get us what that is. We're targeting full year a little over 21% of gross VOI.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. So that would assume then that's probably going to be pretty flat for next -- for the back half?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "It's our current projection. But as default trends improve, that number evolves.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. And the loan loss provision has fluctuated, give or take, roughly between 21% and 23% of sales. As your tour flow increases, can you give us a historic perspective on -- in the past, when your tour flow increases, what does -- is there any meaningful change in your customer profile?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, I mean, it depends what period of time you're talking about. If you're talking about the period of time when we were growing at a strong double-digit and we had a huge amount of front-line sales going on to drive that growth, yes, there was a difference in profile back then. We're talking about 2007, 2008 because there, we're hitting customers that we don't know and it's a little bit of a different profile. Right now, if you look at the last couple of years, our profile is probably pretty consistent. We've been hitting the same number of -- or an increasing number but roughly the same number of new sales versus upgrade sales. And really, the only thing that impacted it over the time was the amount of large transactions we were doing. And as we talked about, we changed some of our credit underwriting standards and we moved that around a little bit. But that was the only other thing, I would say, the last couple of years that had any meaningful impact. And Tom, do you have anything...", "Thomas G. Conforti", "No. I would say the way you should think of this, Harry, is our profile for our customer target is fixed. And it's higher, as Steve said, than it had been in the earlier years. And so the challenge for our marketing team is to figure out how to target what we have established as a fixed profile.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. So I guess, at the end of the day, my question from a modeling point of view would be as the defaults fraud issue becomes more of a looking in the rearview mirror, should we be thinking that the loan -- the provision ought to be settled in the 21% to 21.5% of sales going forward? Or is that just -- does that tie your hands too much?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes. Our target is to continue to see that number decline. If you recall, I think, in 2008, I wasn't here, but I seem to remember about -- a number of about 17% to 18%. I'm not saying we're going to get there. But I am saying that the customer profile has improved and we're focused at bringing that number down further. We're not accepting a 21% target for the next 5 years, that's for sure.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "Following up on a couple of things you discussed. On the COGS, to what extent does the reduction suggest that you've actually increased the pricing, as there's 2 sides on? Second question, can you talk about the marketing costs relative to the revenue for new owners? And then sort of following yesterday's article in The Times on innovation, can you talk about -- which talked about Wyndham, could you talk about what some of this innovation means in terms of occupancy rates and pricing?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Sure. Well, as for the COGS percentages that's driven by price increase, not to a large degree, Mike. We do increase price, we do premium price product, but it's more on the purchase side. So it's more on the cost side than it is on the price side. As for marketing costs for new owners, as we said before, we're constantly trying to find ways to be more efficient to bring in new owners. I referenced the Margaritaville as an -- Margaritaville relationship as an example of trying to use some creative methodologies to drive new owners. But right now, I would say that our delivery of marketing cost is not dissimilar to what it was a year ago, so I wouldn't say that there's been any real wholesale movement in that cost section. And as to innovation, I mean, we are constantly trying to innovate. And it's something that is kind of part of the culture here at Wyndham. In fact, we have an innovation award that we give to an associate or groups of associates who do extraordinary things to drive innovation within the company. So whether it's on the technology side, like we've done at RCI, or it's finding new ways to deliver a different product to the consumer in WVO or on the hotel side, parts of our project Apollo that we've talked about for the last several years, where we are finding better ways of delivering heads and beds for our franchisees through technology improvement and trying to drive that business to be better. We want to increase our value proposition to our franchisees. In order to do that, we need to be innovative. We need to be creative. And that is heavily, heavily our focus. So I appreciate the recognition. And we continue to work as hard as we can to be innovative.", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the speakers.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay, Shirley. Thank you very much. Well, thanks for joining us. And remember to tune in to the Wyndham Championship on August 15 to 18 on the Golf Channel on CBS. And enjoy the rest of your summer.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Margo C. Happer", "Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO; and Tom Conforti, our CFO.", "Before we get started, I want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-Q filed July 24, 2013, with the SEC. We will also we be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these measures to GAAP is provided in the tables to the press release. It is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website at wyndhamworldwide.com. Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Margo. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter call. As you saw from the press release, we posted another banner quarter. Seasonally, the third quarter is our largest quarter, and we are happy to report double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in each of our business segments and adjusted EPS growth of 25%. Momentum across the company is strong, and I am proud of our results, both this quarter and since we listed as a public company over 7 years ago, during which time, our business teams have established a track record of great performance.", "However, great results are yesterday's news, and we need to keep our focus on future growth. So let me take a few moments to put some of our recent accomplishments into context of our strategy and long-term growth trajectory. In the Hotel Group, EBITDA was up 10%. Our overall system size was up over 3% from a year ago, which really is a notable achievement, given our large base. With over 7,400 properties, we're the largest hotel company in the world. This powerful platform was clearly evident at our Global Franchise Conference in September, which with over 6,000 participants, we believe, is the largest gathering of hotel franchisees in the world.", "Enthusiasm was high, as prospects for the future look strong. Franchisees reacted positively to a planned umbrella advertising campaign, multiple brand refreshes and a new enrollment strategy for our loyalty program, Wyndham Rewards. We expect these actions to translate into increased momentum for our franchisees and for Wyndham Worldwide.", "With 15 brands in our hotel portfolio, we offer hotel owners and developers a wide array of options. This fact enables us to expand our worldwide presence and establish flags in new markets in the U.S. and globally. For example, we recently expanded our relationship with Grand City, a large hotel owner in Europe, adding another 17 hotels and over 2,400 rooms across Germany, and bringing the Wyndham hotel and resort brand into Austria for the first time. And we recently opened a Ramada Encore in Turkey as part of a 30-property development deal. We have increased our global footprint by adding 4 brands in 12 new countries this year alone, including Days Inn in Brazil and Germany; Ramada in Columbia, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan and Singapore; Wyndham in Ecuador and Peru; and TRYP in Belgium and The Netherlands.", "System growth provides annuity-like revenue streams that drive earnings growth. This unit growth, combined with improving industry fundamentals, will make the Hotel Group our fastest-growing business unit.", "Wyndham Exchange and Rentals posted an excellent quarter, with EBITDA growth of 15%. RCI continues to innovate, expanding the portfolio of products and services for its member base. Year-to-date, almost 35 million or 7% of RCI's total revenue came from products that were introduced within the last 4 years. This includes technology-enabled offerings from our introduction of rci.com, which gives members greater flexibility in how and when they exchange, as well as premium platinum memberships, which recently eclipsed 200,000 members.", "Our Vacation Rentals business had an outstanding quarter, with organic revenue growth of 10% in the largest quarter of the year. We saw strong growth in Southern European destinations, where we benefited from new inventory sourcing strategies. Our James Villa Holidays and Novasol brands performed particularly well, both growing double digits in the quarter.", "Our Rental business has consistently performed well during a pretty choppy couple of years in Europe. Because of outstanding value proposition, 2 of our products, the strength of our brands and our management teams, our ability to retain homeowners and attract homes from owners who are looking for rental income, and the operating flexibility of our mostly fee-for-service business model. We've assembled a collection of the best -- excuse me, the best Vacation Rental product in the right locations, which provide great value to different consumer segments throughout the European countries in which we operate.", "Now turning to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. We continue to innovate on sales and marketing to drive sustainable growth by ensuring a unique, fun guest experience. As importantly, we continue to change the timeshare development model from capital-intensive to capital -- to asset-light. Through this innovation and asset-lighter focus, we are driving longer-term sustainable growth with better cash flows and returns.", "In sales and marketing, we have a number of initiatives underway to expand or open channels that will attract both new and existing owners. We have our first sale of Margaritaville Vacation Club by Wyndham in early October, when we sold a platinum points package to Jimmy Buffet during his recent visit to our Bonnet Creek property in Orlando where, by the way, he did pay full price.", "We've begun telesales for Margaritaville Vacation Club by Wyndham, and have a full launch scheduled for the first quarter of next year. This affiliation provides a large, loyal, fun-loving customer base with a great demographic profile and strong similarities to our Vacation Ownership owners. We expect significant tourists from Margaritaville channels through joint marketing activities, including tie-ins at Margaritaville restaurants.", "Developing strong urban product offerings is another important sales and marketing initiative. Sales at our New York City locations started in August and are running ahead of our expectations. We're exploring marketing alliances to give us optimal access to the New York City residents and visitors. We are also excited about our other new city center location in Chicago, where we'll start sales next month.", "Finally, we are pleased to renew and extend our marketing alliances with Caesars in Las Vegas and Outrigger in Hawaii, which we expect to produce more than 35,000 annual tours combined. We continue to make significant progress on our Just in Time development model, which we've described to you as WAAM 2.0 and 3.0. We thought these designations were important to describe the evolution of this business model. Specifically, that in WAAM 2.0, we purchased inventory from a developer. And in WAAM 3.0, the inventory is built by others as intended timeshare. However, going forward, we'll just talk to both of these combined as WAAM/Just in Time. What's important about WAAM/Just in Time is that we capture the attractive financing -- consumer financing spread and significantly reduce the time the asset is on our balance sheet, improving overall cash flows and returns compared with the traditional timeshare development model.", "We recently added 2 great WAAM/Just in Time deals to our development pipeline. In the first, a partner will purchase approximately $10 million of land from us in Beaver Creek, Colorado. They will build 50 presidential reserve units in a great ski location and deliver it to us on a Just in Time basis. The second is a ground-up project with an independent developer in Park City, Utah. This will be a fantastic ski-in/ski-out location with a full sales office.", "We're excited by both projects, but especially by the enthusiasm we're seeing from developers. We're well on our way to WAAM/Just in Time inventory, providing the majority of our sales within the next 3 to 5 years.", "As you saw from the press release, we've given the preliminary 2014 guidance. In an environment with modest economic growth in the U.S. and recovering economies in many of the other countries in which we operate, we expect to deliver EBITDA growth within our target range of 6% to 8%. Great performance and continued growth, it's a proven durable formula for driving shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom to review the results.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. As Steve noted, third quarter results were robust with adjusted EBITDA up 13%, and adjusted earnings per share are up 25%. These results reflect continued strong performance in each of our business units and the ongoing benefit of our share repurchase program.", "For the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares for $160 million, decreasing our weighted average diluted share count by 7% year-over-year. Now let's take a look at the business units.", "In the Hotel Group, revenues were up 19%, reflecting increased revenues associated with owned hotels, higher franchise and management fees, and revenues from our recent global franchisee conference. Adjusted EBITDA increased 10%, aided by the RevPAR gains, a 3% increase in system size, and favorable revenue of $4 million related to our Wyndham Rewards Program. Our loyalty program is designed to be EBITDA-neutral, and it's running a bit ahead of that year-to-date, reflecting fundamental improvements in the program. We expect spending to catch up to revenues in the fourth quarter, resulting in $7 million of additional expenses compared with 2012.", "RevPAR grew 5% domestically and 3% globally in the third quarter. International RevPAR was negatively affected once again by faster growth in our lower-RevPAR brands in China. On the plus side, RevPAR results also reflect the accretive impact of the 3 packaged deals we completed over the last 18 months with Shell core, HPT and Grand City, which expanded our higher-RevPAR brands.", "Our Exchange and Rentals segment generated outstanding results. Excluding benefits from the impact of foreign currency, revenues increased 11% and EBITDA increased 12%. Acquisitions contributed $19 million of incremental revenue and $7 million of incremental EBITDA to our growth figures. On the Exchange side, revenues were up over 1% in constant currency, driven by increases in both average number of members and revenue per member. Increases in the average number of members reflects higher retention rates and growth in Latin America and North America, while revenue per member growth was supported by higher volume and better yields from member rentals.", "On the Vacation Rentals side, revenues were up $40 million or 16% on a constant currency basis. Excluding acquisitions, rental revenues were up 10% for the quarter, reflecting a 7% increase in the average net price per rental and a 3% increase in transaction volume. These results were driven by yield management practices at our Wyndham Vacation Rentals U.K., and Landal GreenParks business, as well as increased rental units supply throughout Europe.", "Our Vacation Ownership business also had a great quarter, with revenues up 11% and EBITDA up 14%. Shell contributed $33 million in revenue and $8 million in EBITDA to the quarter's growth. Now if we were to exclude Shell, revenues for the quarter grew 6% and EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA, up 8%.", "Gross VOI sales were up 7%. Tour flow increased 9%, reflecting the Shell acquisition and new community marketing programs. We saw a continued sequential improvement in volume per guest, or VPG, which ended the quarter down 1.6% from the third quarter of last year. If we are to exclude Shell from the comparisons, VPG was flat in the quarter, which is a notable achievement, given the strong results in the year-ago period.", "WAAM sales for the quarter were $51 million. Now remember that WAAM total sales will move up or down from quarter-to-quarter based on our inventory and sales plans, but we expect a strong, positive long-term trajectory.", "Property management revenues increased 22% versus the same period last year, primarily reflecting the addition of the Shell portfolio. As a reminder, these fee-for-service revenue streams were a key reason for the Shell acquisition. The faults in the quarter were $62 million, down over 12%, while the provision for loan loss was $102 million, down from $124 million a year ago. Cease and desist activity is close to historic norms, as we have made great strides to protect our owners from third-party debt relief scams. We will remain diligent to prevent future occurrences of this type of fraudulent activity.", "Now let's spend a few moments on recent capital markets activity. During the quarter, we used an interest rate swap to convert $500 million of our long-term debt from fixed to floating, to better balance the mix of our overall debt portfolio. The swap is mark-to-market on a continuous basis, with the bulk of the adjustment recorded on the balance sheet and a small portion on the P&L.", "In the third quarter, there was $1 million noncash benefit to the P&L. The impact will vary from quarter-to-quarter, based on movements in short-term interest rates. And while it might cause some minimal interest expense volatility, we do not expect this instrument to materially impact the P&L.", "Additionally, in August, we announced the renewal of our $650 million securitized timeshare receivables conduit facility through August of 2015. The prior-tier facility was due to expire in August of 2014. As we've shared in the past, our goal is to ensure maximum flexibility in our overall debt portfolio.", "Free cash flow for the first 9 months of 2013 was $5.19 per share compared with $4.63 per share last year, a 12% increase from the 9 months of 2012. So far, in the fourth quarter, we've purchased an additional 800,000 shares of stock for $50 million. We have $732 million remaining on our share repurchase program as of last evening.", "Now moving to guidance. And as you saw from the press release, we are raising our full year EPS guidance to $3.78 to $3.80, up from $3.66 to $3.76. This reflects lower depreciation and amortization, lower interest expense, as well as our quarter 3 share repurchases. We now expect depreciation and amortization for the full year to be about $216 million, and interest expense for the full year to be approximately $120 million. Our full year share count guidance is now at 135 million shares, and this excludes any share repurchases beyond the third quarter of 2013.", "Regarding 2013 full year EBITDA, as you can see from our results, the businesses are performing at the high end of our expectations. As we've pointed out previously, currency movements have been a significant headwind this year against guidance assumptions, creating a $14 million drag on EBITDA guidance. If not for these headwinds, we would end the year at the top end of our guidance range, which we established in February at around $1,165,000,000. However, if you do the math and subtract the $14 million from the top end of the range, you can see that we'll be near the midpoint of our EBITDA range despite our stellar operating performance.", "Finally, for the full year, we are reiterating previously issued business unit revenue, EBITDA and driver guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.70 to $0.72, another strong quarter. In addition to the $7 million of expense timing in the Hotel Group, which I mentioned earlier, remember that fourth quarter in our Vacation Rental business is seasonally weak. This seasonality effect has been exacerbated by acquisitions in the business over the past few years.", "Our outlook, in addition, does not assume any additional share repurchases. While some analysts models might incorporate an assumed level of repurchases.", "As a reminder, our full year guidance and driver -- excuse me, our full year earnings and driver guidance are posted on our website at www.wyndhamworldwide.com.", "Turning to our 2014 outlook. We expect revenues of $5.25 billion to $5.35 billion, and EBITDA of $1,215,000,000 to $1,240,000,000, consistent with our long-term growth rates of 6% to 8%. We expect adjusted earnings per share of $4.12 to $4.22, assuming a diluted share count of 133 million. The share count assumption includes our repurchases only through September 30, 2013.", "As it relates to free cash flow, you can see from our 2013 results that we are once again ahead of our target of $750 million for the year. Looking to 2014 and beyond, we expect free cash flow to grow generally in line, but not necessarily at the same rate as earnings. As we have mentioned in the past, our cash tax rate is expected to increase over time, as it is subject to a number of variables, including the loss of alternative minimum tax credits and the rate of growth of our timeshare receivables. We are finalizing our projections, but at this point, we expect these factors to increase cash taxes by $40 million in 2014. We are reviewing this closely for next year, and we'll have a much better point of view to share with you in February, once we're finished with our budgeting process. At which time, we'll also share, of course, business unit and driver guidance.", "In collusion, I'll let go of Steve's comments that he made earlier, which are, that we are determined to build on our track record of performance with continued growth, well into the future. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Tom. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We are pleased with our third quarter results but, again, we're never quite satisfied. In an environment characterized by an uncertainty, a lot of uncertainty down in Washington and signs of recovery in Europe, we are committed to driving shareholder value by executing on every element of the business that is under our control, including innovation, day-to-day operational excellence, close attention to customer experience, disciplined capital allocation and plain old hard work. We believe these are the right ingredients to successfully execute our strategy and deliver sustainable long-term performance.", "Finally, we maintain the belief that our culture is a highly valuable driver of our ongoing performance, an important component of which, is our corporate social responsibility programs which reflect our values in the engagement of our associates and stakeholders around the world.", "In October, Wyndham Worldwide earned a place on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, a select list of companies considered to be leaders in sustainable economic, environmental and social performance. We are proud of such recognition as it not only reflects the collaborative efforts of so many within our company, but also the responsible and results-oriented performance of our teams. And now, Shirley, we'll take any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Greff with JPMC.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Tom, just to clarify your commentary on '14 free cash flow, you said you'd expect free cash flow to grow roughly in line, not necessarily in line with the trajectory of earnings growth. Are you talking about EBITDA or earnings per share? Are you talking about absolute free cash flow or free cash flow per", "share? If you can just help us understand what you meant by that comment.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes. We were talking about the absolute growth of the business. So it wouldn't be a per-share number. Per share, we'll grow probably in line with the per-share growth, but EBITDA will grow in line with the absolute -- excuse me, free cash flow will grow in line with the absolute growth of the business.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it, great. And then looking at the loan-loss provisioning, Tom, you mentioned that cease and desist is having less of a negative impact there. The year-over-year improvement in the third quarter was much better than what you experienced in the first couple of quarters. Even if I kind of look at where you finished the third quarter, you're still above where you were historically. Can you talk about maybe how you're looking at that, and maybe the path to kind of getting back to where you were historically? Maybe talk about some of the credit provisioning or some the drivers there as well.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes. In the past, Joe, we've pointed out there had been 2 primary reasons for the uptick. One was cease and desist, and I think we've made great inroads and great strides as -- and I think it was this quarter or last year when we first identified the issue in a major way. And I think the comment at that time was, we believe that we could address this in a timely fashion, and I think we have. And so we feel pretty good about the progress we've made on cease and desist, with constant vigilance going forward to ensure that it stays that way. I think the second point that we've raised in the past is the impact of large balance loans. And we described that, that source of the increase in loan loss was going to take a bit longer to work through. And I'd say on that side that we've made some progress, but we have more work to do. And until we can address that issue, I think our improvement to historic norms will take some time to get to, in my opinion. But Steve, do you have a point of view to...", "Stephen P. Holmes", "No, I think that's accurate. We're still working to get back to where we were. Then we want to get better because we are selling higher FICO-scored customers right now.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Great. It looks like corporate expenses have been higher than what were -- we were forecasting. Was there anything onetime in the 3Q? And it doesn't sound like corporate expense for the full year is changing all that much. So I guess we see 4Q corporate expense lower than what you had in the 3Q?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "I don't think there's anything unusual in there, mostly employee cost. I think that when we went back and looked at what the Street had, the Street had some lower corporate expenses than we frankly were forecasting. So I think we were just maybe -- maybe there's a little bit of a disconnect there, but it's not significant.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes, there is not -- no onetime cost, Joe. It's employee cost, as Steve said, and maybe some IT costs, but nothing extraordinary in the quarter.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "All right. And my final question. Looking at what's embedded in your 2014 guidance, can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about tour flow in VPG? I'm presuming that, that we've anniversary-ed Shell, tour flow growth will moderate from the levels we've seen this year. And now that we've anniversary-ed some of the difficult comparisons on VPG and Shell, that VPG will grow from here. Can you just talk about that a little bit, how you're thinking about that?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes, we have anniversary-ed both of them. So you're correct, they will be anniversary-ed, I guess, in the fourth quarter of this year. And so next year, we will be apples-to-apples for the full year. We haven't -- honestly, we haven't gone through the detailed budget forecast for VPG and tour flow yet. Both of them are projected to increase. But to what degree? I'm not really in a position to give guidance on that right now. We will definitely do that in February when we give our driver guidance. But your assumption is correct, that we'll be lapping the impact of Shell.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Kent with Goldman Sachs.", "Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So just a couple of questions. One on -- just a follow-up on Joe's question about VPG. Maybe you could just talk about what happened this quarter, whether there were any special programs that allowed you to make such a steady improvement. And in particular, I'm not frivolous, you or Steve or Tom mentioned community marketing. I just didn't know what that meant. I thought that was the word you used. And then -- why don't we start there, and then we'll go after that.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay. There was no new program of significant that launched in the third quarter. This was kind of a maturation of the programs that we launched in the second quarter that had more of an impact and brought us back up to kind of the level that we were at last year. Remember, last year was extraordinary. The Community Marketing Programs or CMP that Tom was talking about is the way we -- was part of the process we go for attracting the new owners to our system. And they're basically, they're the booths that you see at the -- in areas like Orlando and Las Vegas where we attract people who are visiting the community to come and learn more about our product. So it's the normal -- CMP is the normal process that we go through, there's nothing new about that. Is there a third part to the question, Steve?", "Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I don't even remember. But I'll move on to my next one, which is Vacation Rental results were good. You had very good pricing, you had very good supply on that front. How much yield management efforts are shaping up? I know that's been a focus for you. How are you looking at that? Over the next 12 to 24 months, what kind of initiatives do you have in place for that?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, I think that, that is one of the things that we expect to see an impact of more, frankly, in the future than we saw in this quarter. We've rolled out our -- some of our yield management, new yield management tools. That just as a reminder, these are tools that basically were developed by the RCI exchange gurus and the PhDs that we have working on our yield management for RCI. They took that skill set, and they translated it to our Rental business in Europe. We started with the U.K., we've rolled into The Netherlands, and it's going to next roll, I think, towards Denmark, is our next move. And we do expect those to have a positive impact. That impact will be -- it will take years to get the full level of that impact, because we need to make sure that the programs are working. So we have great confidence in the way that we're working the yield management. And also, we need to bring our owners along, the people who own the homes, villas and cottages, so they understand the kind of flexibility we need in pricing in order to get them the best yield. And that also is a process that has begun and that we'll continue to work on. So I'm excited about this program. It's our ability to really use the data that we have in the marketplace and apply it to the -- then apply it to the Rental business. Kudos to that group, for RCI and the Rentals group, working closely together to bring that to fruition.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Agnew with MKM Partners.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to ask question on Vacation Ownership. I may be a little bit surprised, maybe incorrectly, that inventory is not coming that -- or is coming down slowly as it is, given excess inventory and WAAM. So maybe if you could just comment there. And then also related to that, if you were to get the majority of sales in the next 3 to 5 years on WAAM, what sort of inventory levels you think you need to support that sales pace?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Sure. Thanks for the question, Chris. A couple of questions there. As to the reason the inventory isn't coming down faster on the balance sheet, you have to remember that we are spending money to finish off product that's on our balance sheet, if there's work in progress on the balance sheet. So we're kind of adding a little bit to it every quarter, as well as taking it down. And if we do WAAM 1.0 sales, which we did have some of that in this quarter, that has no inventory impact. That's somebody else's inventory. So those, I think, are the factors. Tom, am I missing anything else?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "No, I think -- I think that's it for the most part, Steve.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes. And the other part of the question was about the...", "Thomas G. Conforti", "It's about what happens if 50% of our inventory comes from WAAM in the next 3 to 5 years, what will happen with our inventory levels?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay. Or yes, what inventory do we need, if that's the case. Well, first of all, the decision to move towards this Just in Time inventory basis is an effort to improve our cash flow and also improve our return. We do want to work down our inventory on our balance sheet. We've said in the past that we think it will come down about $100 million a year. That's been kind of the pace that we've been on for the last couple of years, and we'd like to see it continue to come down. However, there are great opportunities for us in this Just in Time market. Developers are very excited about what we're doing and want to provide us more inventory. So I would not expect to see a dramatic falloff. But as an example, one of our Just in Time product offering that we have this quarter, that we just signed this quarter, is a product that we owned, the land that we owned in Avon, Colorado, near Beaver Creek. We're taken that off the balance sheet, we will eventually, because we're flipping it to somebody who's going to complete the inventory and then turn it back to us just in time. So we are diligent about trying to get down our balance sheet. But I don't think, Chris, it's going to go down to a level that would be like 1 year's turn any time soon. So it's going to be a little bit higher than probably I would like in time, and I would like it to be. But we're best utilizing our resource as we think.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Chris, one of the things to remember, that I would add to Steve, is that a component of the inventory that's on our balance sheet are expected recoveries in the future. And that number, if I remember correctly, is around $250 million of our $1 billion. So if you remove that out, it's $750 million. And if you do $750 million, assuming $2 billion in sales, that's like 18 months of inventory. If my math isn't totally off, I think that's the ballpark, right? Then as Steve said, when we bring in WAAM, we'll be able to turn stuff a lot more quickly, so that will be a plus. But I don't expect a material decrease. It is not going to get down to $300 million or $400 million simply because we have this recovery. So it's going to come down, it will continue to come down. WAAM, no doubt, will allow us to turn our inventory. WAAM/Just in Time, much more rapidly than the conventional model would allow us. And we'll see some improvement, but it's not going to be a gaping change between where we are and a much lower number.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "That's helpful. And to get to the majority of your sales, I think you said 3 to 5 years, what would cause you to get WAAM up to the majority of sales in 3 years, maybe, versus 5? Is it something in the development community or is it just your decision on the timing of progression?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "I think a combination of the 2. But we feel great about the pipeline of WAAM/Just in Time deals that we've already announced. Those deals alone will get us to a very good number, in our minds, and within 3 years, or at 3 years. And it's just going to be continued planning of those types of projects and our managing our pipeline. And I think Steve and I feel highly confident that within the 3 to 5 years, and hopefully, it will be closer to 3 than the 5. But we're not promising anybody anything at this point, but we're making great progress to that goal.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And one final question, and I might have missed this, can you comment on the favorable timing of marketing expenses, I think, in the Lodging business?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes. I think there's about $7 million...", "Thomas G. Conforti", "I think it was about $11 million...", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Marketing expense. The -- one, it is just simply a timing difference. We didn't spend as much on marketing in the third quarter as we will spend in the fourth quarter, which is just a matter of shifting some of the spend from quarter-to-quarter. It's just the way the media schedule and marketing worked out...", "Thomas G. Conforti", "But we also had the benefit of the conference, which...", "Stephen P. Holmes", "And we had a conference in the third quarter, yes.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Which came in the third quarter, which we didn't have out the prior year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Concerning RCI, it looked like average revenue per member was essentially flat year-over-year. Where do you stand with price increases? Where have you been this past year? And what are your expectations for pricing, both on the annual membership and the exchange fee going forward?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "We have continued to increase prices modestly, Patrick, on both the exchange and the membership fee. As we have more corporate -- clinical corporate members, which are groups like Hilton and Disney and Wyndham, where there's a kind of a discount membership fee for being part of a corporate membership that does tend to keep that number flatter than we'd like it to be. The thing that the RCI business needs, frankly, that spurts growth, is to see the smaller developers coming back into the market. Those smaller developers, their members pay full fees because it's not a corporate membership, it's just an individual membership when people buy their timeshare. We do see some kind of green shoots starting up on the developer side. We see some smaller developers coming into the marketplace. But this is not going to be a whipped-back result, we're not going to see the downturn that we saw come back as quickly as it went down. But there is a lot of money in the timeshare industry. People do extremely well, and they will continue to come back in as they see the capital markets open up for them.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nikhil Bhalla with FBR.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Steve, I just wanted to get some color on the currency movements for you. Is there a point in 2014 when you start to kind of lap easy currency movements?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Well, Nikhil, it's Tom. So the $14 million was against guidance assumptions. In fact, our performance results have not been negatively affected and I think possibly slightly affected -- positively affected against last year. But when we set our guidance, which was in the month of December, the rates that were available at the time led us to certain beliefs. And we updated our EBITDA number in February, reflecting the positive placement of rates at the time, and we actually added, I believe, $10 million to $15 million to our EBITDA target. But that was a brief period of time. But when we look at year-to-year comparisons since then, our actual results have been favorably impacted. So this is strictly an issue of what rates we used to set guidance in December of last year.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And just to remind us again, how much of your exposure is to the euro from an EBITDA standpoint?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "My guess is be a ballpark, it's probably 15% to 20%.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "That's the number I would say as well, 15%.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And just final question for Steve. Steve, what are you seeing in terms of new timeshare development right now?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "From our standpoint, Nikhil, or from the...", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "From the industry standpoint.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, as I said, we are starting to see some of the smaller developers gain access to capital. And that capital is in 2 forms. One in the ability to finance the receivables they generate on sale, and the other is the capital that's required for them to build product. The first piece that's come back more quickly is the financing of receivables. So we see people who had projects that were in process or built projects that they had to put on hold because they couldn't finance receivables that they were generating in the sales. They're coming back into the market more quickly. Capital available for development is still tight, quite frankly, for the little guys and the medium-sized guys. It is coming back, but that will take a longer lead time. So I don't see a lot of new developments, Nikhil, going on out there. There are some, so I don't want to say there aren't any, but not to the level that we've seen historically.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Steve, you had talked or touched on the impact of the government shutdown. Can you give us a sense more recently if it -- to what degree it has impacted customer behavior? And if it has, has it changed just in the near term?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, other than depressing a lot of people, I think the impact was most heavily felt in the tourism industry at the national park level and areas that are subject to government supervision. For those properties, it certainly did have an impact. Because people stopped traveling, whether it's a national park or it's people going to visit presidential libraries. Those were all shut down. Fortunately, with our distribution, we're so broad, that we didn't feel or see much of an impact from that at all. But I'm sure for the individual franchisee, hotel owner in one of those markets, they certainly felt it. But that's a different level of impact from what we see.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And then my second question. And the second question is related to the Hotel segment. You touched on seeing signs of a turn in Europe. Can you give us a bit more color on that? And secondly, are you seeing at least a basing and perhaps any signs of encouragement in China?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, I'll tackle Europe first. The European story as we all know, it's a collection of countries, it's not one country. So when you break it down by country, there's a lot of variability. We have some European countries that performed extremely well, we have some that were negative. So it is a bit of a mixed bag between -- within the continent -- within Europe, and I don't mean to be vague about it. But there are markets like Germany that were up. The other market that was up was Spain. I'm just going from memory, looking at the reports over the last few days. But there were also markets that were down. So it's a bit of a mixed bag over there. When you look at consumer confidence in some of the reports like PhoCusWright that have come out -- or even there was a report generated by Deloitte & Touche about how CFOs in the U.K. feel about their environment right now, and it's the most positive it's been in a while. So I think there are generally signs that there's improvement. But again, it's not an across-the-board improvement. So I don't have a specific answer for you on that, Harry, other than that it's mixed. With respect to China, our issue in China is -- I don't know if this is where you're going, but our issue in China is really a mix issue. Our largest growth is coming in our lowest-priced product, which is the Super 8 product, where we're adding a lot of hotels. As we bring on more Wyndham hotels, which will be full-service hotels in primary and secondary markets, those hotels will definitely give us a lift, and we have quite a bit in the pipeline. So I would anticipate that our Chinese RevPAR will see improvement over the next 18 months, partially as the result of that mix may be shifting a little bit.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And just as a follow-up to that, where in China, for the full-service developments, are you seeing the greatest opportunity? Because there have been some discussions about oversupply in some of the primary markets.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Honestly, I would have to get the detail of our pipeline to tell you exactly where it was. I know we've talked about deals that are in the works in the past in specific locations, but I can't give you a blow-by-blow as to where the product is located. We are so lightly penetrated in the Wyndham side, Harry, that almost any new secondary or primary market would be new for us. And in some cases, it's not a matter of a new construction. In some cases, it's a matter of putting a Wyndham brand on a product that already exists. Well, I don't know if it's a new supplier or it's just conversion of supply.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "Following up on the last, on a same-store sales basis, can you give us some idea of the profitability of owners? How does that differs with the growth or not lack of growth in the U.S. and Europe and in China? And I have another question.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, same-store sales were not dramatically different. I don't think, based on what I looked at.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "If you remove the currency effect.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Yes, yes. If you take out currency effect, I don't think it was dramatically different from our reported sales. So I don't think that there would be much of a difference to the owner than the 3% internationally and 5% domestically RevPAR that you saw.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "Okay. And sticking with Europe, can you give us some idea -- step back, you've talked about it in the past that because of the, I guess, Arab Spring, there's been more inbound traffic or local traffic. Is that continuing? Is that leveling off? Are we seeing some changes in direction in or out?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "I think what you may be referring to, Mike, is a couple of quarters ago. We talked about traffic from the Middle East to the U.K. We saw an increase in some of the traffic there. I think that may be what you were referring to, and I don't have an update for you on that.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "I was also thinking that Europeans who were staying within Europe rather than traveling outside of Europe.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "That may have been a contributing factor to the Vacation Rental business in Europe, but I don't think that we've highlighted that as a reason.", "Operator", "At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I'll turn the call back over to the speakers.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thank you very much, Shirley. And thank you all for joining us in the third quarter call. We look forward to speaking to you at the year end. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Margo C. Happer", "Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO; and Tom Conforti, our CFO.", "Before we get started, I want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC.", "We will also we be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these measures to GAAP is provided in the tables to the press release. It is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website at wyndhamworldwide.com.", "Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Margo. Good morning, and welcome to our 2013 year-end call. It was another great year for Wyndham Worldwide. We had a strong finish with fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA growing 10% and adjusted earnings per share growing 16%. For the full year, we grew adjusted EBITDA over 9% and adjusted earnings per share 19%. These results demonstrate that the combination of superior business execution and disciplined capital allocation produces exceptional performance. I'm happy with what we have accomplished. But as you know, our focus is on future growth and 2014 promises to be another great year.", "Let me take a few minutes to tell you about this exciting opportunities that lie ahead. In the Hotel Group, we are redirecting resources to enable us to launch our first-ever umbrella marketing program with a national advertising campaign to begin this spring. Our goal is to maximize the effectiveness of our marketing spend to drive more direct bookings in incremental revenue to all of our brands. The creative concept is to produce a high-impact, multi-brand national television campaign that also reflects the unique essence of each brand.", "We are also redirecting resources to strengthen our Wyndham Rewards loyalty program. Loyalty programs are a key factor in driving hotel contribution. Across the industry, 68% of loyalty program members will stay within their frequent guest program network, even if their preferred brand is unavailable. Our experience is that a significant number of Wyndham Reward members stay at more than one of our brands.", "Our Wyndham Rewards efforts are focused on strengthening franchisee participation and member reward levels. We're increasing incentives for franchisees to hit enrollment hurdles and providing better redemption options for members, making it easier and more advantageous than ever to use our program. In 2013, we saw new enrollments up close to 40% and active members up over 20%. We expect to double our program contribution in the next 5 years.", "Now turning to Wyndham Exchange & Rentals. This business unit had a great year despite continued economic softness in Europe. Great products, strong management and ongoing innovation have enabled us to achieve these positive results. Nowhere is this more evident than in our European Rental businesses, where we are leveraging proven and highly sophisticated RCI yield management capabilities to increase Rental earnings.", "We introduced dynamic pricing last year in our U.K. Cottage and Dutch part businesses. In both cases, properties with dynamic pricing in place outperformed properties with traditional pricing protocols. We plan to expand the use of advanced yield management capabilities to all of our Rental brands, and dynamic pricing is an important aspect of our strategy.", "Historically, the vacation rental industry priced holiday homes about 18 months in advance. In addition, promotional discount campaigns required lengthy owner solicitations and approvals, which hindered the necessary speed to market to optimally capture consumer demand and drive volume.", "Dynamic pricing is the pricing model used in airline, rental car and hotel booking systems. Rather than trying to predict demand and formulate prices many months in advance, an intelligent system evaluates a range of data, such as past booking information, customer web search trends and other demand factors, continually calculating the best prices to optimize rates and occupancy. This is basic in many industries but new to the Vacation Rental business in Europe.", "Regarding the macro environment in Europe, economies in our key markets appear to be on the upswing. For example, the Netherlands, which is home to our largest European Rentals business, has been dealing with the recessionary environment since 2009. This market is expected to grow modestly this year while the U.K. economy is expected to grow over 2%. There are some encouraging signs. Through January, bookings at each of our European brands were ahead of last year.", "We also continue to build out the U.S. rentals market. We've added or expanded our presence in 6 markets since we acquired ResortQuest in the fall of 2010, most recently adding the Outer Banks in North Carolina to our great getaway locations. We now -- we have also integrated over 9 -- over 60 websites financial and operational systems. That said, there is tremendous room for growth in the U.S. vacation rental market, which is estimated to be over $20 billion.", "On the Exchange side of the business, RCI, which celebrated its 40th anniversary this week, continues to be the innovator in the timeshare exchange industry with great results. We're expanding the services we provide to developers, enhancing the consumer experience, increasing revenues and improving margins. We added over 90 new affiliates and 175 new resorts to the portfolio in 2013, as well as the renewals of significant brands, such as Disney and Fairmount Heritage Place.", "We ended the year with online transactions at 48% of the total, up from 45% in 2012 and 13% when we launched the rci.com initiative in 2008. Innovations, through technology and new products, are driving revenue growth and higher member retention rates. Almost $45 million or 7% of RCI revenues in 2013 came from sources that didn't exist 5 years ago, and member retention rates are close to 90%.", "At Wyndham Vacation Ownership, we continue to innovate to drive cash flow, improve the sales process and enhance the consumer experience. Even with our long history of industry changing innovations, the Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model, also known as WAAM, is a standout. Since its launch in 2010, we have modified the program and continue to find creative ways to reduce or eliminate the capital needed for product development. These WAAM models are -- were established to improve overall cash flow and returns and have proven to be a great success. Since March 2010, we have signed 14 WAAM contracts with 8 already contributing to sales. More importantly, our current pipeline is sufficient to support 50% of our development spend by 2015.", "On the sales front, we have solid momentum moving into 2014. We're excited about our new urban sales offices in New York, which opened in August, and Chicago, which opened in November. Results so far are strong, with VPGs more than double our norm at those -- in those markets. We also recently opened -- began sales in Margaritaville Vacation Club by Wyndham, with our pilot program running ahead of plan.", "Finally, as you saw in our release this morning, we are raising our dividend, consistent with our policy to grow dividend at least at the rate of growth of our company. This reflects the board's confidence in the growth and momentum of the business, and I've never been more optimistic about our prospects and ability to leverage the many opportunities ahead.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Tom to walk through the numbers.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Thank you, Steve. As Steve noted, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which topped off another year of solid adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share growth.", "Let me start my comments by reviewing the financial performance of each of our business units in the fourth quarter. In the Hotel Group, revenues were up 10%, reflecting higher RevPAR and increase in system size and increased hotel management reimbursable fees.", "Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased 3%, aided by RevPAR gains and an increase in system size, partially offset by nearly $7 million of higher expenses associated with marketing. As we discussed on last quarter's call, the higher spending reflects the timing adjustment as we catch up from lower spend in the previous quarters. Adjusted EBITDA excludes a $9 million charge as we put in place the restructuring of our Hotel team, which will support funding for the umbrella program that Steve discussed earlier. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes $8 million in noncash charges, primarily related to our Hawthorn brand.", "Domestic RevPAR grew 4.7% in the fourth quarter on the strength of our upscale Wyndham brand, which grew 10.5% for the quarter and 12.4% for the full year, featuring both strong same-store performance and a mix benefit from recent hotel additions. International RevPAR continues to run at lower rates due to expansion of our lower RevPAR brands in China. Overall, RevPAR increased 3.8%.", "System size for the year increased close to 3%, including the opening of 8 Wyndham hotels in Germany and the opening of our 500 Super 8 property in China, which put the total number of Wyndham family properties in China to nearly 700.", "Our Exchange & Rentals segment generated solid operating results in what is seasonably their toughest quarter of the year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenues increased 3%. On the same basis, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was down $4 million, primarily reflecting increased losses due to Rental acquisitions.", "On the Exchange side of the business, revenues were relatively flat on a constant currency basis. Average number of members increased 1.6%, reflecting member growth in the Americas attributable to higher retention rates and new affiliations, while Exchange revenue per member decreased 1.8% due to the absence of revenues related to a product discontinued during the fourth quarter of 2012.", "Excluding the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions, Vacation Rental revenues were up $5 million or 4% for the quarter, reflecting a 4.4% increase in average net price per rental as our yield management strategies continue to produce benefits, particularly at our Landal GreenParks business in Holland. Transaction volume was flat.", "Our Vacation Ownership business had a great quarter with revenues up 12% and adjusted EBITDA up 19%. Gross VOI sales were up $53 million or 12%, reflecting over a 6% increase in both tour flow and VPG. We're really pleased with the progress we've made on VPG. And as Steve said, we're starting the year with solid momentum.", "Write-offs of consumer finance receivables in the quarter were $68 million, down over 12% from the fourth quarter of last year. The provision for loan loss was $73 million, down from $89 million a year ago. We're pleased with the progress that we've made in this area. We'll continue making refinements to our credit standards this year and expect further improvements in the provision.", "Now when we look at overall company EBITDA performance from 2013, we see growth of over 9%. You might remember that foreign exchange trends went against our guidance assumptions to the amount of $14 million company-wide. Now if we were to add this amount to our final EBITDA number of $1,152,000,000, we would've exceeded the top end of our full year EBITDA guidance range.", "Free cash flow for the year was $770 million or $5.70 per share, slightly ahead of our expectation. As you know, cash flow movements can be fluid on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis. Therefore, we are focused on a target area of approximately $750 million rather than any specific number. Cash from operations were just over $1 billion while CapEx was $238 million, higher than 2012, largely due to renovations at our owned Rio Mar hotel in Puerto Rico and Wyndham Exchange & Rentals moved to a new building.", "We repurchased 9.7 million shares during the year for $590 million, decreasing our weighted average diluted share count by 7% year-over-year. Including the $156 million that we paid in dividends, we returned about $750 million directly to shareholders. As it turned out, acquisitions accounted for only a small portion of our spend last year. Now please remember that an important capital allocation priority for our company is to prudently invest in the business, including M&A, seeking out the highest returns for your capital.", "Now let's turn to 2014's outlook and guidance. We're going to post full guidance details to our Investor Relations website following the call, and our guidance assumptions are based on foreign exchange as of December 31, 2013. Our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges are unchanged at $5.25 billion to $53.5 billion (sic) [$5.35 billion] for revenue and $1.22 billion and $1.24 billion for adjusted EBITDA.", "Adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2014 moves to $4.18 to $4.28 per share, reflecting the share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2013. We expect the diluted share count of approximately 131 million shares, which, per our standard guidance practice, assumes no share buybacks in 2014. That translates to approximately 9% to 12% adjusted EPS growth in 2014 before any share repurchase in 2014.", "Now let's take a quick look at guidance for each of our business units. Starting with the Wyndham Hotel Group, we expect another strong year. At the guidance midpoint, we expect revenue growth of approximately 5% and adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 10%. Regarding Hotel drivers, we expect RevPAR growth of 4% to 6% and room growth of 2% to 4%. Recall that we are operating primarily in the economy and mid-scale areas, which usually have lower RevPAR growth than the overall industry at this stage in the recovery cycle.", "We expect Wyndham Exchange & Rentals revenues at the midpoint of guidance to increase 7% and adjusted EBITDA to increase 8%. We expect average number of members in our Exchange business to grow from 0% to 2% and Exchange revenue per member to be flat. We also expect Rental transactions to grow 4% to 6% while average net price per rental would grow 5% to 7%.", "For Wyndham Vacation Ownership, we expect total segment revenue growth of 4% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 5% at the midpoint of the guidance ranges. We expect tour growth of 2% to 5% and VPG to be flat to 2%. We expect the provision for loan losses to decline to approximately 18% of gross VOI sales, down from 20.2% in 2013.", "Company-wide, we expect depreciation and amortization to be $230 million to $235 million. We expect to spend between $235 million to $245 million in CapEx. Keep in mind that our maintenance CapEx level is roughly $100 million. We expect to spend $165 million to $175 million in timeshare development in 2014, up from $129 million in 2013.", "As we've mentioned over the past few years, our goal has been to manage inventory spend to $150 million as our 5-year average starting in 2011. Our free cash flow guidance remains at a target of $750 million, as stronger business performance will be offset by higher inventory spend and the $40 million increase in cash taxes that we've talked about on last quarter's call.", "For the first quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be up $0.72 to $0.75. We would note that there are some differences between our outlook and some analysts' models with regard to share repurchase. We don't budget share repurchases, and some analysts build that assumption into their models.", "In addition, on a business unit level, WVO will have a challenging year-over-year comparison in the first quarter. While key drivers for the business are expected to perform strongly, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be flat or down slightly in the first quarter, reflecting the absence of an $11 million benefit from a previously disclosed legal settlement in quarter one of last year, as well as a $6 million EBITDA hit from deferred revenue associated with Margaritaville sales, which we'll just recognize later in the year as construction is completed.", "I'd like to finish by reiterating our strategy to deploy cash flow to increase shareholder value by investing in the business and by returning capital to you. Our focus now and always is to maximize shareholder return.", "And so we're looking forward to another terrific year. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Tom. Thanks, Tom. Before we open the line for questions, let me sum up.", "At the end of each year, I'd like to be in a position to tell you that we've delivered a combination of more of the same and something new. By more of the same, I mean consistent execution of a sound business plan and disciplined capital allocation that enables us to invest in the business and return a significant amount of capital to investors. By something new, I mean innovating to drive growth and a superior customer experience, leveraging the size of the Wyndham Hotel Group to achieve greater marketing impact, implementing dynamic pricing in the Rental businesses and, as in WAAM, continuing to find new ways to improve cash flow in Wyndham Vacation Ownership. I hope the more of the same component gives you a high degree of comfort in your investment in Wyndham while the something new component gets you excited about the significant runway we have to create value for you in the future.", "With that, Shirley, let's open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Joe Greff with JPMC.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Steve, Tom, the questions we're getting from investors this morning is on the level of buyback activity in the fourth quarter and in the 1Q, and I know you haven't given any explicit sort of targets in absolute dollars. So maybe the specific question that you can answer is has your view or strategy on the level of buyback activity -- has that changed relative to the last couple of years? And was there anything more recently that would have precluded you from being more active in the quarter or year-to-date?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Sure. Thanks, Joe. No, our view has not changed. The fact is we did purchases of around $600 million this year. We did $630 million last year, a little bit more. And that's consistent with what our expectations were. We also managed though -- you asked is there anything that influences it. We have said in the past that we do manage to a leverage ratio. And so if cash comes in or out during a period of time, it could impact the amount of purchases we do for a particular month or particular quarter. But the fact is, we purchased $30 million more in the third quarter of this year than we did in the third quarter of last year. And in the fourth quarter, we purchased a little bit less. So it's not -- I don't think there's anything to read into that at all.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So $24 million quarter-to-date times 3, times 4 would be a lot less than sort of the $600 million of annual buyback activity. You're not signaling to us that perhaps the buyback signal is different than in the past.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Absolutely not. No. And it's -- if you were to look at it on a day-by-day basis, you'd probably get even a different interpretation. So no, we have not changed our policy and our thought on that. And in fact, I think in Tom's comments it's pretty clear that our capital allocation policy remains the same. We'd love to invest in the business if we can. If there aren't good deals for us, we're going to buy back stock and we increase our dividends.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Well that comment is a great segue into my next question. Is there much out there? I know in the past, some of these acquisitions, you could argue, have been more of a -- coming from a distressed area or a distressed seller. Is there much out there that would fit what you kind of talk about as being sort of tuck-in acquisitions?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, there's always things out there, and we're pretty active in looking at everything that's out there in our zone. So we -- I don't think that the pipeline is much different than it's been in the last couple of years. We don't know if we'll close any of the deals we're looking at currently, because you just can't predict what the other side will do or whether we'll be able to get ourselves comfortable in the price metrics. But nothing really has changed, Joe, in that regard. We'd love to find more opportunities to grow, and we'll continue to look. But if the deals don't make sense, we're not going to be doing them.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.", "Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Could we talk a little bit more about the timeshare business broadly? I guess I'm struggling with the VPG business. The volume per guest was just so terrific. I still didn't completely understand why it wouldn't moderate as we get into 2014, especially given nice growth expectations for tours. And then staying on timeshare, the loan loss provision changes for Q4, can you just give us a little bit more color on that? And how you're thinking about it for -- I'm sorry, for the fourth quarter and then for the balance of '14, how are you thinking about loan loss provision? And then finally, Tom, what are your -- did you mention what your free cash flow growth expectations were for '14 and beyond?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay. Well, I'll let Tom take loan loss and the question you addressed to him about the cash flow projections. I'll address the first question, which was VPG. And we saw a nice VPG lift in the fourth quarter. You're right, Steve, we did. We also had a relatively easy comparison. And we had said that before to 2013, to -- excuse me, 2012 when we discontinued a program that we've talked about before. That lifted us in 2012. It ended and then was not present at the end of 2013 -- excuse me, 2012. So the 2013 comparison is easier. I don't think that, that's necessarily indicative of what the upcoming year will look like. And again, we don't run the business to try to hit a VPG growth number. That's not the way that we run the business. We run it for EBITDA and cash flow. And the fact is we are constantly looking at new marketing channels, new ways to add partners to our marketing program, like Margaritaville and others. And we build our program and plan around what we see as our marketing channels and our ability to drive tours from different channels. And what we're giving you as the guidance is based on the best information we have available. This is what we think the VPG will look like for the year. As I said for the projects in the urban markets in Chicago and New York, they've been terrific. They're running ahead of our plan, and they're significantly above the average VPG. But then in and of itself will not lift the overall VPG. That's just 2 markets that are doing very, very well. So we're trying to give you the best guidance we can based on what we're looking at throughout our marketing channels. And we'd love to overperform. But then again, we're going to give you what we think is our best look at what the year will look like. And I don't know what else I can add to that, Steve. But I'll let -- Tom, do you have anything to add?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Steve, just finishing up on that. Did you note the sales towards existing versus new? I'm sorry, if maybe you could give us some color on that, too. I didn't -- if I heard that or even speak to that.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "We didn't speak to it. We think our marketing channels this year will be driving a few more new tours than we saw last year, but it's not a massive shift. We look at that because we want to make sure we're adding new members. And as the system grows, obviously, we need to add more new members in order to keep that same ability to grow in the future on upgrade sales. So this year, we were around 28,000, 29,000. We'll probably break 30,000 next year. But no major shift.", "Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Sorry, Tom, go ahead.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Okay, Steve. I'll answer your third question first, which is did I talk about free cash flow for next year. Yes, we're targeting $750 million. And the reason we pointed out that the we're targeting $750 million, first off, we're targeting around $750 million because of the fact that while the business will be growing and producing more cash from the business, there are 2 extraordinary factors. One is as we've been talking about now for a number of years, we expect our cash tax rate to increase, and next year, it'll be notable. And that's going to be probably around a $40 million impact alone. And then as we've been managing to this inventory spending target over $150 million over a 5-year period of time, we expect to spend a little more in inventory next year 2014, this year, rather, than we did last year. So those are the 2 factors in why we're targeting around $750 million. So to your second question, which I'll now answer second, is the question about provision. If you recall, we identified cease and desist probably a year and change ago that we have noticed a tick-up in that type of activity, which led to higher defaults. And we indicated at that point in time that we thought that was something that we could deal with. And I think our team down in Orlando worked on it pretty aggressively this year with our legal team, and I think we've made good progress on cease and desist. So I'd cite that as a factor. But I would cite sort of just overall improvements that we're making in our consumer finance group in Las Vegas and working with people who have loans to try to improve what we can to try to improve the default trends. If you look at our actual defaults, our actual defaults have not been growing. And so that's an encouraging sign and a sign that gives us optimism that next year that, that number will come down. And you and I may have had a conversation along the way. If you remember, our provision for loan loss at its peak was around 30%. If I recall correctly, 29% to 30%. And we were often asked, \"Well, you've strengthened the quality of your buyer. When will it get to the good old days?\" And the good old days, I think, before I arrived. But I think 2007, the number was around 17% or 18%. And so we never promised anything because it's really hard to predict. But we're really encouraged that, next year, we'll be getting close to an 18% number. So we feel good about our progress, but there's more work to do. There's never -- we never stop working to improve that measure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "I have 2 questions. The first is I just want to be clear -- just clear something on the previous question. In your EBITDA guidance assumptions, does that assume that your loan loss provision will be going down in 2014 to make that guided range?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes. From about 20% to about 18%.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "okay. And the rule of thumb, each percentage point was roughly $8 million. Is that -- as I recall, correct?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Patrick, the number -- we said that a couple of years ago. I wouldn't want to quote it right now. So let us get back to you on that. We haven't revisited that metric for some time.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. That was the first question. The second, and to dig a little bit deeper into the results, the Vacation Exchange & Rental. In the press release, you talked about weakness from seasonality, from acquisitions and, obviously, foreign currency. But -- and in the conference call, the prepared remarks, you talked about increased losses from acquisitions. Did I hear that correctly? And if you could talk a little bit more what -- about the seasonality and what exactly are these increased losses from acquisitions.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Sure, Patrick. And the -- and I appreciate the question. If there's any confusion around that, we should be really clear. So the Vacation Rental business is a seasonal business because of the way that the bookings and the cash comes in is definitely tilted towards the summer months. And because of that, you saw the infrastructures. So you could actually buy a business that has a loss in the fourth quarter but has a profit in the second and third quarters. And that is not unusual in the Rentals business. We did a couple of deals this year that brought in businesses and brought in, therefore, their losses in the fourth quarter that skewed it a little bit. We're really pleased with the deals that we've done and the performance that we're seeing, so we don't want to give any signal that there's anything wrong there. We're very happy with the performance that we've seen, and we've done deals both in the U.S., as well as in Europe. So no, it's just -- we're trying to describe why you don't see as much growth as you might think you would see given the performance and the drivers that we're reporting out on. That's really the only thing that we're trying to signal to. Do you have anything to add to that, Tom?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "No, that's perfect. No.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I've got one more question here. You talked in the earnings release about higher capital expenditures in 2013 versus 2012. Just give me a little more color on what were those higher expenditures. Was it more just in the timeshare developments, or where else was that?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "What we cited, there were 2 reasons. One is that we are in construction in our hotel at Rio Mar, the hotel that we purchased in Puerto Rico. And so that's coming through CapEx, that -- the hotel improvements. When we start to develop timeshare, that will be done not through CapEx, of course. And then the second reason is we built a new building or had a new building built for our Exchange & Rentals team, and that was the other extraordinary factor.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Nikhil Bhalla with FBR.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Tom, this question is for you. Would you just kind of give us some color on where the default rates actually stood at the end of 2013 compared to 2012?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "If -- we can give you that. We're going to get you that information. But I assume you recall that we were down in the quarter, for sure, which I cited on -- in my comments. But for the full year, my guess is we were down. But I can have someone do a quick calculation, and we can someone -- we'll get you the percentage. You're asking, Nikhil, for the full year change in defaults, 1 year to the other, or are you just looking for the quarterly number?", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "No, that's -- even the full year is good enough. I'm just trying to ascertain where we are right now or where we stood for the year. And then just going back to where that number was at its worst, possibly in 2009, if you could just -- I don't know if you remember that number.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Okay. We're going to scramble and get you that data. But let me give you 2 data points. For the full year 2013, there were $280 million in defaults as compared to 2012, $305 million in defaults. And the peak number in 2009 was $462 million in defaults, so a material improvement in what were quite difficult times, of course, for everyone.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "Regarding the rental industry, I was wondering if you have any associations with some of the OTAs. For example, the HomeAway seems to have some association. And so to the second question I wanted to ask regards mobile devices. Again, big discussions upon mobile devices for reservations. I was wondering -- and it would seem particularly that you want more to be done in-house. Where do you stand on using -- getting into mobile devices and away from some of the Expedia-type companies, for example?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay. And, Mike, I assume the second question was more directed to the hotel industry than rentals. Your first one was rentals, correct?", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "First one was rentals, correct. And -- it's correct.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay. On the Rental side, and I know you've ask this question before about the connectivity to OTAs, we do use -- for example, you raised HomeAway. We use HomeAway for some of our product distribution, but that's not our main channel. But we do use it at times when we're -- when we have inventory that we're trying to place out in the market. So we do use all the different distribution channels that we have available to us. We view them as partners. We don't view them as anything other than that. So we feel that our model of the full service managed rental is different than other models, but the other distribution models are great complements to what we have. With respect to the mobile devices, I encourage you to go on your mobile device and pull up our apps. They're very good. You can book either directly on your mobile app or what we offer as our first choices. After you do a search, you can push a button and get connected to our call center because it'd be better if people were talking on the phone than trying to do their iPhones while they're driving. So you can do it either way on our mobile apps. They're very good. They're very easy to use, and we think they're user-friendly.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "Could you kind of quantify to what extent reservations are coming through your own mobile devices? What kind of growth you're seeing?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "The growth is significant. I don't know the exact numbers. But overall, it's still a small piece. But that -- if I gave you a growth number, it would look really big. But it's off a small base of what it contributes to the overall.", "Operator", "And we do have one more question. Next question comes from Antoine Chiche with KKR.", "Antoine Chiche", "Just wanted to ask regarding the 2014 guidance in the prepared remarks you mentioned that...", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Antoine, you got to speak up.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "We can't hear you.", "Antoine Chiche", "All right, sorry. You mentioned that the fourth quarter was affected by $14 million in foreign exchange. I was wondering if foreign exchange had affected your 2014 guidance at all. And if pro forma, it had actually increased from last quarter.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes. Antoine, number -- what we said specifically is when we set guidance at the end of 2012 for 2013, we made certain assumptions in our guidance, right, because it's a target that you have to establish with some fixed assumptions. And so we used foreign exchange at the end of 2012 for guidance. And then throughout the year, particularly early in the year, those guidance assumptions created a deficit of around $14 million for the company.", "Operator", "We do have a question from Whitney Stevenson with JMP Securities.", "Robert A. LaFleur - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Somehow, I came through as Whitney, but it's Bob LaFleur. A quick question on the Hawthorn charge. If you could just give us the details behind that and what was involved there.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, that was -- Hawthorn's a brand that we bought when we acquired the USFS business from Hyatt. We bought Hawthorn and Microtel. And when you do the acquisition, you have a set of projections of what the growth rate will be and where you'll be in a certain period of time. And that drives the value that you allocate to the brand and to your franchise agreements and everything else. In the case of Hawthorn, the growth has not been what we originally had projected. What we found was we had to terminate more properties than we thought once we got in there. And so we took down the number. Subsequent to that, it's been growing well. We -- in fact, we just added a whole bunch of Hawthorns. So I think in the long run, we -- what we'll define -- it's just a point in time when we had to compare to what we had originally projected. There was little shortfall. Not the case with Microtel, which is doing fantastic. Just the case of that particular brand.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Bobby, we didn't write-off the total asset of the brand. We just shored off a portion of it.", "Robert A. LaFleur - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Is Hawthorn primarily a new-build brand, or are you doing conversions with that?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "We're doing conversions as well as new build. We actually just created a new prototype for Hawthorn that is seeming to be very popular. We think we'll get some good traction on that on the new construction side. But we also do quite a few conversions. And it's -- as you probably know, it's Hawthorn's Suite. It's actually an extended stay brand for us.", "Robert A. LaFleur - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And one quick last one on timeshare. With the increase in tours and the increase in VPG, is the increase in VPG being driven primarily by better close rates, or is it better sort of average transaction price? Could you maybe talk about some of the composition of that improvement?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Bob, it's a little bit of both. I don't -- I wouldn't want to be -- I wouldn't want to say that it's just one that's contributing to it. Again, we don't manage the business to VPG as one factor. And if we saw close rates shoot up and the volume go down a little bit, we wouldn't be heartbroken. The price per transaction go down. It's like RevPAR. Occupancy up, ADR down a little bit. Do you live and die by that? No. So I don't want to be telling you that it's going to be just one or the other factor. It's going to be a little bit of both.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMC.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a quick follow-up here. Of the $235 million to $245 million of CapEx for '14, how much of that would you identify as sort of onetime in nature or things that would not necessarily recur beyond '14?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes. So we're going to finish construction on Rio Mar, and that's going to be probably another $30 million or $35 million. So it's probably around $200 million, Joe, with about $30 million being extraordinary-type spending.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Joe, maybe more to the point of the question. Our maintenance CapEx is around $100 million. And so everything above $100 million, you can kind of assume is something that we're doing to improve the business that is not required just to keep the lights on. And so that -- there will be flex in that above. But to Tom's specific answer, that's the 2014 impact.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Great. And can you remind us last year in the 1Q, the settlement gain last year, what was that exact amount?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "It's $11 million. It was in WVO.", "Operator", "At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the speakers.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thank you, Shirley. I appreciate you all joining us and look forward to talking to you later on in the year. Thanks.", "Operator", "And this does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Margo C. Happer", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO; and Tom Conforti, our CFO. Before we get started, I want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K filed February 14, 2014, with the SEC. We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these measures to GAAP is provided in the tables to the press release and is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website at wyndhamworldwide.com. Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Margo. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter call. I am pleased to report that we started 2014 with another strong quarter with adjusted EPS of 10%. During the last few months, many people have asked me if the extreme weather conditions we are having are having an impact on our business. Without a doubt, the polar vortex causing record low temperatures in the U.S., snow and ice storms shutting down travel as well as our call centers, and historic flooding in the South of England, can all have an impact on bookings and travel patterns of our consumers. However, once again, in spite of challenges, our business models proved resilient and our teams delivered strong results.", "In addition, we are seeing some pick up on the macroeconomic front around the world, and overall business momentum is strong. Tom will walk through the financial details, but I'd like to take a few moments to tell you about what we're seeing in each of our businesses, and why I believe 2014 will be another outstanding year.", "Let me start with Wyndham Hotel Group, which we believe will be our fastest growing business unit. First, remember that we are the largest hotel franchisor in the world with 7,500 hotels, a footprint over 15% larger than our next biggest competitor. Our diverse portfolio of strong brands provides a great foundation for growth, especially as the lodging cycle continues to improve.", "While we're best known for our powerhouse economy brands, Super 8 and Days Inn, there are other brands in our portfolio that have huge potential. For example, late last year, our extended stay brand, Hawthorn Suites, unveiled a new hotel prototype intended to enhance the overall guest experience, while reducing development costs for franchisees. The result was significant savings in development costs compared to our previous prototype and great interest in the brand. We also recently unveiled a new Wingate prototype. The more efficient Wingate footprint reduces the cost for hotel owners to build and operate a new Wingate, offering development savings of approximately 10% compared to the previous prototype. We also continue to make great progress in growing our flagship brand, Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, with a number of properties up over 30% from the first quarter of last year and close to 75% from 2 years ago. This quarter, we continue to execute on our strategy to add Wyndham flags in city center locations around the world, including another property in New York City.", "We're on target to go live in mid-May with our first umbrella marketing campaign for our hotel brands. Our primary goals are to maximize the efficiency of our marketing dollars, increase general brand awareness and drive more direct bookings to our brands. The creative concept is to produce a high impact, multi-brand national television campaign that also reflects the unique essence of each brand.", "The television and digital media campaigns will run from May 12 through September 21. We secured high-profile primetime season finales and premieres and specials on the major networks, in addition to cable entertainment and sports. So stay tuned in May and expect to see a strong Wyndham brand family presence.", "In addition to the umbrella marketing campaign, another important initiative at Wyndham Hotel Group is to dramatically grow our Wyndham Rewards loyalty program. We've launched franchisee incentives in the first quarter to better support enrollment, and we are already seeing positive results. We look forward to reporting our progress in the months to come.", "We are pleased to report our hotel websites recently won a prestigious e-commerce award, eTail's 2014 Best-in-Class for Search. This award celebrates excellence in search engine optimization strategy and we were specifically recognized for integrating third-party data and improving relevancy for consumers.", "The combination of the umbrella marketing campaign, heightened focus on Wyndham Rewards and our ongoing online strategy should help us drive job #1 for our hotel business, increasing the value proposition for our franchisees.", "Now moving to Wyndham Exchange & Rentals. We are the world's largest timeshare exchange company with more than double the number of members than our nearest competitor, and we are also the world's largest professionally managed vacation rental company, with approximately 103,000 properties in our portfolio. We continue to innovate in both businesses. In March, RCI began a new chapter in its mission to provide the best online experience for its members by launching program experience. This multi-year initiative is focused on 2 primary goals, personalizing the experience at key touch points and simplifying how and when we offer services and products to maximize value to our membership.", "In our recent March release, we implemented the first phase of program experience, unveiling new design, personalization and functionality features on rci.com., all of which will strengthen RCI's customer experience. Our focus on the customer experience extends to our rental businesses as well. For example, Landal GreenParks, our largest rental brand, which is based in Holland, is currently in the midst of a long-term initiative to significantly enhance the Landal online experience. The first phase of the project was delivered during the fourth quarter of last year. To improve book-to-pay functionality, Landal customers now experience fewer steps to complete a reservation, as well as improvements in the functionality of our website for mobile devices. With these enhancements, the percentage of mobile traffic has increased from 25% of website visits in the first quarter of 2013 to 40% in the first quarter of 2014. We expect initiatives such as this, in addition to our continued focus, on enhanced yield management strategies to support growth this year and beyond.", "In Vacation Ownership, we are the market leader by any measure, owners, resorts, sales and earnings. We also lead on innovation. Earlier this month, we won the Ace Innovator Award at the Annual Timeshare Industry Conference, the ARDA Awards Gala in Las Vegas. The ARDA Awards celebrate the best and brightest in the vacation ownership industry and the Ace Innovator Award recognizes our company's successful launch of the WVO mobile technology initiative, featuring the Apple iPad platform throughout the entire sales organization, ensuring our sales associates have the most up-to-date, consistent and accurate sales information possible.", "Our mobile technology initiative is only one example of new sales tools and practices that combine leading-edge technology and best-in-class sales techniques. We're transforming the sales experience by leveraging our most successful practices across our system. For example, some of our larger sites, such as Orlando, have long deployed podium presentations to effectively and efficiently introduce prospective owners to the benefits of timeshare. Rather than a prospect sitting one-on-one with a salesperson to cover the basics, we give small-group presentations, which are fun, interactive and informative. In the past year, we've rolled out podium presentations across much of North America, using this model for approximately 40% of our current tours. We expect that 60% of tours will include a podium presentation by year end. We believe these new tools and practices will help drive continued growth by improving the sales experience.", "On the corporate front, we are proud that earlier this week, we moved further up the list of the top 50 companies for diversity on Diversity in its annual report. Focusing on corporate social responsibility will continue to be an important element of Wyndham Worldwide's identity.", "In summary, we have a full -- we have a very clear focus across the entire organization to drive innovation and growth within our business, and we have the talented associates to make that happen.", "And now, I'll turn it over to Tom to review results.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. As Steve noted, we're off to a great start with our first quarter results. Overall, we achieved adjusted diluted EPS growth of 10% year-over-year, supported by great business execution and shareholder-friendly capital allocation.", "Free cash flow for the quarter was $2.07 per share, up over 22% from $1.69 per share in the first quarter of 2013.", "So now let's turn to the financial results for each of our business units. In the Hotel Group, revenues were up 7%, reflecting higher RevPAR and franchise fees, as well as increased hotel management reimbursable fees, which is a reminder our EBITDA neutral.", "Adjusted EBITDA increased 17%, largely due to the increases in revenue plus favorable timing of marketing expenses. System-wide RevPAR increased 4%, reflecting domestic gains of 7.6%, partially offset by system growth in lower RevPAR markets outside the United States, unfavorable currency movements and slower RevPAR growth in certain international markets.", "System size for the quarter increased 2.4%, reflecting robust development efforts across all of our regions.", "In our Exchange and Rentals business, revenues in adjusted EBITDA were flat, excluding foreign currency and acquisitions. Reported EBITDA included a $10 million charge in the current year, resulting from the currency devaluation in Venezuela.", "This was a challenging quarter for the Exchange and Rentals business, in part due to the severe weather in North America and extensive flooding in the U.K., which Steve mentioned earlier.", "In addition, the shift of Easter from March first quarter 2013 to April second quarter 2014 creates a difficult year-over-year quarterly comparison, especially in our European Rentals business. The business managed well, however, primarily through tight cost control.", "Our full year outlook for the business remains unchanged. The general economic environment in Europe is improving, and we expect operating enhancements that we've put in place, namely, technology, enhanced yield management capabilities and streamlined cost structures to give us more than our fair share from the economic recovery.", "As of early April, peak summer bookings for our European Vacation Rental businesses were comfortably ahead of last year.", "Excluding currency effects, exchange revenues were down 2%. This was driven by a 3.7% decline in the exchange revenue per member, primarily resulting from a decline in Latin America, due largely to the ongoing economic and political environment impacting our Venezuela customer base, where access to foreign currency is limiting travel, as well as the impact from the unusually severe weather in North America.", "The average number of members increased 1.6%, reflecting higher retention rates and new affiliations in the Americas.", "Vacation Rental revenues were up $4 million or 2% for the quarter, excluding the impact of foreign currency, reflecting a 1.4% increase in rental transactions and a 0.8% increase in the average net price per Vacation Rental.", "Transactions were largely driven by increased customer demand at our Novasol business, which is based in Denmark, while pricing benefited from strength in the higher-priced accommodations at our Landal GreenParks business in Holland.", "Our Vacation Ownership business unit had another strong quarter, with revenues up 8% and adjusted EBITDA up 2%.", "Now excluding the $11 million favorable legal settlement in the first quarter of last year, adjusted EBITDA grew 13%. Gross realized sales were up 7% year-over-year, reflecting a 4.3% increase in tour flow and a 2.8% increase in VPG. Tour improvements were primarily driven by new sales locations, including New York City and Chicago.", "VPG favorability was the result of improved average price per transaction. Now net Vacation Ownership interest sales were up 15%, reflecting higher gross realized sales and a lower provision for loan loss. The improved provision was supported by an 18% decline in defaults from the first quarter of 2013 as well as the positive impact of tighter underwriting standards.", "On the ABS front, on March 19, we completed our first term securitization transaction of the year with the issuance of $425 million of asset-backed notes. The Sierra timeshare 2014-1 was comprised of $328 million of A-rated notes and $97 million of BBB-rated notes. The notes had coupons of 2.7%, 2.07% and 2.42%, respectively, for an overall weighted average coupon of 2.15%. And the advanced rate for the transaction was 88%, another great securitization.", "Now moving to corporate. Interest expense was lower than our expected 2014 run rate, reflecting a credit on VAT taxes. We expect interest expense to normalize at around $30 million a quarter for the remainder of the year.", "Corporate expenses were higher in the quarter than our 2014 expected run rate and we expect those to normalize around $30 million to $31 million a quarter for the remainder of the year. We ended the first quarter with cash from operations at $315 million, up from $274 million in the first quarter of 2013, reflecting favorable timing of working capital. Now please remember that we have a number of free cash flow headwinds this year, including a higher cash tax rate and higher timeshare development spend that will cause our free cash flow in 2014 to be lower than it was in 2013.", "In the first quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares, totaling $150 million. While repurchasing shares is a great use of excess cash, as we have consistently said, an important capital allocation priority remains to prudently invest in the business, including M&A, seeking out the highest returns for your capital. However, absent M&A opportunities, it's safe to assume that we'll spend approximately $600 million this year on share repurchase.", "Finally, let's turn to guidance, which will be posted on the website after the call. As you saw from the press release, we're increasing our EPS guidance $0.05 for the full year and diluted share count goes to 130 million shares, reflecting the benefit of our quarter one repurchases. We reiterate all other guidance previously disclosed. For the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.11 to $1.13 and a diluted share count of 129 million shares. Remember, our guidance assumes 0 future share repurchases, while some analysts assume repurchases in their models. As a result, there are differences between our outlook and some analysts' expectations.", "In addition, the seasonality effect from our vacation rentals business is changing as we grow the business, pushing more EBITDA, but less cash flow into the third quarter.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Steve.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. At Wyndham, we have a culture of customer service that is summarized in the phrase, \u201cCount on me.\u201d Our commitment to shareholders is to run this company in a way that ensures that you can count on us as well. Specifically, you can count on us to have a clear strategy and to execute that strategy with focus and discipline. You can count on us to never be complacent in any of our businesses and continually innovative. And you can count on us to be good stewards of your capital.", "And now we'll take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan Chase.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "The loan-loss provisioning was more favorable than how most of us had modeled for this past quarter. I know, Tom, you talked about sort of the guidance items, the drivers being largely the same as a quarter ago. Can you talk about what your expectations are from here for loan-loss provision improvements? And how much of it is tighter underwriting standards, defaults going down? I know cease-and-desist is probably largely behind us. If you could give some additional color on that, that would be great.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes, Joe. We expect our number to remain as we previously indicated in spite of a really strong first quarter. I think one of the contributors we've talked about in the past was we really did a determined job of dealing with the cease-and-desist situation that we had, and I think that's translating into improved default trends. I point to that as probably the largest factor in driving the fall trends down and giving us comfort on our provision rate.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Is that tied to faster repayments? We see consumer fancying income, that line item has been roughly flattish?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Not -- Joe, it's Steve. That's probably more of the fact that we are constantly tweaking our cash down payment and what we're trying to accomplish at the sales desk. So if we kind of push the compensation sales organization towards more cash down, that will reduce the amount of loans that are out, so there's a lot of things that can affect it. I don't think it would be the work that we did on cease-and-desist that would have impacted that.", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then you said summer bookings on the rental side, it's comfortably ahead. I was hoping, maybe you can give us some greater level of detail, and that's all for me.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "We are -- comfortably is a comfortable word. We are running well ahead of last year. And again, that's -- we saw that in the first quarter -- earlier in the first quarter, we mentioned it on our fourth quarter call and we're continuing to see that trend continue, which gives us some encouragement for what rental will look like this year. The...", "Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Is that pricing or volume, Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "It is -- it's a little bit of both, but I believe it's more volume than it was pricing. It was more volume. And if you -- one of the things we do as we're going through our strategic planning in our business unit reviews, is we look at a lot of the factors that are impacting the consumer around the world. And in Europe, you'd see some positive trending in consumer confidence, and spending levels and in propensity to vacations. So the trending is good as well, so we feel like this will be a good summer for our Rental business. If we look at it right now, we're up high-single digits, but I don't want to indicate that \"Boy, that's going to be a blowout for 2014\". It just means that people are booking earlier and maybe they want to make sure they get to the right location, and we think that's a great sign and it gives more power to our yield management models to increase pricing. But I don't -- we don't want to throw out numbers because we don't want to indicate that this is something that is off the charts run away. It's just -- It's a very good sign and we're comfortable with it.", "Operator", "And the question comes from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.", "Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Could you just talk a little bit about tour flows impact into the first quarter? You gave some color on it, but I'm always trying to understand the balance of new customer mix versus existing customer mix. And any new programs you have in place to boost that volume on either side of new or existing over the next 6 to 12 months?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Sure. Okay. Thanks, Steve. Well, just to step -- to talk about the new customers first, I think we said on the last call that we're targeting just north of 30,000 new customers this year versus, I believe, we're about 28,000, or 27,000 last year. So we do have a slight push to increase. As we will as our base gets bigger, because we want to keep enough new customers in that base that are upgrade for the future as good strength. So right now, we're running at about that pace to be able to deliver about 30,000 new customers this year and just north of 30,000. And so that kind of talks to the new customer side of it. As to the tours, our tours were actually up this quarter, a little bit more than we had forecasted for them to be up. And it's not -- it is a science, to a degree, but you never know what your capture rate is going to be on some of the marketing programs. So we always shoot to be able to exceed our tours so that we never fall short of our tours. Bear in mind that we have salespeople at all of our sales offices waiting for the tours to show up at the front door. If we can't deliver them tours, we have very ineffective salespeople. And so we make sure that we have enough tours to feed the sales force pipeline. I think that this quarter, probably, tour flow is up a little bit more than we expected. If it had been a little bit lower, our VPG probably would have been higher. As you know there is kind of play-off between tour flow and VPG. And so the bottom line is we drive the business to produce EBIT in that business, and produce cash flow, and they did another spectacular job. So they took all those tours they got, they turned them into sales, and it really was a great quarter for WVO.", "Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then just a second question for CFC, if Tom could mention, or give us a feel for the securitization market. What he's seeing there and what you all are seeing there? I think that would be helpful, because it seems pretty strong lately.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes, Steve, the conditions in the ABS market are terrific. If you look at the trend of our transactions since 2008, 2009, you do see improvement in every way, in the investor appetite for the notes, the advanced rates, the cost of funds that we're raising, it just shows continued improvement. And, I think, we're benefiting from favorable market conditions, but I do want to acknowledge the work that our WVO team, our consumer finance team, and the treasure group back here at corporate have collaborated to really put Wyndham on the map in the ABS market in a way that investors are seeking out our notes and we're getting the terms that we're getting. So some of it's about great market conditions and it remains robust going forward, but some of it is the terrific collaboration among our 3 different business units within the company.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "As well as what's going on at the sales table because we've tightened up who we are selling to and we've tighten up the amount of cash we're getting down. So it's a -- so it really is a -- across the entire business unit, a great effort.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions for you here. In light of increasing investor demand for the Single A and AA timeshare paper, I was a little bit surprised to hear you folks talk about increasing the tighter underwriting standards. Do you expect those standards maybe to loosen up a little bit, given that demand for the single-A or AA or even below at this point?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Patrick, the underwriting standards we were referring to is our underwriting standards at issuing consumer loans to timeshare buyers, not the other way around.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, okay, just to be clear. And then secondly here on your loan-loss provision at the moment, how much lower can that really go to? It's dropped significantly over the last year. How much lower was that going?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "It's a great question, Patrick, and in the original question I attributed, the improvement provisions to some tactics. But Steve did bring up an important point that needs to be made, which is, all of this movement, this positive movement, started in 2009 when the company sort of restructured and re-profiled the type of customer that we wanted and brought in a higher creditworthy customer, and I think that we knew that we were going to get an improvement as the years\u2019 work through when the economy normalized. And right now, I think, we -- what was our number for the quarter? Was 17%, around 17% of gross COI. We don't have a crystal ball to know how much further it can go to, but I think we've positioned ourselves well to continue to see improvement because of the real structural changes we made to the business early on in 2008 and 2009 with an enhanced customer profile. So we're not quite sure where we'll end up. Our fingers are crossed that it'll continue to improve, but we can't predict at this point.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "So I guess in that regard, when you talk about enhanced customer profile, that's something that you wanted to have that the new level of FICO score going forward and maintaining that, not really going down the FICO score chain, so to speak, to attract new customers at this point?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "No, our intention is to stay right where we are. We feel good about it.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then lastly, on the hotel RevPAR, and I think this could be a question for just the general midscale and economy segment. What do you think clicked in the first quarter? Was it weather, run rate for that -- for economy had been about 4% for the last 2.5 years and then went up to 6% to 7%. What changed to make that happen in the first quarter?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "I think it's kind of closed the gap with the growth of the other segments of the business, frankly, upscale and upper upscale were fairly close in the first quarter, I think, on Smith Travel. And I think it's a number of factors. I mean, long term, you're looking at not a lot of construction going on in the economy and midscale sector, most of the construction has been in the upper midscale and the upscale sector for the most part. So that's just a simple supply-and-demand thing. In addition, if you look at, and I was just looking recently at the last 28 days that Smith Travel reported, there's been a lot of strength regionally within the Central American regions. And fortunately in the Central America region, there's a lot of economy and midscale product. So it could also be just regional travel and also the weather there that impacted, we never use the weather as an excuse, but it does influence that the way people travel. When it's really bad and planes aren't flying and people want to go visit someone, they might get in the car and they might drive to wherever they want to go. That certainly helps. I think there's a lot of factors playing into it, but we're encouraged by what we're seeing. And we think it's going to be a good summer for frankly all sectors of the lodging marketplace. I don't know if I can answer your question any more specifically than that, Patrick, because I don't know if anybody has the real full answer to what you've asked.", "Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "And I've asked around and I think it's just opinions and there really is no right answer, but I wanted to hear your opinion on that. And then just lastly here, you may have touched on this, Tom, in the prepared remarks. You did 257 basis points of margin increase in the lodging segment. What was the primary driver of that? Was that just the RevPAR? Was there something else going in there with the owned hotel?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "It was RevPAR for sure, Patrick. And it was also the timing on marketing spend. That was about 150 basis points, so that's -- I think that's -- those are the 2 key drivers.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nikhil Bhalla with FBR.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Tom, the first question is for you. And you talked about Easter shift having some impact in 1Q. I was wondering if there's any way to quantify how much of that impact was. And if you see a reversal of that in the second quarter? Maybe we see a little bit of a benefit as that Easter shift impact reverses.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Hard for us to quantify, but we expect that it will contribute positively to EBITDA. And yes, it will be a mix shift to favorable result for the second quarter, because it was absent in the first quarter.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "And would that just be in the exchange in rental segment? Or do you think you could see some benefit in the -- on the lodging side and realized side too?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "The comment that I made was specifically about Exchange & Rentals. So certainly, for Exchange & Rentals, but Steve, your thoughts on other parts?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Just one other, Nikhil, just one other little bit of color on it. In the U.S., we have spring breaks happen all different times. Schools take spring breaks. In Europe, it's much more concentrated. It's right around Easter. So when Easter moves, the school calendar moves. In the U.S., that's less the case. The school calendar is often set and Easter can come and go wherever it does, but the school calendar is set to have a spring break at a certain time in the year. So definitely, Europe is more prone to swings from spring breaks around Easter than you would see in the U.S. So that's part of the reason that it's more pronounced in the Rental business because that's where 90% of our EBITDA comes from in Rental, is from the European rental.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "And just a follow-up question, on the loan-loss provisions. Tom, do you know or do you have the loan write-off number off the top of your head here?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Not off the top of my head, but we'll get it for you, we'll retrieve it for you. You have another question, Nikhil?", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Yes, sure. One other -- talk on acquisitions. Steve, you've talked about acquisitions in the past. Any update on that? What are you seeing on that front?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "The market -- the pipeline out there is about what it's been for the last couple of years. There's opportunities out there. There's still high price expectations, and I'm not sure how much will move quickly, but there's a good amount of activity out there. But not any different than it was probably last year at this time.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay. So when you just think back to fourth quarter of this year or maybe even a little bit earlier, you're not seeing any material change in either the size of your pipeline at this point in time? Or just your expectations for how many of these things may close?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "No, no. And as I said continually, it's really hard to forecast opportunity. We look at a lot of different opportunities. We are inquisitive. We'd like to grow our business, particularly the fee-for-service businesses, the hotel, as well as the rental businesses. And the management business on the timeshare side, so those are 3 areas that we're very focused on. But it's not, I don't think it's any, a lot different than it was before. Some of the same opportunities that were out there a year ago for us are still sitting out there and we'll continue to look.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "That's great. One final question for you on margins again. One, on the lodging segment. You just talked about the timing of marketing spend having some impact. Through the rest of the year, if you could just remind us what that impact may actually look like?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Well, we anticipate that we'll see some of that margin improvement in our Hotel group sustained, but obviously, the timing benefit will disappear.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Got it. And 1Q was primarily the quarter where you saw the benefit and you're not expecting any of that stuff for the rest of the year now?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "I'm sorry, the timing benefit?", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Yes.", "Thomas G. Conforti", "It may happen in the second quarter as well, and then we'll spend it subsequently. But by the end of the year, it will not exist. And let me answer your -- the question I didn't have the answer for. The amount of loans written off were $63 million in the quarter compared to $77 million in the first quarter of last year, so a meaningful drop off in the amount of loans that we've written off.", "Operator", "Your next question from Chris Agnew with MKM Partners.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Apologies if I missed this, but your working capital benefits in the first quarter, do those reverse at any point this year? And do we need to be aware of any particular working capital timings through in any quarters through the year? And also on the higher cash taxes, the -- what's the view beyond this year?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Okay, great. Chris, as it relates to the timing of the working capital benefits, there were small items in each of our working capital lines, they're definitely going to reverse. And so the upside that was created in the first quarter we believe will reverse itself by the end of the year. As it relates to cash taxes, not only are we paying higher cash taxes because we're generating more earnings this year, but we're also paying higher cash taxes because the rate at which we pay cash taxes is increasing, so we're catching sort of a double whammy this year. Next year, we don't expect the rate to change materially, but our expectations are that we'll continue to grow the business and so there may be some increase associated with the growth in the business but not an adjustment in the cash tax rate.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Great. And then a question on Vacation Rental. It was very durable through the downturn, which I guess is a good and bad thing. Bad because it's perhaps less leveraged in the upturn. So just sort of bigger picture. So the acquisitions you've made in the last several years, particularly I think a couple in the U.K., are those arguably more economic, more sensitive to an economic upswing in Europe? And also, the yield management system, do you think -- how much leverage do you think you can capture from that in the recovering European economy?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, the yield management system should help us both in an up market and a down market quite frankly. It's a basic fundamental way of maximizing the yield that we're going to get from the units that we have to rent. So I don't think that, that would necessarily be rocket fuel to an upswing, but I think it'll be good in the upswing. It'll also be good for us during more difficult times. And you're absolutely right. The business has been very resilient during the downturn, and it's been resilient about -- with almost everything we've seen since I've been involved in the business. The only thing that took us down at all was back in 2003, I think, hoof-and-mouth disease stopped people from traveling in the U.K. because people couldn't walk through the fields, and that really did hurt the business. But beyond that, that business has shown incredible resilience economically, as well as with the challenging weather, which we definitely had with the flooding in Southern England this year. As for the new acquisitions, are there any more or less resilient? I think that was your question. One of the businesses that we bought about 2 years ago, maybe 3 years ago now, is more of a fly-to business, flying from the U.K. to the South of France and Italy. And that business has done really, really well for the last couple of years. And it continues to do well this year. It came out of the block strong. So I think all of our businesses are really performing well, both the ones we've had for some time, our largest being Landal and Novasol up in Denmark performing well, as well as the new businesses like James Villa, which is that fly-to business, that is part of our U.K. business mix.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Just a quick follow-up on C. Pat's first question. As far as the strength in the first quarter in RevPAR domestically, do you think it's sustainable, given what you're seeing in booking trends for the balance of the year?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, as you know, Harry, a lot of our bookings are short-term bookings. We don't do a lot of group business so we don't have the long-term visibility like some of the other players who play in the group space would have. We think our -- based on everything we said, as I said, everything we've seen, rather, has indicated that the summer is looking good. But again, our visibility into that, other than in the rental business where we can look a little further in, is difficult for us since we are a shorter booking window.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And then the follow-up is the strategy that you're pursuing for the pipeline of growth in lodging space. Can you talk a little bit more about your -- what you're seeing from the developers point of view? What rents are they most keen on, and then the competitive landscape, because it does appear to be some sort of buildup in the midscale without food and beverage pipeline.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, addressing the second part of that question first, the landscape has always been very, very competitive. Midscale without food and beverage has been a hotspot for probably 3 years. I'm just guessing because it's been so long that it's been an area of heavy focus. From the developer standpoint, we're seeing more new construction come into the pipeline, both domestically, but really internationally in a big way. There's a lot of new construction coming in. And that's probably because the economies are doing a little bit better internationally and there's more emphasis on the tourism sector. As for what developers are looking at right now within our product mix, as I said, the microtel -- actually what I mentioned was the Wingate product has a lot of interest right now. We've redesigned the prototype there. Microtel also has strong interest. Hawthorn is doing well with its new prototype. So it's really, all of the brands have something that they're working on to try to push growth. Some of the brands we're very focused on, on doing some cleansing, which is what you do with larger brands like a Days Inn to make sure that we're, keep taking out that which is not appropriately within the brand. So we've got a great portfolio. We manage them very aggressively to maintain the quality of the portfolio, but also to drive the growth.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And then just a quick follow-up. As far as the Wingate prototype, you mentioned that developers are seeing 10% savings. Not that I'm going to ask you to divulge anything proprietary, but is there anything interesting that you can share that gets you that kind of savings?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Well, some of it is -- a big part of it was reengineering. The prototype for Wingate had not been touched in several years. And so we went through with the engineers and the construction folks to actually determine what it was that we could do in this environment, to try to drive down the overall cost of it. We also are making some changes to the common areas, the common space. It's a lot of little stuff that frankly has given us the ability to drive down that cost. And frankly, we probably should have done this a couple of years ago. It's just we're so focused on other things and the new construction market was not as warm as it is right now. So this was the right time to go in, I think, and do that. And I think we'll see great results from it. We've gotten a lot of interest from groups who would like to do package deals with Wingate, which is wonderful.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just really quickly on kind of the deal front, what you guys are seeing. If you could kind of benchmark maybe the landscape relative to what you saw this time last year, in terms of deals across all 3 of your businesses and other players potentially at the table from an acquisition standpoint, is there anything new you could share?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "No. As I said before, it's pretty much -- I would probably say the landscape of M&A looks about the same as it did last year. We're pretty consistently in the market looking at opportunities, so it's not as if anything big or small that's out there hasn't gotten a good look from us. It just really is, depends on value pricing and what we think we can bring to the opportunity. If the opportunity presents itself that we think there's great chances with synergies and with our ability to impact the growth of the business, those are the type of deals that we think are best suited for us. So really not much has changed from a year ago. Really I'm thinking back, probably not a couple of years, the landscape is pretty much similar.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And just a follow, is it more of a disconnect between fit for the company? Or is it more of a bid ask spread at this point?", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Probably more bid ask than fit.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Understood. Then Tom, really quickly, in your remarks, you are -- you talked about interest expense and did you mention a VAT benefit in this quarter? Or was that a reference to last year's comparability?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "Yes. A VAT impact this quarter. First quarter.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "That was how much?", "Thomas G. Conforti", "I think $3 million or $4 million.", "Operator", "At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the speakers.", "Stephen P. Holmes", "Okay. Well, thank you very much, all -- everyone for joining us today, and have a great spring. We will speak to you in the end of the second quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you, and this does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation.

Your lines have been placed in listen-only until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. ", "I would now turn the call over to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. ", "Margo Happer", "Thank you. Good morning and thanks for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO and Tom Conforti, our CFO. Before we get started, I want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K filed February 14, 2014, with the SEC.", "We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these measures to GAAP is provided in the tables to the Press Release and is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at wyndhamworldwide.com. Steve.", "Steve Holmes ", "Thanks Margo. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. As you saw from the release, we closed the year with another great quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 23% in the quarter and 18% for the full year, with growth driven primarily by stronger operating performance and supported by share repurchases. ", "Quarterly performance was particularly strong in the Wyndham Hotel Group with adjusted EBITDA up 23%. The summer momentum continued at our European vacation rental business into the last quarter of the year, resulting in 14% adjusted EBITDA growth at Wyndham Exchange & Rental\u2019s excluding foreign currency and Wyndham Vacation Ownership achieved a significant sequential improvement in VPG as they applied the learnings from the summer to their new sales processes. ", "2014 was a great year, as each of our business units grew at or above their target rates. Supported by indicatives such as our umbrella marketing campaign in the Hotel Group, dynamic pricing and exchange in rentals and better consumer portfolio performance, as well as enhanced timeshare inventory acquisition models in Vacation Ownership. While we are proud of our accomplishments, we are focused on the future and excited about the opportunities ahead. ", "As you are aware, every U.S. company with even moderate foreign exchange exposure is experiencing headwinds from the significant strengthening of the dollar and we are no exception. While operating momentum in our European businesses remain strong, FX translation has negatively affected the EBITDA guidance we gave you just three months ago by $25 million; however, in response we are adjusting our EBITDA range downward only by $15 million. We expect to deliver the remaining $10 million through strong operating performance at our businesses and tight cost controls. ", "Tom will walk you through the guidance in detail, but I\u2019ll also note that despite the reduction in EBITDA guidance, we are raising our EPS guidance to reflect primarily the full year impact of our fourth quarter 2014 share repurchase. ", "The energy and momentum in our company remains strong, and this is reflected in our Board\u2019s decisions to raise our quarterly dividend by 20% and our decision to raise our free cash flow target to $800 million in 2015. So now lets talk about some of the initiatives that are going to fuel our growth over the coming years. ", "I\u2019ll begin with our Hotel Group, which had a great year in 2014, growing adjusted EBITDA close to 15% and margins over 200 basis points. Our efforts in the Hotel Group are focused on two important areas, increasing our reservation contribution to our franchisees and improving the quality and awareness of our brands. ", "One very important initiative to support these goals last year was our multi-brand umbrella marketing campaign. The campaign ultimately drove over $1.8 billion impressions. Bookings in our central channels increased 10% and enrolments in our Wyndham Rewards Loyalty Program grew 52%. This is great progress towards our goal of establishing the best-in-class Loyalty Program in our primary economy and midscale market segments, which we expect will significantly drive reservation contribution to our franchisees. Stay tuned for some exciting developments with our Wyndham Rewards Loyalty Program this year. ", "Of course maintaining category-leading brands begins with the quality of the hotels and our system, which is a significant area of concentration for us. In 2014 terminations for properties below our system standards accounted for nearly 90% of the total properties terminated from our domestic system, helping to ensure that guests experience with our brand isn\u2019t tainted by a small fraction of hotels that fail to meet our standards.", "Following the recession the vast majority of the properties were terminated from our system due to monitory defaults. As termination for quality defaults are now leading the way, we are also focused on adding properties that will improve the overall quality of the system. As a result, properties added to the system in 2014 had an average trip advisor rating that was 24 basis points higher than our system average.", "In addition, new construction openings were up 11% last year and new construction hotels are immediately accretive to brand quality. You may remember from an earlier call that we were working on a process of launching new prototypes for many of our brands. We have plenty of opportunity to put these new prototypes into development, ensuring high quality for our guest and strong financial returns for our franchisees. Prototype redesigns and a compelling brand portfolio have helped us to achieve a 17% increase in our new construction pipeline over the past three years and we continue to add to the breadth and depth of our portfolio with our recent acquisition of Dolce Hotels and Resorts.

", "Cottages 4 You in Novasol offer a similar Holiday Home product, making it a natural fit from a customer desirability perspective. This builds on the recent introduction of cross selling of over 3,000 French units between these brands. We believe that this is a start of an exciting opportunity to maximize cross-market penetration through each of our brands in Europe and the U.S. ", "Another example of sharing inventory across brands is the Wyndham Home Exchange program. This program provides our vacation rental property owners with the ability to deposit up to five weeks per property annually in exchange for comparable intervals from within RCS portfolio of affiliated vacation ownership resorts. It allows exchange members the opportunity to access a wider variety of vacation properties, while also providing outstanding value to the vacation rental property owner. Cross selling supports our strategy to offer more choices to the customers, while driving better utilization of non-traditional leisure inventory across our many brands.

More immediately we\u2019ve made good progress since the third quarter in refining our marketing and sales approach as evidenced by the sequential improvement in VPG, which was close to flat in constant currency in the fourth quarter.", "We further refined our approach on the specialist presenter model and our outreach to owner upgrades. We remain committed to ensuring that our sales process is effective and in tune with the needs and preferences of existing and potential owners. ", "Previously we focused our discussion on the sales process, but it\u2019s important to remember that a large part of this process is targeting the right consumers. We are always developing new analytical models that allow us to approach the right prospects with the right offer, including financing terms. This is a carefully orchestrated effort among the finance, sales and marketing teams. ", "We\u2019ve worked hard in this area over the past five years, dramatically improving our FICO scores and down payments. In 2014 we further refined our underwriting standards focusing on the size of loans. While this action negatively affected our VPG and gross sales, it also drove lower than expected charge offs from those sales, enabling us to achieve net sales growth of 8% for the year.", "Our provision for loan loss is near a record low and we are continuing to look for improvement. This reflects fundamental operating changes we made to the business, but also supported by approving U.S. economy. Do remember that a lower provision means that we are seeing lower charge offs and higher collections, which improves cash flow. Of course nowhere are the changes in our time-share business more transformative than how we source inventory.", "Since 2009 we\u2019ve increasingly moved from capital intensive to capital efficient inventory sources.

Let me review the financial performance of each of our business units and then discuss our expectations for 2015.

", "Domestic RevPAR increased 8.6%, led by strength in our economy and upscale brands. System-wide RevPAR increased 3%, reflecting both currency headwinds and higher growth in lower RevPAR markets, specifically China. Now if we were to exclude China and bring it to constant currency, global RevPAR grew 5.9% and international RevPAR was flat. System size increased 2.4% for the year and the pipeline at year-end stood at approximately 960 hotels and 117,000 rooms. ", "Our Exchange & Rental segment generated solid operating results in what is traditionally its slowest quarter of the year. On a currency neutral basis revenues increased 6% and adjusted EBITDA was up 14%, reflecting revenue increases and effective cost management. ", "On the Exchange side of the business revenues were up 2% in constant currency. The average number of members increased 2.2%, reflecting member growth in the America\u2019s attributable to higher retention rates and new member growth, while Exchange revenue per member was flat.", "For Vacation Rentals revenues were up $15 million or 11% for the quarter in constant currency, reflecting a 7.3% increase in transaction volume and a 3.3% increase in average net price for rental, primarily driven by growth and a higher yield at our Landal GreenParks business based in Holland, where we are seeing the tangible benefits of our enhanced pricing tools. ", "We are coming of a strong year in Europe for our Vacation Rentals business and our early booking experience indicates a continuation of this trend in 2015. Our bookings thus far are up compared to the prior year.", "Let\u2019s keep in mind the nature of what we sell in our rental business in Europe, primarily domestic vacations in Europe sold to continental European or British consumers. So our product in continental Europe for Euro currency consumers is still a great value for those domestic market consumers and now an even better value for our U.K. customers due to the relative strength of the British Pound. Consumer confidence in our major European markets has remained steady. Our customers really value their vacations and the product offerings we provide. ", "Near the end of the quarter we completed the sale of Canvas Holidays, a provider of European Campaign Holidays, resulting in a $20 million non-cash loss. This segment of the leisure industry in Europe had experienced significant consolidation over the past 12 months. After careful assessment we determined that we would need to make significant capital investments to maintain a relatively small position with limited growth prospects and therefore we decided to exit the business.", "In our Vacation Ownership business we wrapped up another strong year with adjusted EBITDA growth of 6% for the full year. Fourth quarter revenues were up 2% and EBITDA was flat year-over-year. Net VOI sales were flat, reflecting flat VPG in constant currency and a 2.1% decline in tour flow offset by a lower provision for loan loss. ", "Similar to last quarter, tour flow decreases reflect lower upgrade tours as we transition to our new specialist presenter-marketing program. While fewer existing owners are touring, our close rate for those owners who are touring is higher, providing promising signs for the specialist presenter model. ", "Overall VPG was still affected by the resulting mix shift to new owners, however as Steve noted, we are pleased with the sequential progress we made on VPG in the fourth quarter. ", "The provision for loan loss was $60 million down 18% from a year ago. As Steve noted the refinements we\u2019ve made to our credit standards and other operational steps have resulted in provision rates that are near all time lows. ", "Turning to some company-wide figures, free cash flow for the year was $749 million or $5.90 per share, comfortably in our neighborhood target of $750 million. Inventory on the balance sheet increased to approximately $140 million. Now this primarily reflects late 2014 inventory purchases and some non-cash items. ", "We repurchased 2.1 million shares for $171 million during the quarter, decreasing our weighted average diluted share count by 5% year-over-year. For the full year we repurchased 8.6 million shares for $662 million. Including the $179 million we paid in dividends we returned about $825 million to shareholders in 2014. ", "So, now let\u2019s turn to our 2015 outlook and guidance. As a reminder we\u2019ll post full guidance details to our Investor Relations website following the call. As Steve mentioned, we have adjusted our earlier guidance levels due to the significant strengthening of the dollar. Recall that we noted a $9 million foreign exchange impact, 2015 versus 2014 when we issued our guidance in October. Well, since then currency has impacted adjusted EBITDA by another $25 million, resulting in total year-over-year foreign exchange headwinds of $34 million.", "While we are lowering EBITDA guidance for 2015, we have refined our revenue assumptions and are increasing our revenue guidance by $50 million. The new range is $5.450 billion to $5.550 billion. Note the negative FX impact is being primarily offset by the acquisition of Dolce. Our new adjusted EBITDA guidance will come down just $15 million to $1.285 billion to $1.315 billion. This guidance range reflects FX rates on January 30, 2015. We may update our views as we progress into the year should the value of the dollar change meaningfully.", "Let me take a brief moment to explain to you why the company is experiencing this FX translation effect. Our hedging activity for earnings translation exposure is done on a quarterly basis. So while the P&L is somewhat protected from FX fluctuations in the short-term, exposure beyond a given quarter remains unprotected. ", "In large part our hedging practices around translation are guided by consideration of hedge accounting implications. Hedging of non-economic activity such as earnings translations in our business does not receive favorable accounting treatment, which could result in P&L volatility. Therefore we hedge within a quarter to avoid the optics of P&L volatility.", "As it relates to how we see these FX movements impacting our business, our ongoing philosophy has been to evaluate the performance of our international businesses, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. Our operating teams are responsible for the commercial momentum of our businesses and we believe the best way to judge the momentum of our underlying businesses is on a local currency basis. Therefore we will disclose our results in 2015 with and without the impact of foreign currency effects.", "On a currency neutral basis our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2015 implies growth of 6% to 9%, which is consistent with our targeted business growth rate. Adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance for 2015 moves to $4.75 to $4.90 reflecting share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the net effect of foreign exchange. We expect the diluted share count of approximately 123 million shares, which to our standard guidance practice assumes no share buybacks in 2015.", "Now let\u2019s take a quick look at the guidance for each of our business units. Starting with the Hotel Group, we expect another strong year. We expect revenues of $1,270 billion to $1,320 billion. We expect RevPAR growth of 4% to 6% and room growth of 3% to 5%. In constant currency however RevPAR growth will be 5% to 7%. ", "Note that the Hotel Group revenues assume approximately $100 million of pass through reimbursable revenues from the Dolce acquisition. Pass through reimbursable revenues contribute no EBITDA and will result in the full year margin determent of about 250 basis points for the Wyndham Hotel Group in 2015. Hotel Group EBITDA will be $360 million to $375 million. ", "At Exchange & Rentals while the operating results of Canvas were immaterial to our full year results, the sale of the business will impact our driver growth rates and also have a significant seasonality impact on EBITDA and EPS. In 2014 Canvas generated losses in the first, second and fourth quarters, but produced $18 million of EBITDA during the third quarter. We will mention these effects in future quarters. ", "Reflecting January 30, 2015 FX rates and the sale of Canvas, we expect revenues of $1.500 billion to $1.560 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $364 million to $377 million for WER. ", "On a currency neutral basis and excluding the effect of the Canvas sale, growth would be 3% to 6% for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We expect the average number of exchange members to grow 1% to 3% and exchange revenue per member to be down 1% to 3%, however on a constant currency basis at the mid-point, exchange revenue per member would be flat.", "We expect Vacation Rental transactions to grow 2% to 4% and we expect average net price per rental to decrease 9% to 11%, primarily reflecting foreign exchange. On a currency neutral basis average net price per rentals would be flat. Adjusting Canvas results out of 2014 drivers, the growth rate in rental transactions and average net price per transaction would be approximately 200 basis points higher. ", "For Vacation ownership we expect revenues of $2.660 billion to $2.725 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $680 million to $700 million. We expect tour and VPG growth of 1% to 3%. Excluding foreign exchange effects EBITDA growth would be 4% to 7%.", "Company-wide we expect corporate expenses of $130 million to $135 million down from 2014 due to lower employee expenses and legal fees. We expect depreciation, amortization to be between $242 million and $245 million. We expect interest expense of $112 million to $114 million, which assumes no debt issuances in 2015. ", "I\u2019m also very happy to say that our free cash flow target will move to $800 million for 2015. That equates to $6.50 per share. Remember that we managed to a neighborhood target when it comes to cash flow, but overall we expect free cash flow to grow in 2015. We\u2019ll post our cash flow representative model with our cash flow assumption through the year to our website following the call. ", "For the first quarter we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.91 to $0.94. Year-over-year 2015 first quarter comparisons will benefit from the absence of approximately a $6.5 million loss from Canvas in 2014. ", "Remember that our interest expense is always a little lower the first quarter than our annual run rate due to the timing of VAT credits and we would also remind you that we don\u2019t budget repurchases into our guidance assumptions. ", "To close, we were very pleased with the performance of 2014 and are looking forward to another terrific year in 2015, and with that I\u2019ll turn the call back to Steve. Steve.", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks Tom. Before we open the line for questions, I\u2019d like to reiterate a few key points. We had a strong quarter to cap off a great year across our businesses. We have outstanding people collaborating in a culture of performance and continuous improvement. ", "Our commitment to value creating capital allocation is unwavering, all of which positions Wyndham very well to continue to deliver for our shareholders. The positive momentum of our business is allowing us to increase our free cash flow target and also increase our dividend by 20%.", "In addition, despite FX pressure which is impacting our EBITDA guidance by just over 1%, we are raising our EPS guidance for 2015, and while we are very proud of what we\u2019ve accomplish so far, we remain firmly focused on achieving success in the future, by continuing to execute across our businesses, generating significant free cash flow and deploying our shareholders capital to drive superior value.", "With that Wendy, we can open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Joe Greff with J.P. Morgan.", "Joe Greff - J.P. Morgan", "Good morning everybody. A question for you on your \u201815 free cash flow guidance. The conversion of year-over-year EBITDA growth into incremental free cash flow growth in 2015 versus 2014 was nicely ahead of I think what most of us were expecting. Can you give us the high level bridge there? What\u2019s that was driving that and how sustainable is that conversion? Is there anything one-time in \u201815 that we should mindful of that might not sustain itself beyond 2015, particularly with the regard to inventory stands and timeshare and then also the cash tax rate? Thank you.", "Steve Holmes", "Joe, I\u2019m happy to answer the question. So we ended the year at $750 million. We expect EBITDA growth, I think foreign exchange impacted EBITDA growth around 5% or so. ", "There are a couple of things as it relates to product investment. We ended up investing a little more in inventory in 2014 and so we don\u2019t expect any incremental spend on inventory in 2015, so that\u2019s a neutral factor. ", "On the cash tax side we\u2019ve actually identified some opportunities that we are taking what was a headwind in the past and adding that as a positive to our overall free cash flow contributions. So we feel pretty good that that $800 million number is achievable for the year and sustainable into the future.", "Joe Greff - J.P. Morgan", "Great. A lot of us want to ask about M&A. I'm not sure if there\u2019s anything new to provide there, but if you could. And then since it is topical today with another lodging company talking about spinning out its timeshare business following what another company did a few years ago, can you talk about Steve the strategic value you see in keeping your timeshare business intact with your other hospitality related businesses, and can you tell us why you think it should stay within Wyndham versus spinning it off like what [Indiscernible] talked about this morning. Thank you. That\u2019s all from me.", "Steve Holmes", "Sure Joe. Well, first of all every company is different with their situation and circumstances and what they view as critical to their kind of ongoing success. Our timeshare business is roughly half of our overall company and has a great track record for proven growth and delivery of innovation. ", "We are also very happy with our collection of businesses. We\u2019ve got great businesses with fantastic, talented associates and everybody is proving to be very adaptable and resilient. So we\u2019ve gone through some periods of downturn where other companies have seen more pain and we haven\u2019t seen as much in part because of the resilient nature of the way the business is built. So at any particular cycle it could look like a great idea or not a good idea to have all the businesses together, but we feel really good about the collection of business that we have.", "Having said that, as we said continually since we listed on the New York Stock Exchange, we understand our fiduciary responsibility to our share holders and we will look at all options and all opportunities. We\u2019ve looked at all options and all opportunities and we have now what we feel is the proper collection of businesses, but we continue to look at that and that\u2019s not foretelling of anything. Its just foretelling of the fact that we are always mindful of looking at what our options are out there. ", "So we really think there is great connectivity with our businesses. We are continually looking at how we can cross fertilize and cross market the business and we really feel like we have a terrific collection of very resilient and very strong leading businesses in each one of their sectors. ", "Joe Greff - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you. ", "Steve Holmes", "Sure. ", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. ", "Steve Holmes", "Hey, Steve. ", "Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs", "Hi, good morning. So could you just give us a little bit more color on the VPG improvement; it got a lot of focus last quarter. Could you just give a little bit more detail exactly of what Franz and Mike Hug and that whole crew did in three months? How they pivoted and changed that trajectory so quickly? ", "Second question is just the Dolce. Nice acquisition in a niche area and just following on what Joe said, from a cap allocation perspective, on an acquisition perspective, do you see more opportunities like that. And I think what\u2019s interesting about Dolce, if you don\u2019t mind me saying it, that it was a niche area. I didn\u2019t hear a lot of other hotel companies talking about it and you all found a way to buy that. Is there a pipeline of those kinds of things out there that we should be looking for? ", "Steve Holmes", "All right, well thanks Steve. I\u2019ll take the questions and Tom will weigh in as he sees fit. ", "On the VPG question, which I do understand, there were a lot of questions in the third quarter. If you look at the history of our VPG, it has not been straight line. It has been a little bumpy, a little volatile and that\u2019s the nature of a sales and marking business like this. We set long terms goals and we achieved those goals and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done continually, but it doesn\u2019t mean for one quarter we may not be up or down. ", "As Franz who you mentioned runs that business said the other day, we start the year, we run a marathon. Our splits may not be exactly what we want them to be, but we know that we can spin a little harder and reach the goal at the end of day, and that is part of how he runs that business and they do a phenomena job of running the business down there in Orlando. ", "Specifically what they did was, as we talked about on the last call, they had a pretty good idea of what was impacting the VPG downturn. They adjusted for that. Some of the things they did was they changed the kind of timing and rhythm of our tours for our in-house guest. So people staying at the resort, coming in to take a tour, we were a little bit too ridged and structured about when those tours were going to be. ", "So we moved back to a little more flexible model, but still using our specialist presenter program, the new way of positioning the product. That had a very big impact on the success rate of generating those in-house tours and as you know, VPG and in-house tours are higher than the front line tours. So just that mix can have a bit of a change to it, and that\u2019s really \u2013 I mean there is no more really to the secret sauce than that. That is what we did. ", "We looked at basically our marketing methodology and we adjusted it and we\u2019ll continue to adjust it and again I\u2019ll say this, we said it in the past, don\u2019t expect VPG to be straight line every quarter. We work to maximize our profitability in the business. As we commented, our gross VOI was kind of flattish and down a little bit in the third and fourth quarter, but our net VOI, when you take into account who we are selling to and what our loss profile is, it was actually growing by 8%. ", "So there is gives and takes in that business. Its one of the wonderful flexibilities to that business and I don\u2019t know that there is any group that manages it better than our group down in Orlando. ", "As for Dolce, thank you for the compliment of finding that deal. M&A is kind of part of our DNA here and we have a very terrific M&A group. Its not huge, but it\u2019s a great group. There they are constantly turning over rocks and looking for deals. We\u2019ve looked at Dolce for a while. We were doing other things and had our focus in other areas, but once we turned our laser focus to it, we were able to complete that deal relatively quickly and we think it will be a great addition to our hotel portfolio. ", "As I said, not only adding more group and meeting business capability to us from an inventory standpoint, but also from the sales standpoint, they have a great reputation in the meetings business for group meetings and now we can apply that same group sales people to also driving more business to our Wyndham and other meeting and banquet hotels. ", "So we feel like this is a terrific opportunity for us, a great fit. It\u2019s a New Jersey based company, so it\u2019s kind of easy. We hope to keep a lot of those key players involved and so we are very much looking forward to the integration of that business. ", "Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thanks.", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks Steve. ", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust ", "Hi, good morning. ", "Steve Holmes", "Hi Patrick. ", "Tom Conforti", "Hi, Patrick. ", "Patrick Scholes \u2013 SunTrust", "Hi. I got a number of questions here, first just a few questions on the results in the quarter. Did you say how much versus your original expectations in October FX hurts you for the fourth quarter results?", "Steve Holmes", "It was a little. ", "Tom Conforti", "It wasn\u2019t a significant amount. ", "Steve Holmes", "It shouldn\u2019t stand out, as big numbers Patrick.", "Tom Conforti", "So EBITDA growth for the fourth quarter would have been approximately 150 basis points higher if you strip out the effect of foreign exchange. ", "Patrick Scholes \u2013 SunTrust", "Okay. Secondly, in here it looks like part of your earnings beat versus street expectations was in the lodging segment, but you noted in your press release that you did have favorable timing of royalty and marketing expenses. How much did those account for? ", "Steve Holmes", "You know, I don\u2019t know the specific number of the top of my head. I might get that in a second, but what ended up happening was that in 2014 we had been running a surplus \u2013 excuse me, 2013 we had been running a surplus through the first three quarters and the accounting requirement is such that you can\u2019t end the year with a significant surplus. So we ended up booking a big expense in 2013, and our approach in 2014 was different. I think the effect was worth around $5 million to overall EBITDA in the fourth quarter year-over-year. ", "Patrick Scholes \u2013 SunTrust", "Okay, and then one last question on the quarter. I do see here in the non-GAAP statements you had a $27 million hit from an equity investment in the vacation exchange and rental. Can you give us some color on that? ", "Steve Holmes", "The $27 million in exchange in rentals has to do with the sale of Canvas and we also had, we had the minority investment in a small business and that valuation of that business was recast. So those were the two components of it. ", "Patrick Scholes \u2013 SunTrust", "Okay, and then I have two last question here. Can you give us a ballpark estimate of what you expect for EBITDA for Dolce in 2015?", "Tom Conforti", "Its small Patrick. We\u2019re not adding anything in for it frankly. Between the integration cost that we will incur, to bringing the company together, its going to be less than $5 million and I\u2019m not sure exactly at the end of the day how much it will be, but its not much to add. 2016, it will be a more significant contributor. ", "Patrick Scholes \u2013 SunTrust", "Okay, so expect an up-tick from $5 million in 2016 on that. And then last question, have you see it all, any up-tick in incoming U.S. tourism for staying at European hotels or in your Vacation Rental Business and I relate that to the depreciation of the Euro, so anything noticeable with U.S. travelers coming over to Europe in the last couple months?", "Steve Holmes", "No, not specifically. What we\u2019ve seen is the European rental business is starting the year very strong. They are right in line or ahead of our exceptions. And at this point I\u2019ve not a report of whether any of that is driven from US consumers. ", "We are just seeing the bookings coming in. I\u2019m not seeing the source of the bookings at this point. We will see it later, but it has never been a big part of the bookings for rentals in Europe. The dream is the villa in Tuscany, but I don\u2019t know how many Americans actually do that, but it a very common thing for Europeans to do. ", "So, as soon as we know Patrick we\u2019ll tell you how we are doing with U.S. consumers going over to Europe, but at this point I don\u2019t have anything to report. ", "Patrick Scholes \u2013 SunTrust", "Would I guess your expertise and experience and intuition tell you that the vacation rental business in Europe should actually benefit from Europeans being more expensive to go to US so they decide to stay in Europe for the summer? Is that a fair statement?", "Steve Holmes", "I don\u2019t think so. I mean it\u2019s a nice thought, but I don\u2019t think so. I think that frankly the Europeans take more holidays than the Americans do and we pick up a couple of those weeks of holiday from the people we travel with, with our rental product and they may have six weeks. They take two weeks with us and maybe a week is with visiting family and maybe a week is traveling abroad. ", "But we haven\u2019t seen over the years where there\u2019s been ups and downs in consumer confidence and in some of the countries in Europe, as well as volatility in the currency that its had all that much of an impact on our business. And again as I said, we see starting the year strong over there, so we don\u2019t see anything to indicate that even though the euro is way down that it\u2019s impacting. ", "Now could it be because people aren\u2019t planning their international trips, that could be an interesting thought, but my intuition would tell me its probably not having that large of an impact. If anything, within Europe I think it may increase the flow of Brits to continental Europe, because there is a nice arbitrage to the pound to the euro, but for long haul, like coming from the US, I don\u2019t think its going to be that much of an impact.", "Patrick Scholes \u2013 SunTrust", "Great. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you.", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks Patrick.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Chris Agnew with MKM Partners.", "Chris Agnew - MKM Partners", "Thanks very much. Good morning. I wanted to ask about timeshare inventory and I understand that it increased because of timing around year-end, but as you move forward and towards that 60% to 70% capital efficient sourced inventory goal, how should we think about inventory on the balance sheet changing over time. Thanks.", "Steve Holmes", "You know Chris, I think that as we had looked at this going forward that its been our view that we\u2019ll increase inventory spending up to a certain level, not materially different than what we are doing right now and that we\u2019ll manage our inventory balances accordingly. So one would think that that would translate over time to a gradual reduction in the levels of inventory we have in our balance sheet, but remember that the inventory in our balance sheet is comprised of a number of different components and so those components aren\u2019t going to necessarily go away. ", "So I think in the past we\u2019ve talked about the number getting south to $1 billion, maybe $800 million or $900 million at its optimal, but we wouldn\u2019t see it going much beyond that, because again of the components that are sort of fixed components and I\u2019ll remind you that one of the components is the expected return of inventory that we get from our run loss provision and so I think that\u2019s worth about $250 million in and of itself. So we think that it will get \u2013 if we\u2019re running the business optimally, a couple of notches below the $1 billion and that\u2019s where we would settle.", "Chris Agnew - MKM Partners", "Okay, it makes sense, but I mean you\u2019ll be presumably growing EBITDA and its inventory won\u2019t be growing with it essentially.", "Steve Holmes", "We hope to be growing inventory more efficiently as we get bigger.", "Chris Agnew - MKM Partners", "Okay. And then on just a follow up on VPG, and obviously I mean you said guidance is 1% to 3%. You said don\u2019t expect that every quarter, but can you point us to any thoughts to maybe first quarter first half of the year. I think optically it looks like you have some tougher comps in the first quarter and I think you had mentioned before that some of your initiatives were kicking in later in the year, so any color you could give us on what to expect over the next couple of quarters would be great. Thank you.", "Steve Holmes", "Yes well Chris, as you mentioned the comps get easier in the third and fourth quarter just because of what we saw happen this year. So I think that if anything you\u2019d probably see a lower VPG growth in the first quarter, maybe a little bit higher in the second quarter and then better in the third quarter and the fourth quarter probably about the equivalent. ", "So I guess there would be a phasing of kind of low to slight negative in the first quarter moving through positive as we move through the year, but the team is very comfortable with the 1% to 3% that they\u2019ve guided to for the full year.", "Chris Agnew - MKM Partners", "Correct, thank you. And the last question, just on the umbrella marketing campaign, I know you had some major advertising campaign last year. Are you not re-launching but repeating national advertising again this year? What should we expect that you. ", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks Chris. Bigger and better than last year. We will be launching the \u2013 we will be telling our franchisees about the umbrella campaign that we\u2019ll be running this year at our conference in Las Vegas in March. We will also be talking about some changes that we are making to our loyalty program at that time. So yes, great stuff going on in the hotel group. The umbrella campaign this year I think will be terrific. ", "Chris Agnew - MKM Partners", "Thanks a lot. ", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Nikhil Bhalla with FBR. ", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR ", "Hi, good morning Steve and Tom. A quick question on just the tours in the fourth quarter and you might have alluded to this early and sorry if I missed that. Why were the tours lower year-over-year in the fourth quarter or the tour volume?", "Steve Holmes", "Tom Conforti", "Nikhil, its Tom. So we\u2019ve initiated this podium presentation, this specialist presenter model and one of the things that we are working on is ensuring that our ability to put people on tours is strengthened and we made good progress on it in the fourth quarter, but we are still working through insuring that our outreach on this new method of sales pulls people on tour that we want. ", "In my comments I identified that the deficiency in our tours reflected our need to work through. It was related to the upgrade sales. And so we brought in fewer upgrade sales, again as we worked through improving our outreach to people we are taking vacation visits with us to take tours. ", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR ", "Okay, so it\u2019s just a mechanism of how you attract tours that was changed correct?", "Steve Holmes", "How we reach out to our existing owners to come and visit our new specialty presenter presentations.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR ", "Okay, got it. And just on Dolce Hotels overall, Steve can you just talk about how this actually fits in from a strategy standpoint into the current portfolio you have for hotels where there could be some synergies. Where would be the opportunity to actually growth the Dolce brand. How do you see that in the future?", "Steve Holmes", "A couple of different way Nikhil. Dolce is a great brand with great products, it\u2019s a global brand. There is quite a few properties in Europe, as well as what we have in the U.S. But it has been a brand that has been somewhat starved for growth just because of the capital structure that the business was living in before and we fell like we have the opportunity to kind of bring our capabilities to bear, including using capital to help growth the business more quickly as we do in all of our upscale managed property environment with our development advance nodes or key money. So we have the ability to open doors that maybe weren\u2019t opened before with the limitations that Dolce had. ", "On top of that, they have a terrific group sales marketing business as I said before. That\u2019s both an advantage to us and our Wyndham properties, but also advantage to the existing Dolce properties because we have ourselves a good group sales business. So we can kind of expand the group sales effort we have to deliver more for the owners of the Dolce Hotels, as well as for the owners of the Wyndham Hotels.", "So it\u2019s really a win-win on both sides. Both the teams are going to come together and we are going to be in a position to drive a lot more value. The more value proposition we can build, the more people will sign up to become part of the Dolce system and that is part of the \u2013 the kind of secret sauce of how we grow our brands when we bring them together is that the combined whole is more powerful than the individual pieces. ", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR ", "Got it. And just to clarify on your free cash flow guidance for next year, when we look at 2014, your share buybacks kind of total $600 million plus overall. Should we expect share buybacks to be kind of in the same proportion of free cash flow in 2015 as it was 2014? Anything that would take away from that? ", "Tom Conforti", "Yes, as we say every year at this time Nikhil, it all depends on what the M&A prospects look like, what are the other uses of capital for us to grow the business more quickly. We are always looking to deploy capital into the businesses to get them to grow even more quickly than they are growing right now and we\u2019ll continue to look for those opportunity. ", "But if you drew a picture that was the same as 2015 that existed in 2014, then your assumptions should be correct, but it really depends on what opportunities present themselves to us. ", "So we don\u2019t target a share repurchase. We try not to because we don\u2019t know what the future will hold. It\u2019s very hard to kind of model opportunity in the future, so we tend to be opportunistic in that regard, but again we don\u2019t see any reason to paying cash up on the balance sheet. We don\u2019t see any reason to de-lever the company, so if there is cash flow, it will be used to enhance shareholder value.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR ", "Thanks for that Steve and one final question for Tom. Tom, can you just talk a little bit about if you can book in sort of where the CapEx would be in 2015?", "Steve Holmes", "I think we are going to be up $10 million against this year, so I think 245 to 255.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR ", "Perfect, thank you very much.", "Steve Holmes", "240 to 250, let me correct that please.", "Nikhil Bhalla - FBR ", "Okay, 240 to 250. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question today is from Harry Curtis with Nomura.", "Harry Curtis - Nomura Securities", "Hey. Good morning everyone. Just a couple of quick questions. The first is some clarification on the growth of your brands. In looking at the growth of the brands, the hotels that seem to expand the most were kind of barbelled. It was really Wyndham and then Knightsbridge and so as we look further into 2015 and 2016, if you could talk about your strategy, where would you like to see your brands expand the most? ", "Steve Holmes", "Well, we\u2019d love to see all the brands expand very rapidly, but we again have to be flexible and opportunistic about what the market is presenting. We rolled out several new prototypes this year, and are rolling them out at our conference in March to franchisees that we think will engender even greater support from the franchisees and those brands that we are rolling out are Baymont, Days Inn, Super 8, there were five of them. I\u2019m not remembering all of them; I think Hawthorn is another one. ", "So those will have a fresh prototype that will be available for franchisees, either new construction or a conversion. So those are brands that we would like to see grow, because we think the prospects exist for quick grow. ", "A lot of our growth is coming internationally. So when you look at our international markets, most of our brands are represented in most markets, but not all. This year we opened properties in South American markets where we never had those brands before and they now represent new growth prospect. ", "So we don\u2019t go into the year saying we want to see X number of Wyndham\u2019s, X number of Howard Johnson's, X number of Super 8s. We go in with a targeted growth rate and then the sales, the development team then targets very, very tightly regionally what\u2019s available, what fits best into our market. ", "So I\u2019m not answering your question probably the way you would like to have an answer with some specific number for Nights Inn or Days Inn or Super 8, but we really don\u2019t manage the business that way. We manage the business to maximize growth and manage the business to grow with the brands that present themselves with the best opportunities in specific markets.", "Harry Curtis - Nomura Securities", "My second question is really more a clarification on guidance for 2015 and how much incremental improvement that guidance includes, just a lower provision? So in 2014 your provision came down to $260 million. That was down 25%. Does your 2015 guidance anticipate much incremental change in that?", "Tom Conforti", "It doesn\u2019t assume much incremental change at all. It\u2019s pretty flat to what our experience was in 2014.", "Harry Curtis - Nomura Securities", "Okay, so do you think you are at a level now that really reflects kind of a stability for a multi-year period?", "Tom Conforti", "My personal opinion and hopefully Steve and I see it the same way is we\u2019ve made radical improvements. We may have taken the right operational steps Harry to get to a better place. The economies worked in our favor. ", "These things are really hard to project, but we believe that we have an enhanced consumer profile that we\u2019ve identified some operational practices and we\u2019ve arranged credit standards such that there is no reason to believe that things can\u2019t get better, but at this point in time we don\u2019t have any visibility into it and so while we are optimistic about continued improvement right now, we are just guiding to continued strong performance in that metric. ", "Steve, do you see it the same way.", "Steve Holmes", "Dead on.", "Harry Curtis - Nomura Securities", "Great. Well, that does it for me. Thanks.", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks Harry.", "Operator", "Thank you. I will now turn the call over to speakers for closing comments. ", "Steve Holmes", "Okay Wendy, thank you very much and thank you all for being on the call today. We look forward to talking to you on the first quarter report. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. ", "Margo Happer", "Thank you, Shirley. Good morning. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO; and Tom Conforti, our CFO.", "Before we get started, I want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-Q filed February 13, 2015 with the SEC.", "We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these measures to GAAP is provided in the tables to the press release and is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website at wyndhamworldwide.com. Steve?", "Steve Holmes", "Thank you, Margo. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter call. We had another strong quarter with currency neutral adjusted EBITDA growth of 6% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 17%, reflecting sustained operating momentum in each of our businesses and continued benefit from share repurchases. ", "Our Hotel Group achieved double digit adjusted EBITDA growth in the quarter. In our Exchange & Rentals business, we are seeing continued strong growth in rental transaction volume which is building for the summer. In vacation ownership, we grew gross VOI by 3% in constant currency. ", "Finally as you saw from the press release, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance based on the progress of our business which is neutralizing continued FX headwinds and share buyback that support future EPS growth. ", "I will spend a few minutes discussing our operations, then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom for the financial details on the quarter. Let me highlight a few initiatives from our annual strategic planning process that will contribute to our momentum and help us continue to enhance value in the future. ", "Beginning with the Hotel Group. In addition to the technology and marketing initiatives we discussed last quarter, our strategic plan is strongly focused on our brand standards. These efforts have led to growth in our new construction pipeline. Specifically we have seen strong growth in our Wingate by Wyndham brand which is recently ranked as the highest in guest satisfaction within the mid-scale segment by JD Power right up alongside our Microtel brand which retained its leadership position in the economy/budget segment. ", "On the technology front, as we discussed last quarter we are moving away from building in-house systems. Instead we are partnering with best-in-class providers to help ensure our franchisees around the world are utilizing the most technologically advanced systems now and into the future. We are progressing on our plans to migrate over 4500 of our North American franchisees on to Sabre\u2019s cloud based property management system. ", "As part of the property management migration, our economy and mid-scale franchisees will also enjoy the benefits of an integrated revenue management system developed and installed by industry leader Infor. This easy-to-use tool is designed for owners who may have limited revenue management capabilities that allows these owners to efficiently and effectively analyze booking information trends and patterns specific to each hotel on a daily basis. The owner will receive recommendations that can be used to optimize rates based on demand. This level of insight and pricing capability will provide unprecedented value to our franchisees and boost their bottom line. ", "We currently have 21 hotels piloting the property management system which is proceeding as planned. Later this year, we\u2019ll start adding roughly 100 hotels per month, accelerating to about 400 hotels per month until we reach our target. We expect full implementation by late 2016. ", "And on the marketing front, we are seeking to drive growth in our loyalty program. Our 2015 summer umbrella marketing campaign is off to a terrific start. It is linked to the recent relaunch of our Wyndham Rewards program which is designed to leverage the scale of our overall system through a very simple and generous earning and redeeming proposition. While still early in the campaign, initial results saw a 7% increase in loyalty bookings over the same period last year. ", "Award redemptions are up approximately 60%, a great indicator that consumers are not only aware but engaged more than ever with our program. Marketing analysts are calling Wyndham Rewards the most simple and rewarding loyalty program of its kind. We see great potential for our revised loyalty program in the future. ", "Now moving to Exchange & Rentals. Vacation rentals in the sharing economy have been getting a lot of press lately. So I\u2019d like to remind you of our value proposition and what sets us apart. Wyndham Exchange & Rentals is the largest provider of professionally managed unique vacation accommodations in the world, and our mission is to send people on the vacations of their dreams. We do this by providing the right inventory to the right traveler at the right time. ", "Our inventory spans the globe and includes virtually every non-hotel vacation option, literally from houseboats to castles to timeshare. In addition, we provide a wide array of value-added services, not just to guests but also to homeowners in our B2B partners. ", "Our strategic priorities at Wyndham Exchange & Rentals are to leverage our strength across all of our brands, including our technology and analytics expertise, the breadth of our inventory and our distribution capabilities. I spoke on our last call about enhancing our distribution channels through the use of online booking services, such as HomeAway and we have often spoken about analytics and yield management. ", "Equally important to us are analytics around our customers\u2019 preferences. We've been very successful at RCI in customizing member interaction to drive satisfaction and increased member retention. Now we are leveraging these best practices within our rental brands. In doing so, we have the opportunity to drive higher inventory utilization based on large samples of consumer data. For example, we will often work with homeowners across our rental brands on how to tailor their home to achieve maximum occupancy and yield, using our unique knowledge of the individual traveling consumer. We may work with homeowners on how best to remodel their property for rental but just as important on a more modest level, we may also help and determine what amenities to offer or whether to allow pets. ", "We are also able to work with business partners on a larger scale on product development. For example, in our host seasons Holiday Park brand in the UK, we have launched several exclusive niche sub-brands. We package and market resorts under these brands to individual travelers based on their personalized preferences. We also work with the developers on a weekly basis exchanging ideas, expertise and pricing data to drive performance. The result is an all-around win with highly satisfied developers and consumers and higher revenues for us. This is another great example of how the strength of our European rental brands combined with analytics has allowed our businesses to thrive through a choppy European travel market. ", "Now turning to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. Our strategic plan focuses extensively on how to enhance the customer experience and create even more loyal owners. Along those lines, we are pleased with our progress on sales in the second quarter. In addition to making some management changes in key markets, we fine-tuned our sales outreach to owners with a hybrid model that allows for both the traditional and the specialist presenter approaches that we launched last year. This resulted in growth in VOI sales and in adjusted owner tour mix which supported higher VPG. ", "We believe we've had the right tour balance for now between specialist presenter and traditional owner sales with approximately 60% of tours currently in the specialist presenter or group format. Remember that our move to specialist presenter is part of a comprehensive initiative to increase and enhance consumer engagement across our brand, beginning with how we sell our products both potential new owners as well as existing ones. We are doing this now because we want to keep our owners engaged and as importantly keep potential owners eager to engage. We want to ensure we\u2019re positioned to capture the next generation of timeshare buyers. ", "Recent surveys by ARDA have shown that the industry's youngest timeshare owners, those in the millennial and younger Gen X demographics, are highly enthused about the timeshare product. More importantly, the millennial generation is planning on taking significantly greater number of vacations and traveling to destinations where we have an abundance of timeshare product. To support future growth, we will open six new sales centers this year in great locations, such as New York City, St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Las Vegas. Many of these sales centers will be largely committed to driving new owner growth, enabling us to reach potential new timeshare owners of all generations in more locations. We see tremendous upside in the timeshare business. ", "Now let me turn the call over to Tom for details on the quarter\u2019s profit. ", "Tom Conforti", "Thanks, Steve. Good morning everybody. After getting the year off to a good start in the first quarter with strong financial performance, we sustained that momentum in the second quarter with adjusted EBITDA growth of 6% and 17% growth in adjusted EPS on a currency neutral basis. ", "Compared to the second quarter of 2014, foreign exchange reduced revenues by $48 million and adjusted EBITDA by $12 million companywide. We exceeded our EPS guidance reflecting better-than-expected operating results, particularly at vacation ownership, expense timing and share repurchases. ", "We repurchased 1.9 million shares for $165 million during the quarter contributing to a 6% year-over-year decrease in our weighted average diluted share count. Free cash flow for the second quarter was $428 million, flat compared with the second quarter of 2014. ", "Now I want to reiterate my comment from the previous call that we expect free cash flow to be lowered through the first nine months of the year versus 2014, reflecting the timing of inventory purchases and adverse foreign currency comparisons. While FX movements are currently projected to create a $25 million headwind to our year-over-year free cash flow assumptions, we remain committed to our annual neighborhood target of $800 million. ", "Now let\u2019s take a look at the financial performance of each of our business units. Starting with our Hotel Group. Achieved another strong quarter with revenues up 18% and adjusted EBITDA up 11% year-over-year. On a currency neutral basis, excluding the impact of the $4 million benefit from the increase in licensing fee rate the Hotel Group charges our timeshare business and the Dolce Hotels and Resorts acquisition, revenues were up 6%, adjusted EBITDA up 9% and margins were up approximately 100 basis points. Results primarily reflected higher royalties and franchise fees. ", "Now recall that we adjusted the Wyndham brand licensing rate last quarter based on an updated review of market-based pricing. Domestic RevPAR continued to perform well increasing 5% on a same-store basis. Strong overall performance particularly in the Pacific and South Atlantic regions where our franchisees have been able to put through rate increases, was somewhat offset by weaker occupancy performance of our hotels in oil-producing regions. ", "A particular bright spot was the performance of our managed property business. Same-store managed North America RevPAR increased double-digit compared with the same period last year. While our managed portfolio is relatively small, this performance highlights our improved capabilities in this important growth area. ", "System-wide RevPAR was flat largely due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange and the continued unit growth of lower RevPAR hotels in China. Excluding the China effect and in constant currency, global RevPAR grew almost 4%. ", "Our Exchange & Rentals segment continued to perform well. On a currency neutral basis, revenues increased 4% and adjusted EBITDA was up 6%. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2014 included a $3 million loss associated with Canvas Holidays which we sold in 2014. On a currency neutral basis and excluding the impact of acquisitions and the Canvas divestiture, adjusted EBITDA increased 3% reflecting tighter cost management in our RCI brand and growth in Wyndham Vacation Rentals North America. ", "On the exchange side of the business, revenues were flat in constant currency. The average number of members increased 2.2% attributable to new member growth in the Americas. Exchange revenue per member declined 2.7% as a large portion of member growth was from large timeshare clubs whose members generate lower revenue. ", "Vacation rentals revenue for the quarter were up $17 million or 8% in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions and the Canvas divestiture. This increase reflects a 6.1% increase in volume -- transaction volume and a 1.7% increase in the average net price per rental. Transaction growth across all major brands was highlighted by the strength of our Denmark-based Novasol business, our UK cottage and parks business and our Wyndham Vacation Rentals North America business. ", "Results were strong in our vacation ownership business as well. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 5% and gross VOI sales increased 3%. EBITDA was flat on a currency neutral basis and includes a $4 million increase in the licensing fee rate paid to the Wyndham Hotel Group. ", "Now excluding this fee increase, currency neutral EBITDA would have increased by 2% as improvements in gross VOI sales and the provision rate were partially offset by higher sales related costs. Net VOI sales were up 9% or 11% in constant currency, reflecting a lower loan-loss provision and a 4.4% increase in VPG net of currency, partially offset by a 1% decline in tour flow. ", "Sales and VPG benefited from a favorable product mix resulting in higher yields and from transaction side in addition to the points that Steve mentioned earlier. The provision for loan loss was $60 million while write-offs were also $60 million, maintaining our reserve balance on gross receivables at around 17.5%. ", "You may also note that WAAM fee-for-service commissions declined on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter. Now this is part of our continued plan to shift WAAM development to the just-in-time model which increases total revenues and EBITDA by allowing us to finance the consumer loan receivables and benefit from the great spread that we earn on our portfolio. We expect this trend to continue consistent with our plans. ", "In addition, the ABS market remains robust. We just completed our second ABS term note transaction of the year on July 15. The $275 million Sierra 2015-2 transaction added 2.56% weighted average coupon and a 90% advance rate. ", "So finally let's turn to guidance which will be posted on the website after the call. As you saw from the press release, we are increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance $0.07 for the full year and diluted share count goes to 120.2 million shares, reflecting the benefit of our second-quarter repurchases and a 25 basis point reduction in our full-year tax rate to 36.5%. ", "Total company as well as business unit revenues and adjusted EBITDA guidance remain all unchanged. However we are fine tuning our driver guidance as follows: 2015 RevPAR guidance is now 2% to 4%, down from 4% to 6%. Now this reflects an approximate 200 basis point change in foreign exchange from our original guidance assumptions. At this time we believe we will be at the lower end of that range due largely to the loss of the Center City hotel that was purchased by Hilton. The hotel had an outsized impact on RevPAR but produced insignificant royalties relative to our overall system. ", "Remember that a 100-basis point change in RevPAR in general only impacts our EBITDA by $2.5 million to $3.5 million for the full year. For WVO, we believe we will be at the lower end of the 1% to 3% tour flow range. We will post an updated guidance schedule to the website following the call. ", "For the third quarter, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.65 to $1.68. In Exchange & Rentals, know that the now divested Canvas Holidays brand had an $18 million EBITDA contribution in the third quarter of 2014. In addition, our Hotel Group benefited from the signing of a co-branded credit card agreement with a third-party amounting to $4 million of additional EBITDA in quarter three -- excuse me \u2013 2014. ", "We expect interest expense in the third quarter of approximately $32 million, slightly higher than our current run rate reflecting the early termination of interest rate swaps in the second quarter. For now our full year interest expense guidance remains unchanged but please be aware that depending on market conditions we may decide the issue some date later in the year. If that's the case, we will update guidance accordingly at that time. ", "Finally, remember that we don't assume future repurchases in our EPS guidance. In addition, year-over-year 2015 third-quarter EBITDA comparisons reflect projected unfavorable currency headwind of $13 million. ", "To close, we are pleased with our first half and are looking forward to continued progress for the remainder of the year. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve. Steve?", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks, Tom. Next week will mark our nine-year anniversary of listing on the NYSE. Before opening the call to questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to comment on our performance since that time. ", "Our strong operating results, execution and growth have driven significant increases in EBITDA, revenues, EPS and free cash flow. Between dividend and share repurchases, we have returned $5 billion to our shareholders. To put that in perspective, our market cap at the time of our IPO was $6 billion. ", "Our total shareholder return since listing, including dividends, is more than double that of the S&P 500. And we still have a tremendous \u2013 we have tremendous potential ahead of us. We see great opportunities to generate growth and value across all of our businesses and we remain keenly focused on capitalizing on those opportunities. We recently completed our eighth strategic planning process since we launched as a public company and this latest was filled with more opportunity than any I have seen before. I am proud of what we've accomplished but more importantly, I'm really excited about what lies ahead. ", "And now Shirley will open the line for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.", "Joe Greff ", "Good morning, guys. As you guys know from making the rounds at conferences and talking with investors, vying for a guest has been a pretty important metric to follow here and you guys obviously executed with some nice results here which was good to see. Can you talk about what you are actually seeing from the customers' perspective migrating or moving toward this hybrid model? Are you seeing greater success in new potential timeshare buyers or existing? And you may have said this and maybe I missed this, but can you talk about how many sales offices you have left to convert to this hybrid model? And then I have a follow-up. ", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks Joe. Well first of all, VPG is a heavily talk-about metric but as we said multiple times it is not a consistent metric. It does move around. So we\u2019ve had quarters where it\u2019s been up dramatically, down dramatically. We think for the full year it will pace on what we think it will be but again we don't \u2013 just so we are consistent even when we have an up quarter, we don't put too much \u2013 we won\u2019t want to put too much in that one particular metric without looking at everything else. But having said that, just to be clear the hybrid model is a hybrid between the way we previously marketed for our in-house guests which are our existing owners and this new specialist presenter model. So it really \u2013 that doesn\u2019t \u2013 this new specialist presenter model doesn\u2019t really touch the new owners as much as it does the old owners. We still do group presentations for new owners. So it\u2019s not dissimilar but when we talk about specialist presenter and the marketing impact it has, we are really talking about the impact it has for our in-house customers, people staying at our resorts. That\u2019s what we were trying to solve for is a better approach to the customer, a better experience for the consumer who already owns timeshare and is staying at our resort. And that's where we\u2019ve made the changes. ", "Relative to how many are left to do, we\u2019re basically done. We think we\u2019re at about a 60% rate of specialist presenter now for our in-house guests. We think that\u2019s about the right balance. We will probably stay there and see how things track. We could go up, could go down a little bit but we like what we\u2019re getting out of that model right now. So we really don't have a lot more to roll out on that side. ", "Joe Greff ", "And when you look back at the 2Q, what percentage was new versus existing sales? And then, Tom, you had mentioned about the adjustment to the RevPAR growth drivers. How much was the impact related -- the rollout of the impact related to the loss of that one city center hotel? And that\u2019s all for me. Thanks, guys. ", "Steve Holmes", "Okay. I will take the first one. I\u2019ll let Tom talk about the RevPAR piece. We are running about two-thirds, one-third upgrade to new owners. That\u2019s the pace that we are on right now. Tom, RevPAR?", "Tom Conforti", "RevPAR, Joe, that Center City hotel was worth a little under 100 basis points impact for us.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.", "Steven Kent ", "Hi good morning. Just to follow up on Joe's question more specifically, do you expect VPG to be positive for the balance of the year and if there is any changes or what could move that around? It obviously does move around quite a bit probably more than all of us would like but just give us a sense for that. And then the second question is, could you just talk about if you are seeing or hearing anything from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau looking into timeshare practices, whether that\u2019s one of the agencies that could have oversight of your business? And also if you are seeing any inquiries from any other agencies as to timeshare lending? ", "Steve Holmes", "Okay. Thanks, Steve for those questions. We do expect VPG to be positive going forward and we appreciate the lack of comfort with the movements in VPG. I just will remind everyone and again we\u2019ve said this before, we are constantly changing our marketing programs. We are moving our sales incentives around because we have a very large global sales force that\u2019s selling timeshare that we\u2019re constantly trying to make -- to optimize as best we can, so there will be some volatility in there. It\u2019s just the nature of the beast and we shouldn\u2019t be surprised by that. We may not like it but we shouldn\u2019t be surprised by it. ", "As for the Consumer Finance Protection Board, they are -- I know that they came out with something that said that in October they will be providing more guidance on consumer lending and included in that is timeshare but we have not heard anything specifically about that. We think that everything we\u2019re doing and we believe \u2013 we are constantly looking at this from a regulatory standpoint is absolutely straight up the middle of the fairway. And so we don't see any impact from that but we haven't seen \u2013 if they are coming out with something new, it\u2019d be news to us. And you also asked, do we see any other regulators coming in and creating issues? No, we don't. We are happy and pleased to see some of the prosecution effort against people who are bad players in the timeshare industry. We used to talk about the cease and desist issue that we had, the guy who was leading that cease and desist effort was recently found guilty and was sentenced. His sentencing was I think 25 years. So that is a big time deterrent we believe to people who want to play badly in our industry. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Agnew with MKM Partners.", "Chris Agnew ", "Thanks very much, good morning. A couple of questions on vacation rental. Observation that the last couple of years pricing appears to be much stronger in the second half of the year. And I was just wondering how seasonality helps your yield management efforts if you could talk a little bit about that? And then on European demand trends in vacation rental, there has been a little bit of commentary that Europeans are booking shorter stays this year. I was just wondering if you have seen any evidence of this in your vacation rental bookings for the summer period? ", "Steve Holmes", "Well, thanks and your observation on the rental rate that we\u2019re getting is accurate because of the time of year. There is seasonality to this business and clearly the summer is the biggest time and so there is more ability to move rate when you have higher demand in the market. So that absolutely is a fair observation. ", "As for the second question which was about the shorter stays. I have not heard that and honestly I have to go back and look to see \u2013 I have not heard our vacation rental group say anything about the duration of stays being an issue and it hasn\u2019t popped up as a metric that\u2019s moved internally. And I certainly did not see that in the strategic plan that we reviewed with them. So I would say probably not there, Chris, but we\u2019ll certainly get back to you with an answer on that. ", "Chris Agnew ", "And then one more question just on acquisition pipeline, lodging and maybe vacation rental, can you touch on that? Thank you. ", "Steve Holmes", "Well, as we said before we are constantly on the prowl and constantly looking in both rental \u2013 you hit the two areas that we are working \u2013 in rental and lodging we are looking at opportunities. We will only do deals that make sense for our company obviously and we are disciplined but we do do a lot of work. We have an active M&A group internally that works on these opportunities and some of them are way below the radar screen, they\u2019re just small deals that we do in the rental businesses, both domestic and internationally. ", "On the hotel side, if we have anything to talk about, we certainly will bring it forth and we\u2019re constantly looking at opportunities. And then you asked about the pipeline, for acquisitions I think that\u2019s the way you phrase the question. I\u2019d say the pipeline probably is a little bit stronger than it\u2019s been but also expectations are pretty darn high. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust.", "Patrick Scholes ", "Can you talk a little bit about your domestic RevPAR growth? When I compare it to what the travel would have suggested, it definitely was the lower and I know you have the Hilton Hotel in there. Do you think it\u2019s time for a major refresh of some of the brands in the magnitude that Comfort Inn is currently going over or that InterCon did a couple of years ago with their Holiday Inn? ", "Steve Holmes", "Yeah, well thanks for that question, Patrick. It actually is not -- I don't think that we are pushing a reset button on our brand. In fact, some of our brands like I mentioned, Microtel and Wingate are getting JD Powers awards for best appreciated by consumers. So I don't think we\u2019re at the point of hitting a reset like we did with Ramada frankly many years ago. We are, however, very very focused on enforcing our brand standards. We did during the downturn. We did show flexibility with our franchisees and were not as diligent possibly or as aggressive in terminating properties that fell below standards. We gave them more time to fix the problem just out of the fact that we knew that their cash flow wasn\u2019t as strong, so it takes money to fix fiscal problems. So we were more flexible. We are much less flexible now and I would say that we will be -- continue to be much less flexible going forward. We think now is the time when the industry is doing well that people should be reinvesting in their properties and we see that happening. I went down to a what we call a franchise advisory council which was for all of our brands recently and there were probably 150, 200 people in the room franchisees who were the franchise leaders for each one of the brands. And the thing I heard most strongly from our franchisees was make sure you keep on the quality of their fellow franchisees and so that is something that we had dedicated ourselves to and which we are reinforcing. And so I think we can get a lift just from the sheer fact that we are going to remove some of the weaker players in the market. And that is something that we\u2019re very very focused on. ", "As for RevPAR compared to industry, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re much different than the economy sector. If you\u2019re looking at the luxury or upper up-scale segment, yes, we won't go down as much. We probably won\u2019t go up as much as they do. So we\u2019re probably a more stable play there but we feel that we are performing well and we track our RevPAR indexes and as Tom said on the managed properties, we saw a great uptick, double digit uptick in RevPAR at the managed properties. So we\u2019re feeling pretty good about where we are and how our brands are performing. We think that the loyalty program will give a great lift to this but it\u2019s going to take a little time for that to build. So it\u2019s probably a 2016 and beyond impact period. ", "Patrick Scholes ", "Thank you for the explanation. Two more questions here. Just a little more color on the 2.7% decline in exchange revenue per member, I would have thought that would have been better than that considering lower gas prices and sort of reemergence of the middle class here. What was driving that decline? ", "Tom Conforti", "Yes, Patrick, it\u2019s largely related to the composition of our exchange membership now increasingly going to clubs and people who are part of larger timeshare systems typically pay a lower membership fee and transact less. So that\u2019s all it really is, it's sort of an ongoing phenomenon. ", "Steve Holmes", "Yes, you saw \u2013 to your point, Patrick, we did see an uptick in the members. So there are people, are out there traveling and they are traveling in good numbers and they are being converted into timeshare owners. But as Tom said it\u2019s a mix issue. ", "Patrick Scholes ", "And then lastly, on the property management systems you discussed for the hotels, who pays for that? Is that mostly the franchisees? And if you are paying for it, how much -- or part of it how much are we talking here? ", "Steve Holmes", "It\u2019s not significant. We actually negotiated deal with Sabre and Infor where the franchisees are basically getting the system for the same thing they were paying before. So we were able to make it a net neutral to them which is really terrific. They are getting a better system, they\u2019re getting a lot more capability and particularly this yield management system for the economy hotels. They\u2019ve never really utilized that before. So we think that, that will have a great impact. That will take a little \u2013 that will be rolled out but in my opinion it will take a little longer to effectuate because these owners are not accustomed to working in that kind of an environment like a large full service hotel would naturally do. So we think that this will have a big impact going forward but probably a little bit more of a delayed reaction than some of the other things that we\u2019re implementing in the Hotel Group. ", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura.", "Harry Curtis ", "Good morning, everyone. A quick question that\u2019s really a bit more broad on the health of the consumer. When we look at the flattish tour flow and then the somewhat softer RevPAR guidance, what would be interesting is your assessment on whether the consumer in your view is a little stronger as we head into the back half of 2015 or a little bit weaker? ", "Steve Holmes", "That\u2019s kind of a tough question, Harry. I think that \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t attribute anything to our RevPAR guidance to the consumer because those two factors as Tom mentioned that are impacting it are simply the FX and the fact that we lost this hotel in San Francisco believe it or not it\u2019s large enough and big enough that it does have \u2013 it does move the needle on RevPAR. That I don't think at all -- obviously that doesn\u2019t move in the consumer's direction at all. The tour flow is really a reaction to how we are staffed and how many tours we want to take. One of the things our review showed during this last few months is that we may have been providing too many tours to our salespeople and that might sound counterintuitive. But if you provide too many tours, then the natural reaction of the salesperson is well the next guy is going to be more likely to buy than the one I have right now, so let me move on to the one. And that's understandable as the natural reaction and -- but it's not necessarily the right reaction because if we go through the process with an individual, we should see the close rate be about what we historically have experienced.", "Now going to the health of the consumer, while we are talking about close rate, we actually saw an improvement in the close rate in timeshare and that is something, it\u2019s another metric that we track and it works its way into VPG but that kind of is an indication of how this consumer is feeling. And so if anything as you\u2019re going to feel stronger in the second half of the year, I don\u2019t know, he felt pretty strong in the second quarter to us. Is he going to feel stronger, I'm not sure. It\u2019s a great question, it\u2019s a difficult one to answer because my crystal ball is only so good. ", "Harry Curtis ", "Okay. Well we will maybe revisit it in three months. Second question or last question rather is going back to your expansion in your managed hotels. Can you talk about how competitive the process is to get one of your brands on a managed hotel and whether or not or to what degree you are either providing key money or mezz financing to win that or are the economics really appealing without having to lift your investment? ", "Steve Holmes", "It\u2019s a mixture of both, Harry. We do use key money or development advances whatever you want to call it, and in some cases, we don't. We go on just the pitch of what we can bring to the hotels. So it is a mixed bag. I would probably say more of them have development advances and don\u2019t \u2013 but that\u2019s kind of the standard for this \u2013 that segment in the upper up-scale, upscale level where we\u2019re doing the management of properties. But yes, the results that we are seeing are in part the fact that I think we are doing a good job managing. We also have flipped properties into our brands and the brands are bringing good RevPAR lift and again we are watching all of these versus the kind of the index -- versus the market in which they are competing in which is really, when you look at it how you judge, how a property \u2013 an individual property is doing. ", "But just going back on your question about the health of the consumer. The one thing I would point to is \u2013 and we\u2019re not going to get granular with what July looks like as we are only slowly 27 days into it. But in both the timeshare and the hotel world, we\u2019re seeing pretty good reaction from the consumer. So again just trying to give you a glimpse, so now you don\u2019t have to wait three months, you only have to wait two months \u2013 I am telling you July is looking like consumer is relatively strong, and the same is also true in Europe with our rental businesses. ", "Harry Curtis ", "That\u2019s really helpful. Just a quick follow-up on that comment. As you look into the summer months, what kind of pricing power is built into your guidance for the summer months rentals in Europe? ", "Steve Holmes", "Healthy because we\u2019re tracking on \u2013 we\u2019re tracking with a fairly good increase in pricing for last year and the first half of this year. So we\u2019re kind of continuing that trend of pricing. So we feel pretty good about the European rental business. ", "End of Q&A", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the speakers for closing comments. ", "Steve Holmes", "Thank you very much, Shirley and thank you everybody for joining us today. Remember to tune into the Wyndham Championship August 20th through 23rd on the Golf Channel and CBS and enjoy the rest of your summer. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "I will now turn the call over to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Margo Happer", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO; and Tom Conforti, our CFO.", "Before we get started, I want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K filed February 13, 2015 with the SEC.", "We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these measures to GAAP is provided in the tables to the press release. It is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website at wyndhamworldwide.com. Steve?", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks, Margo. Good morning and thank you for joining us. As you saw from the release, we posted a strong close to a great year. Looking forward, we are excited about what lies ahead in 2016 which we believe will be a great year for leisure travel.", "With the wide range of places to stay, Wyndham Worldwide is uniquely positioned to welcome people to travel the way they want and where they want. This gives us great confidence in our prospects and is reflected in our Board's decision to raise our quarterly dividend by 19%, and increase our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion.", "Tom will focus on fourth quarter results but first let me summarize the year which was terrific from both an operational and a financial perspective.", "On a constant currency basis and excluding acquisitions and a divestiture, we grew revenue 6% and adjusted EBITDA 8% in 2015. On the same basis, adjusted EPS grew 17% reflecting strong operating performance across the company supported by our share repurchase program.", "Wyndham Hotel Group achieved 11% adjusted EBITDA growth on a constant currency basis excluding acquisitions and including the increase license fee paid by Wyndham vacation ownership or 7% excluding the fee. We successfully acquired and integrated Dolce, which significantly enhanced our presence in the managed hotel space and is performing better than our expectations.", "We also developed and launched a new cloud based strategy for our property management and central reservation systems. Finally we introduced The Wyndham Wizard to millions of consumers and made great progress on our new award winning Wyndham awards loyalty program.", "Wyndham Rewards is one of the threads that weave Wyndham Worldwide together driving a powerful marketing and value proposition to consumers across our travel brands.", "The newly named Wyndham Destination Network formerly known as Wyndham Exchange & Rentals grew adjusted EBITDA 6% on a constant currency basis excluding acquisitions and a divestiture. We are moving to a more expensive vision of the business which combine offerings from our vacation rental and timeshare exchange brands to enable our Wyndham Worldwide customer base to experience vacation of their dreams.", "With rising awareness of the sharing economy and increasing consumer demand for unique places to stay, we believe this new strategy will drive higher customer engagement and higher growth in years to come.", "Our portfolio of managed vacation rental brands posted great results in 2015. While some of our largest European vacation rental competitors had declines in vacation volume in 2015, all our brands both in Europe and the U.S. posted transaction increases enabling us to achieve transaction growth on organic basis of 7%. And RCI also had a strong year netting 66,000 to their average member account.", "Wyndham Vacation ownership had a great year with growth and timeshare sales up 5% in constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA was up 6% in constant currency and including the additional license fee paid to Wyndham Hotel Group for 8% excluding that fee.", "With a focus on the next generation of timeshare owners, we improved our sales process to enhance customer engagement and drive future growth. We opened six new sales centers to expand our reach for new owners and changes to our underwriting standards continued to benefit EBITDA through lower loan losses, while innovative methods for sourcing inventory reduced our cost of goods sold.", "So with all those 2015 achievements behind us, let's talk in more detail about some of the initiatives that will fuel our growth in the coming years. I'll begin with Wyndham Hotel Group. We expect to drive growth through renewed focus on improving the quality of our brands, redefining what technology means for economy in midscale hotels, and continuing to differentiate with our Wyndham Awards loyalty program.", "Our goals are to increase our value proposition to both our hotel owners and guests and to drive higher contribution across the portfolio. The migration of our central reservation and property management systems are on schedule and are being well received by owners and franchisees alike.", "The new cloud-based property management system with automated revenue management capabilities is now running in over 200 of our North American Hotels. By the end of year, we expect to have transitioned over 3,000 hotels to the new system, which is being operated and maintained and will be enhanced in new years ahead by a technology leaders such as Sabre and Infor.", "In addition, we successfully transitioned the TRYP by Wyndham brand to our new Sabre-enabled central reservation system and we're already seeing a lift in our reservation contribution for the TRYP brand even during the short time the new system has been in place. We're looking forward rolling it out to our Wyndham brand later this year and the remaining brands through 2017.", "Last quarter I was pleased to announce that U.S. News & World Report named Wyndham Rewards, one of the top loyalty programs in the hotel industry jumping from seventh to second place. More recently, our Wyndham Rewards program received two Best in Show Platinum Awards from Loyalty360, a well known loyalty marketing association with members from across a wide range of industries.", "These acolytes our reflection of the innovative and dedicated work of our team, which has created a program that is less complex and more rewarding than any other. And our franchisees have never been more engaged with property direct enrollments up over 30% since program launched.", "Our recently introduced Go Fast program where consumers use points plus cash first day has been a great success with over 300,000 room nights booked through the program last year. We expect Wyndham Rewards members to drive over $2 billion of revenue to our hotel owners this year, delivering guest who stay more often and stay longer than non-members.", "Now turning to Wyndham Destination Network. As discussed on last quarter's call, we changed the name from Wyndham Exchange & Rentals to reflect our standing as the world's largest provider of professionally-managed unique vacation accommodations. Anything from cottages to castles to timeshare resorts.", "We continue to see momentum in our rental brands which strengthen our core customer source markets, which are the U.K., Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany and the U.S. Despite new entrants into the rental market, we've seen little impact in the competitive landscape. With the strength of our brands and the depth and breadth of our offerings, we provide a great value proposition to both homeowners and travelers. These attributes enables us to be largely insulated from economic as well as geopolitical risks and produce reliable consistent results.", "Last year we bolstered our strong proprietary distribution network through global partnerships with online portal such as HomeAway and Booking.com. We'll continue to pursue the strategy in 2016. We have local presence and global average, which provides strong advantages compared with the full rent by owner option in the same channels.", "Providing the wide distribution for a property owners has been a primary strategy for the Wyndham Destination Network and it's working. For example, \"Know This All\", our Danish brand now sources renters from over 80 countries, that's up from 50 countries just 18 months ago.", "Now, let's look at RCI. This brand continues to perform well driven by a long tradition of innovation. Over the past few years, we've introduced enhanced membership options and several new products that add convenience and flexibility to RCI membership. Last year we launched additional new products that strengthened our members' ability to enhance their trading options.", "All told, the products we've introduced since 2010 added approximately $50 million to annual revenues in 2015. We're working on the next generation of RCI.com and look forward to updating you on our plans in the near future.", "Of course we continue to expand our global network at RCI, for example RCI recently added a new flagship affiliation with Tokyu Corporation in Japan, adding five great resorts in popular Japanese destinations.", "RCI is by far the biggest timeshare exchange brand in the world and its international footprint is clearly a distinguishing strength. With over 4,000 resorts worldwide to choose from, RCI provides tremendous value to its members and we expect to further expand our network in 2016.", "Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership which had another outstanding year with strong VOI sales growth. Last quarter we discussed how all indications are pointing to strong long term trends in the U.S. leisure travel market from millennials to boomers. We also highlighted our efforts to set the stage for increased sales by opening new sales centers in New York City, St. Thomas, Puerto Rico, Southern California, Colorado and Las Vegas, along with new affiliation agreements.", "We're pleased with the early progress and performance of these initiatives and have recently taken additional organizational steps to best position our vacation ownership business for future expansion. Our goal is to drive consistent and profitable sales, sales growth with tighter more focused operating regions.", "We believe this focus will help us intensify the process we started a couple of years ago to evolve timeshare sales and marketing to ensure our customer friendly buying experience and to drive future growth.", "Let me remind you the primary initiatives, most of which we previously discussed. First we introduced and refined a group presentation sales format for new and existing owners ensuring that our best sales people are in front of our customers using a proven uniform method of telling a consistent story and producing sales.", "Second, for owners who have benefited from our product for many years but are no longer actively using it, we designed a suite of programs to enable them to gracefully exit their ownership. We broadly call this program \u201cOvation by Wyndham\u201d. It is how we applaud owners who have experienced years of great travel memories but whose needs and circumstances have changed.", "Finally, we improved the buying experience for consumers. We implemented enhanced sales training and compliance programs and we bolstered our quality assurance regime on the contract enclosed process which now includes videotaping.", "We\u2019re also streamlining our documentation process to make it more transparent and easier to understand for the consumer. We\u2019re piloting a program to bring greater clarity to the sales by providing contractual documents and program information in a digital format on a preloaded tablet.", "We give buyers the tablet rather than a thick owners kit enabling them to enjoy easier access to important materials regarding their purchase and use of our products. We made great progress in these initiatives over the past two years and will continue our focus in the future.", "With our new sales centers, strong affiliation agreements and enhanced sales and marketing operations, we\u2019re looking forward to generating substantial long term sales growth within our vacation ownership business.", "The opportunities in timeshare, a business with strong economics are robust. To capture these opportunities, we are targeting 35,000 new owners in 2016, about a 15% increase over 2015, so 35,000 in 2016. We expect to achieve these through increased tours primarily from new marketing alliances and the new sales offices we have opened in the past 18 months.", "We will also slightly increase financing to credit worthy new buyers through lower down payment requirements. We look forward to updating you on our progress.", "Before turning over the call to Tom, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook. Stock market volatility aside, the operating dynamics we see across this company looks strong for 2016. The geographic and demographic diversity of our offerings, the resiliency of our fee for service revenue streams, the scalability of our businesses and our proven track record of strong execution provide a stable base from which to grow. It\u2019s a powerful combination.", "Now let me turn the call over to Tom to walk through the fourth quarter and what we expect in detail in 2016. Tom?", "Tom Conforti", "Thanks Steve, good morning everyone. As Steve noted 2015 was a very good year for Wyndham Worldwide despite the fact that foreign exchange negatively affected year-over-year adjusted EBITDA by $46 million and created significant headwinds throughout the year.", "ABS in foreign exchange effect on EBITDA, we would have ended the year at the top of our long term guidance range. We also enjoyed a strong fourth quarter. On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions and a divesture, revenue increased 6% and adjusted EBITDA increased 8%.", "We also enjoyed a very strong year in cash flow generation. Free cash flow for 2015 was $769 million compared with $749 million for the 12 months of 2014. This was within our neighborhood target range of $800 million. Remember that foreign exchange reduced free cash flow in 2015 by approximately $43 million. So on a constant currency basis, free cash flow in 2015 was $812 million and 8% increase over 2014 growing in line with currency neutral adjusted EBITDA.", "The increase reflects stronger operating results and lower capital expenditures. In addition, you might recall from last quarter's call that we sold land and work-in progress in Wyndham Just In Time transaction for $65 million in cash. So we are not technically apart of the definition of free cash flow. It did at to overall cash flow for the company and was available to support our capital allocation decisions.", "During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for $165 million and over the course of the year we repurchased 7.9 million shares for $650 million, reducing our full-year weighted average share count by over 6%. In addition, we've repurchased 1.6 million shares for a $107 million so far in 2016.", "Now let's take a look at the performance of each of our business units. Our Hotel Group had a strong fourth quarter, capping off a terrific year. On an apples-to-apples basis, which excludes the effective currency, the increased inter segment licensing fee that hotel receives from Wyndham Vacation Ownership and the Dolce acquisitions.", "Fourth quarter revenues increased 6% and adjusted EBITDA increased 10%. Results reflect an increase in royalty in hotel management fees as well as growth in our Wyndham Rewards Credit Card program.", "Same-store domestic RevPAR increased 4.4% reflecting the ability of our owners to increase room rates as hotel occupancy was relatively flat. We achieved this growth despite continued pressure on our RevPAR growth in the oil producing markets, which as defined by STR mainly includes parts of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and West Virginia.", "To put this in the perspective, RevPAR in the non-oil producing markets grew 7.5% where as RevPAR in the oil producing markets was down 27.9%. We were especially pleased with the performance of our managed portfolio where domestic same-store RevPAR was up 7% from the prior year.", "The performance of our FelCor upper upscale Wyndham portfolio was particularly strong with the 9% increase in RevPAR year-over-year. System-wide RevPAR was flat in constant currency, largely due to the continued unit growth of lower RevPAR hotels in China. Excluding China and in constant currency, global RevPAR was up 1.6% which includes a 240 basis point unfavorable impact from domestic and Canadian oil markets.", "Overall, net system size grew 2.6%. For the year, gross room openings of nearly 66,000 were offset by over 48,000 terminations, most of which we consider to be sub standard. The result is continually improving system quality. Our development pipeline is over 119,000 rooms, a 2.2% increase over the prior year.", "Our Destination Network segment continued to perform well. Note that adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2014 included a $6 million operating loss from Canvas Holidays, a U.K. based camping brand that we sold late in 2014. On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, the Canvas Holiday's divestiture, revenue increased 5% and adjusted EBITDA increase 9%.", "Results reflect growth in our portfolio of brands, particularly at our RCI and Denmark-based Novasol brands. EBITDA also benefited from the receipt of settlements of business disruption claims related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010.", "At RCI, exchange revenue increased 1% in constant currency. The average number of members increased 0.7% attributable to continued new member growth in the Americas. Exchange revenue per member was flat as pricing increases offset the growth in lower transacting club members. Vacation rentals revenue for the quarter was up 8% in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions in the Canvas divestiture.", "That increase reflects an 8.1% increase in transaction volume and flat average net price per rental. Transaction growth occurred in all significant brands and regions. Both pricing and transaction volume were aided by our dynamic pricing initiatives.", "Fourth quarter results for our vacation ownership were also solid with revenues up 7% and adjusted EBITDA up 5% in constant currency and excluding a $4 million increase in the licensing fee rate paid to the Hotel Group.", "Reflecting our emphasis on sales growth, gross VOI sales were up 9% in constant currency in the fourth quarter of 2015. That growth reflected a 3.4% increase in VPG, and a 4.7% increase in tour flow. VPG benefited from higher transaction sizes and tour flow increased primarily due to the new sales centers that Steve mentioned earlier.", "The performance of the consumer loan portfolio remained solid. The provision for loan loss was $64 million compared to $60 million in the fourth quarter of last year -- of 2014, primarily reflecting higher sales volumes in the quarter.", "For the full year, the provision for the loan loss was right in line with write-offs. In write offs were approximately 2% in the fourth quarter and approximately 7.5% for the full year, reasonably consistent with the results in the same periods of 2014.", "Company-wide net interest expense increased by $10 million in the fourth quarter over the same period in 2014, reflecting the $350 million, 5.1% bonds issued in September in the absence of the fixed to floating interest rates swap that we unwound during the second quarter of 2015.", "Now, let's turn to our 2016 outlook and guidance. As a reminder, we are going to post full guidance details to our investor relations website following the call.", "Revenue guidance for 2016 is $5.8 billion to $5,950 million. Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2016 is $1,375 million to $1,400 million. As usual, we are most comfortable with the mid-point of these ranges. Today's guidance is based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31 2015, which reflects $10 million of an adverse intact on our 2016 EBITDA assumptions.", "While the calculated EBITDA growth range for 2016 is 6% to 8%. Please take note that in constant currency, we are expecting 2016 EBITDA growth of 7% to 9%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2016 is $5.46 to $5.60. We expect a diluted share count of 116 million shares, which per our standard guidance practice assumes no share buybacks in 2016.", "Now, let's take a quick look at guidance for each of our business units. Starting with the Hotel Group, we expect another strong year. We expect revenues of $1,355 million to $1,390 million. We expect room growth of 2% to 4% and global RevPAR growth of flat to up 2% or 1% to 3% in constant currency, which does incorporate 3% to 5% domestic RevPAR growth.", "Note that our January RevPAR was directionally in line with industry reports and we expect RevPAR to be below our annual guidance range in the first quarter reflecting the Easter Holiday shift and a strong first quarter 2015 comparison. We expect Hotel Group adjusted EBITDA will be $397 million to $407 million.", "At Destination Network, we expect revenues of $1,570 million to $1,615 million and adjusted EBITDA of $378 million to $388 million. We expect the average number of exchange members to be flat to up 2% and exchange revenue per member to be flat or up 1% to 3% in constant currency.", "We expect vacation rental transactions to grow 5% to 7% and average net price per rental to decline 1% to 3% primarily reflecting foreign exchange.", "For vacation ownership, we expect revenues of $2.9 billion to $2,980 million and adjusted EBITDA of $728 million to $754 million.", "Our key metric, gross VOI sales is expected grow 5% to 7% reflecting tour growth of 3% to 5% and flat to plus 2% VPG growth. As Steve noted earlier, we intend to increase our new owner target this year, which will have a dampening effect on VPG. This will be more than offset by higher tours.", "Company-wide we expect corporate expenses of $135 million to $140 million consistent with 2015. We expect depreciation and amortization to be $245 million to $250 million as additional capital projects come online. We expect interest expense of a $131 million to $133 million, which assumes no new debt issuances in 2016.", "Interest expense is higher than 2015 primarily due to the $350 million, 5.1% bond we issued last September and the elimination of the fixed-to-floating rate swapped that was in place for five months in 2015. Now, we will be considering ways throughout the year to reduce interest expense further.", "We expect the modestly higher rate of securitization activity in 2016, but rates will be comparable. The market appears to be strong and while spreads, maybe widening a bit, benchmarks are lower.", "Our neighborhood target for 2016 free cash flow remains $800 million. As Steve discussed earlier, we expect to increase financing to credit worthy consumers to drive new owner growth; which will have an adverse short-term impact on cash, but which we believe is a great investment in the business.", "Also as always, keep in mind that there were can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter or any given year. So we view $800 million as a neighborhood target rather than an exact figure. Our business produces abundant free cash flow roughly $7 a share this year, which represents a compounded growth rate of 13% since 2010.", "Our capital allocation philosophy is to invest in the business and then return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.", "ABS in M&A opportunities, you can expect we'll return at least $600 million to shareholders this year through share repurchases. In addition based on the board's decision to increase our annual dividend to $2 per share, we will return another $230 million to shareholders through dividend payments.", "Now turning to the first quarter, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.08 to a $1.11 and remember that we don't budget repurchases into our guidance. To close, we are very pleased with our performance in 2015 and are looking forward to a very strong 2016.", "And with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve. Steve?", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks, Tom. As I said earlier, we are confident that we will continue to grow and generate significant value for our shareholders. Our confidence rests on the diversity of our products, the resiliency of our model, and most importantly the strength of our 38,000 person global team members. They have done a great job of delivering results and driving shareholder value for close to 10 years now. On behalf of all of us, thank you for your continued support and confidence. We will work hard to earn it each and every day.", "And with that, Lindy, we'll open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Joe Greff", "Good morning, everybody. Since you reported the prior earnings in late October, obviously a lot of macro risks have come to the fore. Just wondering you how maybe your internal budgets have changed over the last three months, reflecting these heightened risks. Put another way, Steve and Tom, how have some of the pieces moved around, and how have you incorporated some of these macro risks in the segment guidance? And then I have a follow-up.", "Steve Holmes", "Okay. That's a great question Joe. Our budgeting process like our strategic planning process is pretty dynamic. We are always looking at what's out in the landscape. Actually, I don't believe there was much of a change in the way the budgets developed from October to January. There were some additional tasking where we saw risks developing, but it really didn't change our outlook. The budget was based on our strategic plan. And yes, there are shifts and moves, but it really didn't change all that dramatically. I don't - can't think of anything. ", "Joe Greff", "And then just looking at the Hotel Group segment, the pipeline was down a little bit sequentially from the end of the 3Q. Seems to be more outside the US than in the US. Can you talk about what's driving that? And then another quick one on the Vacation Ownership segment. You mentioned the new sales center driving increased tour flow. Can you remind us when those new sales centers, when they opened up, and when you anniversary the opening of those? That's it from me. Thank you.", "Steve Holmes", "Sure. Well, on the - I'll hit the second one first. And may be somebody can grab the specific dates. I don't know the exact dates when this sales office has opened, but they opened it various times during 2015. I think one of them may have opened at the end of 2014.", "But generally, they opened during 2015 and we're seeing good production out of all of them. We'll continue to enhance those sales offices and the affiliation agreements that we have for driving more tours into those sales centers.", "And your first question was on --", "Joe Greff", "On pipeline, sequential pipeline.", "Steve Holmes", "Yes. The pipeline is - as we've said in the past, Joe, it's not a critically important things for us, but less important than other hotel-related companies. Because our - the lot of the additions we make are new - excuse me, are conversion. And conversions tend to flip very quickly, so it may not even appear on the pipeline.", "The pipeline is really - mostly made of properties that are new construction. There were some international conversions that were brought in, they are on there, they take a little bit longer to come in the domestic conversions; but it's a mix. I don't think there is anything really meaningful to be read into that change or difference.", "Joe Greff", "Great. That's all for me. Thank you.", "Steve Holmes", "The only other thing I would add, Joe, is that when it comes to the sales offices, if we can get back to you with specific dates when things open, we will, but bear in mind that when sales office opens, it doesn't open initially at a 100% capacity. I visited our New York sales office shortly after it opened and we had kind of a minimal staff there. We've been staffing up and continue to grow. And so they do ramp up a little bit. So that will happen during 2016 and into 2017.", "Joe Greff", "In other words, then once you anniversary, it's not like you're lapping against a full comparison quite yet.", "Steve Holmes", "Not necessarily. It's like a hotel ramping up. It takes a little ramp up and then it continues to improve.", "Joe Greff", "Good enough. Appreciate it guys.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Steven Kent", "Good morning. Two questions. First, on the vacation rental business which was very, very strong this quarter, you alluded to it, but how much of the volume was essentially same store versus maybe some acquisitions?", "In fact, I think you said some part of your business actually left. So what I want to understand is, is this same store volume increases, is it also consolidation? Are you starting to acquire some of these vacation businesses? Is that starting to gain momentum? And is that the rationale for the name change to Destination Network, meaning, are we going to see more and more from that, both on the consolidation and on the marketing front?", "And then more on the numbers side. The securitization market, as you noted continues to be robust. Can you just give us a little bit more color on that? And also the first rate increase that we saw from the Fed, did that have any impact on propensity for financing, or any issues on spread? I just want to understand how that's going to roll out, if in fact we start to see rate increases?", "Tom Conforti", "So Steve your first question was on same store transaction volume it was 8%. I think it was 8% growth in transaction volume that\u2019s excluding acquisitions and divestures.", "Steven Kent", "Tom, is that, the revenues was up 8%, or was that the actual number of weeks or vacation days or?", "Tom Conforti", "Yes, it was transaction volume but if transaction volume was up 8 and on a currency neutral basis pricing was flat to translate to about 8% revenue growth.", "Steven Kent", "Okay. So then the second part of the question was just, I know at one point you talked about that there was an opportunity to consolidate this part of the business, is that starting to gain momentum and is that the rationale for the name change or one of the rationales for the name change?", "Steve Holmes", "The M&A activity is not the rationale for the name change. The acquisition opportunities we continue to look at things, we've built this side of the business, this rental business through acquisition starting in 2003.", "So we\u2019ve been in the market acquiring businesses as they become available if they are appropriately priced. But like with the hotel side we\u2019re very disciplined in what we will pay for the businesses.", "As you noted we sold one business in 2014 and that\u2019s because it really didn\u2019t fit our model as well, it was more of a camping business versus a cottage rental business, so we sold it to somebody who is more focused on that particular sector of the market.", "The change for destination network is really all about getting more out of the businesses that we already have in the family there. Some of it you\u2019ve heard or seen which is, we brought our tremendous yield management skill set from RCI and transported it into the rental business in Europe and we\u2019re seeing results from that yield management capability which is the first time a European rental business has had that kind of skill set. And various other technology things for the most part that RCI has brought to the table and has kind of put into the rental business.", "In addition, we see an opportunity to do more cross selling of people who are currently doing rentals of cottages to possibly renting timeshare and then maybe deciding that they want to buy timeshares at some point. ", "So, we think there is real opportunity there and so by giving this team as one family within destination network, we think we can drive more that across the enterprise.", "Tom Conforti ", "Steve, I think your third question if I recall the sequencing right was around securitization and so you know we\u2019re in constant touch with investors. I think one of the strategies that we\u2019ve employed is constant marketing and discussions with interested investors and it's from this constant source of intelligence that we remain very optimistic.", "The base rate is lower on the pricing of these types of notes, spreads have widened the tidy bit but we think rates will be comparable to they were last year and so actually we feel very good that because of this constant marketing and because of performance of our businesses that we will be able to get through 2016 very comfortably and that's kind of reflected in our targets for the year.", "You had mentioned something about interest rate increase and whether that had any effect on pricing and our securitization, and the answer is none of that were discernable to us and so at least in this part of our business we remain quite confident in this stability of trends as we go forward.", "And I\u2019ll just add one more thing, we've been at the securitization business for a long time. Investors know us, they've experienced the performance of our businesses through the tumultuous period of 2009 and 2010 and I think they remain very confident in the program that we have out there. And if there is any stress in the market I think we are going to maintain ourselves nicely although we don't detect any stress in the market currently at all.", "Steven Kent", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Patrick Scholes", "Good morning. I have a couple questions. First is, with all the US economy and US consumer under the microscope at the moment, what trends have you seen in sales for your time share business, so far this year?", "Steve Holmes", "Well, we don\u2019t get into granularity in this call about what we've already seeing in 2016 but the way I would view it as within any powerful sales organization, a year-long sales effort is more of a marathon. However it's really nice to come out of the starting gate fast and we\u2019re doing very well down at the WVO now. I'll leave it at that because we don\u2019t give specific guidance.", "Patrick Scholes", "Okay, fair enough. Several other questions. In the past you've talked about if you were to make an acquisition, the priority would be in the Hotel Group. Is that still consistent?", "Steve Holmes", "Yes it is. Well we said the hotel and rental I think were the two that we kind of focused on. We would - we look at everything there Patrick to be quite honest and we have made acquisitions in timeshare we bought shell vacations two years ago I think - three years ago may be now.", "And so we will do transactions if they make sense and we do look at everything. So I wouldn\u2019t say we won\u2019t do anything in timeshare but our focus tends to be more heavily on rental and hotel and the reason for that is that the synergies that we can bring to bear on a hotel transaction or rental transaction or greater and therefore and we can bring more value as an industry player probably then we can on the timeshare side.", "Patrick Scholes", "Okay. Thank you. Two more questions here. You talked in the prepared remarks about increasing financing to new owners. Does that mean lowering credit standards for these potential new buyers?", "Tom Conforti", "No, the plan is that we think that we're - frankly we're leaving some opportunity and some money on the table and that we can lower our down payment requirement little bit and still maintain our quality standards. We\u2019re very focused on that. The results that we\u2019ve seen improvement in provision is the direct result of that teams effort to improve our quality standards of our buyers.", "Patrick Scholes", "Okay. And my last question concerns the repurchases so far, quarter to date. The pace seems to be a little bit higher than where historically it is, when you report earnings. Is that reflective on your thoughts of -- are you increasing the pace a little bit, now that the stock has pulled back? Anything we should read into that?", "Steve Holmes", "Well, I think we just should read into - we put a good 10B5 plan in place that trigged as the stock went down. We are not allowed to make training decision during most of the period that we have been in right now but we've put in place to plan in effect and advance.", "And as Tom said in his comments, we're comfortable saying we are going to get at least $600 million this year assuming no M&A and will follow that pace. Will we buy more when the stock is down, yes but we are not a day trader so we\u2019re not making day to day decisions about a particular movement. We're trying to do this thoughtfully and with the plan.", "Patrick Scholes", "Okay, that's all. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Christopher Agnew with MKM Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Chris Agnew", "Hi, good morning, couple questions. First, any major differences in the cadence of free cash flow or CapEx that we should look for in 2016? And then second, I think you said you assume no debt issuance in 2016. Is that -- has there been any change in your view on leverage ratios? Can you remind us what they are, and how you're thinking about leverage in 2016? Thanks.", "Steve Holmes", "No problem, Chris. Chris, on free cash flow cadence I think the only thing that will be somewhat extraordinary will be - we know, we're going to build up our receivables balance a bit as we increase lending to creditworthy buyers of timeshare. I would expect that cash earnings will improve this year, CapEx is going to come in a little wider than it did last year, product investment will be in the ballpark of what we spend last year, and working capital will be a net positive.", "So I would say that if you were to look at the components of free cash flow, we are maintaining the $800 million neighborhood target, because we are going to fund this increase lending to timeshare buyers. So I would say that's how I see the free cash flow environment for 2016. As it relates to debt issuance, Steve and I believe, as others do in our company that we are at the optimal point of leverage.", "We are the lowest grade -- lowest rung of investment grade. We believe that's where we should be given the business composition that we have and the free cash flow dynamics of our business. We do not intend to change that unless something extraordinary and compelling comes up that we believe will lead to an expansion of the business overtime. But that would have to be quite an extraordinary opportunity. So I think at this point, we are certainly comfortable with where we are and don't expect that will change anytime soon.", "Chris Agnew", "Got it, thank you. One more follow-up on vacation rental business. The business, particularly in Europe, I think outperformed during the Great Recession. Does that dynamic change in any way, because of new entrants, thinking about Airbnb in particular? And is there an opportunity for you to think about distributing vacation rental product on Airbnb? And even potentially other leisure inventory, some of your lodging product through Airbnb? Is that something that you've thought about? Thank you.", "Steve Holmes", "Well, the rental businesses in Europe have performed very well. As I said in my comments, they've done extremely well. They did well in the recession, a couple of years ago too. So it's a very resilient business. We've got great product in great locations. As I commented, we are using Booking.com and HomeAway for some of our distribution. And HomeAway has been in this market for quite some time. This is not -- they are not a new entrant and Airbnb has been there for a while.", "Airbnb's systems do not accommodate our rental model as well as some of the others do. So as of right now, we've run some test that require a lot of manual effort to try to use Airbnb as a distribution channel force, because that's really what they are. But we have not been able to find an automated way to do it. So I think it's unlikely that they will be a big distribution avenue for us, but HomeAway and Booking.com will continue to be.", "Chris Agnew", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Tom Conforti", "Hi, Chris. I just want to add one more point to that of your question around debt. It came to me as Steve was answering your last question. That is we do have some notes that come do at the end of the year. We'll be looking at different refinancing options of those notes. So while -- I said in my prepared comments that our guidance doesn't reflect -- just reflects our current debt levels. We do have refinancing come up and we'll be considering alternatives to refinance those notes at some point in time this year.", "Chris Agnew", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Katz with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "David Katz", "Hi, good morning all. Two questions. Just the strategy, or the strategic thinking around what you talked about with the VOI business, in terms of higher tours and prospectively lower VPG. And the opening of the new sales centers, is that indicative of some change in view about the landscape, and just driving a little greater volume? Any economic change as to why that VPG would go down, or is that just the physics of how that business works?", "Steve Holmes", "Yes, it\u2019s really capturing an opportunity, David. It's looking at the opportunity to grow more rapidly to our new owners from about 30,000 a year to 35,000 a year. And new owners tend to run slightly lower VPG than upgrade sales.", "So it\u2019s almost a mix function more than anything else. Not a sign of weakness at all. In fact, it\u2019s a sign of strength because we see the opportunity exist to be able to go out and bring in more new owners to our system. Now, those new owners to our system become upgrade owners in the next three year, five years. ", "David Katz", "Got it. And if I can ask a question about the hotel business. Again, taking all the information in total, with a bit more focus, or at least as the pipeline reflects on international, I think Tom, you made some reference to hotels exiting the system that were sub-quality.", "As we look at the whole hotel landscape, we see brands investing and repositioning themselves. We see some new entrants in the price-driven segments of the market. Any thoughts at all about looking at the brands that you have, and repositioning some of those in a more assertive way than what you've done so far? And basically, how you're thinking about that issue?", "Steve Holmes", "Well, we constantly David, are looking at our brands and part of the big push that we have going on is to increase the quality of those brands. So Tom referred to the sub-standard properties that we're kicking out.", "The other side of it is that the units that we are adding generally have a higher quality score, TripAdvisor score, our QA scores, than the average. So the idea is to improve the overall quality.", "Do I see us taking Days Inn from being a solid, or Super 8 a solid monster economy brand and moving it up to midscale? No. But we do see some terrific growth in our midscale and upper upscale properties of Wyndham and Wingates and Wyndham Garden.", "So we are seeing growth in those areas. But I don\u2019t see us taking one of our economy brands and try to reposition it to the select midscale, if that was your question.", "David Katz", "Not that it would necessarily change segments, but just to cite an example, Choice has taken the Comfort brand and doing some refreshing, perhaps, is a better word, or we've seen Holiday Inn over the years establish a new set of standards, to in some respects upgrade within their current segment, that brand.", "And as an example of a new entrant, we saw Hilton introduce a brand a couple of weeks ago that is intended for a specific segment. And so it was more about a refreshment, rather than a repositioning.", "Steve Holmes", "Well absolutely, I'm sorry didn't understand the question there. That definitely is happening. We are working on new prototypes for each one of our brands. We are working with the franchise advisory council to get those rolled out.", "But honestly, we are always doing that. So that\u2019s nothing extraordinary. We are probably going to have, in 2016, 2017, a fairly significant rollout of some of those prototypes. But I wouldn\u2019t consider a repositioning like Holiday Inn did. I think they did a terrific job of resetting that brand. One of the best I\u2019ve seen.", "So they did a great job for a very, very large brand. I applaud them on it. But I don\u2019t think that we are going to go through that type of a massive change. We are trying to make more of an evolutionary change versus a revolutionary change.", "David Katz", "Perfect. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Harry Curtis", "Hi, good morning. Quick follow-up on Pat's question, on the time share business. Should we expect any increase in your provisions as you change your down payment requirements?", "Tom Conforti", "Harry, we will see an increase in provision and the reason is that in spite of the fact that our sales levels are growing, the more important factor is that we're financing a higher percentage of those sales.", "And so just by the fact that we're extending more loans to people means that we're going to provide at a higher level as a percentage of sales. So it's a mechanical thing. But as Steve said earlier in an answer to an earlier question, we have no intention to deviate from the credit worthy standard that we've established over the past few years.", "Harry Curtis", "Okay. Very good. And my other question had to do with a little bit of historic perspective, given the disruption we're seeing in the markets. There's an awful lot of concern about the consumer confidence, and consumer spending beginning to tip over. If you go back to 2007 and 2008, what are the indicators that softened first, or what are the data points in your -- mainly in your time share business, that softened first?", "And it was encouraging, your comments were encouraging about, you have expectations for a great year in leisure travel, but if you could give us some perspective on if there were to be some softness, where would that likely manifest itself, and are you not seeing any at this point?", "Steve Holmes", "Well, thanks Harry. The question about consumer confidence and I think we've mentioned it before, we don't see a lot of correlation between consumer confidence and the timeshare business. The timeshare business, it's a sold-good, it's not a sought-good. It really depends on how good our marketing and sales efforts are. That's what drives that business.", "So if you go back to '07, '08, '09 and you take out the fact that we took our sales down, because we didn't know what the ABS market would look like, all of the metrics around our sales effort in timeshare were terrific. VPG was up. We were controlling tours perfectly. We reposition that business. I have to tell you, it was one of the great repositioning of a business I've seen and it made - the business actually stronger.", "So we didn't see - we did not see a lack of people interested in buying. What we saw was our marketing efforts were bringing in buyers who probably were more prone to buy, because people traveling at that time when travel was down a bit, where the more dedicated travelers more inclined to buy.", "So, we actually exceeded sales during that time. And that's true of our rental businesses as well. We did it extremely well. So we have a model that is extremely resilient. So do we look at consumer confidence, we look at trends, we look at the fact that this gas is down, and whenever gas prices are up, people say, oh my gosh, people won't be going in their cars to go rent hotel rooms now. Well, that doesn't happen.", "And likewise, when prices are down that doesn't mean they necessarily get in their car more to drive around. But they do have more disposable income in their pocket and I've seen several reports that have shown that a large percentage of the additional dollars people have now that gas prices are down, these are going into travel and entertainment.", "So, we feel we're extremely well positioned and all of our tracking is looking very positive.", "Harry Curtis", "Thank you. And just a housekeeping item. Can you address the improved margins in the hotel business? I think the mix of the Dolce business was having an impact on them, but it seems to have righted itself. Is that a fair statement?", "Tom Conforti", "For the full year, Harry, Dolce cost us around almost 300 basis points of margin. So net of the Dolce affect, we were positive. Now, to be fair sort of the offset to that is the higher licensing fee that they received from our timeshare guys. And so net-net on a full year basis, I would evaluate that their margin was basically flat against 2014.", "Harry Curtis", "Okay. Very good, thanks guys.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Michael Millman", "Thank you. I want to follow up actually on the last question, questioners. One is regarding the time share. Could you discuss the trends you're seeing in terms of the users and buyers? I guess by that, I mean, in terms of age or income or how they use it or in fact even nationality. Are we seeing more, less, from Europe, Canada?", "And secondly, regarding your comment about a great year for leisure travel, can you talk about that in consideration of the oil economy, you talked about in the US, Texas and Oklahoma markets, maybe that's broadening, Canada, also in Europe, terrorism, and more broadly now, the Zika concerns. Thank you.", "Steve Holmes", "Okay. That was a lot in that last question, which I'll tackle first. And we are not seeing any impact from the Zika virus. We don't have a huge presence in Latin America. We have a good presence, but not a huge presence. So we've not seen any change there.", "As per travelers coming in to the U.S., there was little bit of a downturn in Brazilian travelers to Florida. They flew into Miami and Orlando in large numbers and we did do a lot of marketing to them. We have a Portuguese sales line in Orlando, but it didn't - again, it wasn't large enough to have impacted the business at all. So we don't think that the travel patterns are changing.", "As for the oil producing markets where the fracking has been occurring in the U.S. is definitely down. As Tom said, I think it's down 27% RevPAR in those particular market. So they have been hit very, very hard. I never thought I would say that oil-producing markets in the U.S. would have an impact on our results, but they frankly they have. So we've highlighted that and pointed that out to you.", "As to the U.S. about the age of the buyers of timeshare, it has trended down. It's gotten younger over the last several years. I think right now the order report says that the average timeshare buyer is 51 years old - that's the owner, so the buyer is probably younger than that. I think it's in the early 40s and actually I'm looking at something here, this is 39 years old. And so they are younger.", "The Gen-X's are attracted to timeshare. The average household income is up fairly significantly. I remember when it used to be $80,000. It's up like $95,000 now. So there is a younger more affluent person buying timeshare than there was historically.", "Tom Conforti", "He asked about leisure trends as well.", "Steve Holmes", "Well, we see good momentum on the leisure side. We are largely a leisure business. So we\u2019re a pretty good barometer of the leisure traveler.", "Michael Millman", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we have no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the program back to our management for closing remarks.", "Steve Holmes", "Thank you very much, Lindy, and thank you all for being on the call and thank you for your support. We'll look forward to talking to you next quarter.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's program. You may disconnect at this time.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "I will now turn the call over to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Margo Happer", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO; and Tom Conforti, our CFO.", "Before we get started, I want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to Risk Factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These Risk Factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K filed February 12, 2016 with the SEC.", "We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these measures to GAAP is provided in the tables to the press release. It is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website at wyndhamworldwide.com. Steve?", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks, Margo. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I am pleased to report that we are starting a year with another solid quarter of operating performance across our businesses. Tom will walk you through the financial results in detail. First, let me give you the highlights of the quarter.", "In our Hotel Group, RevPAR results are somewhat mixed. We continue to see weakness in oil producing territories but this was offset somewhat by areas of strength such as California and Florida. Comps should get easier in the second half of the year.", "At Wyndham Vacation Network, our rental businesses had a strong first quarter with our bookings pipeline running ahead of last year, while RCI remains a consistent steady performer. And Wyndham Vacation Ownership had a great operational quarter as we saw the benefits of various initiatives, new sales processes, new sales offices, and an intensified focus on new owners, payoff with double-digit growth in gross VOI sales. Unfortunately there was also an increase in the provision for loan loss which was attributable to an increased effort by third parties to encourage customers to default on their timeshare loans.", "And finally, our free cash flow is strong, and we continue to opportunistically deploy our capital.", "Now I would like to focus on the great progress we've made on a number of strategic growth initiatives throughout our businesses. At the Wyndham Hotel Group, our new and award winning Wyndham Rewards program continues to deliver great results designed to appeal to the everyday traveler, we've made Wyndham Rewards the most generous and easiest used program in the industry.", "We have won simple and straightforward award night redemption level. All of our rooms are now available for only 15,000 points per night with no blackout dates, and that includes our Wyndham Grand Resorts which previously required up to 45,000 points for each night.", "To make the Wyndham Rewards program even more attractive, we're beginning to leverage our unique portfolio of vacation rental and vacation ownership properties. We are expanding award night redemption options across the most aspirational of our destinations. So now Wyndham Rewards members have even more exciting travel options staying for example at timeshares in Hawaii and vacation rentals in Aspen.", "In addition to enrolling 5 million new members in the last 12 months, award night redemptions have increased 90% since the program launched last May. We have seen our member occupancy increase over 200 basis points since the launch of the program and our franchisees have never been more engaged, increasing enrollments across their front desk by 55%.", "Building on this momentum we launched our third umbrella advertising campaign on April 18. The ads once again featured Game of Thrones star Kristofer Hivju as the Wyndham Rewards Wizard in new primetime network in cable TV spots. The campaign is designed to drive direct bookings by promoting our richest consumer offer ever. The offer is available only on our branded websites and thorough our call centers. Members who receive up to 25% off our best available rate, along with $100 in Wyndham Rewards gift cards on their second stay, which can be redeemed for savings on future stays.", "In the Hotel Group our decision to exit the central reservation system and property management system development business and migrate to best-in-class cloud-based technology partners is proceeding as planned. We currently have over 450 properties live on the new Sabre System which includes an automated revenue management component.", "Wyndham is the first global hospitality company to offer economy and mid-scale hotel owners a means to automatically analyze millions of historical transactions and demand trends. This enables our franchisees to set the ideal price for their property with the simple push of a button each day. The first group of hotels using this new revenue management tool is showing a 260 basis point increase in RevPAR index compared with hotels not yet on the system.", "Moving on to Wyndham Destination Network which is evolving its strategy to better harness its inventory and distribution power to send more people on the vacation of their dreams. For us, the sharing economy isn't a trend. We've been in the business for decades. RCI invented the exchange concept for timeshare back in the 1970s and our vacation rental brands includes well established businesses dating back more than 70 years.", "As you all know, we are the largest, world's largest provider of privately owned yet professionally managed unique vacation accommodations with over 112,000 properties. And for us it's about the strength of our proprietary brands and the local relationships we have built with our property owners and customers. The strength of these relationships and our value proposition is at the core of our strategy ", "In vacation rentals, we are benefiting from initiatives to expand our ecommerce and distribution capabilities, while continuing to develop new markets. In fact, our Denmark based Novasol brand and Netherland's based Landal GreenParks brand just experienced their best ever quarter in terms of bookings and we're seeing strong bookings throughout our business for the peak summer season.", "What makes us even more noteworthy is that it has happened during despite the economic turmoil in Europe along with recent terrorism and the refuge crisis.", "We have a very resilient business built on the strength of our core brands and our diversified portfolio.", "At RCI, we're excited about the continued expansion enhancement of our product offering. RCI has long been the leader in vacation exchange based on our ability to consistently deliver innovations and transform our business to deliver the best experiences for our members and affiliates.", "In the first quarter, we launched a multi-year business strategy that will encompass our entire core membership model, including our customer's experiences and our B2B relationships with timeshare affiliates. It will expand our digital capabilities to further improve our personalization; we're initially focused on our North American operations before expanding globally.", "The program will leverage the ways we use our customer data, automation, and content, to create exceptional engaging interactions with our customers. For example, we will be able to offer members customized products based on their travel preferences and timeshare ownership characteristics.", "We'll improve both the relevance and the quality of leads to our affiliates and improve the effectiveness and efficiencies of their operations. In addition, we will be transforming our website, mobile offering, and digital marketing capabilities. We look forward to updating you about our progress in the future.", "Now let's move to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. As we previously mentioned, our focus is gross VOI growth, supported by accelerated growth in new owners. I'm especially pleased to report excellent top-line results in the first quarter and we're well on track to achieve our goal of increasing new owners by 15% in 2016.", "Our new sales centers are performing well, particularly strong performances in Las Vegas, New York, Puerto Rico, and St. Thomas. Our timeshare product delivers the ultimate in choice and flexibility as evidenced by our industry leading owner base of close to 900,000 families.", "And as our history demonstrates, we are committed to continually evolving our product offerings to meet the needs of today's consumers in an ever changing marketplace. We believe this customer centric approach is the foundation of our success.", "First, we started a process a couple of years ago to evolve timeshare sales and marketing to ensure a more consumer friendly buying experience. We introduced and refined a Group presentation sales format for new and existing owners ensuring that our best sales people are in front of our customers using a proven uniform method of telling a consistent story and producing sales.", "We expanded post sales surveys, as well as secret shopper program, both part of a vigorous multifaceted compliance and quality assurance effort. As always our closings are led by a designated quality assurance associate to independently explain the contractual terms of each transaction.", "More importantly, we ensure that owners remain satisfied with the product long after the original sales by continual surveys and feedback loops.", "We're tracking our owners satisfaction whether they are saying at our resorts. We're speaking with the customer service representative or consumer finance representative. We also continually monitor comments on social media to ensure we're getting unfiltered feedback from various survey channels. Our mission is to always keep a close watch on the sentiment and satisfaction of our owners.", "We expect to continue evolving and innovating to maintain and grow our position as the market leader in this industry, and that includes providing options to our longtime owners, who may want to exit their contract that they no longer use or regularly using their timeshare.", "We first announced our \"Ovation by Wyndham\" program at this time last year. The goal of this innovative program is to ensure a simple, safe, and secure exit path for owners that preserve the goodwill and strong brand loyalty, we have generated over many years of providing these families with fantastic vacation experiences.", "There are no fees, hidden costs, or additional purchase requirements to participate in the program, just an Ovation for these members for their many years of ownership. We believe this customer centric approach benefits our customers, our brand, and in the end our bottom-line.", "Now let me turn the call over to Tom for the details on the quarter's results.", "Tom Conforti", "Thanks, Steve, and good morning everyone. We started 2016 with a solid first quarter on a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA increased 6%. We generated $218 million of free cash flow and 11% increase over the first three months of 2015, due to strong operating performance and the favorable timing of capital expenditures. These results include the negative effect of the Venezuelan currency devaluation which reduced free cash flow by $24 million.", "During the quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $175 million. We've reduced our weighted average share count by 7% year-over-year through share repurchases made during the last 12 months. In addition, we've repurchased 600,000 shares for $45 million so far in the second quarter of 2016.", "So now let's take a look at the performance of each of our business units. At our Hotel Group, revenues increased 1%, adjusted EBITDA grew 6% as growth in our Wyndham Rewards Credit Card program, strong performance at our two owned hotels, and cost containment measures more than offset weaker global RevPAR. These factors also led to a higher margin for the quarter.", "As we have seen for the last several quarters, there were many macroeconomic factors impacting our Hotel Group performance. The oil-producing markets in the U.S. and Canada, foreign exchange, and the growth in low RevPAR markets such as China continue to pressure our global RevPAR growth.", "Domestic RevPAR was flat as higher room rates were offset by lower occupancy. This performance reflected continued pressure on our RevPAR and the oil-producing markets which is defined by STR mainly includes parts of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kansas, and North Dakota.", "To put this into perspective, performance in the oil-producing markets was down 28% resulting in a 220 basis point impact on domestic RevPAR. Excluding oil, domestic RevPAR grew 1.9% which reflected RevPAR growth of 2.8% in our economy branded hotels and 3% in our mid-scale hotels. These two segments make up over 90% of our portfolio.", "Now domestic RevPAR growth was also adversely impacted by over 100 basis points from the loss of a few Wyndham branded properties such as the San Francisco based Parc 55 in February 2015 and also by the timing of Easter.", "Remember first quarter performance is against a strong domestic RevPAR in quarter one of 2015 of almost 8%. System-wide RevPAR declined 1.6% in constant currency, largely due to the continued unit growth of lower RevPAR hotels in China and continued weakness in the Canadian oil markets. Excluding China, and in constant currency, global RevPAR was flat, which includes a 210 basis point unfavorable impact from domestic and Canadian oil markets.", "Overall, net system size grew 1.8% year-over-year, which incorporates our continued focus on improving the overall quality of our system. Our development pipeline is over 124,000 rooms that's a 7.3% increase over the prior year. And that number also includes a 20% increase in domestic new construction activity with the concentration in our higher end brands.", "Our Destination Network segment had a very good quarter. On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, revenues increased 5%, and adjusted EBITDA 3%. Additionally excluding a $4 million benefit in the first quarter of 2015 from a value added tax reserve reversal which we discussed with you last year, adjusted EBITDA would have increased 7%. Results benefited marginally from the shift of the Easter holiday into the first quarter.", "First quarter 2016 reported EBITDA included the $24 million foreign exchange loss associated with the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar.", "At RCI exchange revenues were flat in constant currency reflecting flat average number of members and revenue per member. Vacation rentals revenue for the quarter were up 9% in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase reflects a 7% increase in transaction volume and a 2.3% increase in the average net price per rental. Transaction growth was strongest in our Novasol and Landal GreenParks brands aided by our ecommerce and geographic expansion initiatives. The pricing increase was primarily due to higher average fees at Landal which we believe also benefited from the Easter holiday shift.", "First quarter results for vacation ownership business were solid with revenues up 4% and EBITDA up 5%. In addition to strong gross VOI sales, results benefited from an increase in property management fees and higher consumer finance revenues. As we committed to a couple calls ago, we intensified our emphasis on growing gross VOI sales which is now yielding excellent results. Gross VOI sales were up 10% in constant currency. That growth reflected a 3.8% increase in VPG, and a 6.5% increase in tour flow. VPG benefited from higher transaction sizes and improved close rates while tour flow benefited from higher arrivals and tours at our new sales centers.", "Sales to new owners increased 7% consistent with our internal plans. The performance of the consumer loan portfolio remains solid but is experiencing slightly higher default rates. Our average FICO score of originations during the quarter was 727 consistent with underwriting standards of the past year. However, we saw an increase of $12 million in loan defaults during the first quarter resulting from higher activity by third parties that may be soliciting our owners to cancel their contracts. This may be a variation of what we saw a few years ago with cease-and-desist activity. We're looking into whether there is a legal activity associated with this issue and if so, we will take appropriate action. Separately, we are enhancing communications to owners about options that we may have available to them should they wish to exit their timeshare ownership.", "The higher defaults contributed to a higher provision for loan loss in the quarter with the provision at $63 million in the first quarter compared to $46 million in the prior period. Approximately $5 million of the increase reflects higher sales volumes. The remainder reflects increased defaults encouraged by third parties. Now remember the provision flows through to EBITDA at an approximate 60% rate since we get about 40% of the loan value in inventory recoveries which we then of course resell.", "Companywide net interest expense increased by $8 million in the first quarter over the same period of 2015, reflecting the $350 million, 5.1% bonds issued last September, and the absence of the fixed to floating interest rate swap we unwound during the second quarter of 2015. Depreciation also increased as we brought new long-term projects into service.", "We completed two notable capital market transactions in March. At the corporate level, we closed $325 million five-year floating rate term loan and used the proceeds to redeem the remaining $315 million outstanding under our 6% bonds due this December. We incurred an $11 million one-time charge to pay for the related make-whole provision. The effect of these two transactions is now included in our updated interest expense guidance.", "At Vacation Ownership, we completed our first term securitization of the year with $425 million Sierra 2016-1 transaction at a 3.2% weighted average coupon, and an 88.9% advanced rate. The order book was strong as our paper continues to be well received by the market.", "Now let's turn to guidance which will be posted on the website after the call. As you saw from the press release, we are increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to $5.61 to $5.75 for the full-year and diluted share count goes to 113.2 million shares reflecting the benefit of our first quarter share repurchases. We're adjusting our interest expense guidance to account for the previously discussed debt transactions.", "We're reiterating total company as well as business unit revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and driver guidance, although our current view is that RevPAR will be at the low-end of our guidance range. Our projected annual interest expense moves to $127 million to $129 million from $131 million to $133 million as a result of the previously mentioned favorable capital markets transactions.", "Our neighborhood target for 2016 cash flow remains at $800 million. As always keep in mind that there can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter or any given year, so we view the $800 million number as a neighborhood target rather than a precise figure.", "Now turning to the second quarter, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.35 to $1.38. Remember that we don't budget repurchases into our guidance.", "Also note that depreciation will be a couple million dollars higher in the quarter sequentially but we expect it to moderate in the second half of the year.", "For the second quarter, while we expect continued momentum on the top-line at vacation ownership, our current best view is that there will be continued pressure on defaults and hence the provision which will reduce their EBITDA growth rates. And at the Hotel Group, we expect RevPAR in the oil regions to remain challenged.", "Finally, a quick note on some additional disclosure. The majority of our peers have amended definitions of adjusted EBITDA to exclude share-based compensation. While we've not formally changed that definition of adjusted EBITDA, we are now providing our quarterly share-based compensation in Table 7 of our earnings release so that investors can make apples-to-apples comparisons between us and our peers. Note that our full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance would increase by approximately $60 million if it were presented on a similar basis to our peers.", "And with that, I will turn the call back to Steve. Steve?", "Steve Holmes", "Thank you again for joining us today. We are off to a good start in 2016 as we continue to execute and drive innovation across our businesses, whether it is the Wyndham Rewards program at the Hotel Group, revenue management efforts in Europe that are helping to drive our booking base at our rental businesses, or our new owner expansion efforts at WVO. We are continuing to develop differentiated value propositions that will serve as the foundation for growth, profitability, and shareholder value.", "The proven resilience of our diversified business model makes us uniquely positioned for any environment. The disciplined capital allocation continues to be hallmark and commitment of Wyndham.", "Thank you for your continued support and confidence in us. We will work hard to continue to earn it each and every day. And with that Keith, we are happy to take any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions].", "We will go first to Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Joe Greff", "With regard to your comments on increases in the loan-loss provision in vacation ownership on February 9 and your cash flow representative model, you had a range of about $291 million for that provision and obviously that didn't take into account some of the things you talked about this morning. What is that range now taking into account the third-party pressuring that provision? And from an EBITDA perspective, what is that and where are you offsetting it since the full-year guidance is unchanged?", "Tom Conforti", "So Joe, we know what the provision is in the first quarter obviously, and we have visibility into the second quarter. And as I said in my comments, Joe, we expect that we will have a similar level of provision variability quarter-to-quarter. But beyond that really our visibility is somewhat limited because we believe that these organized efforts we're not quite sure both longevity of those or the duration of those efforts.", "We hope that will end with the end of the second quarter but we no way of knowing at this point. So we expect that the business unit because of the momentum on the top-line as it did in the first quarter, we'll be able to offset a good portion of that and of course we'll do whatever else we need to do in terms of cost containment throughout the company to achieve that number.", "Joe Greff", "Okay. So the increase in the first quarter was $12 million year-over-year, $5 million of that was just related to higher VOI sales so $12 million less $5 million is $7 million, 50% flow through of the EBITDA impact in 1Q and I should interpret your comments just now as a similar level to that in the 2Q here with nothing in 3Q or 4Q?", "Tom Conforti", "So let me walk you through the numbers it's $17 million, a $5 million of it is attributable to sales that gets us to $12 million, we get 60% of the $12 million because we recovered 40% on inventory probably that gets you to $7 million. So $7 million was the net sort of EBITDA effect for provision in the quarter associated with this organized third-party activity.", "We expect similar levels in the second quarter comparable levels that may be a $1 million or so lower or higher, but in that neighborhood. And we expect that the revenue and there may be some continuation in third and fourth quarter, we expect that the revenue momentum of the business will serve to offset some of that as well as cost control across the board.", "Steve Holmes", "Yes, and as you know, Joe, we went through something not to similar to this couple of years ago and we worked through it. So this is very -- it\u2019s a very creative, innovative group down in Orlando that take on these challenges and when they come up, we always find a way around.", "Joe Greff", "Okay, great. And then I have two relatively minor questions. One is on the buyback in the quarter, there obviously was a slowdown since you guys reported results back in early February. And I know the share price has moved upwardly but is there anything to the slower amount of buyback in the last half or two months of the quarter versus what you did in the earlier part of the 1Q? Was there anything that precluded you other than share price?", "Steve Holmes", "No, no, the pace of the program we put in place for the beginning of the year was adjusted for price. And so it was more accelerated beginning part of the year and then we were on pace with what our expectation was for the quarter, for the rest of the quarter basically. So it was share price driven.", "Tom Conforti", "Yes, with share price driven and also remember the bumpers we have or we want to retain our investment grade ratings. So we felt that we were above trend. Typically it's a 150 quarter, we did 175 quarter and we want to make sure that we're comfortably within the bumpers of what is investment grade.", "Joe Greff", "Got it. And then this Venezuela currency devaluation charge, I think most of us are surprised that it was that sizable relative to maybe how we understand the relative size and presence of Wyndham in Venezuela. Can you talk about that a little bit? What is your revenue EBITDA dependency in Venezuela?", "Steve Holmes", "Well in the old days it was more than it is currently and this is sort of the accumulated effect of years and years of activity in the market and the inability of us to remove cash -- to remove cash out of the market. We knew that this day was coming at some point in time because the regime in Venezuela hasn't changed in some respects. And certainly moving currency out of the currency has been impossible for a number of years now. And so we just we did know that it was going to happen when it did, but we expect that eventually we are going to experience something like this at some point in time.", "Joe Greff", "And your exposure to adverse currency in Venezuela at this point forward is zero?", "Steve Holmes", "No, it is minimal, we produced less than $2 million this year in Venezuela, usually a bigger part of our business at RCI but it's not as much anymore in what business we do, do is U.S. currency denominated.", "Tom Conforti", "Joe, you should know that we don't have much left in Venezuela, so I think it\u2019s probably $1 million or so, couple of million dollars. So I think we've devaluated as much as it could be the value may be if it happens down the road, it will be immaterial for sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Kent with Goldman Sachs.", "Steve Kent", "Hi. So the -- I wanted to talk to you a little about new customers versus existing customers for the timeshare business. I thought maybe Tom; you said something like the new customers are up 7%.", "Tom Conforti", "Correct.", "Steve Kent", "So if you break it out, what is your split between new and old? That is one question related to that. Second, is the FICO score about these same on the new versus the old? And I know it is early because they are new but the default rates are they running about the same? And then just one final question because I think the VPG number was very strong this quarter. I know it's a continued evolution of how you get better and better at selling. May be you could just give a couple of examples of what is leading to that higher momentum on VPG?", "Tom Conforti", "So four part question I count it. So the one question I could answer comfortably and immediately is that our FICO score remain, it's actually a couple points higher than it was last year. So the profile is the same.", "Too early to tell on the default tendencies of the new owners since they've just become new owners and we haven't noticed a material drop off. Keep in mind that that new owners don't necessarily default at any greater rate than existing owners, the reason being that existing owners typically have larger loan balances, and new owners typically don't, and so the default experience is not materially different than it is with upgrade.", "Steve Holmes", "And then you had asked about the mix of new and upgrade. It's pretty close to what it was before slightly increased new owner additions obviously by increasing but it's not anything dramatically different.", "On the VPG momentum, Steve, it really is -- it's in both of the kind of metrics that go into VPG, both closed rates as well as the transaction size. And this is really I believe a continuation of the process improvements that they have put in place down in WVO, as well as to a degree the opening of the new sales offices, some of our sales offices are in locations where we will deliver just by their locale, we will deliver a higher VPG like New York, St. Thomas. So we're getting a benefit of some of that flowing through as well. So I think it's really kudos to the team. They're doing everything they need to do to continually improve the business and if not for this, this bump in the road on provision this would have been a blow out quarter for WVO.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust.", "Patrick Scholes", "Hi good morning. I have a number of questions. First, talk a little bit more about in the vacation rental revenue certainly a strong 7% growth rate in transaction volume. Can you give us a little color on like what types of customers are you seeing that large increase from and perhaps where they are located and their geographic region?", "Steve Holmes", "Sure, it\u2019s as you know this is largely a European business and the two businesses that performed the best were Landal which is largely Dutch for Dutch, but also some German in there as well. And the other was Novasol which is a little more broadly distributed because they have product both in Northern Europe as well as Southern Europe in Croatia and Italy and those are the biggest population, they draw from German travelers and the Danish travelers. So those were the two highest performing markets that we had.", "Tom Conforti", "Patrick, you might recall that we discussed last year the expansion of our distribution relationships with a couple of online distributors and that also engaged some nice buoyancy to our transaction volume.", "Patrick Scholes", "Okay. Have you seen any material change after the Brussels attacks in the booking and demand patterns?", "Steve Holmes", "No, no we did not.", "Patrick Scholes", "Okay. Two more questions here, when I look at your exchange revenue per member, it\u2019s been a pretty consistent downward trend year-over-year. Is that just propensity to exchange is decreasing? Is there something else going into that decrease?", "Steve Holmes", "No, it really is the -- it's exactly that. It's the propensity, it says more and more of the members are coming from clubs, the larger clubs, they do less transactions with us and that creates a downward pressure on the exchange revenue per member. Part of what we're doing with this new initiative that is started in destination network is to expand our offerings to these members, so that we can give them more products, more different experiences which can generate a larger share of wallet. So they're doing a great job of kind of looking at different ways that we can reverse that trend but that trend is one that's existed for some time.", "Patrick Scholes", "Okay, thank you. Last question, historically you have outlined a 6% to 8% organic EBITDA growth going out into the future. How do you feel about that range for the next several years?", "Steve Holmes", "We feel -- we feel good about it. I was just handed a note on your last question, Patrick, we recognize that there is FX impacting that exchange revenue per member I neglected to say that.", "Patrick Scholes", "Okay.", "Steve Holmes", "Going forward our growth rate we feel very good about it. We did our strategic reviews at the end of last year and have done budget reviews, we feel like we have terrific programs in place and a lot of this seed corn that we're planting right now is going to bear fruit in 2017 and beyond even though we were comfortable for this year because things like the tremendous systems that we're rolling out in Hotel Group are going to have some really positive impacts.", "And those aren't felt immediately. Because really we've got there is a series of initiatives that we're rolling out and we haven't even hit the big ones yet that will have the biggest impact. So revenue management for these hotels is important but the two interface and other things that are coming out as part of the Sabre System that will come out in 2016 and 2017 are going to have the bigger impacts. So we feel very good and WVO is quick and long, they've got great plans for going forward.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Chris Agnew with MKM Partners.", "Steve Holmes", "Hey, Chris.", "Chris Agnew", "Thanks very much. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the strong tour flow growth you saw in the quarter with new sales centers. Have the sales centers fully ramped and thinking about the cadence through the year, when do you start to lap the opening of sales centers and any plans for additional sales centers? Thanks.", "Steve Holmes", "Okay, well just talking generically about tour flow, there were a lot of drivers of our increased tour flow. The new offices were one element of it, they are not completely ramped up yet, they will continue to ramp up over this year and actually into next year to a degree because not only they have to open a sales centers, you then are -- you're finding your tour flow sources, you're training your sales people. So I expect to see a multiyear impact from some of these larger sales centers like New York and St. Thomas and as well as the new center we have out in Vegas. So that is going to blend in over time.", "Some of the initiatives that we talked about previously like Norwegian cruise lines that's just starting. We had our first cruise -- the Norwegian cruise line that went into St. Thomas and then went over to our sales center on the 19th I believe of April. So yes, last week, so we're just starting that program and there is a multitude of other programs that the group is working on to continually kind of freshen the sources of our tour generation. So I think what you're seeing I do not expect it to slow down, it was great in the first quarter, it's always difficult to predict. So I don't want to say it's going to be up every quarter like it was this quarter but we feel very good about our marketing and sales efforts at WVO right now.", "Chris Agnew", "Thank you. And then if I could switch to the weakness you talked about in oil and gas markets. Are you seeing any signs of stabilization and when do you start to run over easier comps in those regions? Thanks.", "Steve Holmes", "Well it's a good point, Chris. At some point, we should start lapping the issue and it was first identified kind of at the end of the first quarter of last year. So the second quarter had some in it but it really got more dramatically pronounced in the third and fourth quarters. So we should start, that's why comps should be easier in the second half of the year.", "Now we're hesitant to say, it will be easier because we're not sure how much contingent it will be from this, there is the market that are oil producing are down, we will expand beyond that, we won't know until the summer quite frankly because we're such a leisure summer driven business. But we are monitoring it closely and we're working with our franchisees in those markets to try to do everything we can to drive business there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Katz with Telsey Group. Please go ahead.", "David Katz", "So two questions. Some of the discussion around this third-party effort, are you able to provide any more detail as to where that came from exactly or is this a better -- perhaps a better off-line discussion? And then you mentioned that it has happened in the past. Can you point to some specific timing so that we can go back and get a little historical perspective on how that has rolled in the past?", "Steve Holmes", "Yes, just the last question is easier to answer than the first one. The first time we saw that kind of a similar activity was back in 2012 and it flowed into 2013 and at that time, we called it the cease-and-desist effort. As a result of that cease-and-desist activity, there were people who are prosecuted, who are found guilty, and who are serving sentences right now.", "So sometimes these activities are just now legal and we have to beat them back and because of that I'll go to the first part of the question which is I don't think we're really in a position to talk about this on the call or frankly off the call either if we could talk about we talked about on this call because we're in the midst of trying to track all this down right now.", "As you can see the business is performing and covering the pressure that we're feeling from this and as I said it would have been a knock out quarter if not for this activity.", "David Katz", "Understood. And then if I can ask one smaller question around Dolce, can you -- just since it is a newly integrated brand and again recognizing it is relatively small, can you just talk about what your plans are for that over the next 12 months in terms of exiting rooms from the system and what we can reasonably expect that to achieve? And it certainly would help if we went out past rest of this year also if that's possible qualitatively?", "Steve Holmes", "Sure, well as you said Dolce, is a new brand, it's also a relatively small brand but it's we also have a lot of momentum in the brand. As for exits, we did have a couple of properties leave may be just one property leave after the acquisition but other than that it's very stable. We are producing for them and I think we reported on the last call and even the call before that the impact on those hotels has been dramatic not just on their performance, from a revenue standpoint but also in their cost because they've been rolled into our OTA contracts, they\u2019re getting the benefit of it. So we\u2019ve got some very happy hotel owners in the Dolce world. We will continue to manage those properties and grow as a management company and we will continue to keep the quality of, it\u2019s a terrific quality product.", "David Katz", "Got it. And if I can ask one last one, I believe you mentioned in the past that and the question comes up about regulatory scrutiny on the industry overall, and the degree to which that may or may not impact your practices, but I believe you talked about surveillance or tracking on your vacation ownership sales closing execution. And if my memory serves correctly, the percentage was around 70%. Can you just talk about how that number, what the sort of factors around that that percentage going up or down I suppose could be in the near-term? And just how you are thinking about this kind of regulatory scrutiny context that comes up with investors all the time?", "Steve Holmes", "Well couple of thoughts and then Tom could add whatever he likes as well. This has been a highly regulated industry for decades which is a really, really good thing. There used to be some kind of bad actors in this industry and many of them have been eliminated because of the good regulatory environment. So we encourage regulation, we encourage prosecution of the bad guys who are the bad resellers; we do everything we can to continue to build the integrity and the respect of this industry. And I think it's improved dramatically if you follow this industry 15 years ago and you look at it now.", "The current flurry of activity has not really influenced how we're operating the business; I think you're referring to our videotaping of closings. We started that before any of this recent flurry has cropped up and we started doing it because we thought we could learn more by understanding how our consumer is understanding our product offering to make sure that our specialist presenter programs and others are the best that they can be.", "So this is a constant effort on our part and we survey our customers, we do the video recordings and we also do the closings by the QAs. It's just something we've been doing for years and that\u2019s just the way we -- that\u2019s just the way we manage the business always wanting to improve that.", "Tom Conforti", "Yes, David, you had mentioned what was the limit -- we are at 70, what's the limitation? The limitation is technology and we're exploring ways to develop mobile technology or utilize mobile technology to be able to video record the whole system at some point. But we haven't found the right technology solution at this point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura. Please go ahead.", "Harry Curtis", "Hi good morning. So I'm just trying to drill in to these the third-party issue a little bit more. To what extent is the Ovation plan a response to what these third-party folks are offering. Is there a connection first, that's my first question?", "Steve Holmes", "The answer is no, we started the Ovation program which is really for our customers who have already paid their loans and have been owners for some time. We started that over years ago -- couple of years ago.", "Harry Curtis", "Okay. So in trying to understand the Ovation program a little bit deeper is there, to what degree -- I'm not sure I really understand or can articulate the question. But to the extent that there is a loan out there, what happens to that loan if you make them an offer to take that unit or interest back?", "Steve Holmes", "Well those aren't the people that we are approaching with Ovation, the people that are right now are taking advantage of Ovation program are ones who have paid off their loans and are people have been around for while usually there is some change in their situation, they lost their job, their health is gone bad, they -- we noticed that they are not using their product as much as they historically had used it. So we will reach out to them and say, can we book a vacation for you, if not, is there some reason that you're not using your product. And we just want them to gracefully exit if they don't want it. We don't want them to feel like they're trapped into paying maintenance fees, so we'll give them a way out, and then we can take that product and resell it to somebody else. So it's really just a kind of a recycling program for those people who have kind of reached their term.", "Now, to be honest, we have not gotten that kind of response that we were thinking we might see on Ovation not as many people have taken us up on the offering, but we're going to continue to refine it and improve it and we think it will be nice way to get people to recycle out and leave gracefully.", "Harry Curtis", "Okay. And thank you. And my last question goes back to the second half provisions. You mentioned that the second quarter provision is roughly the same as the first and so in your annual guidance are you assuming that that the provision will be roughly the same as it was last year?", "Tom Conforti", "Harry, I think that we expected there will be some continuation although probably not at the same rates as we've experienced in the first half of the year. So, but that's constant -- that's a constant area of reassessment frankly, and so what I say to you today may change, month or two down the road as we get a better sense of things.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.", "Carlo Santarelli", "Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the Venezuela devaluation. Obviously it has been hard for just about any company to get capital out there but Tom, did you reference the free cash flow that you noted was negatively impacted by $24 million because I'm just trying to reconcile if it was a write-down what the adjustments would be from a cash and EBITDA perspective?", "Tom Conforti", "Yes, absolutely, it was -- our free cash flow was reduced by $24 million. It struck me odd is well the first time I got through it with my Chief Accounting Officer, but it's a write-down of cash, and so therefore it's cash that had been earned previously that now has been sort of devalued and therefore we have to reverse the prior earnings of cash. I guess is how in my sort of non-accounting mind I would rationalize it. So, yes, it did impact cash flow, and it impact reported EBITDA which we adjusted out because obviously it's not a part and parcel of our daily operations of our business.", "Carlo Santarelli", "Right. So then the cash flow number that you guys provided, the $218 million for the quarter, you are saying is $242 million prior to that reversal?", "Tom Conforti", "That's correct, Carlo.", "Operator", "And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I'll return the floor to our speakers for closing remarks.", "Steve Holmes", "All right thank you all very much and watch out for the Wyndham Reward -- Wyndham Reward Wizard on TV. We will talk to you in the next call.", "Operator", "And this does conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Operator", "Welcome to the Wyndham Worldwide Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "I will now turn the call over to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Margo C. Happer - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO and Tom Conforti, our CFO.", "Before we get started, I want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K filed February 12, 2016 with the SEC.", "We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. Corresponding GAAP measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP are provided in the press release and the tables to the press release, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at wyndhamworldwide.com. Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Margo. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Second quarter results were in line with our expectations. There's great energy across our businesses. While we execute on near-term objectives, we're also looking ahead, making sure we are continually innovating and making prudent investments to ensure strong, continued growth in the years to come. Let's take a look at the key initiatives in each of our businesses.", "Wyndham Hotel Group is making investments in three key areas to ensure the business is well positioned for the future. First, we are redefining what technology means for economy in midscale hotels. Second, as we discussed in recent quarters, we are taking a fresh look at our brands and the guest experience. And third, we are reinventing hotel loyalty with some industry-leading improvements to Wyndham Rewards. Our goals are to continue to increase our value proposition to both our hotel owners and consumers and to drive higher contribution for our hotel owners. We are convinced that this direction is absolutely the correct path to take even though we are implementing these plans in a decelerating RevPAR environment.", "As you might recall, effective January 1 of this year, Wyndham Exchange & Rental became Wyndham Destination Network. The name reflects our expanded vision for the business. We are leveraging the strengths of a portfolio of unique vacation accommodations to provide our worldwide customer base with the options to vacation the way they want.", "We believe that executing this vision will result in higher combined growth than exchange growth or Vacation Rental growth alone. On a practical level, that means we're enhancing technology, continuing to leverage our yield management capabilities and strengthening our marketing across brands. In addition, we recently launched a project to develop the next generation of RCI product offerings. This business continues to deliver on its strategy, despite modest growth in the exchange industry and potential FX headwinds in Europe, resulting from Brexit.", "Finally, in Wyndham Vacation Ownership, we spent the past couple of years transforming our sales process to ensure a great experience for new and existing owners. We've opened new sales centers in key vacation destinations, which will be important to bring new owners into our system. That's our focus. We're increasing our new owner growth target to mid-teens this year, and we're on track to hit that number with a 13% increase recorded in the second quarter. In setting this goal, we realized the short-term margin impact, but the lifetime value of a timeshare buyer remains highly compelling. Also, as we discussed in our last call, our progress is being somewhat muted by the unexpected increase in third-party guided defaults.", "Let me take a moment here to update you on that topic, we are vigorously pursuing legal alternatives against individuals and companies that might improperly be targeting our owners. We've filed the lawsuit and discovery is underway. But at this point, there are no silver bullets. While we're aggressively exploring all options, we think this situation maybe a situation that we lap before we solve.", "Given its size, we believe it is manageable situation as evidenced by our maintaining EBITDA guidance for the year. So stepping back, let me say that as usual, while headwinds do exist, we believe our operational agenda establishes the correct long-term direction for our company.", "Now turning to the quarter, let me point out a few operating highlights in each of the business units. Let's start with the Hotel Group. And as the world's largest hotel franchisor with a concentration in the economy segment, we see a unique opportunity to leverage our strength to enhance the economy hotel experience for both hotel owners and consumers in new ways and on an unprecedented scale.", "While much of the industry's recent development and innovation has been focused in the upscale \u2013 upper upscale and luxury segments, 40% of all rooms are purchased in economy and midscale hotels. We expect this number to continue growing as the global middle class increases from 2 billion to 5 billion over the next 15 years.", "Many of our brands Days Inn, Ramada, Travelodge, and Super 8 have a rich heritage in U.S. brand awareness of over 90%. We are working to enhance the guest experience and tap the full potential of our brands to ensure that we resonate with the next generation of travelers. We initiated this effort a little over a year ago with the transformation of the Wyndham Rewards program. We eliminated award tiers, blackout dates, and other features that make loyalty programs frustrating, confusing and unattainable for many customers. The result of this transformation is that redemptions are up over 90% and nearly 6 million people have joined the program since its re-launch.", "Our goal is to create the industry's top rank loyalty program. To support that effort, our summer umbrella marketing campaign is underway now, through the busy Labor Day week, bolstered by a $20 million national advertising campaign featuring the Wyndham Reward Wyzard. Of course, the best loyalty program in the world is irrelevant without a strong consumer value proposition. So, we recently completed a global research study to help us enhance the guest experience and better define the value and positioning of each one of our hotel brands. Based on this research, we're developing new marketing campaigns, digital experiences, websites, on-property amenities, travel perks, and marketing partnerships.", "On the technology front, our transformational cloud-based property management and central reservation system installations are proceeding on schedule. We recently completed a flawless migration of the Wyndham Hotel and Resorts, Wyndham Garden, and Wyndham Grand Hotels to the Sabre central reservation system. And our migration to the Sabre property management system is progressing equally well. We now have nearly 1,600 of our economy and midscale hotels operating on the new PMS system, utilizing or preparing to utilize the new automated revenue management tools, the first for the economy space.", "Supporting all of this is our continued focus on quality as we work to remove properties that are no longer up to our brand standards. These efforts have helped raise our overall customer satisfaction and net promoter scores across our brands", "Now let's turn to Wyndham Destination Network. We continue to add to our scale, geographic reach and diversity of experiences within our portfolio. This year, RCI announced new affiliations in China, Japan, the Czech Republic, Portugal, the Canary Islands, England and Mexico. These affiliations include one-of-a-kind experiences such as the family-themed Nickelodeon Hotels & Resorts in Punta Cana and two resorts within the first Cirque du Soleil themed park, which is now under development in Nuevo Vallarta.", "All told, Wyndham Destination Network offers more than 112,000 properties to the everyday traveler in over 100 countries. We're seeing strong transaction growth in Croatia, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands, and the outlook is strong for the summer season with third quarter Vacation Rental bookings up 8% compared to 2015.", "Now, I'd like to take a moment here to briefly comment on Brexit and why we don't expect any operational effect on our business. 13% of Wyndham Worldwide revenues comes from Europe, the majority of this from Vacation Rentals. While we are predominantly domestic drive-to vacations, 90% of our Vacation Rental transactions in the UK are made by UK consumers. The same applies in Continental Europe, where over 90% of transactions are made by Continental Europeans, primarily German, Dutch and Danish consumers traveling to Continental European destinations.", "Our Rental brands have traditionally performed well in periods of economic and political turmoil because of our outstanding drive-to locations and strong value proposition. And our large inventory in the UK and nearly 40,000 units positions us well should demand for UK vacations increase due to the depreciation of the pound. So, while we may experience some additional FX headwinds resulting from the Brexit decision, which Tom will discuss in a moment, we do not expect any change in overall demand or impact on bookings.", "Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. As I mentioned earlier, the team is doing a great job of executing their plan to bring in new owners. Our new sales centers in New York, St. Thomas, Puerto Rico, Southern California and Las Vegas are performing well, generating strong growth in new owner tour flow. About half of our new owner tours are sourced through our community marketing programs and alliances, which put the Wyndham Vacation Ownership product front and center in desirable vacation locations.", "Our community marketing programs include local outreach at malls and representation at events such as NASCAR. We focus on venue and alliance partners whose customers match our timeshare owner demographics. Our alliance partners share a commitment to truly knowing their customers and providing great experiences for them. These partnerships provide Wyndham Vacation Ownership with access to potential tours, while enabling existing owners to use their points for new services, benefits or products offered by our alliance partners. Our partners typically benefit from increased product exposure and incremental income, while we gain scalable access to large segments of consumers. It's a win for us, for our partners and for our owners.", "We've enjoyed much success over the years partnering with major brands to fuel our growth and expansion in markets such as Caesars in Las Vegas, Outrigger in Hawaii and Margaritaville in the Caribbean. Of course, we also continue to connect our hotels and Vacation Ownership brands through Wyndham Rewards. We're constantly improving and enhancing our marketing efforts for distribution and efficiency. One great recent example of a new alliance is Norwegian Cruise Lines. Potential new owners can purchase land and sea vacations combining a cruise with a stay at a nearby Wyndham resort.", "Another is our alliance with Avis Budget Group, which includes a call transfer program and also enables our owners to rent a car using their timeshare points. And we've recently signed a new alliance with a major tour operator in New York. Individually, none of these sources is intended to account more than 5% of our tour flow, but collectively, they serve to broaden our marketing reach and grow our pipeline of prospective new owners.", "Now let me turn the call over to Tom for details on the quarter's results. Tom?", "Thomas G. Conforti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. As Steve mentioned, results for the second quarter were in line with our expectations. On a currency-neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA increased 3% in the quarter, as higher revenues at our businesses were muted by higher provision for loan loss at Vacation Ownership, which while large was in line with our expectations.", "We generated $616 million of free cash flow in the first six months of the year compared to $625 million over the first six months of 2015. Now recall that 2016 results include the negative effect of an unanticipated Venezuelan currency devaluation in the first quarter, which reduced free cash flow by $24 million.", "In total, our free cash flow has been adversely affected by $35 million of unexpected foreign exchange headwinds over the first six months of 2016, including the impact from Venezuela and an additional $11 million, primarily from a devaluation of the British pound. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of stock for $150 million. We've reduced our weighted average share count by 7% year-over-year through share repurchases made during the last 12 months. In addition, we've repurchased 600,000 shares for $42 million so far in the third quarter of 2016.", "Now let's take a look at the performance of each of our business units. At our Hotel Group, revenues were flat, reflecting difficult year-over-year comparisons. Higher royalties and growth in the Wyndham Rewards Credit Card program were offset by the absence of $3 million of global conference fees and $2 million in termination fees from two large properties that left the system in the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased 4%, reflecting higher royalties and growth in the Wyndham Rewards Credit Card program, as well as cost containment measures, offset somewhat by the lower termination fees.", "Domestic RevPAR increased 2%; that increase reflects higher room rates. Excluding oil producing-regions, domestic RevPAR actually grew 3.3%. RevPAR in the oil-producing markets was down 16%. Remember that RevPAR in these regions was down 28% in the first quarter, so we're happy to see some sequential improvement. System-wide RevPAR was flat in constant currency, pressured by the continued unit growth of lower RevPAR hotels in China, which has also been experiencing some market softness and continued weakness in the Canadian oil markets.", "Excluding China and in constant currency, global RevPAR increased 1.6%, which includes about 120 basis points unfavorable impact from domestic and Canadian oil markets.", "Net system size grew 2.2% year-over-year, which is net of the impact of our continued focus on improving the overall quality of our system. Our development pipeline is nearly 128,000 rooms. That's a 10% increase over prior year, which includes a 21% increase in domestic new construction activity with a concentration in our higher-end brands, particularly our Wyndham brand.", "Moving on to our Destination Network segment, on a currency-neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, revenues increased 1% and EBITDA 2%. At RCI, exchange revenues increased 1% in constant currency, reflecting a 0.7% increase in the average number of members and a 0.3% increase in revenue per member. Vacation Rentals' revenue for the quarter was also up 1% in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions. A 4% increase in volume was offset by a 3.3% decline in the average net price per rental.", "Transaction growth was particularly strong in the UK-based Hoseasons business, as well as our Denmark-based Novasol brands, and was reduced a bit due to the shift of the Easter holiday into the first quarter of 2016. Faster growth in our more moderate product offerings adversely impacted the average net price per rental.", "At our Vacation Ownership business, revenues increased 1% and EBITDA 3%. Results benefited from an increase in gross VOI sales and property management fees, partially offset by a higher provision for loan losses.", "EBITDA further benefited from lower cost of goods sold. Gross VOI sales increased 3% in constant currency and the number of new owners increased 13%, in line with our previously-stated goal of increasing new owner sales. Sales to existing owners was flat. The growth in gross VOI sales reflected a 3.4% increase in tour flow, offset by a 0.8% constant currency decline of VPG.", "Now VPG was impacted by higher sales to new owners, which are generally less efficient than upgrade sales, while tour flow benefited from higher arrivals in tours at both our newer and existing sale centers. Second quarter consumer finance portfolio performance was in line with our expectations at the end of the first quarter, which included the activity by third parties, encouraging our owners to cancel their contracts.", "Our average FICO score of originations during the quarter was 727, and that's consistent with our underwriting standards of the past year. Defaults for the quarter were $74 million. That's an increase of $14 million, which was almost entirely due to the organized third-party efforts. Both of these numbers were consistent with our expectations. The provision for loan loss was $90 million in the second quarter, resulting in an overall reserve level of 17.7%, consistent with recent levels over the past three years.", "It's worth emphasizing that the increase in the provision is in line with our expectations when we last spoke to you in April, with the breakdown as follows. $12 million from third parties causing our owners to default, $8 million from higher sales volume and financing propensity, and $10 million from comparisons to favorable performance trends in the second quarter of 2015. Remember that the provision flow-through to EBITDA is approximately 60%.", "As Steve said, we're continuing to work on the third-party issue and in the meantime, the situation is tracking to our expectations. We calculate that the EBITDA impact in the first six months has been around $15 million. We estimate the third quarter EBITDA effect to be $8 million.", "Company-wide, net interest expense increased by $4 million in the second quarter compared with the same period of 2015, reflecting higher levels of debt, including the $350 million 5.1% bonds issued last September, as well as the absence of a fixed to floating interest rate swap that we terminated in the second quarter of 2015. Depreciation also increased as we brought new long-term projects into service.", "Corporate expenses increased by $2 million, largely due to higher stock-based compensation expenses. And these expenses were offset somewhat by cost-cutting initiatives. At Vacation Ownership, we completed our second term securitization of the year in July, the $375 million Sierra 2016-2 transaction had a 90% advance rate and a 2.42% weighted average coupon. That's nearly 80 basis points below our prior 2016-1 transaction, as we benefited from lower post-Brexit interest rates and generally improved market conditions.", "Now, let's turn to guidance, which will be posted on the website after the call. As you saw from the press release, we're increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to $5.68 to $5.82 for the full year. And diluted share count goes to 111.8 million shares, reflecting the benefit of our second quarter share repurchases.", "We're fine-tuning our revenue guidance, lowering the overall range by $150 million. Approximately $50 million of the adjustment relates primarily to a forecast correction in our hotel management gross up at the Hotel Group, which has no EBITDA impact. The remainder is at Vacation Ownership and primarily reflects our best view of the impact of third party prompted defaults.", "Just a reminder, in timeshare accounting, the provision for anticipated defaults is a contra-revenue account. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance remains unchanged at $1.375 billion to $1.400 billion. Note that this guidance incorporates a negative $17 million year-over-year EBITDA impact from changes in foreign exchange rates, $6 million higher than in the full-year guidance that we issued in April, largely due to the impact of Brexit on the British pound.", "We expect the EBITDA impact from third-party defaults to be around $30 million this year. But we are holding our adjusted EBITDA guidance range for Vacation Ownership and the overall company. However, given these headwinds, we are more comfortable at the lower end of our EBITDA guidance range. There are no changes to drive our guidance, although remember we said on the last call that RevPAR would be at the lower end of our guidance range, which implies flat global RevPAR.", "Our neighborhood target for 2016 free cash flow remains $800 million. As always, keep in mind that there can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter or any given year, so we view $800 million as a neighborhood target rather than an exact figure. In addition, we are facing two free cash flow headwinds this year. First, as discussed, we have $35 million of unexpected foreign exchange headwinds year-to-date. Second, remember that as part of our strategy to drive new owner growth at timeshare, we are increasing financing to creditworthy customers, which will have an adverse short-term impact on free cash flow in 2016. However, we regain around 90% of that spend in financing activities from the receivables we securitize, and that is outside of our free cash flow definition. Typically, our receivables age four to five months before they enter a term securitization, so this is a short-term investment and not a long-term investment in the business.", "Now, turning to the third quarter, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.84 to $1.87, which includes an $8 million foreign exchange impact. You'll note seasonality differences between our expectations and current analyst estimates. Our results are heavily weighted to the fourth quarter this year, reflecting expected revenue improvements in timeshare, as new sales sites become fully operational, and then, our hotel business as the oil impact comparisons moderate. In addition, we expect increased benefit from disciplined cost management in the fourth quarter. Remember that we don't budget repurchases into our guidance either.", "So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve. Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Tom. Monday will mark our 10-year anniversary of Wyndham Worldwide's listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Before we close, I'd like to take a moment to comment on our performance since then. Between dividends and share repurchases, we have returned nearly $6 billion to our shareholders. The accumulative impact of our share repurchase activity over this period has been a 45% reduction in our share count. This combined with the strong operating performance in growth has driven significant increases in key metrics.", "Just to put a few numbers around it, adjusted EBITDA is up over 80% and adjusted EPS is up over 225%. Looking forward, we see great opportunities in all of our businesses for future growth. We remain relentlessly focused on continuous innovation and execution of strategies that will deliver a compelling value to our customers and great returns for our shareholders, both now and in the future.", "I am extremely proud of the culture we've built and the team we have, delivering value to our customers and our shareholders every day. And the passion of our 39,000 associates is also a source of great pride. Thanks for your continued support, enjoy the summer, travel and remember to tune into the Wyndham Championship August 18 to August 21 on the Golf Channel in CBS.", "And with that, Erica, we can now open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go first to the side of Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Good morning, everybody.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Joe.", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Maybe not surprisingly, I have a bunch of questions on loan loss provisioning and you gave a lot of data on this call and I just want to make sure I'm understanding this correctly. So, revenue is off $150 million this guidance versus the prior quarter's full-year guidance. $50 million relates to hotel pass-throughs, that leaves us with $100 million. Of that $100 million, the majority of that relates to loan loss provision in Vacation Ownership. And then you mentioned about 60% flow through on that impact which would generate $60 million of EBITDA. And I think you said the impact from the third-party activity is $30 million for this year. So, I'm missing something. Can you just explain maybe what I'm missing there?", "Thomas G. Conforti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. So, Joe, it's $50 million for hotel. That brings it down to $100 million for timeshare. If you take the $30 million to EBITDA and assume that number is 60% of the revenue number that means that the lost revenue associated with the higher provision is $50 million. So, that leaves us another $50 million. And that other $50 million is we're bringing our gross VOI expectations down to the lower end of our gross VOI range. And that's how we get the $150 million.", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Got it. Okay, an extra $50 million for lower growth VOI sales. And what's driving that $50 million delta in growth VOI sales now versus a quarter ago?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Joe, I think we're just getting better visibility into how the new sales centers are operating. We are driving more new owner growth, which is what we're really focused on. And it does come at the expense of some gross VOI. If you imagine a sales center where we have 30 sales associates, we're putting more new owners in front of those sales associates. So that means they're selling new owners versus upgrade owners. Upgrade owners produce more in a sale than a new owner does. So, I think it's just us kind of getting our arms around the balancing of that and what it looks like.", "Again, we're not changing EBITDA because we're managing through it, but it means that each sales office might be a little bit lighter than we thought on \u2013 as a result of the new owner generation. We like the outcome, it's what we're shooting for. It just means a very minor modification on the top.", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you. And, Steve, your comment leads me to my next question where you're managing for EBITDA and you're managing through some of these buckets of revenue headwinds. Where are you extracting cost savings or expense management? What are the big buckets across the reportable segments? I'd imagine much like the 2Q, it's across all three reportable segments, not just in VO.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I mean, it \u2013 we run a, as you know, a pretty lean shop here. But there's always opportunities to look at our cost base and so we are taking a very hard look at our costs and making sure we are as efficient as we could possibly be. The other thing is we have cost of goods sales which we have been able to manage down through some efficient inventory acquisition methods, and so that's helping us get there. But in the end of the day, we're dedicated to hitting our number, and one of the costs we have is variable costs at the end of the year related to bonuses and things that if we're not at our number, that's going to be something that will have to be considered.", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then my final question kind of going back to the loan loss provisioning and your comments that the flow through at 60%, why isn't it 100% and what does that 40% delta relate to?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "It relates to the recapture of inventory. When we take back inventory, there's a value to it and that value is recaptured. So, it's not 100% loss.", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. So, is that a function of prior reserves against that incremental loan loss?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, it means if you have a loan and there's a piece of timeshare associated with it, which there would be, if you default on the loan, we'll take back that inventory. And as you know, Joe, we're going to sell it for more than we probably originally sold it for because there's no depreciation in that asset. It's one of the wonderful things about the timeshare model.", "So, as we take it back in, we're required to put that on our balance sheet at a value and the net result is it's a flow-through of about 60%. Am I describing that right?", "Thomas G. Conforti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Correct, Steve.", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you, guys.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Joe.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from the site of Patrick Scholes from SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions here. What exactly is for the hotel segment, you had a $50 million revenue forecast correction. What exactly is that? I haven't heard that term before.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Patrick, it's a simple thing. When we set our budgets at the beginning of the year, we knew that there were certain managed properties that were going to leave our system. The business unit budgeted for the inclusion of those units for the full year. And so, what we did is the pass through, so the cost that we incur in managing that, we also offset that dollar-for-dollar with revenue recognition. And so, simply, it was the inclusion of hotels that shouldn't have been included for the full year on revenue that has zero margin.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay, so a higher degree that some of the managed properties. Now, as I recall, you don't have a lot of managed properties to start with; how many are you losing?", "Thomas G. Conforti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "In this case, it was three particularly important or three larger managed properties.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Are those the FelCor properties?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, no. These are \u2013 two of them were Dolce properties that departed as a result of the acquisition. We knew they were leaving. And another is a property in Florida. We \u2013 this was probably the simpler vernacular for it is we blew the forecast on this. They should not have been included in the budget initially. We didn't include the income from the management fees, but we did include the pass through costs. So, it was just kind of a correction of that missed budget.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay, let's move on here. Then my next question, when you talked about the provision change breakdown, the third category was \u2013 correct me if I am wrong \u2013 was $10 million from comparison or favorable comparisons from good performance. What exactly is that, how is that not just more defaults or is it more defaults?", "Thomas G. Conforti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No. No. No. So, the last $10 million, in 2015, you might recall that our provision on a relative basis was declining. And the reason was we had favorable default trends. And so, we were just simply reflecting in the second quarter of last year favorable default trends, which led to lower provision of about $10 million and those trends were \u2013 those positive trends obviously, in this particular environment, we weren't able to recognize those same benefits in 2016. So, it's simply favorable default trends in 2015 that were reflected by a lower provision rate.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. So as I understand it, this is separate from the third-party defaults and it's just a higher belief that outside of those third-party defaults that you will have more defaults, correct?", "Thomas G. Conforti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, so, the $12 million we cited was the effect of third-party guided defaults. That is component number one. The second number that I quoted reflected higher volume and greater financing propensity. We've talked about our commitment to lower the down payment. And so, those two factors were the second number. And the third factor for year-to-year comparisons was that in 2015, we had favorable default trends and we were able to lower our provision in 2015. We're not able to make a similar reduction in 2016. So, for year-to-year comparisons, we didn't have that benefit that we had in 2015.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Last question on the Diamond Resorts financials that came out a couple of days ago concerning the pending acquisition, it listed in there a public company that had made an offer. Can you comment on that or confirm or deny it was or wasn't you folks?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, we don't. As you know, Patrick, we don't comment on M&A activity. And so, I won't make a comment about that.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "All right.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we'll go next to the side of Chris Agnew from MKM Partners. Please go ahead.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "Thanks very much. Good morning.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Chris.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "Your revenue guidance assumes acceleration and growth in the second half of the year. What gives you confidence in revenues accelerating and what would get you to the high-end of your guidance range? Thanks.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Chris, I cited two things that we were counting on for improved revenue performance. One is \u2013 and we know this will materialize, the effect of the disruption in the oil-producing regions, we saw an improvement quarter-to-quarter. Last quarter, we had a 28% reduction. This quarter, we only had a 16%. By the end of the year, that number should be fully mitigated. So, we'll pick up revenue there in the Hotel Group.", "And in the timeshare business, we cited particularly importantly, the sort of the maturing of the new sales centers that we've opened and the additional use of lower down payments. So, we're optimistic that both of those factors will lead to an improvement in the timeshare business.", "Steve, do you want to add any color to that?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No. That's basically it. We scrub these forecasts very carefully and push to make sure that we know where our sources are coming from and we're comfortable.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "Got you. Thanks. Can you give any color on the progression of the oil-producing or the impact from oil-producing states through the quarter, monthly, sequential progression, see how you ended up coming out of the quarter?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You mean month-by-month progression?", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "Yeah, just the color the improvement.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, the improvement was \u2013 I don't remember if June was better than May, but certainly May and June were better than April on a comparative basis. So, there was sequential improvement. The \u2013 so where we think ultimately we're going to lap this downturn, but we think that there probably is some lessening of the impact.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "Okay. Thank you. And then last question, some of the other timeshare companies have not been impacted by third-party guided defaults or have a very limited impact. Have any thoughts on why you've been targeted or why this is a bigger impact for you rather than other companies?", "Thomas G. Conforti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, Chris, I would dispute the opening part of that statement because I was down at the conference for the timeshare industry, and even mid-sized players have seen an increase in this activity and I've \u2013 all the large players I talked to have seen this activity. It's a question of how much is there. And when you're the largest in the industry, you obviously have the largest opportunity for people to make money based on your customer base. And so I think that we probably are a little bit more of a soft target for people because we're so much bigger. But I think everybody is seeing it. And we've had to deal with this before and we'll shut it down. I think, importantly, as I said, we see us being able to tackle this problem, but we probably won't get it beat back until we start lapping it, which is next year. But we feel even with what we're seeing, we're covering it and we're keeping our EBITDA guidance the same.", "The fact is, it came in this quarter right online with our expectation. I could not have said that about the first quarter because we weren't really sure what was going to happen. We were \u2013 we had a broader estimate. This quarter, we were pretty accurate with what we saw coming in. So, we feel like we've got our arms around this, it's not what we would like, which is for it just to go away. But these guys, they don't just go away, they're making money and they're going to keep playing the game for as long until some of them go to jail.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "Got you. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to David Katz from Telsey Group. Please go ahead.", "David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Hi. Good morning.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, David.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey, Dave.", "David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "I'll apologize for going back to this issue given all the other interesting business dynamics you have going on here, but with respect to the lawsuits and your legal actions with this, I believe at a public conference a couple of months ago or a month or so ago there was discussion about injunctions, which I assume are intended to put a stop, right, or to mitigate what's going on today. And I would just be curious sort of where that stands? And to the degree that you're launching lawsuits, are they in pursuit of remedies or getting money back or are we suing for injunctions? What are we hoping to accomplish with some of these legal actions? And I did notice lastly that it grew by $1 million for the third quarter expectation. Are we really comfortable that it's not going to continue to grow through the remainder of the year? And then I really do have a business-related question.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Well, I'm not going to go into too much comment about lawsuits because it's something that we shouldn't be talking a lot about. Basically \u2013 let me give you as an example what we've done in the past. We want to shut this down. It's something illegal is happening because our customer information is getting put into other people's hands and it's being used to aggressively pursue our customers. And that's something that we need to stop.", "So, the only way you can stop it is to find out who's doing it and how's it happening. And in order to go through that discovery process, the best way to go about it is to file a lawsuit and start looking inside the inner workings of some of these enterprises. And that's what we did last time. And that's the way lawsuits usually progress. I don't know what you're referring to with the injunctions. I don't \u2013 that's not something I'm familiar with, it may have been somebody else's comment. But that's not something that I'm familiar with.", "David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Okay. With respect to the Hotel Group, you mentioned in your comments about removing rooms from the system. Are we able to tell from the very copious disclosure that we have, how many rooms did you remove and are they oriented toward some brands more than others? And what expectation do you have in terms of removing rooms going forward, cleansing the system?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thanks, David. There's always been a certain level of churn in our system with these economy hotels. Generally and I don't know about percentages for the quarters. But generally, we add about 6%. We take out about 3% or 4%, which gives us a net 3% growth roughly. That's rough numbers. That varies by brands, but it's in all of our brands. Our largest brands are Days Inn, Super 8 and, obviously, there's a number that leave from there. But there's a number that leave from Howard Johnson, Ramada and Travelodge and all of our brands. So, it's a normal activity of our business that for the 20-plus years I've been involved with it has been kind of the standard operating procedure. You love to have to not to kick out anyone, but quality is something that we will not compromise on.", "David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Understand. Thank you very much.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jared Shojaian from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hi. Good morning. Thank you.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Jared.", "Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC", "So, I appreciate all the color here on the loan losses, but it sounds like that 50% growth rate here in the second quarter is the right run rate for the back half of the year. But just want to make sure I'm understanding you correctly, is your expectation that this is completely lapped by 1Q 2017 or could we see more trickle effect into next year?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think we'll probably see an impact of lapping and reduction in 2017, yes. So, I guess, the answer to your question is yes.", "Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. And then what's driving the 32% decline in timeshare expenses in the quarter? Is that just the expenses associated with the revenue forecast adjustment or is any of that from the Ovation program and what's the right run rate here going forward?", "Thomas G. Conforti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I'm not quite sure, Jared. It's Tom. I'm not quite sure what the 32% reduction that you're referring to. Is it something specific?", "Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC", "Yes, the cost of Vacation Ownership interest.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Oh, VOI sales, the cost of goods sold.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "The cost of goods sold.", "Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC", "Right.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. The cost of goods sold is coming about from two sources. One is the \u2013 has to do with the recycling of inventory. And we're able to take in lower-cost inventory that way. I think that's the largest piece of it. And there's some other costs in one of our brands that are \u2013 we're putting lower-cost inventory into one of our brands than we had in previous periods. It's a bit of a technical term, but that's what it basically comes down to. We're sourcing lower-cost inventory through cycled inventory and some of the new inventory we're putting into one of our brands is of lower cost.", "Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC", "Got it. Okay. Thank you.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Harry Curtis from Nomura. Please go ahead.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning. I'll just add \u2013 or ask one other quick question, Steve, about the provision. You sound pretty confident that in 2017 you'll reduce the provision. What needs to happen to actually get a reduction in the provision? It sounds like you're kind of anticipating a positive legal outcome to achieve that.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, Harry. I never handicap lawsuits. It's too hard to do that. So, I wouldn't say we're going to get a positive income \u2013 outcome. I think we're going to become more educated and we'll understand what these people are doing, and if they're doing illegal activities, we do expect to be able to point prosecution in the right direction. That's what we've done in the past. I think my confidence comes as much from lapping the problem as it does solving the problem. As I said, there's no silver bullet here. What I think we have the ability to do is \u2013 I think we do have the ability to turn it back and we have done that in the past, but I also think that by Q1, we will be lapping the issue. So, it won't be an increase in the provision anymore, in the absence of an increase, will be flat or reduced provision. That's more of what I'm talking about for Q1.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Harry, it's Tom. Let me add just a thought. And there is a school of thought that says what we're seeing now is sort of an acceleration of defaults that may have taken place at some point in time. We saw that in 2012 when we had a similar type of issue, that there was a spike in defaults in the near term, and then the loss curve leveled out much quicker. And so, to Steve's point, there is a school of thought that says what we're seeing now is a bit of an acceleration of the activity that might have happened in the future, that won't happen in the future because it's happening now. And that might be an optimistic view of it, but that's the experience we had in 2012 and 2013.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question is between the \u2013 increasing your financing to creditworthy customers, I guess the first part of the question is, why are you doing that now? And then the lower down payments, it seems like you're getting more aggressive to generate incremental sales; again, why have you changed your sales techniques, if you will, or getting more aggressive?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's not really getting more aggressive, Harry, it's actually getting somewhat opportunistic. We manage the amount of down payment that we require from customers based on basically our compensation model with our sales people. We incentivize them to get certain levels of down payments. When we stood back and looked at this during our strategic planning, we said we're actually leaving a lot of money on the table because we have very, very good credit worthy customers that we're not allowing to borrow more than X amount of dollars.", "So, what if we allowed them to borrow a little bit more? Would that give us an opportunity to actually grow our EBITDA in the future, as we're going to be driving more interest income, and as you know, the spread there is pretty good. So, this was more \u2013 this had nothing to do with defaults or anything, this has everything to do with us strategically taking advantage of what we've thought was a real opportunity. And we still feel that way, evidenced by the fact that our FICO scores are the same as they were before and we're kind of opening the spigot a little bit.", "This is not big movement; this is relatively small movement. And as I said, I think, the last quarter, we probably wouldn't even talk about it if it didn't have a free cash flow impact. It potentially does have a current period free cash flow impact because we don't recover those \u2013 the cash that we put out for those receivables until we go through a securitization, which generally takes three to four months. So, it's really just a \u2013 if not for the cash flow thing, you probably wouldn't even notice it. But, it's \u2013 I think, it's the right \u2013 strategically the right thing for us to do for the company for the long term. And that's why we made the decision to do it.", "One other thing I'd say on your first question, Harry, is don't lose sight of the fact that this business is still hitting its numbers, its EBITDA number, despite this pressure from the provision. So, these guys are really good at managing their business, they're very thoughtful, and when they see pressures like this as we did with the cease and desist a few years ago, we adapt and adjust and we make our numbers. And that's one thing we're very committed to do at this business, and we've done it successfully for 10 years now.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hey, everyone. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Carlo.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "With respect to the new sales centers that you guys have opened and are starting to kind of get some traction and with respect to the attempt to drive kind of a mid-teens growth within the new owner base, what are you guys doing to target kind of the millennials at this stage?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we gather them in our basket of consumers that we talk to because in essence, what we're doing is we're capturing the traveling public into our tour flow mix. And just looking at the statistics of what's happening in the industry overall, there's been a dramatic decline in the average age of buyer from 54, maybe five years ago, 54 was the average age, to now the average age is 39 years old according to ARDA. Is that right, 39?", "Thomas G. Conforti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "39.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, 39, which is a remarkable decline. Well that means that there's younger people buying the product than there used to be, and yet, our numbers and others in the industry continue to increase. So, I think the fact is, we are capturing them in our marketing net and they are buying. We do stress different things with our sales pitches. For example, we'll talk more about experiences because millennials tend to lean towards experiences. So, we make it more experiential of what you'll have with these trips, and which we can take advantage of with timeshare. But that's just describing the product differently to suit the desires of the buyer. It doesn't change necessarily our product. It's just pointing out what you can do with your timeshare.", "And I think the fact is the flexibility we gave timeshare buyers, both us and the rest of the industry by going to a points based product really addressed much of what a millennial will want to see, which is, I want more flexibility, I want more ability to make my vacations the way I want them to be. And so, that is what we're delivering.", "We're obviously increasing our ability to do more bookings online. That's something that's been very important. We actually have been talking about this for several years. We're launching a new program called Voyager that is building that capability that'll make it easier for people to go on their iPhone to make decisions about their vacation planning. So, we're doing \u2013 there's a lot that we're doing, but we're seeing the capture happen just across the industry, not just us.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thank you. And then if I may just one quick follow-up. As it pertains to your current guidance, Tom, correct me if I'm wrong but the FX impacts that you are seeing right now, how are they being contemplated for the back half of the year within the current guide?", "Thomas G. Conforti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So, the assumptions we've made are based on current foreign exchange rates. We don't project going forward, Carlo, what direction rates might take. So whatever the rates are at the end of the second quarter, those are the rates that we include in all of our forecasts going forward. And that's where we got to $17 million number for EBITDA. And the year-to-date number on cash flow was a little bigger, $35 million, because of the Venezuelan situation that happened in the first quarter.", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Right.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So, we're just using second quarter ended FX rates..", "Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. That's perfect. Thank you both very much.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And we'll take our final question from Patrick Scholes from SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Hi. How are you? Just a follow-up question, one thing I guess hasn't been discussed here is when we talk about up-ticking and defaulting. What underlying causes are making these people defaulting in the first place here? What do you see and what may be changing of late?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, that, Patrick, we talked about that a little bit before. That's part of what we're investigating to understand more about. What we know is that people are \u2013 third parties are calling our owners and are encouraging them to default. Exactly what their pitch is to make them do that, we're not sure. We don't know what their promising them. We don't \u2013 because at that point that they come to us, our customers come to us and say that they don't want us to talk to them anymore because they're being represented. Then we can't talk to them anymore. And that's the wonderful consumer protections that we have.", "So, we don't have the ability to dialogue with our customers to ask them what convinced you that you wanted to default? You've been taking vacations for the last 10 years and you've been enjoying yourself. What is making you default at this point? So, we're not sure what promises are being made. We're finding more about that and we will continue to find out more about that through our process. But the fact is we have hugely high customer satisfaction. We have probably record occupancy in our timeshare resorts this year. So, the product is being used. People are buying more of it. It's a very highly regarded product. So, we don't know exactly why, and remember, this is a very small number on a base of a million owners that are actually being addressed with this concern.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "As far as when you say a small number out of that million, what roughly, did you say in the past it was about 600 people?", "Thomas G. Conforti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "In that neighborhood, Patrick, it's measured in hundreds to Steve's point...", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "...out of base of the million. So but we know it's a business of large numbers and some incremental shift, albeit, a small incremental shift, if that incremental shift equates to $15,000 or whatever the number is thereabouts that gets defaulted, that adds up to a lot of money in a hurry, so.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "But Steve said, the level of our owner enjoyment is exceptionally strong. And so, we're talking about sort of an incremental effect here.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "At this time, we have no further questions. I'd like to turn it back over to our speakers for any closing remarks.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, Erica. Thank you very much. Well, thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you soon.", "Operator", "We'd like to thank everybody for their participation on today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. ", "Margo Happer", "Good morning, thank you for joining us. With me today is Steve Holmes our CEO and Tom Conforti, our CFO. Before we get started I want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10K filed February 12, 2016 with the SEC.", "We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. Corresponding GAAP measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP are provided in the press release and the tables to the press release which are available on the investor relations section of our website at wyndhamworldwide.com. Steve? ", "Stephen Holmes", "Thanks, Margo. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'll start by sharing our view of the quarter and some business unit highlights and then Tom will go into more details. As you saw in our release, revenues in constant currency and excluding acquisitions were up slightly and adjusted EBITDA grew 5% consistent with our expectations.", "The hotel industry cycle appears to be moderating to historical norms coming off years of accelerated growth starting in 2010 following the recession. Despite reported sluggish global economic growth, people around the world are committed to spending time with loved ones. They're looking for unique experiences at all price points and we believe that our diverse portfolio of travel offerings can continue delivering on that growing demand.", "On a business unit level, Wyndham Destination Network and Wyndham Hotel Group had strong quarters with 8% organic adjusted EBITDA growth in constant currency. Wyndham Destination Network achieved robust transaction growth and Wyndham Hotel Group had a solid quarter despite a softening revpar environment supported by growing credit card revenue coming from our Wyndham Rewards efforts and disciplined cost control.", "Adjusted EBITDA results in Wyndham vacation ownership were weaker than expected, our upgrade sales were light but new owner sales were strong. In addition, sales and marketing commissions were higher than we anticipated primarily as a result of modifications we've made to drive new owner sales. This cost overrun was inconsistent with our typical execution standards. We have made subsequent adjustments and the programs are now correctly generating appropriate incentive relative to results. The issue of third-party induced defaults which we have discussed in previous calls improved slightly from the first half of the year. While we were aggressively pursuing legal options, we believe our best defense is a strong base of happy, satisfied, timeshare owners. We dramatically have increased our communication outreach to our customers. We know our owners are happy by surveys we regularly conduct which include every owner touchpoint from sales to collections to owners' stays.", "For example, over 80% of owners this year were satisfied with their Wyndham Vacation. We want to ensure they remain happy with the product and that we are the first to know should they become happy. We believe fourth quarter defaults related to these third-party efforts will modestly improve sequentially. As you know, increasing new owners is our most important strategic initiative at WVO. Along these lines we're making great progress in adding new owners and in bringing in younger owners. Wyndham Vacation Ownership brought more owners into the system in the third quarter than any other quarter since the downturn, 35% of sales were the new owners compared with 33% in the third quarter of last year. and we are happy to see that 25% of new owners, owner transactions year to date, have been consumers under the age of 40. These are great owner results and bode well for the future. In addition we are looking forward to opening at least three new sales centers next year that will further support these efforts.", "Now let's turn to Wyndham Destination Network. Between our timeshare exchange and vacation rental offerings, Wyndham Destination Network is a major player in the sharing economy. But unlike the big online marketplaces, our model goes well beyond linking supply and demand. As the world's largest provider of professionally private accommodations, we connect travelers seeking the authenticity of homestay with owners looking to rent their property. We offer both a range of services -- we offer both of these groups a range of services to ensure a smooth expense.", "For owners we offer yield management, cleaning, maintenance, billing reservations, key handling and marketing. For consumers we offer great travel experiences with trusted brands. We call it peer-to-peer plus. It's about making life easier for consumers and owners and creating maximum value for both. And this is a business that continues to develop first-in segment innovations to capture market share.", "In our rental brands, we introduced our dynamic yield management program a few years ago, driving consistent increases in revenue install locations through optimized pricing and occupancy. Yield management help drive an 8% increase in organic rental transaction volume this quarter, for example, we recently introduced dynamic pricing at Hoseasons Holiday Parks in the UK and our business there is thriving with Q3 revenue growth of nearly 25%.", "Additionally, in 2017, we will launch the next generation of timeshare exchange products which will enable us to tear our membership offering, customized products and expand our services to new and existing RCI members. Let me close by giving you an update on the strategic initiatives at the hotel group. We are solidifying our position as one of the largest and most formidable players in the hotel space through a combination of our growing loyalty program, reinvigorated focused on our hotel brands, continued commitment to quality and are implementation of a new best in class technology infrastructure. Each of our iconic brands is being repositioned and strengthened. We have refreshed marketing campaigns, our new websites are improving online conversion rates by double digits across all devices. In addition, over 30 guest facing and revenue generating pilot initiatives will bring customer value propositions to life for both our franchisees and the traveling guests. This is all being supported by the combined rollout of the industry's largest integrated cloud-based property and revenue management system. Our owners are beginning to see tangible bottom-line benefits. In addition we have already rolled out a new reservation system to our Wyndham and Trip [ph] brands with dolce set for November 17 and Ramada targeted for December.", "All the implications remain on schedule and we look forward to reporting on this performance in upcoming quarters. As I've discussed on previous calls, 24 months ago or so our hotel division began redesigning and expanding our global loyalty program Wyndham Rewards. We bucked the industry in overall loyalty trends by creating the most simple and generous redemption program rewards program in the hotel space. We also enhanced member levels to provide higher recognition and unique experiences from cooking classes to exciting city tours that are included as part of every award redemption in our Top 25 destinations around the world.", "Since its relaunch the results have been outstanding. The program has enrolled over 7 million new members in our hotels, have seen a 200 basis point increase in member occupancy year-to-date compared to last year. Wyndham Rewards members stay 12% longer than nonmembers and generate 64% more in revenue to our franchisees. Wyndham Rewards was also just named the number one hospitality loyalty program by U.S. News & World Report and earlier this month the Wall Street Journal published a front-page story comparing the industries hotel reward programs which found that Wyndham Rewards delivers the strongest consumer value of all.", "Building on this success, today we are announcing the Wyndham Worldwide will be the first hospitality company to globally expand the use of its loyalty program across vacation ownership and vacation rental properties. This will provide members with an unmatched choice of redemption options, create an even stronger proposition for guests to earn point by staying at our hotels, provide a powerful and cost efficient marketing platform for our WVO sales organization and help us attract and reward renters and owners in our vacation rental brands.", "We've always maintained a strategic vision to provide customers with a cohesive platform to access the widest range of places to stay. Our re-energize loyalty program is a major step in achieving that vision. We remain confident in our ability to drive continued growth and value for our shareholders.", "Before turning call over to Tom, let me take a moment to discuss our outlook. As you know, we look for long-term EBITDA compound annual growth rate of 6% to 8% and we have been above that over the past five years. We are just starting our budget process now and we take that process very seriously. At this time it is prudent to give guidance so like our peers we will wait until we finish our budget process but be assured that we will do our best to achieve our long-term objectives next year and beyond and as always to deliver shareholder value.", "With that I will turn the call over to Tom to walk you through more details for this quarter. ", "Thomas Conforti", "Think Steve, good morning everyone. As Steve noted our overall financial performance was in-line with our estimates. Adjusted EBITDA increased 5% in constant currency and excluding acquisitions. As strong results at our destination network and hotel businesses and companywide expense reductions more than offset the underperformance of our timeshare business. We generated $650 million of free cash flow in the first nine months of the year compared with $660 million over the first nine months of 2015. ", "Now remember that our free cash flow has been reduced by $34 million of unexpected foreign exchange headwinds over the first nine months of 2016 including a $24 million impact from a Venezuelan currency devaluation in the first quarter.", "During the quarter we repurchased 2.1 million shares of stock for $150 million. We've reduced our weighted average share count by 7% year-over-year through share repurchases made during the last 12 months. In addition, we have repurchased 700,000 shares for $50 million so far in the fourth quarter 2016.", "Now let's take a look at the performance of each of our business unit. At our hotel group revenues increased 2% reflecting higher royalties, growth in Wyndham Rewards credit card program and global franchisee conference fees partially offset by the loss of pass through revenues from two managed hotels that are no longer in our system.", "Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% reflecting higher royalties and growth in the Wyndham Rewards credit card program as well as expense management initiatives. Domestic revpar increased 1.9% reflecting higher room rates partially offset by lower occupancy, excluding oil-producing regions, domestic revpar grew 3.1%. Revpar in the oil-producing regions which represent approximately 7% of our portfolio declined 15% year-over-year, roughly consistent with 16% decline we saw in quarter two, but a substantial improvement over the 28% declines in both quarter one and the fourth quarter of 2015.", "Pointing to one headwind removed for the fourth quarter. Those of you who have followed us for some time know that are systemwide revpar results have been negatively affected in recent years by our rapid growth in China, where our portfolio consists of hotels that generally had significant lower room rates than our overall system average. Beginning this quarter, we will discuss global revpar on a same-store business to give a more accurate reflection of our underlying revpar performance. So on a same-store basis, systemwide global revpar was up 1.4% in constant currency reflecting flat to modest growth in most major international regions and incorporating a 120 basis point unfavorable impact from domestic and Canadian oil markets.", "Net system size grew 2.7% year-over-year as we continued our focus on improving the overall quality of our system with determination of substandard property, gross room additions increased 5% compared with a third quarter of last year. Our development pipeline is nearly 134,000 rooms that's a 9% increase over the prior-year which includes a 14% increase in domestic new construction activity with a concentration in our higher end brands particularly our Wyndham brand. ", "Moving on to Destination Network, on a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions revenues increased 5% and adjusted EBITDA increased 8%. At RCI exchange revenues increased 2% in constant currency reflecting a 1.4% increase in revenue per member which benefited from higher pricing and 0.9% increase in the average number of members due to growth in North and South America.", "Overall performance continues to benefit from innovation and product extensions. Vacation rentals revenue for the quarter were up 6% in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions and 8% increase in transaction volume was partially offset by 1.7% decline in the average net price per rental. Transaction growth benefited from our dynamic pricing initiative which often results in higher occupancy due to more efficient pricing, especially during off-peak travel weeks. ", "Transactions also benefited from capacity increases as our brands continue to expand both in existing and new markets. Growth was strongest in our UK-based Hoseasons, Denmark-based Novasol and Netherlands based Landal GreenParks Springs . Our continued momentum speaks to the strength of our value proposition with consumers, especially with domestic drive to vacations. Faster growth in our more moderately priced products reduce the average net price per rental, at our vacation ownership business, total revenues and gross VOI sales were flat. As Steve noted, gross VOI sales were below our expectations. The short fall reflects lower-than-expected upgrade tours [ph]. Owner tour flow was dampened by our focus on new owners as well as more targeted marketing efforts. As you know, coming into the year our plan was to grow new owners substantially while keeping sales to existing owners flat. As part of that process we refined our marketing, our owner marketing to be more selective ensuring that we are touring the right owner at the right time. That put a natural but healthy constraint on the number of upgrade tours and it affected third quarter performance more than we anticipated. Year-to-date however, sales to existing owners are tracking ahead of 2015. On the other hand, new owners are crucial to the long-term health of the business and expanding the number of new owners ranks among our most important strategic initiatives. However, bringing in new owners is more costly and takes more effort and that is reflected in lower VPG. Since we sold proportionally more to new owners in the third quarter, it affected our overall VPG [ph] rate was down by 1.4%. Year-to-date we are tracking a little behind our aggressive goal of tripling the growth rate of new owners but we are very pleased with our progress in adding new owners this year.", "Adjusted EBITDA decreased 3% again below our expectations. Year-over-year results reflect a higher loan-loss provision and higher sales and marketing commission costs, partially offset by higher property management fees, consumer financing, interest income along with expense management initiatives.", "Defaults were slightly better and the provision for loan loss was in line with our expectations but worse than 2015. Defaults for the quarter were $7 million, an increase of $10 million was primarily due to the organized third party efforts. The provision for loan loss was $104 million in the third quarter, an increase of $26 million primarily reflecting the third-party activity and a higher level of finance sales, consistent with our strategy of lower down payments.", "Note that we have good visibility four months out into the third-party prompted defaults so our fourth quarter expectations for the provision are $90 million which assumes a year-over-year increase of approximately $25 million, again, primarily related to the third party issue and higher loan originations. Remember that only proximally 60% of the provision will flow through to EBITDA.", "As Steve noted, sales and marketing commissions were higher than we anticipated. Coming into the year, we reworked our commission structures to focus on new owners and we didn't adequately adjust by reducing commission spend in other areas.", "In addition, we anticipated higher upgrade sales with lower commission rates which did not materialize in the quarter. This execution was inconsistent with our typical standard and we have made changes to ensure it doesn't happen again. As Steve noted, we\u2019ve adjusted the commission program and it is running at the proper level. In addition, we're instituting more centralized control over commissions going forward.", "Finally, the increase in interest income relates to a higher portfolio balance resulting from our strategy to increase the percent of sales that we finance. Company-wide net interest expense increased by $1 million in the third quarter compared with the same period of 2015. Depreciation also increased $4 million as we brought new long-term projects into service. Corporate expenses declined by $3 million due to expense management initiatives. Reported results for the company included $14 million pretax for restructuring initiatives across our businesses to reduce operating cost and better aligned the organization and position us for future growth. We expect an additional $3 million charge in the fourth quarter related to lease terminations from the restructuring. These efforts will result in $20 million in annual savings starting next year. We also booked a $7 million charge associated with determination of an underperforming contract at our hotel group. Tables 7 and A [ph] include full reconciliations of reported to adjusted results for both periods. ", "At vacation ownership we completed our third term securitization of the year in October. The AVS market remains robust, the $325 million Sierra 2016-3 transaction had a 90% advance rate and a 2.47% weighted average coupon. The terms are in line with our last transaction and significantly better than our first transaction of the year.", "Now let's turn to guidance which will be posted on the website after the call. At this point in the year we are moving to approximate projections rather than ranges on the P&L lines except for EPS. We believe revenue will be approximately $5.60 billion at the low end of our previous range.", "Our EBITDA target for the full year will be approximately $1.375 billion this is consistent with our last call where we guided to the low end of our adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $1.375 billion to $1.400 billion. Note that this reflects 6% growth year-over-year or 7% in constant currency. Despite the impact of approximately $30 million from third party related defaults.", "In addition, we have fine-tuned our depreciation and amortization guidance to approximately $252 million. EPS guidance is $5.68 to $5.71 for the full year with diluted share count of 111 million shares. At the business unit level, adjusted EBITDA guidance for Wyndham Vacation Ownership was reduced to approximately $710 million which is below the bottom end of the range. This change is primarily attributable to Wyndham Vacation Ownership's third quarter adjusted EBITDA shortfall and lower expected sales in the fourth quarter due to the closure of a few sales offices as part of our third quarter restructuring activity.", "The temporary shutdown of 14 locations due to Hurricane Matthew and the mix between new owner and upgrade sales. Also, we've updated our full-year driver guidance to reflect some of the changes and conditions we mentioned during the call. We now expect systemwide revpar to be flat to down 2%, down from the prior flat to up 2% to reflect the slowing industry growth in the US. At Wyndham Vacation Ownership our tour guidance is reduced to 2% to 3% from 3% to 5%, primarily as a result of the aforementioned sales office closings and the impact of Hurricane Matthew.", "Finally, reflecting great business momentum our rental transaction guidance at Wyndham Destination Network increases by 200 basis points to 7% to 9%. Our neighborhood target for 2016 free cash flow remains at 800 million. As always, keep in mind that there can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter or any given year so we view $800 million as a neighborhood target rather than an exact figure. We're confident in this target despite the fact that we are facing two free cash flow headwinds this year consisting of foreign exchange headwinds and the effect of lower down payments.", "Now turning to the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.29 to $1.32 and remember that we don't budget repurchases into our guidance. Regarding our 2017 outlook, we will provide full 2017 guidance including company revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow guidance as well as business unit revenue EBITDA and driver guidance on our February call when we will have completed our budgeting process.", "So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve. Steve? ", "Stephen Holmes", "Thanks, Tom. Looking forward, I remain confident in the investments we're making today to drive our future growth. The strengthening of our hotel brands, innovating timeshare for the next generation of owners, the continued growth in our peer to peer plus portfolio and further connecting our brands and inventory through our industry-leading loyalty program. The market forces we see driving the future of hospitality play squarely to our strengths. And our unmatched portfolio remains uniquely positioned for continued success.", "And with that we welcome your questions. Erica? ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. We will go first to the site of Joseph Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Greff", "I recognize your comments on 2017 guidance. I've something that kind of big picture broad strokes in terms of a forward outlook. Can you revisit with us maybe what your long-term annual EBITDA growth target is? And then maybe how that has changed now prospectively versus what it was in the past? Just given world slowing economic growth and [indiscernible] that is moderating, how do you see things now and then I have a follow-up post your answer. ", "Thomas Conforti", "Sure, as you may remember Joe, our long-term growth target 6% to 8% for EBITDA and we are not changing that. We feel comfortable with that, what would change it in talking about the macro events that are happening around us, obviously the revpar market is kind of going back to its more normalized level of revpar growth. That does put a little bit of pressure on the growth of that business, but that business is not the main driver of our company. We have a nice portfolio. So the biggest driver is timeshare and we really don't see any change in timeshare.", "The change we're seeing is our intentional change to move more towards new owners and that\u2019s something that most in the industry are in the process of doing now. Some stuck with new owners after the downturn but most of the players move towards more upgrade sales, long-term you want to keep a good firm pipeline with new owners coming in because that will give us more opportunities to grow in the future and that's what we are committed to do. That will potentially put pressure on EBITDA because the margin is less on new owners but we are looking at ways to mitigate and manage through that. So we're not moving on our long-term view. ", "Joseph Greff", "And just a follow-up, this relates to my first question. When you think about the 6% to 8% long-term annual EBITDA growth target do you think from here it's more OpEx driven than revenue driven relative to history? ", "Thomas Conforti", "No, I think we need to get it back to being revenue driven and that is a big focus of the company is to drive the top line. There are pressures obviously that we and everybody else are seeing and during those times of pressure, it might put more pressure on revenue growth and we may have to be more OpEx focus.", "Again we will manage the business to deliver as we always have on our growth objectives, if the general hotel industry is going to be at a flat to 2% growth next year whatever the pundits are saying, that means there will be pressure on companies have cost that are going up faster than that. So we will have to adjust for it. But we do want to focus on growth just on the hotel group for a minute, we have done a lot recently to improve our value proposition to the franchisees. So I would like to see our growth of units start picking up in our domestic growth because we have really teed up a great environment for franchisees and we saw that at a conference in Las Vegas. There is a lot of excitement around our brands right now. So at times when there's revpar pressure, for us as a conversion brand and new construction, it often increases the opportunity to sign up more franchises.", "So we will go after every opportunity we see and do what we can to achieve that kind of growth and that is our goal. ", "Joseph Greff", "All right. Then my final follow-up here, and I believe I've asked this before in the past both on conference calls even probably related to you, Steve, given the size of your company now versus when it's [indiscernible], why not here today or sometime today think about spinning out into two or three companies? The evaluation that it's hard for you to grow through inorganic means and M&A and spinning out might allow you to do that, how do you think about those things right due to more real world economic cycle? And that's it for me. ", "Stephen Holmes", "Okay. Well just to show that I'm consistent, Joe I will give you the same answer I gave to when we were speaking privately. It's something that we constantly look at. The board is very active at looking at different opportunities and that is something that we have talked about before and we will probably talk about in the future, but if we had anything to announce, we would announce it today. We are constantly looking for ways to drive more shareholder value and more than that I can't say because the board has to deliberate and we have to all decide what the right thing is for the company. We feel we have a great company with great growth prospect. So we feel very comfortable with the company. ", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from the line of Chris Agnew MKM Partners. Please go ahead.", "Chris Agnew", "Couple questions actually around on timeshare. First, VPG you talked about it being impacted by a mix but if you look at it within perspective cohorts of new and existing members, are you seeing closing efficiency rates starting to decline? ", "Stephen Holmes", "Closing efficiency declining in perspective cohorts, not really, no, we haven't. In fact, VPG in each respective area, you know, reasonably consistent with the past 2015. ", "Thomas Conforti", "Chris, one thing on that that I will add that new owners close at a slower rate than upgrade owners so when we go to sell new owners I think it's about half the close rate or little bit so from a mix standpoint as we add new owners, yes, closed rate for the combined would go down but we look at it very separately. We monitor our new owner sales and upgrade sales separately and those have been fairly consistent. ", "Chris Agnew", "And then on the provision, the 26 million increase I think year-over-year, is it right to think that 8 million of that was due to third-party defaults? And so the rest was driven by the increase in financing. Can you share what the propensity of finance has increased and are you putting out incentives to drive that increase in financing propensity? Thanks. ", "Stephen Holmes", "Yes, Chris, is a little complicated but directly to your question about the propensity of the finance, that affect was $4 million of the $26 million. ", "Operator", "And we will go next to Patrick Scholes from SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Patrick Scholes", "Just following up on the guidance or lack of guidance questions on 2017, I look back historically at least for the last five or six years, you've given some sort of outlook. What has changed? Has your budgeting process has that been moved back versus prior years? Or is there something else in there? ", "Stephen Holmes", "It's really just the process, Patrick, that's what it is. Every year we struggle trying to give any sort of guidance on this call because we just are not through our budget process. And this year in fact neither Tom nor I have sat through any of the budget reviews for any of the business units so for us to be giving out guidance, in the past, guess maybe we have seen a budget review or two before we've given guidance but this year we haven't. So we just thought it was imprudent and we looked at our peers and nobody else is giving it, so we're kind of putting our foot out there in all truth we don't think we need to because we've been very consistent with our delivery of results for the last 10 years, so we reinforced our long-term growth targets and we will come out with guidance after we have gone through our budget process and I would suggest that that is the way we will be doing it going forward as well. ", "Patrick Scholes", "Okay. Next question, on the third-party induced defaults, as I recalled in the past you've said that you believe that these uptick in activity for defaults is a pull forward of defaults that would've happened in future years. Is that still what you are thinking here? ", "Thomas Conforti", "We suggested that as a potential but I think what I've said specifically, Patrick is every situation is different, but when we experienced this similar activity in 2012, 2013, what we saw was a compression of default activity early on and then a more immediate leveling to a normal state. We didn't say that that was certain to happen in this case. We presented that as a scenario that could happen given what's happened previously and so I don't think either Steve's crystal ball or my crystal ball is insightful enough for us to make an immediate statement now that that will be the case in this situation. ", "Operator", "And we will go next to the line of David Katz with Telsey Group. Please go ahead.", "David Katz", "I wanted to just go back to the loan-loss provision which was a little bit higher than we had in our model and I know you touched on it in your prepared remarks, Tom, but if you could just give us a sense for what's in there this quarter, a little more color on what's in there for this quarter and why it was so high and paint us a picture going forward? Qualitatively if you can? ", "Stephen Holmes", "Yes, David. So third quarter came in lower than our expectations for the quarter, so I'm not quite sure what was working with your specific model, but let me just sort of generically comment on some of the components that are included in that provision. One is the effect of defaults directly related to PP activity. The other is the effect that that activity might have on our curve, on our loan loss curves.", "We have as the earlier question implied, when we decided to lower our down payment, we've increased our financing propensity and therefore that fact alone deems for the same sales you have to reserve a higher percentage because you are financing higher percentage. So part of it has to do with percentage of sales finance and then some of it is just the volume of the business I think with other component. And then there are small things here and there that are essential for me to explain but I think those are the major categories and I think in general the quarter came in below what our expectations were, not substantially below but below what we believe the number was and we have a pretty good predictive value of this third-party related default activity because we get letters early on that we can judge or eventually going to lead to defaults. So I think those are the sort of the buckets that exist within the provision. ", "David Katz", "And as we think about this number going forward, I assume the expectation is that we are still going to lap next year, the default issue that you are dealing with this year as a percentage or in relation to gross VOI sales which is one of the ways that we measure it, is there any insight you can give us about what you expect that trend line to look like? ", "Thomas Conforti", "I will make two points. One, we have pretty good visibility into the fourth quarter, I had given you a specific number which I think is $23 million or $24 million ahead of where it was last year so that fourth quarter number is pretty accurate. But beyond 2017 as Steve said, we haven't gone through our budget reviews yet and I think our working assumption will be we can discern a change for the better or the worse so my guess is that the assumptions we will hear from our operating team is that going into next year we are going to be in the comparable neighborhood but I haven't seen the plan so I don't know. Steve? ", "Stephen Holmes", "The only thing we've seen is a slight improvement over the first half of the year going into the second half of the year, but whether that will stick or whether it will go down further or it will pickup? Tom is right we\u2019re not sure yet, we will know more as we go through the process. ", "Operator", "And we will go next to the line of Stephen Grimley [ph] from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I have actually two quick follow-up to Joe's earlier questions and one clarification. On the follow-ups, can you just talk a bit about the puts and takes to think about for free cash flow specifically in '17 and beyond? And how that is sensitive to the macro? And the other follow-up is just on splitting segments of, where do you currently or where do you have plans in place to leverage the resources of the overall organization across the three segments? ", "Thomas Conforti", "Okay. So Stephen on free cash flow, we're not going to give you any commentary on 2017 again because Stephen I haven't sat through the budgets but as Steve said, as least as it relates to free cash flow our neighborhood target is $800 million and Steve and I are committed to try to deliver that in 2017 but we haven't reviewed budgets so I just say that.", "But in general over the longer term, the puts and takes our CapEx is one of the factors that applies against free cash flows and we believe we are in a comfortable CapEx zone at this point which is in the low 200 million and our expectation would be we have talked to the business unit about down payments, that was an initiative this year as well about lowering down payments. I'm sure that will be a discussion topic in the budget review but other than that, we expect that the free cash flow trends over the longer term should mirror the EBITDA trends and because we feel like we have reached steady-state on working capital, we've talked about how much we had to invest in product. We don't have a different point of view on that as we sit here today. We feel our CapEx numbers in a comfortable zone and so there's no reason to believe that the longer-term trend should mirror the EBITDA longer term trends, but Steve, do you have a perspective on it? ", "Stephen Holmes", "No I think you\u2019ve nailed that one. I will just respond to the other question about following up on Joe's question regarding splitting up the company. As we've said in the past we believe there are a lot of advantages to having these businesses together. The most recent and notable example of that is the Wyndham Rewards program which is really becoming a blue thread that runs through all of our businesses.", "That is something that we think will drive value to all business units and that is a powerful, powerful product. It's only been around in its current form for about a year and half and it's already setting top levels in all types of ratings for loyalty programs. So we are very proud of what that group has done and it is been as I have said in my comments, it's being embraced by the timeshare business as well as by the vacation rental business to drive more business between the three initiatives. And that is going to be a major factor going forward that we see will be a positive impact. ", "The other positive impact is our technology. We have a terrific IT group across all the business units and they share ideas and those ideas result in things like the old management system at the vacation rental business, that came out of our exchange business and was kind of that technology and know-how was transferred over and applied there. So there is a lot of elements within a company that work well together but as I said, we look at whatever we believe as a Board will drive greatest shareholder value for the shareholders and we will look at all the options that are out there. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then one clarification is you mentioned the lower than expected upgrades in the timeshare business, what percentage of existing owners have upgraded in some form? And how is that ratio evolved over the past few years? ", "Thomas Conforti", "You know, I don't think I have the data at my fingertips, Stephen but one of the sort of rules of thumb on analysis we did a few years ago was that the average new owner will buy the equivalent of 110% of his original purchase. 150% of the -- okay they will buy 1.5 times original purchase. So that analysis is done a few years ago but it's a good question and it's a point that we will do some analysis on. ", "Stephen Holmes", "The other thing Steve, on upgrades, we had a little softness in the third quarter but bear in mind, we had a fantastic third quarter in 2015 that we're comparing to and for full-year we still expect upgrades to be ahead. So we have one quarter where there was some lightness but doesn't mean that that's necessarily a trend or that's what's happening in the industry. So stay tuned we\u2019re working hard to deliver on everything we say we're going to deliver on. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Harry Curtis from Nomura. Please go ahead.", "Harry Curtis ", "A quick question on the provisions, if the provision in the fourth quarter is coming down, do you believe that -- is that an indication that you feel more confident that the third party activity has peaked? ", "Stephen Holmes", "I wouldn't say that we're confident that it has peaked because it's not a completely predictable thing that's within our control. So we are doing everything we can to reach out to our customers to try and get them to not go and pay somebody else to do something that they could do directly with us and that's a challenge because we've got 1 million customers out there who are being targeted on a regular basis. ", "So we have to be very diligent on that. We saw an improvement in the third quarter from the first half of the year and we see it lowering the fourth quarter, but I'm not going to right now call a real Steve decline going into 2017.", "As Tom mentioned before, what we saw with the last go around with this is it was more of accelerating people who might have be planning on defaulting anyhow and so we did see a decline but it's just too early for us to make that call now and we will give you more information as we see it rolling in. ", "Harry Curtis", "Can you share with us just the strategies that you are using to counter this activity? ", "Stephen Holmes", "Well it's kind of two-pronged. One is on the legal front. We are pursuing those people who have inappropriately gained access to our customer list and we will pursue that as we did in the past and also pursue those people who are pitching inappropriate offerings to our customers. Again, it's something that will take time because the courts work slowly and we will continue that process.", "We did that last time and we had success by directing prosecution towards a few of the bad guys who are out there, but really I don\u2019t want to sound like a victim because that's just out there happening we have to deal with it. Really what we have to do is we have to improve our communications with our customers. We know for the most part they are very happy, as I said, 80% have enjoyed their vacation this year.", "I would love it if 80% of the people who stayed in our hotels enjoyed their vacation because I think our timeshare satisfaction rates are probably higher than our hotel satisfaction rates, but the fact is, that means 80% are happy, 20% are not just thrilled so how do we connect with them to make sure they're getting what they want out of their vacation? People love timeshares, that's why it's Tom mentioned that's why they buy more and half the people who own timeshare end up buying more but we have to work really hard to make sure that they have a great experience, if they don't want we want to hear about it. We want the feedbacks so that we can address them. ", "Harry Curtis", "And just my follow-up is since you have changed the minimum down payment on timeshare purchases, has there been any change in your FICO scores, average FICO scores on the base of new owner sales? ", "Thomas Conforti", "Yes, Harry, it remains at around 725. ", "Stephen Holmes", "And just Harry to reinforce the quality of that, the AVS [ph] transaction that we recently did was received terrifically by the market and our execution on that was great which just points to the quality of what we are putting out to the street. ", "Operator", "We will go next to the line of Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ", "Carlo Santarelli", "I know you guys obviously made it clear on 2017 in terms of guidance but if we could just talk a little bit maybe about the fourth quarter and Tom could I clarify something that I thought you said? Did you note that vacation ownership for the year was looking more like 7/10 or did I miss hear something? ", "Thomas Conforti", "No, that was correct. ", "Carlo Santarelli", "Okay. The implication then would be meaningful growth in both the lodging and vacation exchange and rentals segments and I just wanted to better understand where that would come from. Is it more of a margin initiative, or the revenue things? Or are there some favorable in the comp that maybe I have forgotten possibly? But it looks like overall adjusted EBITDA growth in the range of about 18% for the 4Q. I just wanted to better understand the drivers there. ", "Stephen Holmes", "Well, Tom, I will give one response which is on the hotel side, we are going to have the advantage of lapping the oil-producing markets which were down those markets which were down like 30% in the fourth quarter of last year, weren't they? ", "Thomas Conforti", "It's correct.", "Stephen Holmes", "So we will be lapping over that and we're working very hard to improve our margins in all the businesses, so I don't think there's any -- I know the third quarter of 2005 we had a very tough comp on VPG so WVO [ph] I think it was flat to down in the fourth quarter. So there's little things but I wouldn't say that there's anything that comes to my mind -- ", "Thomas Conforti", "Expense reductions, largely Steve. So it's going to be mostly margin Carlo, mostly margin and the growth that we are going to expect is not anywhere next to 18% for the fourth quarter, we have a different target. We believe it's an achievable target and some of it's going to come, good portion of it is going to come from expense management. ", "Carlo Santarelli", "Sorry, I was referring to the full year guide of 1375. I thought that kind of implied an adjusted EBITDA growth for the company of like 18%, that was what I was referring to. ", "Stephen Holmes", "Yes, okay. It's somewhere less than that but we just had a slightly different number but most of that activity is going to come from expense reductions. We do expect some recovery of revenue for the hotel businesses Steve touched on, WDN will have solid revenue as well in the fourth quarter. ", "Thomas Conforti", "And as you know Carlo, the third quarter is much, much bigger and more impactful in the fourth quarter just in size. ", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from the line of Jared Shojaian from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Jared Shojaian", "I realize you don't want to give guidance on 2017, that's obviously clear but is there anything unique about 2017 that we should be aware of? I mean you have got currency which looks to be another headwind presumably won't have the provision headwind again but can you just share any headwinds or tailwinds that we should be aware of? ", "Thomas Conforti", "I don't think we view foreign-exchange or provision as headwind for 2017. At least -- again, we have reviewed plans. ", "Stephen Holmes", "Just not on a macro basis, no. ", "Thomas Conforti", "And we don't know where foreign-exchange is going so neither of those are headwinds. I think what Steve mentioned in his comments was decelerating revpar extension.", "Stephen Holmes", "Yes, based on everything we have seen so far revpar is going to be a little bit lighter but on the other hand we now aren't -- we are going to be completely lapping the challenges from the oil-producing markets. The other thing which I don't them if this is a headwind or not we will have to manage and talk through this, we are committed to increasing new owners at WVO as we saw this quarter, that had unintended impacts which we need to manage better, quite frankly and we're confident that we will but that is something that overall, if you're looking at a bunch of statistics like VPG, VPG could be impacted by new owner mix, but that's not -- I don\u2019t view that as a headwind, I view that as an intended effort to build for the future. ", "Jared Shojaian", "And Steve, just your picture here, as we think about the world slowing, is it possible that timeshare today is just a more cyclical business than it's been in the pass? I would imagine that part of the reason it's been less cyclical historically is because it's been underpenetrated and you also didn\u2019t have the short-term rental competition that we have today. So I would love to hear your thoughts that you have on that. Thanks. ", "Stephen Holmes", "Sure, I think it continues to be in underpenetrated product. As you saw in this quarter, we increased our new owner number by 10% so getting new owners is not a massive challenge. We just have to decide that we\u2019re focused on that and when you focus on that with a ship the size of our ship, you don't just shift gears immediately, you need to bring on the sales people who are more accustomed to new owner sales, you have to modify things like your commission program.", "So it's not a simple flipping of a switch. It's an effort across the organization. So no, I don't think there's anything larger scale that if for some reason timeshare is less attractive. As we've seen in the past it was sold during the downturn very effectively and it continues to be a product that is welcomed by consumers to this day. And also, notably, people have asked us about this and I\u2019ve put it in my script, 25% of the people who have bought this year are below the age of 40 so this isn't just a product for baby boomers, it's a product that is attractive to many different segments of the demographic profile. ", "Operator", "And we will go next to the line of Dan Wozniak [ph] from Morningstar. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "You mentioned in prepared remarks sharing the loyalty membership program across the three segments. Just wondering if you could give an update on the number of vacation rental rooms and ownership rooms that you are offering on the network? And then just a clarification question, you mentioned loyalty members up 7 million. Is that over the past two years? Or is that year-over-year figure? Thanks. ", "Stephen Holmes", "The 7 million figure is from when we revised the Wyndham Rewards program which would be about a year and half or two years over that period of time. With respect to the number of offerings, I can't give you the specifics. I know that we're going up to 25,000 different units that are available for Wyndham rewards redemption.", "There will be certain properties that we pull out that are going to be kind of termed as our featured favorites which are ones that will be made available to owners, but the way it is basically going to work is in this technology will improve over time, if you want to redeem points, you go online, you look at what you can redeem for and then you\u2019re going to need to be directed to the various sources of booking for right now.", "In the future it will be all automated but for now if you want to do a WVO unit you will be directed over there and they have a that sets up specifically to handle that and the same thing with our vacation rentals. So it's a large number and it's a great variety of product and will have ones that are really quick to get to which will be our featured favorites that will be a mix of vacation product in Europe and in the U.S. as well as vacation ownership product at our timeshare business. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "And going back to the 7 million number since you launched Wyndham Rewards, what is the overall loyalty membership I guess before you launch the rewards initiative? ", "Stephen Holmes", "I don't have that number at my fingertips. I know that we have not only have we launched program, but we've also cleansed our member roles to make sure we are counting just active people so honestly I don't remember what it was. I know we added 7 million good active engaged numbers but we can certainly get that. Our hotel group has that at their fingertips. ", "Operator", "And we will take our final question from the line of Michael Millon from Millon [ph]. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "You talked about revpar growth slowing, were you talking about just the U.S. or internationally? And is it related do you think two different places to the economy, related to particularly overseas? To concern about terror related to just a lot of new building or something else that you think might be affecting the pricing? And maybe in fact the travel to hotels in different parts of the world? ", "Stephen Holmes", "Sure, Mike, it's a good question regarding what I'm referring to because really I'm more referring to domestic revpar than international revpar. We've seen pockets of positive and pockets of negative revpar performance internationally and that is very much driven by local economic conditions. With respect to U.S. specifically on terrorism, where terroristic activities have occurred, we've seen immediate impact on occupancies but then they do bounce back.", "So I wouldn't say that there's a continued impact from the terrorist activities and we certainly couldn't pull that out of any numbers that we look at. So I'm referring more to domestic, but I think across the board, there are concerns. Obviously if you look at our rental business in Europe, we had a fantastic third quarter so clearly people in Northern Europe which is where most of our businesses are based, they were traveling, they were going out, they were visiting family, they were having vacations. So it was very, very strong in Europe and yet you could look at some European economies and say that they are down and yet people are still traveling. ", "So it's not as black and white maybe as the question you asked, Mike, because it's a little bit blurred in different areas but my remarks about softening are really just that we've had a number of years of really terrific revpar growth and now we're getting back to that more normalized inflation plus type levels of revpar growth in my opinion. ", "Operator", "I would like to now turn the call back over to Steve Holmes for closing remarks. ", "Stephen Holmes", "All right. Thank you very much, Erica.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "I'll now turn the call over to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Margo C. Happer - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thanks, Keith. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO, and Tom Conforti, our CFO.", "Before we get started, I want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K, filed February 17, 2017 with the SEC.", "We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. Corresponding GAAP measures and the reconciliation of these GAAP measures to GAAP (sic) [non-GAAP] nare provided in the press release and tables to the press release, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at wyndhamworldwide.com.", "Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thanks, Margo. Good morning and thank you for joining us today.", "First quarter results were right in line with our expectations. Tom will go over some first quarter details in a few minutes, but first I will start by discussing our most important strategic initiative: connecting our customers and brands together with what we call the Blue Thread, also known as Wyndham Rewards.", "This loyalty initiative has tremendous power to enhance customer acquisition and retention, as well as customer satisfaction. It'll make our sales processes more efficient and effective, and will drive strong growth and profitability for each of our businesses. As we've discussed before, growing new owners is a critical initiative in our timeshare business, and better aligning Wyndham Rewards in our hotel ecosystem with timeshare will be an important component of our strategy toward new owner growth for many years to come.", "We've made great progress, both on Wyndham Rewards and on our other initiatives, which we expect to accelerate with the addition last week of Mike Brown as the new President and CEO of Wyndham Vacation Ownership. A 25-year hospitality industry veteran, Mike comes to us from Hilton Grand Vacations, where he was Chief Operating Officer, overseeing sales, development, business operations, information technology and innovation. We conducted a broad and robust search process, considering exceptional individuals, both within and beyond the industry. Mike emerged as the clear leader, with an ideal combination of strategic vision, operational expertise and industry knowledge.", "I spent the last five months as interim Head of Vacation Ownership and I've great pride in our teams across the company. I really appreciated the opportunity to directly experience the energy and strength of the timeshare team. My confidence in this business has never been higher, and Mike Brown is the right leader to take Wyndham Vacation Ownership to the next level.", "Mike was instrumental in expanding the Hilton owner base and in driving the connection between Hilton Grand Vacations and the Hilton Hotel customers. And now that we've built the hotel industry's leading loyalty program, we believe we have a significant opportunity with the alignment of Wyndham Rewards across our timeshare and Vacation Rental inventory, and here's why.", "Wyndham Rewards offers a compelling value proposition for consumers. Our customer profile, the everyday traveler, who works hard to take their family on vacation, is consistent across our brands and around the world. There is immense potential to further embrace this market and drive these customers across our business lines. Our focus today, in going forward, is to unlock that potential.", "Let me walk you through what we've done, what we're doing and how we expect connectivity through Wyndham Rewards to drive future growth. At the end of March, we announced that the Wyndham Rewards program surpassed 50 million member enrollments, a major achievement. Originally launched in 2004, Wyndham Rewards was completely reimagined in the summer of 2015, with the aim of reshaping loyalty for the masses. We built a first-of-its-kind program to be simple and generous. This resulted in Wyndham Rewards garnering the top spot in the acclaimed U.S. News & World Report Best Hotel Rewards Program in 2016.", "The ranking is based on benefits, geographic coverage, number of hotels in the network, and property diversity, but the most important category with a 45% weighting is ease of earning a free night. And why is that important? A PwC study last year looking at what drives customer loyalty for hotel brands found that regardless of age, customers recognize and are motivated by value more than any other attribute in a loyalty program. Great value drives redemptions, which drives engagement. And brands that engage with the leisure travelers on a consistent basis foster a broader, more loyal consumer base.", "Since our re-launch in 2015, membership is up 21% and redemptions for room nights have grown to 79%. Wyndham Rewards members now make up 37% of our hotel guests in North America, up from 31% when the program was re-launched. Now with a strong platform in place, we are expanding the program across our business units and brand. Last October, we launched the integration across a portion of our Vacation Rental and Vacation Ownership portfolio. Members can redeem for free nights at nearly 30,000 Wyndham destinations worldwide. Ultimately, consumers will have the ability to earn and redeem points at more than 120,000 hotels, timeshare and Vacation Rental properties across our unmatched global portfolio. That's a huge opportunity to engage with a broad, loyal consumer base on a consistent basis.", "The link between hotel loyalty and Vacation Ownership is especially compelling for us. We believe that the majority of new owner tours at our hotel-branded timeshare competitors are sourced through their hotel loyalty and related channels. For Wyndham Vacation Ownership, that number last year was under 5%. We have a great opportunity that we'll begin leveraging this year. Through enhanced call transfer, special member promotions, and more hotel loyalty guests on site at timeshare resorts through reward redemptions, we expect Wyndham Rewards to generate nearly a third of the incremental tours needed to hit our new owner growth target of 23%, with the remaining tours being driven by new sales centers and expanded third-party alliances as we discussed on the last call.", "And Wyndham Rewards new owner tours have better close rates. Loyalty member VPG could be more than 20% higher than new owner non-member VPG. In addition to driving tours and efficient sales, Wyndham Rewards will also reduce marketing spend by keeping more dollars in-house. A potential new owner may get a small number of points to come to our marketing booth, followed by a larger amount of points to take a tour and some additional points as an incentive to close the sale. These points go back into the Wyndham ecosystem when they're used for a stay at one of our hotel, rental or timeshare locations.", "We're developing an efficient, closed loop system in timeshare that can supplement our already robust third-party marketing alliance channels, which has traditionally been our primary source of tours. Think about it. We built the world's largest timeshare organization, double the size of the nearest competitor, without a connected loyalty program, and now we have one. The potential is significant.", "In addition, we're making great progress in aligning Wyndham Rewards to Vacation Rentals, which is a product that captures those leisure travelers who embrace sharing economy option. Does loyalty matter for those travelers? Yes, it does. The PwC survey found that the option of staying at a sharing economy property becomes more feasible when it is combined with a recognizable hotel brand. And they would stay more frequently at a sharing economy property if they could also generate hotel brand loyalty points for their stay.", "We have increasing momentum in growing our brands that are focused on the everyday traveler, all connected through Wyndham Rewards, our Blue Thread. Together we make travel more accessible to more people than anyone else.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom to walk you through more details on the quarter results and what we expect for the remainder of 2017. Tom?", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone.", "Overall, first quarter results were in line with our expectations. As expected and discussed on our last earnings call, the first quarter had some difficult comparisons, specifically our provision for loan losses was higher, consistent with our previously guided range, and we benefited in 2016 from $9 million of business interruption claims. We expect quarterly earnings comparisons to be more favorable for the remainder of the year. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of stock for $150 million. We reduced our weighted average share count by 7% year over year. In addition, we repurchased 400,000 shares for $36 million so far in the second quarter of 2017.", "So, now let's take a look at the first quarter performance of each of our business units starting with our Hotel Group. Revenues increased 1%, EBITDA increased 2% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting higher franchise fees and growth in the Wyndham Rewards credit card program. These growth factors were partially offset by a $3 million negative EBITDA impact from lower occupancy at our owned hotel in Puerto Rico, reflecting consumer concerns related to the Zika virus, which will begin to lap in the second quarter of this year.", "Same-store global RevPAR increased 2.2% in constant currency, reflecting growth in most major regions. Same-store domestic RevPAR increased 1.7%, driven primarily by a 1.6% increase in room rates. We had positive momentum throughout the quarter with the strongest results in March, and we saw a continued momentum through the first half of April.", "Net system size grew 3% year over year, including two new Wyndham Grands in South America and the mixed-use, Wyndham Grand Clearwater Beach. We continue to manage net growth against our goal of improving the overall quality of our system by adding higher quality rooms and terminating substandard properties. Room growth is supported by a development pipeline of over 140,000 rooms. Now that's up 15% year over year and 3% sequentially, driven by increased new construction units.", "In addition to these financial results, our hotel team has essentially completed the rollout of our new cloud-based property management system to approximately 4,200 of our domestic hotels. We believe that this is the single largest property management system migration of its kind, which also provides integrated and automated revenue management capabilities to our franchisees, another first in the economy space.", "Now moving on to Destination Network, revenues increased 1% in constant currency and excluding acquisitions, constrained by the unfavorable impact of the Easter holiday falling in the second quarter this year versus the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was down 5% excluding acquisitions, adversely affected by the impact from the timing of Easter as well as the absence of $3 million of business disruption claims received in the first quarter of 2016 related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.", "Vacation Rentals revenue increased 1% in constant currency and excluding acquisitions. A 2.8% increase in transaction volume, or 7.6% including acquisitions, reflected higher demand and capacity increases. Transaction and unit growth were particularly strong in our Denmark-based Novasol business and UK-based cottages and parks brands, partially offset by the impact from the timing of Easter.", "Average net price per rental declined 2%, driven by the mix impact of growth in our more modestly priced UK-based Hoseasons and Novasol brands and the Easter holiday shift impact at our relatively high priced Netherlands-based Landal GreenParks business. Looking forward, summer bookings are strong, up 7% on top of similar growth last year.", "At RCI, exchange revenues were flat in constant currency, reflecting a 0.8% increase in revenue per member, partially offset by a 0.6% decline in the average number of members.", "Operationally, we're excited by the collaboration between our rental brands, as they continue to expand on the cross-selling of each other's product. For example, our Landal GreenParks brand has expanded into the UK by working with our Hoseasons team to reflag two properties as Landal GreenParks. The two brands can now cross-market to their respective customer bases. In addition, our RCI brand just won five awards at the recent ARDA [American Resort Industry Association] industry conference.", "Our Vacation Ownership business performed as expected. Results reflected higher gross VOI sales, offset by a higher provision for loan loss. In addition, adjusted EBITDA comparisons were unfavorably impacted by the absence of $6 million of business interruption insurance claims received in the first quarter of 2016.", "Gross VOI sales increased 3% compared with the strong first quarter last year. Results reflected a 4.9% increase in VPG offset by a 1.7% decline in tour flow. VPG growth benefited from both higher transaction sizes and close rates. Tour flow was reduced by the closure of four sales offices as a result of a restructuring initiative during the second half of 2016. On a same-store basis, tours would have increased a little over 1%.", "New owners were up slightly. Overall, we are tracking to plan, and are focused and enthusiastic regarding this important initiative.", "We recently opened a sales center at our now mixed-use resort in Clearwater Beach, Florida, and will be opening another sales center with our new resort in Austin, Texas later this year. And as Steve highlighted, we expect Wyndham Rewards to generate significantly higher tours this year than last. We are confident that these endeavors as well as others will support a ramp in new owner growth throughout the year.", "The provision for loan loss was $85 million. That's an increase of $22 million against 2016. While this was a significant year-over-year increase, it was in line with our expectations and guidance. As a reminder, we began experiencing large increases in the provision in the second quarter last year, so our year-over-year comparisons going forward should be easier.", "Defaults increased $12 million to $87 million in the first quarter, also in line with our expectations. Corporate expenses declined 3% excluding restructuring costs, as we continue to focus on tight overhead expense management.", "Our adjusted tax rate declined approximately 150 basis points to 34.4%, largely due to a change in accounting rules associated with stock-based compensation expense. In addition, we recorded a tax benefit of $28 million on foreign currency losses recognized from an internal restructuring undertaken to realign the organizational and capital structure of certain foreign operations, which we excluded from our adjusted results.", "We generated $203 million of free cash flow compared with $218 million over the first three months of 2016. The decline reflects changes in the timing of our inventory spend, but we remain on track to hit our $800 million neighborhood target for the year.", "We completed two notable capital markets transactions in March. At the corporate level, we issued $300 million of 4.15% 7-year unsecured notes and $400 million of 4.5% 10-year unsecured notes. The proceeds were used primarily to repay outstanding commercial paper and other borrowings, including our $300 million 2.95% senior notes that matured in March. We entered into a $400 million fixed-to-floating rate swap in order to maintain our targeted fixed-to-floating ratio. The net effect of all of these transactions is now included in our increased interest expense guidance.", "At Vacation Ownership, we completed our first term securitization of the year. The $350 million Sierra 2017-1 transaction had a 2.97% weighted average coupon and a 90% advance rate. The order book was strong, as our paper continues to be well received by the market.", "Okay, let's turn to guidance now, which will be posted on the website after the call. As you saw from the press release, we're increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to $5.98 to $6.18 for the full year. And diluted share count goes to 105.5 million shares, reflecting the benefit of our first quarter share repurchase activity. We're reiterating total company, as well as business unit revenue, adjusted EBITDA and driver guidance. Overall as we stated on our last earnings call, we are most comfortable with the midpoint of the revenue and EBITDA ranges.", "Our projected annual interest expense range moves to $142 million to $146 million from $134 million to $138 million as a result of the previously mentioned capital markets transactions, reducing adjusted net income guidance by $6 million to $631 million to $652 million.", "Now turning to the second quarter, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.47 to $1.50. Remember that we don't budget repurchases into our guidance. Also, please keep in mind that the second quarter comparisons will be somewhat difficult, as we'll have higher interest expense from the debt transaction that we completed in March, and higher depreciation expense, as more long-term projects come into service.", "In addition, at Wyndham Vacation Ownership, we're lapping a benefit from proceeds received in 2016 related to a business interruption claim. And also, their cost of goods sold rate will be more normalized when compared to the very low level of COGS in the second quarter of 2016.", "And with all of that, I'll turn the call back to Steve. Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thanks, Tom.", "In closing, let me reiterate we have a great company with a powerful collection of businesses. While we have more work to do, we see a significant opportunity in connecting our businesses, especially our hotel ecosystem and timeshare, through Wyndham Rewards. Doing so will drive increasing shareholder value into the future, regardless of our overall structure.", "Although, along those lines, questions have been raised in the last couple of earnings calls about a possible separation of the company. In February, we had a specific question with respect to the hiring of a new CEO at our timeshare business. I said that the board had asked me to maintain optionality by getting a CEO qualified to run a public company. We are confident that with the hiring of Mike Brown we have found that person. The board wants to maintain its optionality because we remain dissatisfied with our valuation relative to our peers. The board continues, as always, to actively consider all alternatives on the future direction of our company. We will keep you posted as appropriate on our progress.", "All right. Keith, we will now take calls.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We'll go first to Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Good morning, everybody.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Hey, Joe.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Hey, Joe.", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Steve, one of the questions I wanted to ask was that comment that you made at the end here. And maybe just kind of going back to Mike Brown and just kind of helping understand the decision behind hiring him. Most of us on this call probably know him more by reputation than by spending a lot of time with him when he was at Hilton. Can you discuss why him in a little bit more detail? What were the more important considerations in hiring Mike? Was it his past focus on new owner sales at HGV? The fact that he was involved with the HGV spin-out at Hilton? The fact that he was a senior leader at a public increasingly independent company? If you could maybe help rank order or prioritize?", "And then maybe as important as those answers, if you can help us understand what his priorities are in the next 12 months as you would like to see them? And then I have a couple of other questions.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Okay. Well, I think, I would probably say, Joe, all of the above with what you outlined as attributes of Mike. As we said during the search process, we were looking for somebody who was a great leader. We wanted somebody who we felt would be a good public company CEO, whether they were one before or not. And we wanted somebody who was capable of connecting the dots within our business. Those were kind of attributes that we were looking for. The person didn't need to have been in timeshare before, but where they've connected businesses and driven the most out of marketing between businesses.", "So we saw, I saw personally about eight different candidates. There were probably 24 or so that we, within the organization saw. We whittled it down to two. Mike was one of those two, and Mike just stood out to us. If you don't know him, you're going to have a pleasure when you meet him because he's a terrific human being.", "In addition, he really understands this business, which is a big help to me, because I would have spent a lot of time with somebody if they were coming from outside of the industry, which I was absolutely prepared to do if we couldn't find somebody who knew the business already. Mike's experience at HGV is, as you said, he was involved with connecting HGV to the Hilton Hotel guest consumer base.", "He also worked at Marriott, both on the hotel side and on the timeshare side. He did participate heavily in the spin-off of HGV. I don't know how visible he was on the roadshow, I know he was on it, but he may not have been the lead speaker, but he certainly was heavily involved, and all of those factors together just give us a level of comfort that this is somebody who can get there quickly.", "You said what do I expect in the first 12 months? I break it down into quarters quite honestly. This first quarter that he's with us is going to be meeting the people and getting to understand the nuances of our business versus the general industry. And he's already heavily on that, he's actually on a plane right now going to meet with part of the sales organization. And so he's going to be heavily engaged and involved. He will be traveling around the world, meeting all of our leaders and making sure he's well connected to them.", "And so I think, it's the first quarter. He's educating himself on the business and the people. The next quarter or bleeding into the first quarter that he's with us, is going to be all about connecting the Hotel company and WVO. He's already started that. He has a good relationship and previously knew Geoff Ballotti, who runs our Hotel business, so they have a great working relationship. And he also knows Gail Mandel, who runs our Destination Network business. So he starts with a leg up in knowing a lot of people.", "So, I expect big things from him. As you probably saw, when you look at our results for WVO for the first quarter, our VPG was higher than we were projecting and our tours were lower than we were projecting for the full year. But the fact is that's the way that our model was built, and Mike is aware of that. He knows what he's going to need to do in order to get us to where we want to be, which we already had a plan for, I think he'll just make it that much better. So I think that \u2013 I'm very optimistic. I feel very good about Mike. He's a very results-oriented individual, and I think he's going to have a big impact.", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great, that's helpful, and then two questions on timeshare on the topic of loan loss provision. I guess where are you on third-party intended defaults? Tom, what was the increment in the loan loss provision in the 1Q related to that? How do you see that for the full year? And then what are you doing to curb that? Or what have you been doing? Or what are you seeing in response to that?", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Joe, I'll take a crack at the data and then, Steve can talk about the steps that we're taking to try to mitigate it. So around 40% to 50% of our incremental defaults and provisions in the quarter are attributable to the third-party activity. Volume growth is also going to lead to provision increases, so that was a contributing factor as well. And as you know, Joe, we remain committed to accepting a lower down payment to aid the process in bringing more people into our system in part, and so I think those are the three major factors.", "For the remainder of the year, the disparity in the provision rate in the first quarter was the most prominent, meaning the year-to-year comparisons were the most, the biggest gap between 2017 and 2016. You might recall that in the second quarter and beyond in 2016, we started to provide at a higher rate, and so the year-to-year comparisons, the drag on year-to-year performance metrics will be mitigated to some extent as we go forward.", "Those are sort of the basic factors on the data. Steve, do you want to address it operationally?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yes, Joe, as I said the last quarter, on the last quarter call, this is not just a Wyndham issue, it's an industry issue. And the industry as a whole is taking this on. We recently had the ARDA Conference, the industry conference down in New Orleans. And for the time I was there, probably 75% of my time was talking to other developers about the impact of these third-party interlopers.", "We and I believe others in the industry are getting much more aggressive with them. We're starting to see results from that. It's too early to say what that impact will be, but I'm optimistic, as I've been all along, that we will beat this issue back and we will get it back to a more normalized level. So it's just a question of when will that happen. And it's not all within our control, but we are taking significant steps in order to do that.", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. And then my last question here is, how do you see the cadence of VPG growth from here over the next three quarters, recognizing that the year-over-year comparisons are relatively easy or easier in the 2Q through the 4Q relative to the 1Q?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "I think our guidance for VPG for the year, Joe, was zero to 2%, and we came in close to 5% in the first quarter. And that's, as I said, we knew that. We thought that would be the case, and our tours were down. What you're going to see between now and the end of the year on a quarterly basis is there will be an increase in tour flow as some of these initiatives, which I've described and Tom spoke about, will start kicking in. So tour flow will increase and you'll see VPG start to moderate as more new owners are brought on. And that is in our plan, and that's what we've had our plan set from day one.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "We remain committed to our operational guidance of 6% to 8% on tours and zero to 2% on VPG. So there will be a reversal of relative contribution from VPG to tours.", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "All right, buddy.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Chris Agnew with MKM Partners. Please go ahead.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "Thanks very much, good morning.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Good morning, Chris.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "With respect to customers and connecting customers and brands to Wyndham Rewards, is there anything structurally different to some of your peers, such that you maybe can't connect in the same way or to the same degree? And if I think about timeframe, what's your view on how long it would be to first put in place maybe the infrastructure processes to achieve your goals? And then secondly, how long do you think it would take to achieve your goals? Thanks.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Okay. Actually, Chris, it's a good question because the question I ask myself, why haven't we done this before? And the reason we haven't done it before is that we really didn't have a loyalty program. We had a rewards program that was more rewarding people for staying at the hotels, and then whether or not they were loyal to the hotel didn't matter because they would get gift cards or anything else that they wanted from the list of things that we offered.", "With this remake of the loyalty program in 2015, we now have created something that truly is a loyalty program, and we're seeing that with the number of Wyndham Rewards members staying at our hotels, as well as those who are redeeming for hotel rooms versus redeeming for other things. So we needed to have that kind of baseline built before we could start to do what we can now do, which is connecting the hotel to the timeshare and to the vacation rental business. It's been a long time in the coming. We've been working on this for a really long time, and we now are at that point where we can start executing on it.", "And that's another reason I'm so excited about Mike coming on board, because Mike has seen this before, he's done this before, and I think he will get us there more quickly because of that experience. And so what the difference is, the difference is we didn't have one before. We do now. And other than that, there aren't a lot of differences.", "The customer staying in our hotels is a timeshare customer. It's the average consumer that's out there that buys timeshare. And we think with a stronger loyalty connection to the brand that driving those consumers to learn more about our timeshare product is going to be a natural progression as we build out the interconnection between the two business. Did I get your question there, Chris?", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "Yes, thank you. And if I could ask a follow-up on Vacation Rental, and cognizant of the fact your Vacation Rental business is professionally managed and different to the listing services, but can you help put in context your Vacation Rental business relative to Priceline, Expedia, and Expedia's investing in HomeAway? They're generating tremendous growth. I think Priceline's listings were up 30%. Are those in any way impinging upon your growth? Are they complementary to your growth? Just help us contextualize that in our minds. Thanks.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Okay, there are big differences between the two businesses, between a listings business and a professionally managed business. This past weekend I was actually with the Novasol team over in Croatia. And when you are on the ground and you see how they interact with the consumer, how they interact with the owner of the property, it's a much more hands-on business model than a listings model.", "Now we think there are some complementary benefits to it, and we do put some of our product onto some of the listings services as a way of distribution, particularly in the shoulder periods. But for the most part, we're distributing through our proprietary channels on behalf of the owner of the property, which actually provides them a more attractive rental proposition than having somebody manage their property, then go through a listings channel. So we think there are some complementary aspects to it, but they're very different. The two models are very different.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "Got it, thank you.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from David Katz with Telsey Group. Please go ahead.", "David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Morning.", "David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "I wanted to ask two questions. Number one, clearly there is some positive momentum with respect to the loyalty program on the Hotel business, and the accomplishments, I think, by all accounts should be considered impressive. And that is a driver of stays and room nights within the Hotel business. How do you think about the tangible aspects of the brands within the competitive landscape as we observe other hotel companies launching new brands in that category, or rejuvenating or refreshing or refurbing certain brands in your categories? And how do you think about that in the context of the competitive landscape, and whether that might be on your to-do list on a bigger scale than where it is today?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "David, that actually is on \u2013 it's a big priority on our to-do list. In fact, it's the number one strategic initiative that Geoff Ballotti talks about on the hotels side is product quality and bringing in the right properties and retaining the right properties. So we're very, very focused on that. But let me just step back for a minute and address the broader question, which is how do we feel about the brand.", "We just went through a brand analysis, I guess I'd call it, where we actually redefined the brands for our hotel owners as well as prospective franchisees, so that it was very clear how we were marketing those different brands. And we received tremendous feedback from the hotel owner community about what we've done and how we've positioned them. So I feel very good. Now, could our brands be better? Absolutely. And I think every hotel company in the world is trying to improve the quality of their brands by getting rid of the weaker ones and bringing in the stronger ones. And that's kind of a forever fight for us.", "We see this year some growth in the domestic system, which is fantastic. We see new construction ramping up, which is also terrific on the domestic side. And we'll continue to grow internationally as we've been doing for the last 10 years in a meaningful way. But I think our focus right now is on that domestic system, and we've cleaned a lot and we're now looking at getting to a faster pace of growth.", "David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Understood, thanks very much. I'll jump back in the queue.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning, several questions here.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Hey, Patrick.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Good morning.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "On the progress with the new customer mix, I think in the past you've mentioned that the plan is a 23% increase this year. How is that tracking? What was that result in 1Q?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "We're tracking on our plan. It's, obviously, a little bit back-end loaded, but that's how the plan was built for this year, because we closed some sales offices and we're opening sales offices throughout this year. But it's tracking about where we thought it would be, so we feel good. I feel very confident. When you're with the people down in WVO and you're out in the field, they are very, very excited about the new owner initiatives that we have going on.", "And it's not just let's go sell to new owners, it's everything else that's behind that in the organization; that we're building the right urgency tools, that we're building the right marketing lead generation programs. And that's where a lot of time has been spent in the first quarter, and we'll be reaping those benefits in the future. Also, obviously, the Wyndham Rewards connections are just being built that will also be meaningful.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. In regards to that, so it's realistic when we think about tour flow for the rest of the year. You maintain guidance is 6% to 8% growth. You did about negative 2%. It's realistic to think you're going to do 10% from here on out for the rest of the year?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Well, I don't think it'll be 10%...", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "To get to that range.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yes, it won't be 10% every quarter, but...", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "No, on average, yes.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "It'll be significantly higher than it was. Obviously, it was negative this quarter, but again, on our side that was expected. We knew how the year was going to build. So yes, I mean there probably will be a quarter where we touch on 10%, but it's going to build to be in that 6% to 8% range, as Tom said. We're comfortable with the guidance for theirs as well as for VPG.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Just a few more questions here. I noticed for the first time in a number of years it looked like the number, or the count of RCI members declined, whereas the revenue per member was actually up for the first time year over year in a number of years. What's going on under the surface, driving that?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yes, I think part of it is \u2013 I'll hit the last piece first, which is the revenue per member. Part of that is the initiatives that we've put in place to drive more offerings to the member. So we're trying to get a bigger share of wallet by offering them more, and we've created different pieces that we're making available. Different levels of membership, different access to things, so that's what's driving the revenue per member growth.", "On the member side, I think it's probably we did do a system cleanup of member count. I don't know how big of an impact that had, but they may have had a portion of it.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yes. At the end of the day, Patrick, I think we're kind of flattish with members, and it was attributable to a bit of a system cleanup, that we do from time to time.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you. And then last, one big picture question for Steve. You talked strongly about in the last quarter expecting, or being confident, of 6% to 8% EBITDA growth in 2018. Still feeling that same level of confidence?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Absolutely. I think that you know this year, obviously, we've got a series of challenges that we talked about on the last call, which I won't repeat them all now.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Sure.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "But I feel great about the businesses and how they're aligned. I mean the things that we've done at the Hotel Group with respect to technology, and the Wyndham Rewards Program, the impact that will have is meaningful. But at WVO, we're going to see some pretty strong results moving forward. I feel it. I can see it and sense it based on the different initiatives that we have in place. So I feel very good about our long-term goal.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Patrick, remember, expanding the new owner pool means that there's a great upgrade potential shortly thereafter. So it's going to be \u2013 that new owner growth is not only going to contribute to 2017, but just as importantly, give us a broader pool to upgrade as we go forward.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Very good. Thank you.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Sure.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey. Thanks. Somewhat of a follow-up to the Destination Network comments, you've previously talked to personalization there and more broadly, now you've been ramping up the loyalty program and plan to use it across segments. Where are you in implementing a more personalized offer to existing customers, not only using it to attract new?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yes, that is something that on the Hotel and Timeshare side we will see a lot more of through Wyndham Rewards. Wyndham Rewards will not have as big of an impact on the RCI personalization, because Wyndham Rewards is not an RCI product. RCI, as you know, services many different brands that are out there, and so that kind of keeps itself a little walled off from the Wyndham Rewards offering.", "Wyndham Rewards and WDN will really impact the Vacation Rental business. And there I think, yes, we can use the personalization tools that are being worked on within Wyndham Rewards to give that better experience to the person who's renting that shared economy accommodation.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Stephen, on a related note to Steve's comment, we did kick off an initiative we call the next-generation of RCI, which is a commitment to a new technology that will enable us to touch our members in ways that we haven't been able to do that. That's underway. It was an initiative that was approved, I think, at the end of 2016. So it's going to take a little time to work itself out. We should start to see some benefit later this year and into next year.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And then a follow-up that's unrelated. How should we be thinking about the impact of corporate tax reform on the business as it's kind of come back to the forefront with the new administration? Thanks.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Well, I can't wait for the announcement today to see what it's going to look like. But clearly, Stephen, a 15% tax rate if that's where the President comes out and if that's what gets moved forward is terrific, for our businesses and most businesses. Lower taxes means better cash flow, more opportunity to invest. Not just for us but for developers, both timeshare and hotel developers. So I think it's going to be big for our business. And we're looking forward to seeing that move forward. But we'll have to see. That's one that's not within our control, but we can be a cheerleader from the sidelines.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Fair enough. And one very quick follow-up. What's your U.S. cash tax rate currently? Thanks. I'll jump back in the queue.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "What's that? So we're paying the highest marginal tax rate so it's \u2013 what is it...", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Cash tax?", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Oh, cash tax. Yes, it's low 20%, low 20% cash tax rate.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks so much.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yes.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Harry Curtis with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.", "Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet", "Hey, good morning. I wanted to start on the Hotel side. In your pipeline of new hotels, can you give us a sense of the mix of conventions and new build, and what your RevPAR index for your brands looks like?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "I'll walk away from that last one, because I don't have that at my fingertips and knowing what the index is for each of the brands is not something that I have off the top of my head. But to go to the prior questions, it's a mix of new construction and conversion, Harry. There's more new construction in our domestic pipeline now than there's been for some time. So we are seeing more excitement about the brands from developers. And internationally, I believe the mix is still the same, which there is a heavy mix of new construction in the international market.", "Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet", "And then moving on to timeshare, I was interested in your comments about your taking \u2013 I think the expression you used was taking on the issue. In the past, you've talked about actually going after or challenging these third parties' ability to get your lists. Is that still the primary strategy? And to what extent are you actually challenging the efficacy of their claims?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "That is one of the things we're doing. I don't think that that is the primary initiative that we're undertaking. As I said last quarter, we feel that we own this issue. We have to have the better relationship with our customers, so that they're not enticed by a really lousy offer of paying money to get out of their timeshare, which they could do just by not paying their fees.", "So our mission is to get much closer to those people, that small group of people, really relatively small group, who are enticed by that offer. And where we see unethical behavior, we clearly are going after it hard and strong, and we will file suit. We will try to refer to the appropriate authorities when we find unethical behavior. We have and we will continue to do that.", "So our approach is very broad in what we're doing. We're touching a lot of different elements, and we're starting to see some benefits from that. So we're encouraged, but we're not willing to call a beat to it, as we did with the cease and desist several years ago when we saw a turn in that.", "Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet", "Okay, very good. Thanks very much.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Sure.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. If you were to split up the business, can you just talk about any issues that would create with your initiative to drive more tours to the loyalty program?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Sure. If we were to make that decision, and I don't know if I said this on the last quarter call or not, having the interconnection to the Hotel group and having the loyalty programs interconnected is a lot easier to do when you're one company. So you certainly would want to have all of that in place before you made a decision to spin off. Once you do that though, then by contract you put the connections in place, which is what Marriott and what Hilton has done so far, and I believe Starwood did that as well. So I don't see it as an impediment to harvesting that opportunity, particularly if it's in place beforehand.", "Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay, great. And then if you were to pursue a spinoff, would you be blacked out from buying back stock prior to any announcement?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "If we had made a decision and it hadn't been announced yet, I'm not a lawyer, but I would guess that we would be blacked out from buying back stock. But the board would have to make that decision, and then we will take the appropriate steps following that decision.", "Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Michael Millman with Millman Research. Please go ahead.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "Thank you. Would you talk about the timeshare market in Asia, and what piece of that you're looking at or how involved you may be? Thank you.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Sure. Thanks, Mike. I'll break it down to two pieces. One is we view Australia and Asia as combined because we run the Asia business out of our Australian business. Our Australian business is very large and is a mature operation and includes basically New Zealand, Australia, and a little bit in Fiji. We've expanded from there up into Thailand, and we're looking at other markets, Indonesian markets as well. The market over there is huge, but not well developed.", "As I think I've said in the past, we've spent a lot of time looking at China. We wanted to make sure that the rules are well enough established in China that we don't start in a market and then see the more disreputable people who might want to enter into an unestablished market step in. So we've been cautious in China. But I think the opportunity is huge there.", "And one other thing about Mike Brown that I didn't mention before is Mike has a lot of international experience. He lived about 10 years overseas. I don't know if he ever lived in Asia, but he was in Europe and in the Caribbean. So he is very familiar with working outside of the U.S. marketplace. And I'm sure, I know because I've talked to him. He's very excited to get down, spend some time with our Australian group, and look at what we're doing over there.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "And could you just give us a rough idea of what percent this Australian-based business represents of timeshare?", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "It's about 10%, Mike, of the total EBITDA from the business.", "Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates", "Thank you.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yes.", "Operator", "And then we'll take our final question as one follow-up from David Katz. Please go ahead; your line's open.", "David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Hi. Can you talk about, I think your perspective would be helpful and important on scale and its benefits in the timeshare business? Obviously, if we look at the landscape today, there is a group of players that are considerably smaller than you, and then you have considerable scale in that area. How do you use that? And how do you build on that in the future? And obviously, I'm asking in the context of arguments for others combining and whether those things would make sense.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Okay. David, I'll give you my perspective. It's, obviously, one person's opinion. I view scale being critically important in the hotel business and the ability to work synergies through acquisitions as being very meaningful in the hotel business. It's less meaningful in the timeshare business, because you don't have the ability to take out costs. Like when you sell timeshare, you're still going to have your product costs. You're still going to have your sales and marketing costs. You might be able to drive down the marketing costs somewhat by having a larger organization, but it's not as meaningful as it is on the hotel side.", "There's certainly things that are helpful with scale when you look at the selling proposition to the consumer. If you're selling a larger network of properties that are within your own captive versus going out to RCI or II, it certainly is helpful to have more scale there. But that's all in the selling proposition and those that are smaller tend to use the exchange companies as their kind of pathway to broader vacation experiences.", "So, I think I would compare it to a hotel and say, I don't think there's as much of a scale advantage in timeshare as there is in hotel, but there certainly is scale advantage. And we benefit from that, obviously, being the largest.", "David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Understood. Thanks very much.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Sure.", "Operator", "And it appears we do have no further questions. I'll return the floor to you, speakers, for any closing remarks.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "All right. Thank you very much, Keith. And thank you all for joining us, and we look forward to talking to you on the next call.", "Operator", "And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation.

Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Analysts", "Joseph R.

LLC", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet", "Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Wyndham Worldwide Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "I'll now turn the call over to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Margo C. Happer - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO, and Tom Conforti, our CFO.", "Before we get started, I want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These risk factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K, filed February 17, 2017 with the SEC and are noted in our press release yesterday.", "We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. Reconciling GAAP measures are in the tables provided in the press release and are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at wyndhamworldwide.com.", "Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thanks, Margo. Good morning and thank you for joining us today.", "As usual, Tom and I will review our results for the quarter and the highlights of each of our businesses. Before we do that though, I'd like to start by providing some perspective on the announcement we made yesterday that we will spin-off the company's hotel business and become two separate publicly traded companies.", "As those of you have followed our company for sometime though since Wyndham Worldwide was created, our board and management team have maintained a sharp focus on driving shareholder value through strong day-to-day execution and smart disciplined capital allocation. We have worked to generate strong cash flow reinvest portions of that cash in the business when it would be accretive to value and return significant amounts of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "Over the years, we have regularly evaluated alternatives for additional value creation. However, we also recognized the substantial benefits from connecting our unique collection of hospitality brands with what we referred to as blue threads, which include Wyndham Rewards and other cross business unit and brand affiliations. With the work we have been doing in recent years to incorporate these blue threads across the company, we determined that we were now able to move forward with a separation. Going forward, both entities will have long-term agreements, retaining their affiliation with initiatives, such as Wyndham Rewards.", "With those elements in place, we are confident that the spin-off of the hotel business and the combination of Wyndham Vacation Ownership with RCI is the best structure to unlock shareholder value and enable strong long-term growth across the businesses. The transaction is expected to increase the fit, focus, and strategic flexibility of the two post spin-off companies, allow each company to maintain their sharper focus on its core business and growth opportunities, facilitate future capital raising as needed for the two companies and position each company to be better able to make changes necessary to respond to developments in its markets.", "Now, let me review the details of the transaction. At closing, we will create a new publicly traded hotel business and make a distribution of the new entity's stock to existing Wyndham Worldwide shareholders. We expect the transaction to be completed in the first half of 2018 and to be tax free to both Wyndham Worldwide and our shareholders. As a result of the transaction, Wyndham Vacation Ownership with headquarters in Orlando, Florida will be the world's largest publicly traded timeshare business with a portfolio of over 220 resorts throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and South America and the South Pacific, a strong sales and marketing platform and over $2 billion in gross timeshare sales.", "This company will include RCI, the world's largest timeshare exchange company with over 4,300 affiliated properties in more than 100 countries, along with our U.S. Vacation Rental brands. The post-spin publicly traded timeshare company will have significant operating scale and we expect it to generate abundant cash flow resulting in a dynamic platform for growth.", "Wyndham Hotel Group with headquarters in Parsippany, New Jersey will be a new publicly traded pure-play hotel company with a global portfolio of 18 renowned brands, encompassing more than 8,100 franchise hotels and approximately 706,000 rooms in over 80 countries. The company will move forward with a proven asset-light fee-for-service global franchise model and is expected to generate strong margins and significant cash flow.", "Separately, as we move through this spin-off, we will work with the leadership of our European rental brands to explore strategic alternatives in an effort to fully realize their potential. These are strong businesses with established and well-known brands in their regional markets and truly phenomenal leadership in teams behind them.", "Both the timeshare and the hotel companies will have strong proven management teams and outstanding teams of dedicated professionals supporting them. Mike Brown, who we brought in recently as CEO of Wyndham Vacation Ownership will continue to lead the timeshare business as President and CEO.", "Geoff Ballotti, current CEO of Wyndham Hotel Group, will continue to lead the hotel company as President and CEO. I will serve as Non-Executive Chairman of the Board of both companies. I look forward to working with the leadership of these companies to build on our momentum and focus on enhancing shareholder value.", "Tom Conforti will move into an advisory role, working with us through the completion of the spin. As we begin this next chapter, Tom and I agree that now is a good time to make this change to support a seamless transition to the leadership of the new companies.", "Tom worked closely with the board and me to get to our announcement today. His contributions to the company and for our shareholders are significant and our gratitude to him runs deep. Tom was pivotal in focusing the company on free cash flow generation and then in helping to take that story to the Street. This resulted in the nick name internally and externally of cash flow Conforti. We look forward to hearing about his future successes.", "David Wyshner will assume the role of Wyndham Worldwide, Chief Financial Officer and will become Chief Financial Officer of the hotel company upon spin. David was most recently President and CFO of Avis Budget Group. Prior to that, David was Executive Vice President and Treasurer of Cendant, where he led the execution of the company's separation into three publicly traded companies, one of which was Wyndham Worldwide. He is an ideal candidate to lead us through this transition and will be a strong partner for Geoff in the hotel group. We're thrilled to have him on board.", "We'll provide more information on the management teams, corporate names, boards, and other details of the post spin-off companies as we move along in the separation process. In addition, I'm sure many of you have questions about the capital structures and capital allocation philosophies of the two post-separation entities, their expected credit ratings and related matters. We are working on capital structure and we'll of course be in ongoing discussions with the rating agencies. When we are in a position to provide more information on these matters, we will do so.", "In terms of next step, we currently expect to file our initial Form 10 with the SEC by year-end. This will provide more details on the proposed separation, including financial and other details. We will also be working on finalizing intercompany agreements and arranging financing facilities for both entities. The transaction will be subject to final approval by Wyndham Worldwide Board of Directors in the effectiveness of the registration statement. We also intend to seek a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to certain aspects of the transaction. The separation will not require a shareholder vote.", "As I said earlier, we expect to complete the separation in the first half of 2018, but, as you know, we cannot give any assurances regarding the ultimate timing of the separation of whether it will ultimately occur.", "Finally, let me say that we wouldn't be reaching this milestone without the dedication, hard work of the incredible team of talented professionals who have built these businesses and brands into industry leaders over the past decade. We are confident that this separation is the best structure to enable future success across the businesses for the benefit of our shareholders, owners, guests, partners and importantly our associates. I thank them for their hard work for our shareholders, dedicated service to our customers and commitment to building the culture which enables Wyndham Worldwide to be an award-winning global leader in hospitality. I know we can count on them to continue to deliver in the months and years ahead.", "I'm thrilled to be part of this company and couldn't be more proud of what the team has accomplished so far, but I'm even more excited by what lies ahead. With that, let me turn to the second quarter results.", "This was a solid quarter. We're seeing great top line and operating momentum across the business. Consumers are out traveling and our businesses are well positioned to capture that demand.", "Let me tell you why, starting with the hotel group. Our brands garnered four of the top five economy hotel spots in the 2017 J.D. Power Guest Satisfaction Index. And our Wingate by Wyndham brand remained in the top spot in the mid-scale segment. These rankings clearly reflect the quality initiatives we put in place over the last several years.", "With this strong base, we're expanding our system. In June, we introduced the Trademark Hotel Collection, a new soft brand concept for owners of 3- and 4-star independent hotels. The Trademark Collection enables upward midscale and above hotels to participate in the benefits of our distribution and scale, including our leading loyalty program, while maintaining their independent identities. We already have 15 hotels in the system and a strong pipeline.", "We also recently announced an agreement to acquire our 19th brand, AmericInn. This midscale brand's 200 hotels and approximately 11,600 rooms are located largely in the Midwest. It's a great acquisition as it increases our position in the attractive midscale space.", "The AmericInn brand has strong quality scores and guest satisfaction ratings with consistently high rankings in the J.D. Power midscale brand survey.", "And, of course, we look forward to offering the benefits of the Wyndham Rewards program to AmericInn guests. We are excited to welcome AmericInn to the Wyndham hotel family of brands. We expect the deal to close in the coming months and be accretive to earnings next year.", "We continue to make great progress on Wyndham Rewards. Membership is now up to 52 million, over a 10% increase since last year. In addition, we recently announced an alliance with Caesars Entertainment, the first expansion for us beyond the Wyndham family of brands, which will unite two of the world's highest ranking hotel and casino loyalty programs.", "Now looking at our Destination Network business, we continue to see strong growth from our Vacation Rental brands with healthy increases in organic unit count, occupancy and price. Performance has been particularly strong in Europe, where we've been investing more heavily in recruiting, services and the guest experience to drive long-term growth.", "A great example of this is our Landal GreenParks brand. Landal has enjoyed outstanding growth over the last several years, driven by its strategy to enhance the guest experience. Such enhancements include newly renovated restaurants and central facilities providing a more upscale experience. For example, in July, the largest indoor water slide in the world, which our partner built was opened at Hof van Saksen, one of Landal's luxury resorts. We expect a packed summer at Hof van Saksen and across all of our parks.", "Now let me turn to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, Mike Brown has been on board now three months. He has completed nearly 30 site visits and seen over 50% of the Vacation Ownership sales operation. He has quickly established himself as a respected leader across the organization.", "He is excited about growing our leadership position. He sees great opportunity with our seven timeshare brands and our diversified marketing platform and he is excited by the energy and focus of the team which has tremendous momentum, evident in our recent results.", "Gross VOI sales were up 9% in the second quarter and tours increased over 10%, our biggest increase in over three years. We're making great progress toward our goal of bringing in new owners with a 10% year-over-year increase in the second quarter. Every month has shown positive momentum, with July looking like our strongest month yet, especially exciting is that 40% of our sales volume last month was in new owners. Our focus on new owners will be supported by activation of the blue threads between our hotel and timeshare businesses, where there's a huge opportunity to tap an existing customer base.", "Our average hotel customer is 54 years old, married with $70,000 household income. This aligns well with our typical timeshare owner, it's a natural fit. Through enhanced call transfer, special member promotions and more hotel loyalty guests at timeshare resorts through reward redemptions. We expect the hotel ecosystem to contribute significantly to our new owner tour growth this year and will be more significant in years to come, resulting in high-quality efficient sales.", "Preliminary results indicate that new owner tours generated through our blue thread could result in VPG that is 20% higher than our new owner tours generated through our traditional channels. Wyndham Vacation Ownership strategic priorities as Mike articulated to his organization last week are to number one, leverage the hotel ecosystem to its full potential; number two, grow our owner base; number three, execute a financial strategy that delivers organic and sustainable growth; number four, strengthen our culture of committed, empowered, and accountable associates and number five, deliver great vacations and countless memories for our owners. He's well on his way.", "With that, I'd like to turn over the call over to Tom to walk you through more details on the quarter results and what we expect for the remainder of 2017. Tom?", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Our businesses did perform well as Steve mentioned with strong top-line momentum, as revenues increased 5% and adjusted EBITDA increased 4% on a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions. We were especially pleased that gross VOI and vacation rental revenues both increased 9%, again on a constant currency basis and excluding acquisitions.", "Our hotel group made solid top-line gains in the fairly modest RevPAR growth environment. These results clearly demonstrate the momentum of our businesses. Earnings growth would have been higher if not for the anticipated higher provision for loan loss, higher legal fees and the absence of a $4 million business interruption claim that we received in 2016.", "During the quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of stock for $150 million. We reduced our weighted average diluted share count by 7% year-over-year. In addition, we repurchased almost 500,000 shares for $50 million from July 1 through August 1.", "Now, let's take a look at the second quarter performance of each of our business units. At our hotel group, revenues increased 3% and EBITDA increased 6% on a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, reflecting higher franchise fees and growth in the Wyndham Rewards credit card program. Same-store global RevPAR increased 3.3% in constant currency, reflecting growth in all major regions. Same-store domestic RevPAR increased 2.8%, while total store domestic RevPAR increased 3.4% in the second quarter compared with the industry at 2.7%, including 110 basis point out performance versus the industry for our economy segment hotels.", "Performance was particularly strong in the South Atlantic Pacific and Mountain regions, which make up over 40% of our system and all had RevPAR growth of over 5%. Geographically, growth was particularly strong in Florida and California where RevPAR increased 9% and 7% respectively. Net system size grew 3.3% year-over-year.", "Room growth is supported by a development pipeline of nearly 151,000 rooms, up 18% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, driven by increased domestic and international new construction. Growth in our domestic pipeline was particularly strong up 29% year-over-year and 11% sequentially.", "Now moving on to Destination Network. Revenues increased 5% and EBITDA increased 6% excluding acquisitions and on a currency neutral basis. Results reflect strong performance at our Vacation Rental brands, which benefited from the favorable impact of the Easter holiday falling in the second quarter this year. EBITDA also benefited from the reversal of the $3 million value added tax reserve. Vacation Rentals revenue increased 9% in constant currency and excluding acquisitions. A 7.8% increase in transaction volume or 12.5% including acquisitions reflected higher demand and capacity increases across our European rental brands.", "Average net price per rental increased 0.9%. Both revenue drivers benefited from the timing of Easter, most significantly at our Netherlands-based Landal GreenParks.", "At RCI, exchange revenues increased 1% in constant currency, reflecting a 2.4% increase in revenue per member, partially offset by a 1.7% decline in the average number of members.", "Revenue per member benefited from pricing increases while the average number of members declined due to increased member attrition and our lower transacting club membership base.", "At Vacation Ownership revenues increased 6% reflected higher gross VOI sales and higher consumer financing revenues partially offset by a higher provision for loan loss. Despite the great top-line momentum, adjusted EBITDA declined 2% largely reflecting the absence of a $4 million of business interruption claim that we received in the second quarter of 2016. The higher provision for loan loss and $6 million of higher legal expenses. Our legal expenses should return to a more normalized run rate in the third quarter.", "Note that reported EBITDA reflects a $135 million impairment charge. After an in-depth review of operations by Mike Brown in the Vacation Ownership leadership team, including its current development pipeline and long-term development plan, the team determined that it no longer made sense to pursue development at certain locations where we owned undeveloped land. Instead their focus will be on selling existing finished inventory and pursuing asset efficient inventory.", "We were really pleased to see that gross VOI sales increased 9% compared with the second quarter of last year, fueled by a 14% increase in sales to new owners in North America. The sales team has great momentum. Results reflected a 10.3% increase in tour flow, partially offset by a 1.1% decline in VPG. Tour flow benefited from a 16% increase in tours to new owners. The decline in VPG reflects the increase in sales volume to new owners, which produced a lower VPG. The provision for loan loss was $110 million, an increase of $20 million, in line with our expectations, and driven meaningfully by higher sales volume. Defaults increased $13 million to $86 million.", "Moving to Corporate, expenses declined 15% due to lower employee cost. In addition, our consolidated adjusted tax rate declined over 100 basis points to 35.4%, largely due to a change in accounting rules associated with the stock-based compensation expenses. We generated $581 million of free cash flow year-to-date, compared with $616 million over the first six months of 2016. The decrease reflects higher inventory spending and the timing of working capital. We're on track to hit our $800 million neighborhood target for the year.", "Now, let's turn to guidance, which will be posted on the website after the call. As you saw from the press release, we're increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to $6.04 a share to $6.24 a share for the full year. And diluted share count goes to 104.5 million shares reflecting the benefit of our second quarter share repurchases. We're reiterating total company as well as business unit revenue, adjusted EBITDA and driver guidance.", "Our interest expense guidance has been increased by $6 million to $148 million to $152 million, reflecting the initial estimates relating to the proposed spin-off transaction as well as the pending acquisition of the AmericInn hotels and suites brand. Offsetting this increase is a 35 basis point decline and our projected tax rate to 36.25%, reflecting our favorable year-to-date adjusted rate.", "Now turning to the third quarter, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.97 to $2 on a share count of 103.8 million shares. Remember that we don't budget next quarter repurchases into our guidance, while many of our covering analysts do.", "With yesterday's announcement, you should know that we remain committed to our capital allocation philosophy through spin and our dividend will remain in place. However, we may decide to be more opportunistic than programmatic on share repurchase.", "Finally, as Steve noted, I will be transitioning my role here at Wyndham to an advisory capacity for Steve. I'm proud of what we've accomplished over the past eight years and grateful to have been a part of this amazing company and to have been a part, a very small part, of its success. While I'll be involved through the spin, I expect that this will be my last earnings call. I couldn't be more excited about the direction of the company and I look forward to contributing to its continued progress. And mostly, I look forward to staying in touch with many of you.", "With that, Steve?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thanks, Tom. In closing, let me reiterate that we have a great company with powerful businesses. Our solid second quarter results reflect that fact with good top line momentum. We continue to be focused on driving shareholder value, delivering great vacations and countless memories for our owners and guests, and providing our associates with a rewarding place to work.", "Finally, as we just celebrated our 11-year anniversary as the New York Stock Exchange listed company, it's worth noting that since our spin in 2006, we have generated $6 billion in free cash flow, we have returned $6.7 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And finally, our dividend adjusted share price has increased almost 300%, resulting in a 13% annualized return for shareholders. It's a great legacy on which to build.", "With that, Keith, we'll take questions. Thanks.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We can take our first question from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Good morning, guys, and...", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Hi, Joe.", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "...congratulations on today's news. I know this involves and probably still involves going forward a tremendous amount of work. So kudos to you all.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thank you.", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "I want to start off just with respect to the European rentals business, can you give us a sense of how much the European rentals business generates in annual EBITDA? I don't know if you want to give us margins or percentage of revenues and we can kind of back into it. And then with respect to this segment, have you tried to sell this business previously? What transactions do you look at as a valuation benchmark? And then staying on this topic, I'd imagine the cost base is pretty low. So how do you think about tax leakage or ways to minimize tax leakage? Then I have a couple of smaller follow-ups.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Okay. Well, instead of making you do the math to get to where the rental EBITDA is, I'll tell you it's around $130 million, and I could give you revenues and 15% margin, but that gets you to the chase. These are great businesses and, you're correct, we acquired these and a number of other \u2013 we've acquired these businesses over a period of time and without a doubt, their value now is greater than it was when we bought them. We'd like to think we had something to do with that, but these are great businesses that have 60-year, 70-year histories.", "We have received over the years indications of interest on the businesses. We never really thought that it was the right thing to do, nor did we know whether the offers were legitimate. So, we didn't go very far in any of those. But we think there will be interest in these. They are powerhouses in the European rental marketplace, by far the largest collection, and we'll have to see. I mean, our thought process right now and we don't know, we haven't launched a process yet and we don't know what other alternatives might be available for those businesses.", "So, we will go through that process with the team over in Europe. But if it comes in at what we think is a \u2013 what we're told is kind of an expected multiple and I'm not going to say what that expected multiple is. It probably generates a $1 or $2 of breakage, per share breakage. Now that all depends on what happens with tax laws and whether we decide not to repatriate the money because there's something great to do with it internationally, but that is ballpark where we'll end up.", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. And then with respect to what you announced today in terms of the spin and the transaction in total, what will be the all-in cash cost to affect the transaction? Does $300 million sound in the ballpark? And I would imagine a big part of that is going to be what you plan on doing on the balance sheet and refinancing, which I know you don't want to talk about, can't talk about now. But does that seem to be in the ballpark?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yeah, $300 million sounds a little bit high. We don't have everything worked out yet and obviously we have a lot of work to do with our bond holders and I mean it's too early to tell, Joe, to be honest with you, but I mean just my gut says that's a little bit too high.", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Mine as well.", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then with European rentals business going away in whatever form or fashion, I'm presuming some of the allocated corporate expense goes away. And then when you think about the net increment to corporate expenses, $25 million, $35 million, does that sound in the right ballpark?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "No, I don't think so and again we've got a lot of work to do, to come to really build the pro formas for these businesses, but we're kind of looking at it as, it's going to be net zero or maybe a little bit less than zero, so, and there may be some overall reduction.", "Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Perfect. And then with respect to your AmericInn acquisition, do you want to give us a sense of what the transaction multiple there was?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Well, as normal, no. Because we really don't tell what we're paying for businesses or what we think we're going to sell businesses for, but because again our creation multiple is often different than others because of the efficiency of our infrastructure. This one is further complicated by the fact that there are 20 hotels that are, I'm sorry, 10 hotels that are owned that need to be liquidated. And so we're going to have to go through the process. We've been in discussions with people, and we think we've got a pretty good feel for how we can get that done very quickly, but that will also determine what our ultimate multiple is.", "Operator", "Thank you. Thank you. We'll go next to Chris Agnew with MKM Partners. Please go ahead.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "Thanks very much. Good morning. And if I can echo the sentiments, congratulations to you all. If I can ask first question on the legal expenses in the timeshare business, you say they are going to normalize in the third quarter. What gives you the confidence that that's the case? And can you shed any light on what happened in the quarter and any update on the third-party issue? Thank you.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Do you want me to take legal?", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Well I will...", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "I'll take on legal. So, the legal issue has been in existence for a little while, and we saw it in the first quarter, we saw it in the second quarter, and basically the reason we feel that we've got this behind us is, the cases that we were dealing with have been resolved, and so they're no longer \u2013 these particular type of cases are no longer out there and I don't want to go into really any more detail than that, Chris, but we feel comfortable that it's behind us. On the PPE...", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "On PPE, I think everyone needs to realize that if you grow your gross VOI by 9%, that fact alone is going to push the provision higher, because it's a mechanical percentage of whatever your revenue is. So the single largest contributing factor to the growth in provision for the quarter was the fact that Mike and his team did a 9% gross VOI number. So it was worth about 40% of the increase. As it relates to PPE, PPE came in underneath that, but it's still a number that I think we would all agree, we would like to bring down a bit. It contributed a lower number of the $20 million increase, it contributed around $5 million of the $20 million with volume contributing more than that and the rest are various other factors, so.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "Thank you. And if I could follow up, you had strong core metrics in timeshare. How much of that was driven by these initiatives to increase connectivity with the hotel business and the blue thread, etcetera? Are a lot of those benefits still to come? Thank you.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Well, the end of that statement is the correct one, a lot of those benefits are still to come. We've determined that we have the elements in place to start taking advantage of the efficiency of generating tours from our hotel group, but I think if Mike Brown were on this call right now, he would say, we've just scratched the surface and I think I may have mentioned on the last call, maybe I didn't, that his first new hire was somebody who is in this space, in the marketing space for call transfer and for being able to get people on vacations with us, through the hotel channel. And so I think, we've got a lot of work to do, but it's exciting work, both the teams are very, very focused on it and so I think you'll really start to see those benefits in the coming quarters and years.", "I think what you saw in the second quarter, the ramp up in revenues, and particularly new owners is at the beginning of the year, we talked about the fact that we were focusing more on new owners and the team began to execute on that and they began lining up the tours necessary to drive the business. And as I've said before, this is very much a marketing generated business and if you market the tours and bring them in, we've got a fabulous sales organization that will complete the process and we ramped up the tours on the front side and that has resulted in this increase. The benefit of what Mike is doing with the blue thread and what both teams are working on will really \u2013 you might start to see some of it in the second half of this year, but the bulk of that impact will come in 2018 and beyond.", "Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC", "Thank you and once again congratulations.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thanks, Chris.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thanks, Chris.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Hi, good morning. Thank you. Certainly if you know me, I'm usually the last person ever to say anything nice on an earnings call or congratulate anybody, but I will make an exception here. Congratulations, Steve and Tom. You certainly have come a long way from that fateful day in March of 2009, which some of us old-timers can recall, so congratulations there and also congratulations, Mike and Geoff. Steve, can I get sort of some high-level initial thoughts on the possible capital structure of these two spins? Certainly you have Choice Hotels at about a 3 times net debt-to-EBITDA, VAC and HGV at 0 to 1 times. Would you envision a capital structure somewhat similar to what we are seeing with these comparables?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Well, first of all, Patrick, thank you very much for those kind words. There's a lot of work that goes into this, and Tom and I are speaking on the call, but we have people who have been working round the clock for months to get this done. So, we appreciate those kind words. Yeah, it's hard for me to say right now, Patrick, what the capital structure is going to look like. I will make a couple of observations. The first is we start off coming out of the blocks as an investment-grade company. So, our leverage has been investment-grade leverage. The timeshare business is going to look different than VAC or HGV, because we have RCI in there as well, which is a low capital need, high cash flow business. And so, it does change the dynamic somewhat.", "In addition, our hotel business is bigger than Choice's business and our cash flow is going to be higher than there. So, I don't know that I would necessarily point to them as comparables. We will work through this and David Wyshner who is joining us as I talked about before, David is a very strong capital markets person. He has spent a lot of time with Merrill Lynch and he was our treasurer at Cendant where we had a very complex capital structure and then worked his magic over at Avis Budget on the capital structure there. So, I'm looking forward to him getting engaged and helping us think through this as well. Tom and I have burned a lot of brain cells on this and we certainly can use more assistance in getting to the right answer. But unfortunately, I don't have the perfect answer to your question yet.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. We will wait and see on that. Next question, you noticed a sizeable bump up in the development pipeline especially for hotels. Did any of that have to do with the AmericInn acquisition or is that organic?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "No, it did not. AmericInn is not included yet. We haven't closed on that transaction. So that will be a nice little bump as well in the future.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. And then when you say development, are these ground up developments, we are talking new builds or are these...", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yeah. Patrick in my commentary, I pointed out that some of that growth was coming from new development both in the States and outside the United States.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. And then, one last question if I may and this is actually going to be for Mike and Jeff, put you on the spot here. For each of you, if you could single out what you believe is the single greatest opportunity in your respective companies or divisions, once you take the helm?", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "You want to be Mike and I'll be Jeff...", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yeah. We don't have Mike and Jeff on this call, Patrick.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "But we'll get them on in the future.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "They are both very excited. They're actually meeting with their teams today and I think that both of them recognize the importance of driving growth of the business and being very mindful on capital allocation. So, I think you're going to see a very similar trend to what you've seen in the last 11 years at Wyndham.", "Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Very good. Thank you.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thanks.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Patrick, thanks.", "Operator", "We'll go next to David Katz with the Telsey Group. Please go ahead.", "David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Hi. Good morning. Congratulations to all of you, and Tom good luck earning your next nickname.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thank you. Next nickname, we'll figure out what that's going to be down the road. Thanks.", "David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Okay. Not that there's anything wrong with having cash flow in it, but maybe we can come up with something.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "It served its purpose.", "David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "It served its purpose. It has. And to that end, my one question is you commented that share repurchases philosophically will change to a more opportunistic approach, could you elaborate on sort of what that means and how you're thinking about it?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Well, what it means is we've been really programmatic if you follow what we've done. We've done $150 million a quarter for a long time and it may bump a little bit above that, but it's been basically in that ZIP code. We're going to be going through a process of determining what the capital structures are. We are going to have cost associated with this transaction. We are buying AmericInn. We announced Love Home Swap that we bought earlier this week. So, we have been active on the M&A side.", "So, we just don't want to be misleading anybody to say that it's going to be a simple cookie cutter as it has been for the last maybe six quarters or eight quarters; that we may have to be more opportunistic and gauge cash flow coming in and then make decisions about our spend levels. But we are still, as Tom said, we're neighborhood $800 million, we feel good with that. And we may have to consider adjusting where we stand on our share repurchase, but I would not be shocked to see us end the year at $600 million like we have before. We just want to make sure that we're not saying something that we are not \u2013 we haven't left an impression that could be in any way missed, and that was the purpose for that comment. So, thanks for clarifying.", "David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "You're welcome. Is there a point at which you are prohibited from being in the market through this process?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "No, our usual approach is to put a 10b5 program in place as we approach earnings time, and we have had one in place for quite some time. And I would anticipate that we would do that in the future. We will put a 10b5 in place as we come towards earnings. I haven't been told that there is anything that will restrict us from being in the market.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "In fact, we had put in place some time ago the 10b5 that allowed us to repurchase shares as the board was going to consideration. So we're familiar with the mechanism to continue to buy shares where we believe it's important to buy shares.", "David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Got it. My one follow-up is that the business has clearly, timeshare specifically, has clearly evolved and is evolving. If Mike were on the call or what comments can you offer about how the competitive landscape has changed? Is it becoming easier or harder for you to sell? And how do you expect that to change in the future after the spin?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Well, the competitive landscape, we actually probably have less competitors than we had five years ago, just because there has been some consolidation in the industry. And the fact is, this is not a business where we compete at the sales table for someone. This is not like driving down a road and seeing four hotels and deciding which hotel you're going to go into. You're marketed to go on a tour. We tell you about our product. We make sure that we explain it in the most clear manner, and you may or may not decide to buy from us. But you're not sitting and the next table that has a competitor. So really the only competition in this business is for sales people, and we're the biggest and we think we have a very attractive proposition for our sales force. And so we feel, at the end of the day, that we've got the best team out there. But it really hasn't changed, the competitive landscape has not really changed much.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "And the last quarter is evident of that with the 9% growth in VOI...", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yeah.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "...and growth in new owners, and we believe the trend that will continue well into the future.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Absolutely.", "David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Got it. Thanks very much. Good luck.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thanks, David.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Good morning, Stephen.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Given the strong growth in new owners in timeshare, are you finding any difference in those owners that you're attracting now versus the existing base or additions over the past few years, as we think about it from a demographic or geographic standpoint?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "No. Not really. The FICO scores are right in line or a little bit up from what they were before, right in line, and the demographics, I would say are the same. I don't think there will be any shift when we start driving more sales through our blue thread at the hotel group, because that demographic profile is very, very similar to what we already have as our owner base within Wyndham Vacation Ownership. So, I think, it's very consistent.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "And then turning back to the spin, and I guess, thinking through the comments on growth and capital allocation, could you provide a little bit more color on where you think the greatest fundamental opportunities would come in separating each company, if we separate out organic growth opportunities, accelerating M&A, margins and capital allocation?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Well, yeah. I will address that because 11 years ago when we spun off of Cendant, I know the excitement around the opportunity was palpable, as I'm sure will be in the Hotel Group, and the timeshare group, and it's because your focus is heightened, and your opportunities are more driven by that particular business in which you are located. So, right now, all of our senior management team is compensated in large part by the overall Wyndham Worldwide story, and that will change with a new business. So you end up with a much tighter focus on just your business.", "The other thing is, when we spun off 11 years ago, I had high hopes and aspirations for doing a lot of M&A because I've done that my entire career, and I thought that this would be a great vehicle. Unfortunately, the market did not provide us that opportunity with the multiple we were trading at, so it limited us in our ability to do transactions. So, I think, both of these vehicles with significant free cash flow and with hopefully a multiple that is more indicative of its value we'll be able to be more aggressive and more active in the M&A landscape.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "And with the scale that timeshare has, it will make it a very prominent participant in acquisition activity in timeshare.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yeah.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Helpful color. Best of luck with the spin in the future roles. Thanks.", "Thomas G. Conforti - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thanks very much.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thanks, Stephen.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet", "Hey, good morning everyone and particularly to Margo, who no longer has to deal knuckleheads who don't have a buy rating on your stock. I just wanted to follow-up on kind of philosophically where the post-spin businesses are going to go because the strength of Wyndham has been, from a shareholder's perspective, the really strong returns of cash and it sounds like these businesses are going to really evolve more into growth companies. So do you have any sense of what the balance is going to be between growth and returning cash to shareholders?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Well, I'd tell you Harry really, I don't know how to answer that question because I don't know what the opportunities are that exist. There will be transaction capability in both of these industries and we'll just have to see how it develops. But I think it's very safe to say \u2013 and you'll hear from Jeff and Mike individually in the future, I think it's safe to say that neither of them feel that their company should be banks, which was what I said when we first started Wyndham Worldwide. We're not a bank, we're not going to sit on cash, we don't need to harbor cash. So I think that the idea of returning capital to shareholders will be consistent, but that is my view and I think it's shared by both Jeff and Mike and you'll hear from them directly as we go through this process.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet", "Very good. And the second question is, going back to the European rental piece, if I were to give you \u2013 I'm interested in what kind of the general range of what the multiples paid for those pieces might be and if I give you kind of 7 times, 9 times, 11 times EBITDA multiples, could you at least point us in the right direction?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "No, I can tell you that our acquisition multiples were below that, but we were playing in a market that had not really developed that much from a M&A standpoint. So it was kind of a morbid \u2013 it was a market that was moribund. It was little quiet. And so were able to step in and make some really attractive acquisitions. Then, we were able to connect the businesses and build some additional technology that have helped the businesses. So, I can't really tell you what we paid for the businesses and I don't know what the market will pay for it either.", "I know that these are terrific businesses. We have world-class management running each one of these businesses. It's completely impressive organizations over there and it's kind of unfortunate that it was part of the story with Wyndham Worldwide that Margo, Tom and I would always say, it's funny that the Street doesn't understand how good the businesses are but it is what it is and I think that the market over there will appreciate it.", "Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet", "Very good. Thanks and best wishes.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "We take our next question from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, I think you said 40% of sales came from new owners in July. How much was that up year-over-year and can you give us a sense of the VPG in July as well?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "No, on VPG because we don't want to get in the habit of giving monthly VPG numbers. I believe that the new owner number was down in the 30%, low 30s and it was a little over 40% this quarter, I believe that's correct. I'm getting a thumbs up from Tom, so I think that's right.", "Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. So let me try to ask this a little bit differently then. Your new owner cadence from the first quarter and second quarter implies that you are going to need somewhere around I think 40% growth in the back half to get to your 23% target. So first, correct me if I'm wrong, if I'm not doing my math right. And then, as a follow-up to that, if VPG is down 1% this quarter with only 10% growth in new owners, how do you think about VPG in the second half if you're ramping to somewhere around that 40% growth in new owners?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Well, we didn't change our guidance on VPG. So, I guess, you can assume that we're comfortable with that level. As for new owner growth, this is ramping, as you said. We've been ramping it from January, February, March. July was the best month we have ever had and we will continue to ramp up our new owner initiatives.", "The fact is that, and I've said this to people before, that when Mike came onboard, one of his comments was he loves the new owner initiative. He just wants to make sure that they are new owners that will stick. And so he has been very clear with the organization that we need to deliver new owner sales and new owner sales that are not going to default and so that has been a focus, not just on FICO scores because we were good FICO score but making sure that we deliver the kind of experience that the owner needs to have in order to feel good about their purchase and stay in our system.", "And so, Mike has been really crystal clear about that. The organization has responded in a big way, I still stay very connected to the sales organization down there, and they are a fired up group of people and I'll see a bunch of them in the Wyndham Championship in two weeks when they come down for their Sales Incentive Program down in Greensboro, North Carolina.", "Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay, thanks. And just one last one for me. I know you said the acquisitions are accretive to next year, but should you still get some benefit this year and is that reflected in your guidance and then maybe you can give us a sense for the EBITDA contribution and how much it's in 2017 versus in 2018?", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Yeah. We're not saying that anything is going to be built into 2017 just because the way accounting works now all the cost associated with the transaction get dumped in the current period versus being built into the acquisition like it used to be in the good old days. So it makes us kind of breakeven this year on those but we will get accretion on the next year's earnings. And, I think, once we get ready to start talking about next year, we'll give you a sense of what that looks like.", "Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you very much.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And it appears we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to Steve Holmes for closing comments.", "Stephen P. Holmes - Wyndham Worldwide Corp.", "Thank you very much, Keith. I appreciate that. Thank you for joining us and thank you for all your support of the company. We encourage you to watch the Wyndham Championship in two weeks and I want to thank, again, Tom for everything that he's done for the company and for us. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

These statements are subject to Risk Factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These Risk Factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC.", "We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. Corresponding GAAP measures and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP are provided in the press release and that is available on our Investor Relations website at wyndhamworldwide.com. Steve?", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks, Margo. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Given our announcement in August of our plan to become two publicly traded companies, we have changed our format for this morning's earnings call. I will start with a few remarks on the separation process and our third quarter results then turn the call over to Geoff Ballotti and Mike Brown who will share their perspectives on the opportunities for the companies they will lead following the separation and then David Wyshner, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide financial highlights of the quarter. At the end of the prepared remarks, we will take some questions.", "Before I give a few comments on the separation process, I want to highlight that the board of directors took a decision to increase our repurchase authorization. This reflects confidence in our ability to grow and to generate ample cash to both invest in the business and return to shareholders.", "Now on to the spend. We are moving quickly and remain on track for completion in the second quarter of 2018. The board and I remain confident that the spin-off of our hotel business that leaves our Wyndham Vacation Ownership and RCI Timeshare Exchange businesses under one umbrella is the best structure to unlock shareholder value and enable strong long-term growth across the businesses. The transaction is expected to increase the fit, focus, and strategic flexibility of the two post spin companies. The separation will allow each company to concentrate on growing its core business and facilitate future capital raising. In addition, we will maintain the synergistic blue threads, such as Wyndham Rewards between the businesses.", "While both companies will provide more detail on their strategies and priorities as we move through the separation process, I want to assure you that the shareholder value principles that drive us at Wyndham Worldwide will also guide the new companies. These are first a focus on fee-for-service business models that produce consistent reliable earnings growth and generate strong free cash flows. Second, a capital structure that is efficient without taking on undue risk. Third, a capital allocation philosophy that invests in the business and returns excess cash to shareholders. Fourth, a disciplined M&A approach that results in acquisitions that are both strategically and financially attractive. And finally, a fundamental belief that we work for the shareholders and that the best way to deliver for you is to maintain an innovative and inclusive culture that fosters employee engagement and delivers excellent value for our franchisees, partners, owners, and consumers.", "As part of the separation, we announced that we will explore strategic alternatives for our European Vacation Rentals organization. This business operates leading brands in the European Vacation rental space, generates about $750 million of revenue at attractive margins, and are somewhat underappreciated by a largely U.S. investor base. Since our announcement, we received considerable interest in this business from potential buyers and we are responding to that interest.", "As a result, we are optimistic about this process. With that being said, you should expect that it will take several months before we have something more definitive to say about the outcome of these efforts.", "Now let me take a few minutes to put the third quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year into perspective. First, I want to comment on the devastating hurricanes that hit Texas, the Caribbean, Florida, and surrounding areas in recent months, and the also recent devastating earthquakes in Mexico as well as the wildfires in California.", "First and most importantly our thoughts are with the families who lost loved ones or homes and those who face a long period of rebuilding and recovery before they will be able to resume their normal lives.", "Second, we are hearing countless examples of our people doing amazing things to serve guests, protect our properties, and help each other. I want to publicly acknowledge and thank all of our associates and affiliates who have gone above and beyond during these events. These events, but the hurricanes in particular, have had a meaningful impact on our business which we have detailed in the press release. We have reduced our full-year guidance based on our current estimates and the storm's financial effect on our business.", "Otherwise our outlook is positive. Our third quarter results were strong despite the hurricanes and we would have held our original guidance. David will give you details on the quarter and on our outlook in a few minutes.", "But first we're in the process of separating Wyndham Worldwide into two great companies. Let me turn the call over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of our Hotel Group, Geoff Ballotti.", "Geoff Ballotti", "Thanks, Steve. I'm thrilled to be joining the call today to talk about the Wyndham Hotel Group as a soon to be public company. We have grown to become the company that operates more hotels than any other organization in the world with over 8,300 franchised hotels operating under one of our 20 well-known brands today.", "We have an exceptionally strong footprint with 40% of the economy hotels in the United States flying one of our flags. We have significant opportunity for continued growth and great momentum. As Steve mentioned on the last call, our recent acquisition of AmericInn, which we closed this month speaks to this runway as we expand our base in the midscale segment with over 200 high quality hotels.", "In addition, the Trademark Hotel Collection, just launched in June already has over 50 hotels live on our distribution platform. Our value proposition is straightforward. We enable our franchisees who are predominantly single property owners and frequently when they sign with us new to the hotel business to optimize their return on investment.", "We establish brand standards, provide operational training. We ensure the consistency and the quality of their hotels. We offer state-of-the-art technology and revenue management solutions and we enable our franchisees to reduce costs by leveraging our significant purchasing power. Most importantly, we drive guests to their hotels through our global reservations and online distribution channels.", "In the process, we provide everyday travelers around the globe with exceptional value through what are some of the most recognized and established brand names in our segment. Our largest and most international brands are Super 8, Days Inn, and RAMADA, which in aggregate operate in 68 countries around the world and enjoy brand awareness of over 75%. And we have great underpenetrated growth brands such as MICROTEL by Wyndham and WINGATE by Wyndham which are both consistently ranked at the very top of their categories by J.D. Power.", "By way of background, I joined Wyndham in 2008 from Starwood Hotels and Resorts after 20 years in various leadership roles in both Europe and North America. I came to run what is now Wyndham Destination Network and I was excited by the opportunity to grow our managed alternative lodging accommodations while using technology to enhance service delivery at RCI and the many great brands at Wyndham Vacation Rentals. Steve asked me to run the Hotel Group in 2014 and since then our incredible teams around the world have been laser focused on three areas quality, technology, and loyalty.", "First, quality. We have strengthened our brands with new brand positioning, new standards, designed prototypes, marketing campaigns, and websites, and we have removed, our teams have removed over 80,000 substandard domestic rooms over the past three years. And we're just now starting to see results. Last year, we saw very strong gains for our brands across our J.D. Power, Trip Advisor, and Net Promoter ratings. In addition our domestic new construction pipeline is now up 35% over the last three years.", "Second, technology. We invested heavily in our websites enhancing our digital and mobile experiences for consumers, while transforming the technology we provide to our owners. This is a very big deal for us as it allows us to leapfrog legacy industry systems creating a competitive advantage to drive market share. We're now in the process of rolling out an integrated cloud-based sector reservation system, connecting our franchisees to a myriad of new distribution channels. And to connect our hotels to this industry-leading CRS we have completed the installations of over 4,300 new cloud-based property management systems with a first truly automated yield management system in the economy segment.", "And third, we have developed the very best loyalty program at a time when loyalty has never mattered more. We completely re-imagined and re-launched Wyndham Rewards with great results. Research tells us that what our hotel guests want most is an easy way to earn a free night and so we've made Wyndham Rewards the simplest and the most generous program in the industry according to Idea Works for two years running now as you may have seen recently reported in the Wall Street Journal and Forbes Magazine. Unlike competitive programs that have multiple tiers requiring more points for each quality tier, we have one simple and straightforward award night redemption level that appealed to the everyday traveler.", "All 8,300 of our hotels are available for only 15,000 points per night with no blackout dates even at our most expensive and most aspirational upper upscale Wyndham Grand resorts. Our franchisees have never been more engaged in rolling 55% more members at their front desks than they did before the relaunch. Most importantly since the relaunch Wyndham Reward redemptions for free nights have increased from 64% to over 80% of all redemption delivering more room nights and more revenues back to our franchisees and now we're expanding redemption opportunities to over 20,000 of the most aspirational vacation ownership and vacation rental properties in the WDN and WVO portfolios that will remain in the Wyndham Rewards program post-spin.", "Our business model is so simple and so ingenious in exchange for the services and reservations we provide to hotels that operate under our brands, we collect a percentage of each properties hotel room revenues. Our ability to have a diversified share revenue featuring from thousands of hotel properties without owning those physical assets represents an incredibly attractive value proposition for shareholders.", "To sustain and advance this business model, we will continue to be laser focused on quality, technology, and loyalty. We will be committed to investing in our businesses and to pursuing acquisitions when it makes strategic and financial sense to do so and returning excess cash to shareholders.", "We look forward to telling you more about this in the months and years ahead and with that I will now turn the call over to our new President and Chief Executive Officer of Wyndham Vacation Ownership, one of my most important customers for so many years while at RCI, who I am now very proud to call my colleague Mr. Michael Brown. Mike?", "Mike Brown", "Thanks, Geoff, and good morning. Like Geoff, I'm excited to share with you the great assets and opportunities we have at the business I'll be leading. We're the global leader in timeshare and vacation exchange. Timeshare is a multibillion dollar industry with a clear consumer value proposition. Timeshare provides great vacations today and in the future at today's prices.", "The product is flexible enabling consumers to choose a wide array of locations and accommodations throughout the year. The fact that nearly half of timeshare owners plan on buying more over the next two years is evidence to the power of the value proposition.", "Wyndham Vacation Ownership has 221 resorts and 25,000 units across North America, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific, with an established base of nearly 900,000 owners. We have three principal revenue streams: Vacation Ownership Sales, Consumer Finance, and Property Management, each of which contributes significantly to our profitability. Our multiple brands, wide geographic reach, and variety of offerings enable a highly flexible vacation for the broadest demographic in the industry.", "RCI operates the world's largest vacation exchange network with 3.8 million members in over 4,300 affiliated resorts in more than 110 countries. RCI enables timeshare owners to exchange their points for weeks for stays at other properties. The product gives them enhanced flexibility at a nominal cost which is why RCI has customers who have been members for 20, 30, or even 40 years.", "With six months on the job, let me share with you why I'm so excited to lead this business. I joined Wyndham Vacation Ownership in April from Hilton Grand Vacations where I spent nine years and was most recently Chief Operating Officer, following sixteen years at Marriott International and Marriot Vacation Club. I have a deep respect for both companies, for their business models, and for their strong management teams.", "At the same time, I long admire Wyndham's reputation for innovation, its diversified marketing platform, and the quality and scale of its brand and resort network.", "Since May I've been traveling throughout the organization visiting my fellow team members and our owners. I've been especially impressed with the quality and focus of the team, the breadth of our brand portfolio, our significant scale and product offering which as I said earlier, reaches a broad consumer demographic. Combined these attributes will deliver dependable growth for shareholders and produce significant cash flows.", "Steve laid out the strategies and growth initiatives to the team at the beginning of the year. The most significant two of which are to grow new owners and to closely partner with a hotel company which includes fully leveraging Wyndham Rewards. His directive and direction was perfect and I fully endorse it.", "Let me explain. Similar to Wyndham Hotel Group, our owner base is the everyday traveler. We are the largest branded vacation ownership company targeting the section and we are able to do so with a product suite that encompasses a wide range of price points and markets supported by over 100 sales offices. The breadth and depth of this scale is critical to our commitment to growing new owners.", "With over $2 billion in annual gross VOI sales roughly equal to the combined sales of the next two largest timeshare companies, we are the undisputed leader at selling vacation ownership. This is especially compelling since unlike most branded timeshare companies, the majority of our tour sources have historically been unrelated to our hotel business. We have built this tremendous base through strong marketing alliances with other great consumer branded companies such as Seaworld, Caesars, and Margaritaville, and a wide variety of local marketing programs. The diversity and scale of our marketing programs is unrivaled in the timeshare industry and we intend to nourish this highly valuable capability.", "Now in addition, as Geoff noted earlier, Wyndham Rewards provides a significant marketing universe as members are a strong demographic set and have an affinity for our brand. With less than 5% of our VOI sales generated last year from Wyndham Hotel Group, we see significant untapped potential to grow this channel through enhanced call transfers, online marketing, rental cross-sell opportunities, and more. We saw signs of that growth in the third quarter with increased call transfer leads and package sales. As with our marketing leads are the key and in fact through the third quarter our hotel related leads are up 48% from the same time last year. And those packages will tour in the upcoming eight months supporting the new sales next year.", "Steve mentioned on the second quarter earnings call that the fundamentals of our business strategy are strong. In the third quarter, they remain strong with gross VOI sales up 7% even taken into account the challenges from hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Excluding the impact from hurricanes, we estimate that gross VOI would have increased over 8%.", "We're making strong progress in bringing new owners with a 16% year-on-year increase in North American new owner sales in the third quarter. We did this while holding VPG relatively flat. It's a significant achievement and reflects our focus on quality, long-term sustainable growth. Our sales mix over recent years has been about 67% owner upgrades and 33% new owners. We'd like to see that move to 45% new owners over the next five years. While the mix is important in my mind how we get there is critical. We are focused on innovative and efficient marketing with great sales to deliver high quality owners who will look to us to fulfill their lifetime vacation goals.", "Let me take a moment here to talk about RCI and its growth strategies. While our destination network business will continue to report until spin to CEO Gail Mandel who was a great leader and partner, I will cover the business for her today. RCI's primary strategies are to offer new membership and exchange options to grow its member base. We've had a great new alternative lodging options and member models with recent acquisitions. And with a proven track record of many innovative first in the timeshare industry, the team is focused on using analytics and technology to facilitate and enhance the exchange process. This ducktails nicely with our collective vision of delivering great vacation experiences.", "Finally, before turning the call over to David, I want to note that we expect a core part of our investment thesis to be generation and smart deployment of strong free cash flow. Wyndham was the pioneer of just in time capital light and capital efficient timeshare inventory development. Close to 80% of our sales last year were from capital efficient sources.", "Through smart, efficient inventory sourcing and effective monetization of our robust consumer finance portfolio in the ABS market, we expect to have strong EBITDA to cash conversion. And similar to Wyndham Worldwide, our capital allocation philosophy will be a combination of investing in organic growth, making disciplined accretive acquisitions, and returning capital to shareholders.", "I look forward to discussing our achievements and results with you in the years to come and with that I'll turn the call over to Wyndham's Chief Financial Officer, David Wyshner.", "David Wyshner", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning everyone. I'm thrilled to have joined Wyndham Worldwide at such an exciting and important time. I have long been familiar with many of Wyndham's businesses as a result of my work within for its predecessor companies from 1993 to 2006. As Steve, Geoff, and Mike have discussed, our operating segments have compelling business models that generate stable and recurring cash flows while also providing platforms for growth and expansion. I've been incredibly impressed by the teams running these great businesses and I believe there's a significant opportunity for us to increase shareholder value through and following the separation.", "Today I'd like to discuss our third quarter results, the impacts of the recent hurricanes on our businesses, our cash flows and liquidity, and our full-year outlook. My comments will focus on our adjusted results which are reconciled to GAAP numbers in our earnings release.", "Results for the quarter reflect the punishing impact of several hurricanes which we estimate reduced revenues by $13 million, adjusted EBITDA by $9 million, net income by $6 million, and adjusted EPS by $0.06.", "Our total revenues grew 4% reflecting higher services and membership fees and higher vacation ownership interest sales, partially offset by the impact of the storms. Adjusted EBITDA increased 3% reflecting the revenue gains as well as weather impacts and a tough year-over-year comparison we faced because of an $18 million reduction in incentive compensation driven by a reversal recorded in third quarter 2016.", "Nonetheless solely excluding hurricane impacts, in Q3 our revenues grew 4%, our adjusted EBITDA grew 5%, and our adjusted EPS grew 10%.", "In our Hotel group segment revenue grew 1% and adjusted EBITDA increased 4% year-over-year. Our results reflected a 9% increase in our core royalty and franchise fees and growth in other revenue due to the Wyndham Rewards Credit Card program. The revenue gains were partially offset by the absence of $13 million of global conference revenues that we had last year and lower managed hotel cost reimbursements. Both are pass-through revenues that are fully offset by expenses.", "Domestic RevPAR increased 3% in the quarter compared with the industry at 1.9%. Performance benefited modestly from higher demand due to the hurricanes and the solar eclipse in August. International RevPAR increased 4.1% in constant currency reflecting strong performance in a variety of locations including Canada, Germany, Turkey, and Argentina.", "Net system size was up 3% year-over-year primarily reflecting growth in all of our international regions, specifically the Wyndham Hotels and Resorts brand in South America, Europe, and China, as well as the Baymont brand in North America.", "In our Destination Network segment, revenues grew 5% and adjusted EBITDA increased 6%. The recent hurricanes reduced segment revenues and EBITDA by an estimated $5 million and $4 million respectively primarily at our RCI exchange business.", "Within WDN Vacation rentals grew 8%, transaction volume increased 4% including two points from tuck-in acquisitions, and average price per rental rose 3% partly due to currency movements. RCI exchange revenues declined 1% reflecting the net impact of a 1% increase in revenue per member and a 2% decline in the average number of members. Revenue per member benefited from increased pricing and favorable currency movements but was reduced by around three points due to the travel disruption from the recent hurricanes. The average number of members declined due to member attrition in our lower transacting clubs.", "In our Vacation Ownership segment revenues increased 4% and adjusted EBITDA declined 3% with the recent hurricanes reducing revenues and EBITDA by an estimated $7 million and $4 million respectively. In addition year-over-year EBITDA growth was impacted by $16 million of incremental variable compensation expenses due to the reduction in such costs last year.", "Despite the storms, we had our strongest gross VOI sales quarter ever with sales growing 7% year-over-year to $602 million. This included a 16% increase in sales to new owners consistent with our strategic focus on this customer segment.", "Results reflect a 7% increase in tour flow partially offset by a slight decline in sales volume per guest reflecting the mix effect of pass-through new owner growth. Tour flow in North America and the Caribbean were suppressed by sales office closures due to the hurricanes.", "Consumer financing revenues were up 6% to $119 million in the quarter. Our gross receivables portfolio grew 3% to $3.5 billion largely as a result of our sales growth.", "The provision for loan losses was up $19 million year-over-year to $123 million in line with but at the high end of our expectations.", "Defaults increased $12 million to $83 million.", "As I mentioned, the recent hurricanes reduced our tour flow and VOI sales by two points and $9 million respectively. Major sale sites we have in Florida and South Carolina were closed for several days due to the storms. Even more importantly, we have a large sale site in St. Thomas as well as a sales site in Puerto Rico that will likely be out of operation until early next year.", "Certainly weather events happen from time-to-time but the number and magnitude of events in the third quarter were unusual. All in, we estimate that we lost around 5,000 tours in Q3 as result of the hurricanes.", "Turning to our cash flows. We have generated $541 million of free cash flow year-to-date compared with $650 million over the first nine months of 2016. The decrease primarily reflects timing differences and growth in our receivables portfolio.", "Our liquidity position remains strong with more than a billion dollars of liquidity available as of September 30. In addition, we signed a new asset backed facility earlier this month that gives us an incremental $750 million of borrowing capacity.", "We continue to use a substantial portion of our free cash flow for share repurchases in the third quarter buying back 1.5 million shares at a total cost of $150 million. Year-to-date we've deployed $185 million of capital for acquisitions including the purchase of AmericInn in early October. And in the first nine months of the year, we've returned $635 million to shareholders through $450 million of share repurchases and $185 million of dividends.", "Now let's turn to our outlook, a summary of which was in the earnings release, the details of which will be posted on our website after the call. As we look at the fourth quarter, we expect that the recent storms will impact results in all three of our segments.", "In our Hotel Group, Hurricane Maria left our Rio Mar property in Puerto Rico needing significant repairs and the rooms we currently are able to use are primarily occupied by emergency relief workers, which is lower margin business.", "In our Destination Network operations, many affiliated properties throughout the Caribbean, South Florida, and elsewhere have been damaged reducing the inventory we have available to satisfy exchange requests.", "And in our Vacation Ownership business fourth quarter tour flow has been negatively impacted at a number of sites and we also think that the economic disruption in Puerto Rico, Texas, Florida, and the Virgin Islands, could potentially have some impact on our consumer finance portfolio.", "Our associates and our management teams have been working to mitigate the financial effects of the storms on our business. Nonetheless as we disclosed in our earnings release, we estimate that the hurricanes will negatively impact our fourth quarter revenues by $20 million to $30 million, our adjusted EBITDA by $15 million to $23 million, and EPS by $0.09 to $0.14. Therefore as a result of the storms, we're reducing our full-year 2017 projections. We now expect revenues of $5.8 billion to $5.85 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $1.38 billion to $1.395 billion, and adjusted net income of $618 million to $628 million.", "Adjusted diluted EPS which benefited from our share repurchases in the third quarter is now expected to be $5.95 to $6.05 based on a tax rate of just under 36% and a diluted share count of $103.9 million.", "For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.27 to $1.37 on a share count of 102.4 million excluding the effects of any fourth quarter share repurchases. Other than the effects of the storms, our businesses are continuing to perform well and in line with our earlier projections. We are increasing our forecast of 2017 global RevPAR growth to up 1% to 2% and we expect full-year room growth of 4% to 5% including the AmericInn acquisition.", "In Vacation Ownership we expect tours to grow 6% to 7% this year with the hurricanes having a roughly two point negative impact, VPG should be up slightly for the year as a whole.", "We now estimate our full-year free cash flow to be approximately $700 million to $725 million. The decline from our prior projection is driven entirely by hurricane impacts and separation costs.", "We're working through our 2018 budget right now and we plan to share thoughts about our outlook for 2018 and more information about the two post separation companies on our February call.", "In summary, our third quarter results were solid and in line with our expectations despite the hurricane. While we modified our full-year outlook to reflect the effects of recent weather events, the momentum across our business is strong. We have continued to return cash to shareholders through both dividends and repurchases, the separation process including our valuation of strategic alternatives for our European vacation rentals business is progressing well, and we remain enthusiastic about the longer-term prospects for our businesses.", "With that, I'll turn the call back to Steve.", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks, David. I hope you come away from the call with this clear sense that after the separation, we will be moving forward with two strong businesses that have significant competitive advantages, clear strategies, exciting opportunities, and best-in-class management led by Mike and Geoff. As a Chairman of both businesses I will remain engaged in each business with a particular focus on delivering value for shareholders through smart capital allocation decisions and on delivering value to franchisees and customers through the blue thread initiatives that we've been developing.", "We're confident that you will see in these two companies the powerful combination of Wyndham D&A and a strong energy and focus a great formula for short shareholder value creation.", "Finally, the corporate separation like the one we're doing is a massive undertaking that requires coordination across many functions and locations. I want to thank all of our associates for their focus and commitment in executing this separation plan while at the same time not missing a beat in providing our guests the economy of service they have come to expect from Wyndham.", "With that Geoff, Mike, David, and I will be pleased to take your questions. Please bear in mind that we may not be able to answer all question about the two companies following the spin until the Form-10 is filed. Keith?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions].", "We'll take our first question from Joe Greff with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Joe Greff", "Good morning everybody. Steve, a question for you on European rentals business. Obviously we heard your earlier comments about the level of interest in buyers of that business. Can you talk about your timing expectation, I mean would you expect that to be a signed deal somewhat ahead of when the spin is completed or you look at those as coterminous?", "Steve Holmes", "Well the -- thanks for that question Joe that those businesses are fantastic businesses and they have great management over there. So the amount of interest in those businesses is reflective of how strong the businesses are. So we're very proud of those businesses.", "As to timing a normal M&A process like this which we kicked off once we saw the level of interest that existed would probably take us to completing it before the spin, that is our hope. The hope is not being a good plan of course but we would hope to be able to get it done, it all depends on how quickly things move. But we have we've done everything we can to keep the process running slightly ahead of the spin and we've got a great team working on it. So I'm sorry I can't give you any more detail but M&A deals are always a little difficult to put a specific timeframe to.", "Joe Greff", "Okay, got it. And then I have a couple of small questions here. The first is with the updated full-year EBITDA guidance, if I look at the mid-point now versus the midpoint quarter ago and I look at the mid-point of the weather impact, it appears to be that there is some incremental EBITDA reduction outside of weather. What is that? And then also to can you just discuss I know it's not a large amount how much is AmericInn acquisition contributing to the fourth quarter?", "David Wyshner", "Hi Joe, it's David. With respect to EBITDA guidance I think the key issue as you go from midpoint to midpoint other than the hurricanes is that the loan loss provision has been running at the high end of our expectation for the year. There has been a number of other puts and takes but the one that stands out is driving us probably towards the lower half of the original guidance excluding hurricane impacts has been the loan loss provision running a bit higher.", "And then with respect to the AmericInn acquisition given the timing and some of the integration costs that we will have this quarter, we don't expect it to have any significant impact a positive or negative on EBITDA this year, but we do expect it to be a pretty significant contributor next year.", "Joe Greff", "Okay. So the incremental loan loss provision is, I'm guessing, it's something around $13 million to $14 million incrementally for the fourth quarter?", "David Wyshner", "Yes, it really is over the course of the year particularly in the third and fourth quarters and what you could see is that that our guidance early in the year was to be in the 18% to 20% range and year-to-date we're at almost exactly 20%.", "Joe Greff", "Okay, great. And then two final questions, one final question two part. In the fourth quarter, the $15 million to $23 million of EBITDA impact, how was that broken out between the business segment. And then part two with respect to your free cash flow comment of $725 million you mentioned hurricane impact, which we get, and then a separation cost what's the component or the total related to the separation cost? I see in the press release, separation costs for the nine months of this year is $24 million I guess, what's the increment in the 4Q and then that's it from me? Thanks.", "David Wyshner", "Working backward with respect to free cash flow, we expect that separation cost and hurricane impacts are each going to be in about the $30 million to $40 million range and that's the reason for the reduction in the free cash flow projection.", "And with respect to segments as I mentioned during my comments we really do expect all three of our segments to be affected by the hurricanes. I think the largest impact potentially about half of the total impact will be in the Vacation Ownership business and the rest will be split between the Hotel Group and in the Destination Network with the Hotel Group impact driven primarily by the Rio Mar property in Puerto Rico and Destination Network being challenged by just having less inventory available to satisfy exchange requests this quarter.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions].", "We'll go next to Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Patrick Scholes", "Hi, good morning. You noted that the blue thread is starting to have a positive impact. I think the figure was sales were driven by 5% last year, what is that this year has it grew from that 5%. And related to that I believe you've taken up your expectations for sales to new owners, I believe it was 40% previously now it's -- expectations in the future now 45% is blue thread impacting that change, that's my first and I have a follow-up.", "Mike Brown", "Good morning Patrick, this is Mike Brown. So just I guess a little broader on the blue thread and then directly to your question is we are very focused on the alignment with the Hotel Group. We have a number of initiatives underway such as the call transfer, increasing our on property presence, online presence, and getting our properties onto the rental platform for the Hotel Group.", "In fact, this year we've already put since May 93 properties onto that rental platform. We've made a number of changes in the call transfer program and that's what's leading to the increase of leads that I referenced at 48%. So this year the number is marginally up as a percentage of new owner sales, but I don't think that's much of a surprise because keep in mind our platform will do close to $700 million of sales this year through non-blue thread local marketing efforts to new owners.", "So we've got a big basin and our current sales of the blue thread is a relatively small percentage. But that increase of leads that we're seeing from the Hotel Group will translate to an increase in our overall percentage going forward. And I would expect as you see the new owner percentage move what you'll see is that move to a greater percentage of our new owner sales going forward.", "Patrick Scholes", "Okay. Thank you. And then a follow-up question here on the loan loss provision. You had briefly noted you expect part of the increase due to those have taken out loans who are domiciled in the hurricane areas. Outside of that have you seen any noticeable trends that are causing it to go to the higher end of your expected range?", "David Wyshner", "We've been running a bit higher because third-party defaults continue to put some pressure on that and that's really been the only thing other than the hurricanes that's impacting our loan loss provision. I think the silver lining there is that we've seen a flattening out of third-party produced defaults and that's a -- that's a positive that those aren't really growing at this point compared to what we were seeing earlier in the year, but the principal driver there has been on the third-party default issue.", "The other thing I would mention is that our -- quality of our portfolio actually continues to increase our average FICO scores are up compared to where they've been historically and where they were a year ago.", "Patrick Scholes", "Okay, thank you. That's it.", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks, Patrick.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Chris Agnew with MKM Partners.", "Chris Agnew", "Thanks very much, good morning. Good morning. Can you share your thoughts around the license fee paid to Wyndham Hotels from Wyndham Vacation Ownership as it appears to be lower than the license fee paid by the publicly traded timeshare peers? What are the puts and takes as you're thinking about that going forward? Thank you.", "David Wyshner", "Hi, Chris. It is something we're looking at as we go through this spin process. I think you're right in that the current level of less than 3% is below what others are doing and we do intend to look at that as we work through the process of preparing for the separation and looking at the comparables as well as other factors is going to be part of that process.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from David Katz with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.", "David Katz", "Hi, good morning all. I wanted to ask Geoff about one number that he gave out which was that the pipeline on the hotel side was up 35%. I wanted to make sure that I heard that correctly. If you could talk about what you attribute that to are there inducements involved is that personnel changes with how has that come about please.", "Geoff Ballotti", "Sure. We will be as creative as we can be for the right hotel and the right market for the right brand in terms of key money or developer advance notes or mezzanine. But most often, we don't need to use those vehicles. But the pipeline number that I referenced being up 35% was over the past three years. We continue to see very strong growth in our pipeline. We had a great quarter as you saw with the overall pipeline up 10% versus where we were last year. But I think what excites us the most right now about our pipeline is that our pipeline is growing more quickly domestically in the United States you saw an 18% growth in our pipeline in the quarter. And right now what again really excites us is that the brands that are growing the brands that we want to see grow, the Microtel by Wyndham's, the Hawthorn by Wyndham's, the Trip by Wyndham's, the Wyndham Gardens are higher fee par brands in the United States are growing and growing quickly.", "David Katz", "Understood. And if I can just ask Mike one very quick question within the Vacation Ownership business, there is obviously a lot going on between hurricanes we've been discussing some of the third-party inducements for a while now and I think this -- this is one of the first chances we've had to may be ask this question but within all of that noise in Vacation Ownership, what could you direct us to measure and keep an eye on as we go forward in terms of improved execution within that business so that we can keep tabs on progress?", "Mike Brown", "Well there has been a lot of noise and sometimes it's easy to confuse all of it. What I would say is I would and I'll share a few areas to look at but what you should be focused on is what we're focused on which is first of all we're number one focused on the consumers. And when you look at this industry over time it's been an extremely resilient industry because people love the value proposition and love the product offering that is Vacation Ownership whether it's Wyndham Vacation Ownership or anyone in the industry.", "So to the extent that we can execute that business plan and put people on vacations at the highest rate possible, we're going to be doing the best thing we can for our consumers and create long-term sustainable growth.", "Our business and one of my primary focuses in the first six months has been about getting our owners on vacation towards greatest extent as possible and maximum utilization of their ownership. With that said, the way to do that and the way to support growth is actually what we've shared until now growing our new owners that is the lifeblood of our business. We've been in business for longest -- the longest of any of the branded players and therefore we're uniquely ahead of the lifecycle of the owner base and therefore we're deeply committed to growing our new owners and that conversation is super important and working with the Hotel Group to grow that segment of the business because it provides higher VPGs and better margins. So if we can get people on vacation supported by new owners and the closer hotel affiliation those are the points of reference you can be looking for.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Stephen Grambling", "Thanks. Maybe just tacking on last question there for Mike I guess given your experience at Hilton Grant which clearly leverage the Hilton Honors program not only to target customers but in the timeshare offer itself as an added level of flexibility and breadth, how do you assess the current use of and potential opportunity from the Wyndham Loyalty program and the Vacation Ownership business?", "Mike Brown", "We'll I use the word and I will fully agree with it, it's a tremendous opportunity, you will have noticed Geoff use the term everyday traveler and so did I and that is an extremely large demographic in the American population. And for all the right reasons and timing it hasn't been fully leveraged until now. We will be leveraging that for years to come in every aspect and simply the fact that we put 93 of our properties on the rental platform, it's not just about sales and marketing, it's about growing the Wyndham Rewards opportunities, growing the cross-marketing between the properties and growing the intelligent and strong use of our data. That's the greatest opportunity we have and I think it's been an underutilized asset until now that collectively as we sit around this table as one we want to fully nourish and grow as we move forward.", "Stephen Grambling", "And then two related follow-ups maybe for Steve and I realized bit early but as you look at 2018 thinking about the combined are there any puts and takes to think about that could push you into or out of the longer-term EBITDA growth framework of 6% to 8%. I think you also mentioned last quarter that you expect some limited G&A slippage with the spin, is that still the expectation? Thanks.", "Steve Holmes", "Yes, hitting the second one first, we don't expect a lot of slippage from G&A standpoint, the business is kind of being recrafted if European rentals is taken out of the picture but we would expect their not be a lot of G&A slippage.", "With respect to growth rates going forward again we will give more detail after the Form 10 is filed and we're actually out talking to people about these two businesses but I don't have a view or a vision that tells me that the businesses should grow any slower on their own than they do as part of our enterprise. As I said a big part of doing this transaction is the fact that it allows the focus of management to drive their businesses harder. So, I would not expect slippage on that absent something happening in the macroeconomic environment but long-term growth the same or better.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Dan Wasiolek with Morningstar. Please go ahead.", "Dan Wasiolek", "Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, going back to your comments out of U.S. pipeline growth of 18% this quarter is that organic or does that include the AmericInn and then additionally with the reservation system now that you've rolled out can you maybe just talk about some of the potential benefits that you think that system will give Wyndham whether it's potential RevPAR uplift or franchisee unit growth potential. Thanks.", "David Wyshner", "Sure. No that does not include the acquisition of AmericInn. The 18% growth domestically in the quarter was all organic.", "To your second question in terms of system contribution we've seen great growth in fact this was the first quarter that our total system contribution domestically increased to a number over 60% and 50% globally. And I think a big piece of that has been the success as Mike was just talking about with Wyndham Rewards. Our share of occupancy from our Wyndham Reward members that have been checking into the hotel across North America has never been higher and continues to grow and has tremendous upside.", "Dan Wasiolek", "Yes. I guess I was with the reservation system I was speaking to the Sabre system I believe that you guys have been rolling out and just kind of long-term potential from having that system in place whether that there's any benefits or through yield managements or anything that you would highlight.", "David Wyshner", "Sure. Great question. When we look at the technology initiatives that we have that the biggest potential we have right now is moving all of our brands from legacy systems. Recall that all of these brands have been with the exception of two have been acquired over the years and we've acquired with each acquisition a legacy central reservation system. We made the decision several years ago to migrate off of those systems and decided to move everything onto one cloud-based central reservation system platform. To-date we have moved nine of our 20 brands on to that central reservation platform and what that provides each brand with is global to a connectivity that never had before. So in terms of our ability for each brand and we're seeing that today with the brands that we've moved on RAMADA internationally.", "They're now all on a central reservation system that's more connected than what they were on previously and we've seen significant share growth and contribution growth most importantly for the brands that have moved on. Our big brands Days Inn and Super 8 will move on days later this year we're targeting that for November. Super 8 the first quarter of next year will begin to really see an impact in contribution from having what we believe to be one of the industry's leading central reservation systems that is more connected than any other central reservation system out there right now and also not having to ourselves develop the technology and the expense associated with that.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions].", "And we'll go to David Hargreaves with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "David Hargreaves", "Hi, I just wanted to confirm whether I'm right about this it appears to me that in your debt agreements there's nothing that specifically guarantees attachment to any specific assets. So when you're determining how things are going to go during the split it appears that you have a lot of latitude I'm just wondering if you have that same read. And then also in looking at the two businesses it looks like the percentage of debt, the bonds are about 75% of the debt seems to line up with the timeshare and exchange business being about 75% of the EBITDA. It just seems like those conveniently match up and I'm just wondering if you're noticing that or you have a similar view or different view. Thank you very much.", "David Wyshner", "As we look at the debt we view it as a part of the current legal entity and as a result we would expect that the outstanding debt stays with RemainCo. With that being said as we look at the capital structures of both businesses that will almost certainly be some amount of leverage added to the Hotel Group that money ends up getting transferred or dividended up to -- up to the legacy parent entity and as a result that provides some opportunity for debt paydown relative to the amount of debt that's currently outstanding and that will be outstanding at RemainCo at the Vacation Ownership business post spin.", "So I think the right way to think about it is that the debt does stays with the Vacation Ownership and RCI business after the spin, but that amount will be adjusted based on leverage that we put on the Hotel Group.", "The other thing to consider as you think about that issue is that we are pursuing strategic alternatives for the European vacation rentals business and that could give rise to proceeds that impact the debt or net debt associated with each of the businesses as well. And we\u2019ll have more to say about these issues once we file the Form 10 and establish capital structures for the company post spin.", "David Hargreaves", "Is there any updated expectation as to when you\u2019re going to file the Form 10?", "David Wyshner", "I think the Form 10 will be filed on a confidential basis this quarter and will be publicly available at some point in the first quarter.", "Steve Holmes", "Okay, well thank you very much and I think we have kind of run through our time, we had a lot of comments early on, so people didn't get questions and we apologize we will be following up with everyone.", "Thank you very much for joining the call and your support of our company and we look forward to talking to as we have more information. Thank you.", "Operator", "And this will conclude today's Wyndham Worldwide Q3 2017 earnings call. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "I'll now turn the call over to Margo Happer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am.", "Margo Happer", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Steve Holmes, our CEO; and David Wyshner, our CFO; Geoff Ballotti, CEO of Wyndham Hotel Group; and Mike Brown, CEO of our Wyndham Vacation Ownership.", "Before we get started, I want to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to Risk Factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K filed February 17, 2017 with the SEC and our subsequent 10-Q. We will also be referring to a number of non-GAAP measures. Corresponding GAAP measures and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP are provided in the press release and enables to the press release which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at wyndhamworldwide.com.", "Steve?", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks, Margo. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I will start with an update on recent developments and then highlight some of the year's most significant accomplishments. David, will provide additional detail on our results and discuss our expectations for 2018. For sake of efficiency, David and I will deliver the prepared remarks but Geoff, Mike, David and I will all respond to your questions, hopefully not simultaneously.", "Since our last call, we delivered fourth quarter results that were stronger than we have projected and were driven by year-over-year growth in each of our three operating segments. We agreed to acquire the La Quinta Hotel brand franchise system and hotel management business. This nearly $2 billion acquisition will significantly enhance our presence in the mid-scale and upper mid-scale segments of the hotel industry and will make us one of the largest hotel management companies in the United States with over 400 hotels under management, all well maintaining our asset like business model.", "We continue to explore strategic options for our European rental business and remain optimistic about the process. We have received considerable interest in the business from potential buyers and we are responding to that interest. We look forward to updating you when we have something more definitive to say. We continue to return cash to shareholders repurchasing a $150 million of stock in the fourth quarter. We announced we're increasing our dividend by 14% to $0.66 per quarter or $2.64 annually. And we made outstanding progress on our plan to separate into two independent publicly traded companies with a spin-off of the hotel business still on track for completion in the second quarter of this year. It has been one of the busiest times in our history and it has been invigorating to be firing on all cylinders to deliver value for our shareholders. Let me discuss these developments in a bit more detail.", "We started the fourth quarter helping our guests, associates and businesses recover from three devastating hurricanes, as well as earthquakes and wildfires. We were cautious about the impact these events would have on our fourth quarter results. While the financial effects on our businesses ended up being roughly in-line with our expectations, our teams responded in great ways to help guests and associates recover. A wonderful example of this is our team at the Wyndham Rio Mar hotel in Puerto Rico; they have replaced 7,000 pieces of water damaged drywall, housed nearly 600 relied workers beginning less than a week after the storm, positioned the property would be the first Puerto Rican resort to reopen to guests which it did last week and accomplished all of this while operating on generator power for four months.", "As a result of these efforts -- such as these throughout our organizations and over performance in the areas unaffected by the hurricanes, we delivered adjusted EBITDA that was close to $10 million above the midpoint of the range we shared with you in October.", "Last month we announced that we had agreed to acquire the franchise management operations of La Quinta; this is a compelling transaction on many fronts. With La Quinta, our hotel group will spend 21 brands and over 9,000 hotels across more than 75 countries. The addition of La Quinta to our portfolio will build upon our strong mid-scale presence, expand our reach further into the fast growing upper mid-scale segment and position us to be the preferred partner and accommodations provider of developers and guests. In addition, we expect to generate synergies of $55 million to $70 million as we integrate our business and theirs, primarily through the elimination of duplicative costs. Therefore, the acquisition is not only a strong strategic fit but also as highly accretive and well enhanced growth in shareholder value for years to come. We expect to close the transaction in the second quarter.", "As I mentioned, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders with share repurchases in Q4 that brought our full year buyback totals to over $600 million or 6% of shares outstanding. We're also increasing our quarterly dividend reflect the strength of our business and our ongoing commitment to return cash to shareholders. At the same time, we're also cognizant of the cost to the La Quinta acquisition and our separation costs. Net of any proceeds from European vacation rental sales, that will all increase our debt. In that context, we may modulate our pre-spin share repurchases somewhat in order to earmark a portion of our free cash flow for debt reduction. Importantly, our separation process has been progressing very well. We filed the initial confidential draft to our Form-10 in November, received SEC comments in December and have already filed an amendment responding to those comments. We have drafted most of the separation related documents and have been working with banks to establish the capital availability we want our businesses to have post-spin.", "We expect to make the Form-10 for the hotel group publicly available next month and our plan is to give more information on both company's go-forward earnings and capital structures at that time. We expect to hold roadshows for both companies in May with distribution of the hotel companies stock soon thereafter. The Board and I are proud of the progress we made and we remain enthusiastic about both, the near and long-term prospects for each of these soon to be independent businesses. We're already seeing great evidence of how the separation will better enable each company to concentrate on growing it's core business and facilitate efficient future capital raising while generating value for shareholders. At the same time, we believe the two businesses will continue to benefit from the many blue-thread [ph] initiatives among our operations including the Wyndham Rewards program.", "The last few months have been extraordinarily business, even for us and I couldn't be proud of how our associates have tackled all the additional work and the additional uncertainty associated with our strategic transactions. I also don't want our strategic transactions to overshadow the excellent work our teams have been doing in the ordinary course to build our brands, grow our businesses and position us for future success. Therefore I'd like to review some of our principal accomplishments over the last year starting with the Wyndham Hotel Group.", "Geoff's clearly articulated three areas of focus; quality, technology and loyalty continue to drive our actions throughout 2017. Our hotel company has grown to have more affiliated hotels than any other organization in the world with an exceptionally strong footprint and significant opportunity for continued growth. Our brands garner four of the top five economy hotel spots in the 2017 JD Power Guest Satisfaction Index; a clear indication the our quality initiatives are yielding results. We introduced the trademark hotel collection, a soft brand concept for owners of three and four-star independent hotels.", "We also completed an important acquisition of AmericInn, our 20th brand. AmericInn has 200 franchised hotels and nearly 12,000 rooms along with strong quality scores and consistent high guest satisfaction ratings. The tuck-in acquisitions strengthens our presence in the attractive mid-scale space and we're excited to be put -- to soon be offering benefits of our Wyndham Rewards program to AmericInn franchisees and guests. Our teams have made incredible progress over the past two years establishing Wyndham Rewards as one of the world leading and most generous loyalty programs and growing it's base to nearly 55 million enrolled members. In 2017, we made Wyndham Rewards points redemption available at close to 100 Wyndham Vacation Ownership properties, creating new marketing opportunities between the two businesses.", "Looking ahead, we're eager to expand our awards winning Rewards program even further by welcoming the $13 million enrolled members of the La Quinta Returns Loyalty Program into the family once the acquisition occurs. Now Wyndham Destination Network, we made important strategic progress as well; our RCI Timeshare Exchange Business significantly expanded it's reach into new membership models with the successful acquisitions of DAE, a global direct-to-consumer exchange company and Love Home Swap, one of the world's largest home exchange programs. RCI continued to enhance it's membership capabilities with the introduction of the new RCI Gold Membership Tier and expanded it's developer network, both in the United States and in key growth markets such as Vietnam, Japan and China.", "I want to take a moment to acknowledge Gail Mandel and the WDN headquarters team, along with our European vacation rental teams who continue to deliver for guests and shareholders throughout the strategic review process. I've been continually impressed but not surprised by their unwavering dedication and hard work which exemplifies our count-on-me culture.", "In our Vacation Ownership segment, we hired Mike Brown in April and he quickly took the reins. We made great progress towards our goal of bringing new owners, growing sales to new owners 15%. We remain the undisputed leader in selling Vacation Ownership with over $2 billion in gross VOI sales in 2017. We strengthened our business through our industry leading marketing alliances and through tighter integration with the Wyndham Hotel Group. For example, in the fourth quarter we saw continued momentum with blue-thread call transfer leads and packaged sales which increased 83% from the same time last year. That's after a 48% year-over-year increase in the third quarter. New owners accounted for 36% of our sales volume in 2017 and we're on a path to increase that to 45% over the next five years without losing any of our focus on our high margin upgrade sales.", "We also launched a number of owner initiatives to ensure we're continually innovating to fulfill their lifetime vacation goals. For example, we launched new technology that facilitates online owner bookings while enhancing yield management. And we have deepened our owner engagement initiatives, our owner base which is more than double the size of any other Timeshare company is a powerful asset driving future VOI sales, property management and financing revenues.", "As you can see, we've accomplished a lot over the last year. Looking ahead, as we continue to move towards our separation into two independent public companies; I'm excited that both companies will begin this next chapter with significant competitive advantages, proven best-in-class management teams and clear path to superior value creation.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to David.", "David Wyshner", "Thanks, Steve and good morning, everyone. Today I'd like to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results. The impact of recently enacted corporate tax reform on us and our outlook for 2018. My comments will be primarily focused on our adjusted results and you can find our complete results in our earnings release including reconciliations of adjusted amounts to GAAP numbers and breakdowns of our total results between continuing and discontinued operations.", "As Steve mentioned, our fourth quarter results exceeded our expectations. As expected and discussed on our last call, results for the quarter were negatively impacted by the three major hurricanes in the third quarter which we estimate reduced fourth quarter revenues by $15 million, adjusted EBITDA by $16 million, net income by $10 million and adjusted EPS by $0.10. Nonetheless, our total revenues grew 4% in the fourth quarter reflecting favorable results across our businesses, partially offset by the impact of the storms. Adjusted EBITDA increased 5%, primarily reflecting the revenue growth. Importantly, if you exclude hurricane effects, in Q4 our revenues grew 6%, our adjusted EBITDA grew 10% and our adjusted EPS from continuing operations grew 17%.", "We realized that the need to classify our European Vacation Rentals business as a discontinued operation and the effects of tax reform make our 2017 results harder to understand and we are acutely aware that the significant acquisition of La Quinta, our own separation, and the new revenue recognition standard taking effect this year won't make things any easier to understand in 2018. We're committed to doing what we can to communicate the impacts of these various changes as clearly as possible.", "Turning to our business units; revenue in our hotel group segment grew 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 3%. The recent hurricanes reduced revenues and EBITDA by $1 million and $4 million respectively, meaning that adjusted EBITDA growth would have been 7% without the storms. Our results reflected growth in our core royalty and franchise fee streams and growth in ancillary revenues due to the Wyndham Rewards Credit Card program.", "Domestic RevPAR increased 4.5% in the quarter which compared with the industry at 4.2% and was driven by particularly strong performance at our economy brands. Performance in Florida and Texas benefited modestly from weather related demand. International RevPAR increased 5.5% in constant currency reflecting strong performance in a number of areas including Canada, Germany, Turkey, and Argentina. Net system size was up 4% year-over-year, primarily reflecting organic growth in addition to the acquisition of AmericInn. Our global pipeline grew 7% year-over-year including a 15% increase in our U.S. pipeline with domestic new construction rooms up over 20%, evidence that our brand initiatives and new prototypes are resonating with hotel developers.", "In our Destination Network segment, which now excludes the European Vacation rentals business, revenues grew 5% and adjusted EBITDA increased 23% or $9 million. Results benefited from higher pricing in our RCI business where exchange revenue per member increased 7%. Adjusted EBITDA also benefited from expense reduction initiatives.", "In our Vacation Ownership segment, revenues grew 4% and adjusted EBITDA increased 5%. The hurricanes reduced revenues and EBITDA by an estimated $13 million and $11 million respectively, meaning that revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth would have otherwise been 6% and 10% respectively. Tour [ph] growth was 7% and 13% excluding hurricane effects. Consumer financing revenues in our Vacation Ownership segment were up 6% to $120 million in the quarter. Our gross receivables portfolio grew 6% year-over-year to $3.6 billion, largely as a result of our sales growth.", "Our provision for loan losses was up $15 million year-over-year to $101 million as expected. Defaults increased $10 million to $94 million. Third-party induced defaults were consistent with third quarter levels but still up year-over-year. We think our Wyndham Care's customer outreach initiative and other efforts are helping us address the industry-wide issue of third-party induced defaults. But we still have more work to do to turn the tide and we're well aware that being the largest player in the industry with the largest owner base mathematically makes us a large target.", "In our corporate and other segment, Q4 expenses were up $6 million year-over-year due to higher variable compensation costs. We recorded approximately $106 million of non-cash impairment charges in the quarter. They were primarily related to a write-down of Vacation Ownership inventory in the Caribbean as a result of the hurricanes, and secondarily tied to certain guarantee and intangible assets in our hotel group. I should note that one of our hotel group assets we wrote down was for [indiscernible] property management contracts. Accounting rules required us to write-down the specific asset even though the Douche [ph] acquisition as a whole currently pencils out as us having paid only 8 times it's 2017 EBITDA contribution.", "Looking at the full year, our 2017 results were robust. In our hotel group, rooms grew 4% year-over-year including AmericInn and 3% excluding the acquisition, and RevPAR grows 3%, both domestically and globally. In Vacation Ownership, tour volume grew 6% despite hurricane effects and VPG was up 1%. Sales to new owners as Steve noted rose 15%, reflecting our strategic focus on this customer segment.", "Adjusted EBITDA from total operations was $1.397 billion, and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations grew 6% excluding headwinds from the hurricanes and higher variable compensation expense. Adjusted diluted EPS from total operations was $6.16 at 7% year-over-year increase or 10% when excluding the 3-point negative impact from hurricanes. We generated $799 million of total free cash flow in 2017 compared with $782 million a year earlier. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher net income. The absolute level of free cash flow was higher than we had anticipated in October and we deployed more than $840 million of cash for share repurchases and dividends in 2017. In addition, we used over $190 million of capital for acquisitions including the purchase of AmericInn in early October. All-in-all, we think it was a darn good year.", "Turning to tax reform; the recently enacted tax cuts and jobs act is good news for us. In the fourth quarter we recorded a $415 million non-cash tax benefit as we reduced our net deferred tax liability because of the new lower federal rate. Even more importantly, we expect that our effective tax rate applicable to adjusted pre-tax earnings will be approximately 25% going forward, about 12 points below where it was previously. And overtime, our cash tax rate will be around 19% instead of 30% previously. This will enhance our free cash flow by around $100 million a year. Overtime, we expect that tax reform will allow us to invest more in our business and to have more cash flow available to return to shareholders.", "With a solid 2017 behind us, we're enthusiastic about our prospects as we start 2018. Our projects for the year exclude our European vacation rentals business which is now a discontinued operation and excludes the not yet closed La Quinta acquisition and are presented based on our historical revenue recognition accounting and recent exchange rates. We have taken this approach in an attempt to make our guidance as comparable to our adjusted 2017 results as possible, as well as because we don't yet know exactly when the La Quinta acquisition will close. Also, for the sake of comparisons we've provided full year projections for Wyndham Worldwide and it's segments today without giving effect to our planned spin-off. We plan to bridge today's projections to projections for our spin-co and our remain-co after we make the hotel groups Form-10 available next month.", "So as I said, we're enthusiastic about 2018. Our projections for the year are laid out on Table 12 of our earnings release. We expect revenues to grow 4% to 6% this year. We expect our adjusted EBITDA to grow in-line with our long-term objective of 6% to 8% to $1.330 billion to $1.355 billion. Because the third quarter 2017 hurricanes will continue to affect our results in 2018, the year-over-year effect of the 2017 hurricanes is minimal in 2018. Importantly, we expect our EBITDA growth will be driven by revenue and earnings growth in each of our operating segments. Our projections as their midpoints call for EBITDA growth of 8% in our hotel group, 3% in our destination network, 7% in vacation ownership and 7% overall. We expect adjusted dilutes earnings per share from continuing operations of $6.90 to $7.05, an increase of 25% to 28%; this is based on a diluted share account of 101.7 million shares which per our standard practice assumes no share buybacks in 2018 even though we do plan to repurchase stock this year. Even without the benefit of tax reform, our adjusted EPS growth would be 7% to 9%.", "In our hotel group segment, we expect room growth at 2% to 4% and we project global RevPAR to be up 2% to 3% which we believe is consistent with industry forecasts. We expect hotel group adjusted EBITDA will be $445 million to $455 million versus $416 million in 2017. At Destination Network, which is now comprised of our Vacation Exchange and North American Vacation Rental businesses, we expect revenues to grow 3% to 6% and adjusted EBITDA to be $265 million to $275 million, an increase of 1% to 5%. We expect the average number of exchange members and to exchange revenue per member, both to increase 1% to 3%. In Vacation Ownership we expect revenue growth of 5% to 7% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 6% to 8% to $735 million to $750 million.", "Our key top line metric, gross VOI sales is expected to grow 7% to 9% reflecting overall tour growth of 5% to 7%, and faster growth in new owner tours. We expect VPG to be up 1% to 3%. Our Timeshare guidance assumes that our loan-loss provision rate continues to be around 20% of sales reflecting anticipated higher financing levels and no significant increase of decrease in pressure from third-party related defaults. The attractive cash flow characteristics of our business remain the same and we should have a roughly $100 million cash flow benefit from tax reform.", "With that being said, our cash flows will also be impacted by looking to acquisition coupled with transaction costs, separation costs, insurance recoveries, hurricane related capital expenditures and potentially the disposition of our European vacation rentals business. Absent to all of this noise and any timing differences, the growth in our earnings and the favorable effects of tax reform would take the roughly $800 million of annual free cash flow that we've been generating to somewhere between $900 million and $1 billion. As you think about our full year earnings, you should expect La Quinta to contribute about $8 million of EBITDA a month when we first acquire it subject to some seasonality growing to around $13 million by late 2019 as the business is fully integrated.", "Our 2018 outlook calls for adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $263 million to $268 million in the first quarter. This represents a 5% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. As you build out quarterly models, please remember that the September 2017 hurricanes are still a drag on earnings right now but they should help our fourth quarter comparisons. The seasonality of our VOI sales will also impact the loan-loss provision we report as a percentage of sales in Q1 which will be a few points higher than what we expect for the year as a whole.", "Generally speaking, in 2018 we expect to continue the growth we were delivering in 2017 and for the effects of the hurricanes to dissipate as we move through the year. I want to reiterate that we're enthusiastic about our businesses and prospects as we start 2018.", "And with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve.", "Steve Holmes", "Thanks, David. So as I said earlier, this has been a busy time for us. Our Board and our senior leadership team are particularly pleased and impressed that our entire organization has continued to deliver robust results during a period of significant change and we are confident that the actions we are taking are positioning our businesses well for both, near and long-term growth and success.", "With that, David, Geoff, Mike and I will be pleased to take your questions. Erica?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to the line of Joe Greff from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Joe Greff", "Looking at your 2018 guidance, David you may have mentioned this but how much contribution are you making from AmericInn in 2018?", "David Wyshner", "AmericInn's going to contribute about $11 million or $12 million incremental year-over-year.", "Joe Greff", "And what was the contribution in the 4Q?", "David Wyshner", "That was minimal, it was $1 million or $2 million.", "Joe Greff", "And Steve, you mentioned in your earlier remarks about new owners as a percentage of the total -- migrating upto 45%, can you share with us what your goals are for 2018?", "Steve Holmes", "I'll let Mike that one.", "Mike Brown", "In 2015 we had 67% of our sales [indiscernible]. That means that David mentioned down to -- it increased 300 basis points to 64% owners and 36% to new owners. As we look into next year, we want to move that about 200 basis points again, increasing our owner base another 200 basis points for the long-term goal of getting over five years to 55% owners and 45% new owners.", "Joe Greff", "How much cost do you have left in 2018 to affect -- and what was the amount in the fourth quarter of '17?", "David Wyshner", "The separation related costs so far have been in the $15 million range and we continue to expect that overall separation costs will be around $300 million, some portion of which -- a minority of which will be non-cash.", "Joe Greff", "And the cash portion in 2018 would be roughly in what range?", "David Wyshner", "Almost all of the expenses in the fourth quarter were cash expenses.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Steven Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Stephen Grambling", "You talked to the benefit of the split and how that can drive some future consolidation; you've already had a very quick start in the Hotel Group. I'm wondering if you could talk to how you would think through consolidation, going forward is this kind of the end of it or there is still opportunities in the Hotel Group? And then also as you think about Timeshare, is there opportunity for consolidation there? And I know you've had some comments on scale in the past, what are your latest thoughts on what potential synergies you could think through in terms of consolidation in Timeshare? Thanks.", "Steve Holmes", "I'll start off just by saying that one of our goals is we establish these companies as standalone businesses is that they will have the capacity to be acquisitive; we think that's important to fuel shareholder value and growth. But Geoff, I'll turn it over to you for the hotel part of the question.", "Geoff Ballotti", "We're looking absolutely at every deal that presents itself and we'll continue to do it. But I think what we're most excited about is our organic growth, particularly in North America. We saw our North American pipeline grow 15% and what it really excites us in terms of the organic side of that growth is we're growing in the area of the market, right now that we're looking to grow in. Obviously with acquisitions like AmericInn and La Quinta, but with our prototype mid-scale brands that saw the greatest growth in their pipeline, our Hawthorn brand on the extended stay side are win gate on the mid-scale side and our trademark brand which -- as Steve was talking earlier has added 5,000 rooms to the pipeline and is now at 70 hotels. We see great opportunity for both organic and acquisition opportunities as they present themselves.", "Mike Brown", "As it relates to the Vacation Ownership side, the last five years has definitely shown that the industry itself has favored the hospitality brands and I think consolidation will be possible as we move forward. With that said and being in my role for less than a year, our primary focus is our core strategic focus going forward which is really around many of the things that Steve has mentioned around new owner growth and the blue-thread. With that said, and the free cash flow model that we'd expect post-spin, we will be more naturally acquisitive but we will only be looking at deals that are strategic fit for us and obviously financially accretive. Going forward, we won't be looking for acquisitions simply for the sake of acquisitions.", "Stephen Grambling", "You just mentioned the benefits of tax reform, and this is maybe a question for all of you but the benefits of cash -- benefits of tax reform which aren't really going to be impacting EBITDA change; how you think about potential leverage target ratios and capital deployment in each of the businesses? Thanks.", "David Wyshner", "I think the point you make is a good one, they are clearly more of our EBITDA will be flowing through to cash flow and the net income as lower tax rate. So it does give us a little bit more room but I don't think it changes a lot the way we'll approach leverage. The way we approach leverage, what it does -- really create is an opportunity as I mentioned to invest more in our business overtime and the La Quinta acquisition is an example of that; and to return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to the line of Patrick Scholes from SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "Patrick Scholes", "I look to first drilldown a little bit on the strong performance in the exchange of RCI on the revenue per member. It looks like 7% was one of the strongest growth rates we've seen in quite some time. I wonder if you can give a little bit more color on that, you did note that driven by higher pricing but specifically, was this a price hike on the membership or the exchange portion?", "Steve Holmes", "There was price increase, I believe it was both on membership and on transaction, and that's usual for us, that's normal. Bear in mind, the fourth quarter is not a big quarter so beats are a little bit more pronounced than they are in our larger quarters but it was a great quarter for RCI and they continue to innovate and find ways to drive that kind of share of wallet that they can get from members higher and higher. You have anything else, Mike?", "Mike Brown", "That's right, Steve. So I look at the increases is representing both, the price increase that we put through as well as driving customers, driving members there to higher value added products that helps increase our revenues per member.", "Patrick Scholes", "You noted in the remarks that your guidance assumes no changes in third-party default issues. I wonder if you could just touch little more color; do you see the defaults sort of -- have reached sort of their peak level and now it's lessening or it's sort of a steady state, not getting worse but not getting better at this point?", "Mike Brown", "It's the first time I spoke about the subject on the call, I'll take a little bit more time on this because I think it's such an important issue. Because I was certainly aware when I joined Wyndham of the third-party default issue. But what caught me by surprise when I joined was mainly the tactics, and at some cases misinformation that was being shared with our member base. And in addressing the issue, we've really consolidated our strategy and got back to what we believe is absolutely critical to be successful on the issue. And in the end, this industry provides a tremendous product which puts people on vacation, and great vacations; and that's what our strategy going forward is -- is we want to deliver great vacations to our owner base. And more importantly, we want to own the relationship with our nearly 900,000 members; and many of the third-party companies have intercepted that relationship in a variety of different ways and we've launched a number of different programs to really gain and own the relationship, direct communication and whatever media format is out there whether it be by phone, face to face, the digital landscape or on the web; it is our mission to own not only every context but to deliver our owners wish list of great vacations.", "In that respect, we did see some positive trends as a result of our campaign in September of last year. As David mentioned in the remarks, there is a year-on-year growth but we're seeing that year-on-year growth slow. And I would attribute that to what Wyndham has always done well in this industry, it's innovate and you're well aware of the ovation program but we launched Wyndham Care's in the fourth quarter of last year which is really there to give consumers an outlet not only when they are looking to exit their product but when they need to know more about their ownership; and then many cases just look at properties that they are looking to vacation.", "As an example, just yesterday we had 100 phone calls to Wyndham Care's people that we're enquiring about exiting their ownership; that's a great progress and great contact that we're beginning to develop and grow our one-to-one relationships. So we think we have very positive trends, our owners love their ownership and I think in the long run we'll see that trend really help us in the third-party default issue.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Sherritt [ph] from Wolf Research.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I think in the past you've called out an $8 million impact to EBITDA from 100 basis points change in interest rates. Is that still accurate because your current guidance take into account current interest rates?", "David Wyshner", "I think that is about right, we would see that sort of impact on EBITDA and there would be a similar or $10 million-ish impact on below the line interest expense associated with a 100 basis point move in rates. We build our forecast based on the forward curve and -- yes, it does reflect current rate expectations which I guess we all think might be moving around a little bit today but they are based on where the forward curve was.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Now looking to acquisitions, you're obviously going to have to lever up some -- can you just help us understand the debt structure of the new entities and if you can't answer that, maybe you can just help us understand your longer term targeted leverage ranges for both, Timeshare and Hotel?", "Steve Holmes", "We're not quite ready to tackle either of those pieces yet but what we will be working through is the allocation of the aggregate amount of debt between the two companies. We ended the fourth quarter with around $3.7 billion of debt and we'll be adding $2 billion -- it's $3.7 billion of net debt and we'll be adding about $2 billion for the La Quinta acquisition. If we end up with a disposition of our European Vacation Rentals business, that would reduce the amount of net debt that we need to allocate between the two businesses by a fair amount. And from there what we'll be looking to do is, for each business to pick up an amount of debt that obviously adds upto the total but also provides each business with acquisition capacity and capability going forward; so we're going to be going through that exercise with an approach of putting in place capital structures that are not only appropriate for each of the businesses but gives each of them an opportunity to pursue a tuck-in acquisitions and consolidation in their respective businesses.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I think you said 20% of sales for 2018 was the target; you came in a little below that for the fourth quarter, so can you just help me think about how we go from -- I think it was just a little under 19% this quarter to back to 20% for 2018?", "David Wyshner", "Because we report that as a percentage of sales, there is a little bit of seasonality in the numerator and there is seasonality in the denominator as well. So I think it's better to look at that one a full year basis or to look at it as keeping the reserving -- the allowance against the debt that we have, pretty consistent overtime. So there is a little bit of noise just in a percentage of sales based calculation from quarter-to-quarter and I really view what we're forecasting as being fairly consistent with where we've been running.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to the line of David Hargreaves from Stifel. Please go ahead.", "David Hargreaves", "I'm just trying to think things through conservatively. If we're looking at the remain-co structure, I think originally you had indicated an intention to raise some debt at the spin-off piece and spend some of that back so that remain-co [ph] could deliver a bit. But with La Quinta, if we're trying to think about it conservatively maybe there isn't a lot that you could send back. I'm just wondering if that's still your intention with that acquisitions or if we should be thinking maybe remain-co [ph] could be 3.5 times levered business, it's not a terrible thing by the way and the results certainly show that it could sustain that but I'm just wondering if that's an unreasonable hypothesis that we should be thinking through?", "David Wyshner", "I appreciate the creativity to try to get us to answer this question a little bit sooner than we're planning on. We are continuing to work through it. I think the nature of both businesses is that they have a stability and a predictability to them that will allow them to -- that would allow each of them to have a fair amount of depth; and by doing so to optimize the capital structure. As we look at some of the scenarios for how we allocate the capital, I think we feel good about the ability of the businesses to absorb the amount of depth that needs to be allocated but we're just not ready, we don't think it's appropriate to discuss that at this point in time but we will have more to say about it I think in the relatively near future.", "David Hargreaves", "But could you speak to your level of confidence in closing in the second quarter as some of the milestones appear to slipped a little bit?", "Steve Holmes", "Closing in the second quarter on the spin, is that what the question is?", "David Hargreaves", "Yes.", "Steve Holmes", "I mean, we're relatively confident, we need an IRS ruling, we've got to file the final Form 10 but there is nothing really standing in the way of us getting this done in the second quarter. We'd ideally would love to have the European Rental and the La Quinta acquisition, both done as of that time but that's as it's planned right now and we feel good about it but there is no certainty in the world and things can change. We're basically -- we're on our plan, well on our plan.", "Operator", "Thank you. And at this time we have no further questions. So I'd like to turn it back over to our speakers for any closing comments.", "Steve Holmes", "Well, thank you all very much for joining us.
