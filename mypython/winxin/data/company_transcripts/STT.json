On our call today, our Chairman and CEO, Jay Hooley, will speak first. Then, Mike Bell, our CFO, who will take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. During the Q&A, please limit your questions to two questions and then re-queue.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include operating basis and other measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our 4Q '16 slide presentation.", "In addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors, such as those factors referenced in our discussion today; in our 4Q '16 slide presentation under the heading Forward-Looking Statements; and in our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our 2015 Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them, even if our views change.", "Now, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Joseph Hooley", "Thanks, Anthony. Good morning, everyone. In reviewing our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results, I want to reinforce that our performance reflects the strength of our business and our commitment to advancing key strategic priorities that supports State Streets growth.", "I'm pleased with our 2016 performance, our major accomplishments and the substantial progress we made to address strategic priorities. In a challenging year, we stayed focused on our client needs, invested in new products and solutions including the acquisition of GE Asset Management, accelerated the pace of State Street Beacon digitization initiatives and achieved positive fee operating leverage for the full year, excluding the impact of the acceleration of deferred compensation expense in 4Q '16.", "As I just mentioned, we recorded a compensation expense in fourth quarter '16 reflecting the elimination of the service requirement from the churns of our outstanding deferred cash awards. This accelerated expense will give us the flexibility to improve the mix of cash in equity in our incentive compensation and our organization in future years, which will improve recruitment and retention of talent. Mike will take you through the details of this in a few minutes.", "Now, if I refer you to Slide number 5 on the slide deck. I'll walk you through some of our key achievements this past year. We made advances on our strategic priority to digitize the Company through States Street Beacon delivering tangible service improvement benefits to clients. By making advances in our goal of digitizing end-to-end, we're leveraging our strength as a middle and back office provider to deliver integrated solutions that improve the data, speed and overall service experience to our clients.", "We're investing in solutions to deliver client value across all of our businesses, including the data and analytics to help clients comply with SEC modernization. We're also delivering data GX's capabilities to support our asset on our clients as they in source asset management. We also continue to drive growth from our core franchise. We recorded net asset servicing wins of approximately 1.4 trillion for the year, including a 180 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong growth with significant participation from Europe.", "Many of the large wins in 2016 that we highlighted to be represent clients consolidating the relationship with State Street. For example in the fourth quarter, we expanded our relationship with Allianz Global Investors that extends their existing service relationship into a strategic role of partnership to deliver a broad spectrum of global investment servicing solutions, including custody and accounting services. As a result of a decision to the versified providers, Blackrock will move a portion of their assets, largely common trust funds, currently with State Street to another service provider.", "State Street remains a significant service provider to Blackrock and the transition will not be fully complete until 2018 and represents just over $1 trillion in assets. In our total new business yet to be installed at quarter end was just over 440 billion. In our SSgA asset management business, overall we experience net flows of 16 billion during the fourth quarter. In our ETF business, we have 36 billion in fourth quarter 2016 net inflows and 52 billion full year 2016 net inflows, which partially reflects traditional fourth quarter seasonality into SPY, our S&P 500 ETF, but also reflects continuous investment in our ETF product portfolio and distribution.", "SSgA also finished 2016 with approximately 46 billion in assets under management across our target date strategies, a nearly 50% increase in 2015. We continue to invest in developing products and services that will enable us to meet client needs and drive differentiation. Recent examples include expansion of the suite of environmental, social and governance or ESG investment products at SSgA. We recently launched Currenex X2, a next generation institutional foreign exchange trading platform with enhanced capabilities to help our clients' trade more rapidly and with greater functionality.", "And our investment in blockchain distributed ledger application trials to seek to automate or improve the accuracy and processing speed of some of our more complex transactions such as syndicated loans, securities lending and collateral management. We remain committed to expense control, as reflected by our full year positive fee operating leverage of 51 basis points for 2016 versus 2015, excluding the effects of the fourth quarter accelerated deferred compensation expense. And through State Street Beacon, we achieve approximately a 175 million an annual pretax expense savings.", "And during 2016 through share repurchases and common share dividends, we returned just over 1.9 billion of capital to common shareholders. I want to go over up four strategic priorities for 2017 that we have led out for you on Slide 6. These are underway now built upon our momentum coming out of 2016 and support our long-term growth and transformation process into a digital leader and financial services. The priorities include advancing our digital leadership through State Street Beacon, continuing to drive growth from our core franchise, continuing to invest in new products and solutions and achieving our financial goals including generating positive fee operating leverage and continuing to return capital to shareholders.", "Before I turn the call over to Mike, I want to welcome Eric Aboaf, who will be moving into the CFO role by early March. Eric joined us in December and is here with us today, but will not a speaking role in today's call. Eric will be speaking in the first quarter call on April 26th. I'd also like to take a moment to thank Mike Bell for all of his work supporting the firm and our key initiatives.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mike who will review our financial performance for the fourth quarter as well as our outlook for 2017, and following that Mike and I will be available to answer your questions. Mike?", "Mike Bell", "Thank you, Jay, and good morning everyone. This morning, I'll start my review of our fourth quarter 2016 and full year 2016 results on Slide 7. Slide 7 highlights two notable items that impacted 4Q '16 and full year 2016 GAAP and operating basis results.", "First, we recorded tax benefits amounting to a total of $0.54 of earnings per share. This includes a $145 million associated with the designation of certain of our foreign earnings as indefinitely invested overseas based upon our review of our need for capital liquidity in future investment. The income tax benefits also include a $66 million tax benefit attributable to incremental foreign tax credits and a foreign affiliate tax loss.", "Second, as Jay mentioned, we accelerated the expense associated with outstanding deferred cash incentive compensation awards to our employees below the level of Executive Vice President are removing the continued service requirement associated with these existing deferred cash awards. The schedule of the patents of these existing awards has not changed. The impact of this acceleration increased 4Q '16 expenses by approximately $249 million. The expense that would otherwise have been associated with these cash-settled incentive compensation awards will no longer be reflected in future periods.", "The acceleration of the expense is expected to financially allow us to increase the immediate cash component of the incentive compensation in future periods relative to the mix in our awards in the recent years. Importantly, we expect the expense impact of increasing the mix of cash in 2017 incentive awards will approximately offset the going-forward effects of the 4Q '16 acceleration in 2017.", "Now, turn to Slide 8 in the slide presentation for a summary of our operating basis results for full year 2016 and 4Q '16. 2016 results included a slow start to the year for U.S. markets and lower average daily values for international equity markets throughout the year. We also saw client redemptions in hedge fund business and other unfavorable asset mix changes. Despite these headwinds, full year 2016 EPS increased approximately 8% and ROE increased to 11.1%. This includes the impact of the fourth quarter notable items. Excluding the 4Q '16 expense associated with the acceleration of deferred cash incentive compensation and the 4Q '16 tax benefits, 2016 full year EPS increased 5% and ROE increased slightly. Our 2016 pretax margin of 27.1% decreased relative to 2015.", "Nevertheless excluding the 4Q '16 expense associated with the acceleration deferred cash incentive compensation and the impact of the acquired GE Asset Management business, the 2016 pretax margin increased approximately 60 basis points to 29.7%. Turning now 4Q '16, EPS of a $1.48 increased from $1.21 in the year ago quarter and increased from a $1.35 in 3Q '16. As I mentioned earlier 4Q '16 EPS includes a net $0.13 benefit associated with the notable items. On the capital front in 4Q '16, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.38 per share and purchase $325 million of our common stock.", "Moving to Slide 9, we've got the highlight that excluding the expense associated with the acceleration of deferred cash awards and the impact of the acquired GE business, we demonstrated continued progress in managing expenses for full year 2016, resulting in 51 basis points of positive fee operating leverage.", "Please turn to Slide 10 and 11, and I'll briefly review 4Q '16 operating basis fee revenue. Compared to 4Q '15, the stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted operating basis fee revenue with a corresponding benefit to total expense of $27 million. On a constant currency basis and excluding the impact associated with the acquired GE business, 4Q '16 fee revenues increased by approximately 4% relative to 4Q '15. Specifically servicing fees increased reflecting new business across our servicing lines, partially offset by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, client redemptions in the hedge fund business and the non-favorable asset mix change.", "Servicing fees decreased from 3Q '16 primarily reflecting the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, as new business was approximately offset by hedge fund out loads and an unfavorable asset mix change. Management fees increased from 4Q '15 and excluding the impact of currency translation and the acquired GE business, management fees were up $2 million or 8% primary driven by the elimination of money market fee waivers, higher equity markets and strong ETF flows partially offset by outflows in cash and sovereign funds.", "Foreign exchange creating revenue increased from 4Q '15 and 3Q '16 reflecting higher volatility and client related volumes. Securities finance revenue increased from 4Q '15 primarily reflecting growth in enhanced custody partially offset by lower agency revenue. Processing fees and other revenue decreased from 4Q '15 and 3Q '16 reflecting unfavorable valuation adjustments, which include the unfavorable impact of higher FX swap cost and lower revenue from joint ventures, partially offset by higher revenue associated with tax advantaged investments.", "Moving to Slide 12, net interest revenue increased from 4Q '15 primarily reflecting higher market interest rates in the U.S., higher than normal discrete security prepayments of approximately $8 million and disciplined liability pricing.", "Now turn to Slide 13 to review 4Q '16 operating basis expenses. Notably expense control continued in 4Q '16, excluding the expense associated with the acceleration of deferred cash incentive compensation, total expense decreased from 3Q '16, compared to the year ago quarter and excluding the expense associated with the acceleration of deferred cash incentive compensation and the GE acquisition, expenses increased less than 1% primarily reflecting strong progress on State Street Beacon effective management of our other operating expenses and the benefit of the U.S. dollar.", "Let me now move to Slide 15 to review our capital highlights. Our capital ratios remained strong which has enabled us to deliver on a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. Compared to September 30th, our common equity Tier 1 ratio decreased under the fully faced in standardized and advanced approach, primarily driven by a decrease in the after-tax, unrealized mark-to-market position within the AFS investment portfolio due to higher interest rates as well as reduction in the FX translation due to the stronger U.S. dollar. The December 31th fully faced in supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation and the bank also decreased driven by a lower after-tax unrealized mark-to-market position within the AFS investment portfolio.", "Now coming briefly on the final TLAC rule that was issued in December become effective 1/1/19. The final rule was largely in line with our prior expectations. Based on the external long-term debt requirements linked to our SLR, we currently estimate that we will need to issue incremental qualifying debt of approximately $2 billion.", "Moving onto the next slide which we provide an update to our recently completed acquisition of GE Asset Management, the acquired GE Asset Management operations continue to support our plan to allocate capital to higher growth in return businesses. In 4Q '16, these operations contributed $64 million in estimated operating basis revenue and 58 million in estimated operating basis expenses, excluding merger and integration expenses and financing costs. We continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to operating basis EPS and for revenue to exceed $270 million for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 2016. Importantly, as the integration progresses, we expect further revenue growth and expense synergies in the first half of 2017.", "Moving to Slide 17, I'll update you on where we stand regarding our financial outlook. In 2017, we remained focused on key priorities for returning capital to shareholders, prudently managing expenses and executing on State Street Beacon as well as driving growth in our core franchise by delivering solutions to our clients. Importantly in 2017, we're targeting positive fee operating leverage of 100 to 200 basis points. Supporting this target, we expect operating basis fee revenue to grow by 4% to 6% and would increase our expected 2017 net State Street Beacon operating basis savings to $140 million.", "Turning to net interest revenue, we've developed two scenarios for 2017 operating basis NIR. The first scenario assumes market interest rates to remain at December 31 levels. Under this scenario, we expect operating basis NIR to be in the range of approximately $2.2 billion to $2.23 billion. The second scenario assumes U.S. central bank hikes for 25 basis points in both March and September. Under this scenario, we expect full year 2017 operating basis NIR to be in the range of $2.27 billion and $2.3 billion. Notably 2017 NIR will also be impacted by the level of deposits, the deposits swap to U.S. dollars and the associated expense will depend on further potential interest rate diversions between the respective currencies that we swapped.", "We currently expect our operating basis tax rate to be 30% to 32%, which does not assume any potential tax law changes due to the high level of uncertainty. Let me briefly touch on 1Q '17 before turning to the last slide. While our first quarter 2017 revenue will be impacted by market conditions, we expect to generate positive fee operating leverage relative to 1Q '16 supported by our continued focus on expense management. Also it's important to highlight that is in prior years, 1Q '17 compensation and employee benefits expense will be seasonally higher through the effect of the accounting treatment of equity compensation from retirement eligible employees as well as for payroll taxes and associated benefits. We expect the incremental amount attributable to equity compensation for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes in 1Q '17 to be in a range of $150 million to a $160 million compared to 122 million in 1Q '16.", "Moving to the last slide let me briefly review our 2017 balance sheet and capital outlook. We expect the balance sheet to modestly decline in 2017, driven by lower client deposits and lower wholesale CD levels, with the corresponding decrease in the average earning assets of approximately 0% to 5% compared to the 4Q '16 average earning asset levels. On the capital front, we have approximately $750 million remaining under our June 2016 common stock purchase program, and evolving regulatory and liquidity expectation mainly the issuances of both preferred shares and long-term debt in 2017.", "In summary, despite the environmental headwinds that we've experienced, we're pleased with 4Q '16 and full year 2016 results, and believe we're well position to achieve our 2017 financial objectives.", "Now, let me turn the call back over to Jay.", "Joseph Hooley", "Thanks Mike. Victoria that ends our prepared remarks, and we're now looking for to have you open the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.", "Glenn Schorr", "Just a couple of clarification questions on the Blackrock piece of business. From what I understand, it was put up for RFP which to me means that you had a battle in your mind with, how do you think about the sending pretax margins versus retaining the business? So I didn't know if there is something you could tell us about the average fee rate for this business, I'm assuming it's lower because it\u2019s a $1 trillion book. And if there is anything you make about the common trust fund that would be the piece of business that would get move?", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes, let me just give you additional color on that Glenn, and I'll just wind back a little bit. Blackrock has been a client of State Streets from the very beginning 1988. Their first funds and we've been fortunate to be joined at the hip with them through this successful journey of asset growth, and we think we've contributed somewhat to their success, both ETF and otherwise. You know as they grew got to 5.5 trillion in assets, they came to us and say that they needed to consider some diversification, which while not our first choice we appreciate where they were coming from.", "So, the common trust funds are like mutual funds under a bank structure, there is nothing terribly special about them. We had a relationship that considered that had custody and fund accounting associated with us with it. They told us they were going to move it to another provider, which I say well disappointed we appreciated where they were coming from. It's probably taken the year and half to do that. So they will do that over the course of the next year and half. Importantly, we continue to be Blackrock service provider in their high growth ETF business, and we have a significant global relationship with Blackrock. So, I view it as a kind of a one-off adjustment for Blackrock to get better diversified, we're pleased and thrilled with the Blackrock relationship. I think it will continue to grow, and we will grow with it.", "The other point that I was make which is I think an important point is that, in no way do I think it represents anything close to our trend. In fact, the trend is actually than the other way, which is we actually announced this morning the expansion of the Allianz Global Investors relationship, which spans Europe, Asia-Pacific; and in the past year as we have announced several deals MetLife, Watson Capital, PIMCO Russell. So, the overwhelming trend in the industry is to consolidate with fewer providers. For reasons of cost, it's more expensive for an asset manger to deal with multiple counter parties.", "And probably even more importantly, the need to extract data for investment management compliance and risk management, and the more counter price you have them all complicated that is. So, I would say in some, we're thrilled to be associated with the firm as successful as Blackrock, one of the consequences of that is when they grow so rapidly over a long period of time, they have chosen to make allocation adjustment of their service providers. We support that and we will make sure that the transition goes well. We think Blackrock will continue to grow us and by no means do I view it as a trend more as a one-off situation.", "Glenn Schorr", "I definitely appreciate all that. If we step outside the Blackrock piece, and if we were just talking about the quarter, I think probably the next question I would probably ask it would be some version of assets under custody of six but core servicing fees up too. Is there anything unique in the quarter from market movements to show? Or is there just -- that\u2019s just natural fee compression that the business has been doing from last 20 years?", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes, I would say, let me just explain it little bit and again I'll broaden it out past the quarter. I think, if you look at the quarter the things that were positive would be equity markets and new business. The things that slow the other way would be Mike mentioned, it's the strong U.S. dollar and the downward pressure in international markets particularly emerging markets. So, those are the market effects. The other effects Glenn, which we continue to bring up, but the important is the way money flows within our client and subsequently with us, and you see inflows out of the emerging markets out of hedge funds.", "Now, I believe that both of those they are cyclical trends and that we will see some reversion in both of those. And in the other flow trend which is more secular in my mind is the flow to ETF, and you have seen in the U.S. the stunning outflows to fund, inflows to ETF, we serviced over 60% of the ETF market. So, net-net that\u2019s a positive for us, but it's at a low fee rate. So, when you put all those things together, on the quarter you saw that numbers that you have suggested, but I'd also ask you to widen the lens and look over the past two or three years.", "And if you look at, service fees as a percentage of AUCA has remained pretty consistent at 1.83, 1.84, so I think the -- if you look at the consistency overtime, all of them mix shifts and the effects of the environment, most of which I described, which leads need to the focus on profitability, both at a firm level and at a client level. So, I think that is, that\u2019s how we focus, we can't control the environment, nor can we control the flows. But I think we've been smart about migrating our business to the alternative and also the servicing of the ETF's. So, we think we capture all the buckets, but they will move around in time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Ken Usdin", "I wanted to ask on the cost side to your comments about the living in fee operating leverage in 2017. Just trying to understand, Mike your opening comments about, how this view change in the compensation plan works through that in terms of seemly adding to the underlying growth rate in 2017 because of that change? So, I guess if you kind to try to help us understand just the moving parts underneath that. There is the FX translation. There is the ads from GE. There is the 140, and then there is some level of underlying inflation. Anyway of this understanding kind of what's happening underneath of surface would be really helpful? Thanks.", "Mike Bell", "Okay. So, Ken, good morning. First, in terms of the compensation change, I think importantly Ken, we don\u2019t expect there to be a net impact in 2017 from the compensation change that the Jay and I talked about here this morning. So, the reason for that is that we expect in 2017 to increase our cash mix of incentive comp that would then be payable in February '18, but would be accrued as an expense throughout 2017. And we expect net increase in that cash incentive comp mix, which is really driven by this stiff competition that we're dealing with in terms of competing for up for talent. We would expect that to be approximately offset by the lower amortization expense in 2017 from accelerating the expense of these cash, deferred cash incentive awards into 4Q '16.", "So, the net-net, we would expect that change to be approximately flat in terms of the full year impact on 2017. In terms of your question on other ads and reductions to comp, I think you talked about the main once that I would highlight. First of all obviously, we acquired the GE business, July 1, so next year we got a full year worth of expense there, and you can see from our disclosers the expenses associated with the acquired operations. In addition, we've been adding a significant amount of new business obviously that comes with revenue, but it also there is a cost to service that new business would expect that to be in and in 2017.", "We do expect that the there will be additional investments, not just in project Beacon, but also investments to support the long-term growth of the business. And we're focused on long-term shareholder value, not just the results for 2017. And as you quickly pointed out, we expect the net savings from Beacon to reduce that where significantly we expect a 140 million of net savings from Beacon in 2017. So the bottom line, Ken, without trying to focus precisely on the exact expense growth for the full year, what we're really riveted on is that 100 basis points to 200 basis points of positive fee operating leverage. Because again, we are going to have some wins, we expect that to add derivative growth, we need to service that. But basically what we're really riveted on is creating another year of positive fee operating leverage that is actually higher than what we did in 2016. And that puts us on that trajectory to get to the 31% pretax profit margin for 2018.", "Ken Usdin", "Then just as the second question on capital pretty big movement in the unrealized gains and losses from the movement in rates, and you've mentioned perhaps you need to issue prefers. I just want to ask, where is your comfort zone and where you want to sit on your access to capital ratios whether it's CET 1 Tier 1 leverage SLR? And would any changes in rates potentially way on the amount of capital return you would ask for as a result?", "Mike Bell", "First, I would point out that our capital ratios remain quite strong as we have wrapped up the year. First, looking at CET 1, you can see that we ended well above our 10% long-term target, and for the bank SLR are fully faced in the basis, we remain above the 6% bank SLR. Now, Ken, one of the reasons that we have had cushion in our targets, so one of the reasons that we have had a target of 10% for CET 1 is to deal with the kind of short-term volatility that we saw in Q4. Both the mark-to-market hit from the higher interest rates, but also the hit to the CET 1 ratio from the stronger U.S. dollar, and that\u2019s exactly the reason that we have a cushion is to deal with that kind of short-term volatilities.", "So, the bottom line is we are comfortable with our spot rate capital ratios here, as we wrap the year. I think that the big uncertainty is around the fed stress test. We don\u2019t have the scenarios yet. So, we obviously don\u2019t know, but I would expect that based on prior years that fed stress test will probably end up being our binding constraint. And depending upon exactly what that stress test looks like, press would be part of the overall menu of options that we would look at for 2017. But I think it's way too early to speculate on what we might issue, and also how that would come into play with the capital return to common shareholders that we would also look at as part of that capital plan submission.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.", "Brennan Hawken", "I just want a follow-up on Ken's question on comp. So could you let us know my guess is that for the nearly 250 to 249 deferral charge that the majority just given the way usually those deferral profiles look the majority would have been hitting in '17? And so, could you conform that\u2019s right, and if it's possible maybe quantify for us? And also are you removing all of the continued service requirements for the employee process that you led out? And does that raise any concerns? And then, I don\u2019t hear a lot about competition for talent increasing, so could you may be square that with some of your comments and concerns about retention?", "Mike Bell", "Sure, so good morning Brennan, it's Mike. I'll start and see if Jay wants to add. First on your numerical question, the 249 million would have been amortized over three years. So, we're being amortized over '17, '18 and in '19. But you're absolutely right, because these are awards that we're originally granted '14, '15 and '16. There is a disproportion impact on that 2017 of that 249 million that gets accelerated. So, whether or not get a precise numbers, but round numbers if you think about it as in the ballpark of 50% of that number, you wouldn't be far off. And so basically think of it as, those expense savings for 2017 by not having the amortization expense, we expect to be approximately offset by accruing throughout 2017 for a higher cash mix for the cash awards that will then be paid out in February 2018 based on our performance in 2017.", "So, that\u2019s why I say net-net, I don\u2019t expect there to be much of an impact in 2017 from the change. Obviously, when you get to the outer years, ultimately, there would be expense savings because the awards that will be issuing in February of 2018, and particular we'll have less deferred more cash, so therefore less expense ultimately in the outer years, but probably no impact in 2017. All on your question on the continued service requirements, importantly, Brennan, a couple of things, first this only applies to the deferred cash awards. It is not applied to the deferred equity awards that have been issued previously. And the deferred equity awards, it's obviously different for different people but tend to be higher, quite a bit higher actually than the deferred cash.", "So, no, we're not concerned about that having a significant impact on employee turnover. As a result of that is the equity award that people would be walking away from remain quite significant. And I would also would add that the, this doesn't have any impact to our Executive Vice President populations, so the top call it 70 people are not impacted by any of this, it's that pieces is carved out. And then lastly in terms of your point on talent, we continue to see stiff competition for top talent, which is really why we concluded. We needed to make this change now. What's happened Brennan is, we've become a competitive outlier here as the market has basically shifted to a higher percentage of cash over the last several years. So, our mix became an outlier and basically we concluded that this is the time to make that change.", "Brennan Hawken", "Okay, that\u2019s all really helpful color Mike. Hopefully, the trends in competition for talent and trust banks are going to plead over to investment banks here soon. The other question would be on your interest rate guidance. So, very helpful that you laid that that up for us, thank you. If we do end up giving, getting maybe three hikes instead of the two in your upside scenario, how should we think about that impacting NII? My guess would be it would be a little bit less than addition from the midpoint, using the midpoint as a guide, just given beta and a shift higher to higher betas on your deposit base as we higher in rates. Is that right or should we think about it differently?", "Mike Bell", "I think that\u2019s very fair Brennan. The first rate increase that little over a year ago now accrued very highly to our benefit, this last hike in December as well as the first hike in, actually the first two hikes in 2017. We expect to be pretty significantly accretive to us, but we do expect as rates rise and ideally ultimately get back to more like long-term averages that more of that would be shared in terms of higher liability pricing, but that it would be still be net-net accretive to us. So, your specific question on the third hike in 2017 obviously would largely depend upon the timing of that hike. But I think about it is round numbers that could be another 10 million to 15 million per quarter, depending upon exactly the timing of that third hike versus the other two.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.", "Jim Mitchell", "Maybe we could talk little bit about the tax rate going forward it's just a lot of moving parts sticking with all the tax credits and with the contemplation of tax reform? How do we think that I guess first your GAAP tax rate including the credits on go forward basis? And how do you think about the risk of losing those credits versus where the tax rate goes? That would be helpful.", "Mike Bell", "Good morning, it's Mike. First, there is tremendous mean really substantial uncertainty around where all these tax law changes are going. And I think importantly Jim, it's the details rather than the headlines they were going to be very important. So, just as a couple of examples, it's particularly unclear at this point how potential changes would apply to financial services company. Talk about border tax or lack of deduction for interest expense in those. This kind of things is very unclear what that would be in terms of financial services firms in particular. So, at this point I really wouldn\u2019t speculate on the broader picture. In terms of your specific question around tax invasion investments, again the devil will be in the details.", "It is possible that the tax invasion that since we have had a lot of successful over the last several years, become incrementally less valuable in tax rate environment or in environment where there is less tax credits for the alternative energy in particular. I feel positive that the existing investments that we have do have contractual protections to protect in terms of near term cash flow, but again I think this is uncertain situation and really there will be a lot of devil in that details as proposals when we get flushed out.", "Jim Mitchell", "And how do we think about GAAP tax rate on a go forward basis?", "Mike Bell", "Again, I just think it's completely speculated. It will depend upon the full\u2026", "Jim Mitchell", "Not excluding any tax changes, I mean just\u2026", "Mike Bell", "I would expect that the, again takeaway the onetime benefits that we saw in Q4, but borrowing any tax change I would model it similar to what we saw in 2016. Again importantly exclude the Q4 tax benefits that we singled out in the release and then my prepared remarks.", "Jim Mitchell", "And then may be just one last, other question on the Blackrock follow-up. And is there a way to think about the fee rate of that? And I understand obviously you guys announce this morning about 450 billion, I think is that incremental wins? And I guess when we think about your guidance this year that inclusive of the Blackrock and the new win this morning. Just may be some further clarification would be great?", "Mike Bell", "Sure, Jim, I'll start and see if Jay wants to add or add it. But the, first, we really don\u2019t get into details about specific client arrangements, just, that would be a very bad practice. But it is fair to conclude that Blackrock as well as the recent wins are anticipated in the 4% to 6% in the key operating leverage goals that we laid out for 2017. Importantly, as Jay indicated, we don\u2019t expect Blackrock to have a material effect into a beginning in the second half of 2017. So, as Jay said, this is going to spill into 2018 as well. So, we expect that to take awhile to get picked up in run rate.", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes, Jim. The only think I would add is that, in the same way we talked about the stickiness of this business when somebody exits. It takes a fairly protracted period at time and so the effect on revenue will phase in over, my guess is the year and half or so.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Blostein", "Just picking up on the last question, so just need another clarification, I guess around Blackrock. Will you guys win a sizable mandate obviously it often comes with a lot of expense associated with it? So we can take a guess on our revenue impact, but is there any expense relived that you could get on the back of that $1 trillion leaving?", "Mike Bell", "Sure, I think the good news is that, as I mention, we booked $1 trillion for this year. We've got 440 billion that\u2019s still rolling in. These are resources that were redeploying, so I don\u2019t see much in the way stranded cost here given our expectation for continue growth. Is that way your question was Alex?", "Alex Blostein", "Yes, just again like at the end of the day the people are trying to figure out the impact on earnings that is probably not fair to assume a 100% incremental margin on the loss revenue?", "Mike Bell", "Correct, not at all.", "Alex Blostein", "And then just shifting gears a bit back to the NIR discussion. So, I know you guys talked about the balance should be down about 0% to 5%. Is that again something that you're trying to do practically meaning shrink the size of the balance sheet? Or is that just kind what you generally expect with higher interest rates? And a clarification on $2 billion, I am assuming it's in the NIR guidance for 2017?", "Mike Bell", "Let me answer the real easy one first. Yes, the TLAC is included in the NIR outlook, Alex that we talked about. On your question on the reduction in the balance sheet, it's really a combination of the two factors that you described. First of all, we do expect to further reduce wholesale CD balances in 2017, that\u2019s been part of our plan all along. So, I would -- I think that is on track and I would expect that to take round numbers 5 billion out of the balance sheet by the end of 2017.", "In addition, we do expect up to call a 10 billion of client deposits to come off, some of that we expect to come off naturally as the fed fund rate continues to increase, and they find alternative homes for that investment balance. But some of that is proactively looking to further reduce access deposits particularly in all the locations outside the U.S. and in particular EMEA would be an example where we are looking to further reduce access deposits.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Mike Mayo", "So assuming we're willing to accept your premise that the loss of the $1 trillion does not reflect a trend, it happens from time to time. You mentioned the 1.4 trillion of wins in 2016, you have a backlog. So, let's just accept that for this discussion, but still it raises the question, are you guys just in some ferocious price competition? I mean, did you lose this on price, I mean if this is the world's worst oligopoly? Is this just additional evidence of that?", "Mike Bell", "No, I don\u2019t believe and you'd have to ask Blackrock, I guess. It is nearly a matter of us growing so big together and then having the need to introduce another supplier. Purest stuff was that I mean and I think that go to was the common trust funds, not the ETF. So, I think it was a rational move for them, and as I say not something we chose, but I understand their rational when you get to the 5.5 trillion. So, I would say it's much more reflective of the diversification strategy of Blackrock.", "Mike Mayo", "I mean did you try to keep the business and it's not new that Blackrock is big I mean why now?", "Mike Bell", "I think it's been an ongoing discussion with Blackrock on this point, and they chose this book of business to diversify and that\u2019s their call.", "Mike Mayo", "And on Slide 17, when you give see guidance for 2017 of 4% to 6%, does that reflect the loss Blackrock business or would that be more of a 2018 impact?", "Mike Bell", "I think it will phase in Mike. My guess is through the second half of '17, we will see a little bit and then in '18, we will continue to drift in. But so, yes, it certainly reflects any impact of Blackrock.", "Mike Mayo", "And then last question, you continue to give targets for fee operating leverage, but not for operating leverage for the firm as a whole. Don\u2019t your clients pay you in compensating balances and which rates going up? Would you think about changing that target?", "Mike Bell", "Yes, we came to that target just to isolate the net interest revenue from the things that we control. We certainly get paid in balances which create net interest revenue, and I think this year depending on the scenario you pick, net interest revenue might grow in line with core revenue. And therefore, we would transition over to something that looks like operating leverage generally. And if NIR is going more rapidly, we would expect the wider operating leverage target.", "Joseph Hooley", "And Mike just to add to that I mean we continue to establish as an objective getting to a 31% pretax margin in 2018, obviously that\u2019s all in as well, so that is not changed from what the targets we communicated the year and half ago.", "Mike Mayo", "And Mike Bell, just one last comment, it's your last call I guess. As you look back, what would you say, hey, this is really good accomplishment that you achieved? And what one thing that you didn\u2019t get done that you hope the firm gets done?", "Mike Bell", "That\u2019s an interesting question. I would say that I feel best about the capital management discipline that we've had as an overall firm, but also applying at the business and the client level, Mike is what I feel best about. And I would say that in terms of work that still needs to get done that I'm sure that Eric will have a thoroughly enjoyable time dealing with the regulatory issues. I mean we still a have lot of wood to chop in that in that area. And we'd love to gotten all of that done before I left. I think that would still remain in chop.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.", "Brian Bedell", "Jay, just not to beat the dead horse on Blackrock here, but can you can talk about what you're still doing for Blackrock? Obviously through the iShares franchise whether that\u2019s intact I think that wasn't inherited from the deal in 2007? And if you can comment on any other types of business, and then clearly the mix shift with this, which shift more towards ETF and you've mentioned obviously that's a secular trend. Can you talk a little bit about the profit dynamics of service in ETF versus mutual funds? I understand its lower revenue, but what extent you put the offset in front?", "Mike Bell", "Yes, happy to pick that up. As I mentioned, the Blackrock relationship is longstanding and significant, it's global and encompasses the ETF's, many of their mutual fund products and their institutional products all over the world. So, we cover most things. This common trust fund was a just one sleeve of that, but very comprehensive global. And also tightly integrated from a standpoint of back office some middle office integration with a lad and so, it's an extensive and valued relationship.", "With regard to the mix shift and as you rightly point out from package products in the way of fund into ETF, we do have a lower unit of revenue on an ETF, but profitability is quite similar to what you find in their traditional fund structure. Which is why you see a little bit of a, to my earlier comment, which is why, you see the service fee per AEU, CA having downward pressure, but shouldn't effect margin. And I guess the other point I would make is that, as in most of our businesses, the more scale you have, the more margin you should create. And so with the ETF business growing as rapidly as it is, and with thus invested in pretty significant and I would say differentiated technology, we would expect, we have ability to scale and improve that margin over time, as EPS grow, which we think they will continue too.", "Brian Bedell", "Great, and then may be just on the guidance for the fees and expenses, the positive operating leverage. I see it sounds like you're saying that January market conditions are the basis for the fee outlook for 2017. But can you comment on, your view on hedge fund, redemption, I know you said that impacted the few rates in 4Q, so to what extent are you baking that in for coming in '17 and I know 4% to 6% guidance?", "Mike Bell", "So, Brian, it's Mike. First, there are any number of factors that are going to impact a fee revenue growth in 2017, and so you are picking on the couple of them, but I mean there are whole host of other issues that we could talk about. I mean not the least of which is the mix shift that we saw in 2016 worked against us in terms of emerging markets versus developed markets. That\u2019s another wild card for 2017. But to answer your questions directly, yes, we were assuming that in that 4% to 6% range where market conditions are here in January obviously that means upside, if there is a continued grown up in the equity markets, downside if it doesn\u2019t.", "And in the hedge funds, it's difficult to project that beyond the near term. I mean in the near term we have continued to see pressure, and we thought about that in, as we develop the four to six. But as Jay indicated earlier, we expect that really to be more of a cyclical of phenomenon rather than a secular trend. So, over the long term, we would expect the mix impact that we had in 2016 to longer term ultimately reverse and to see more growth in emerging markets versus developed markets, and also additional growth in the hedge fund servicing business.", "Brian Bedell", "Okay and then just mix of the 4% to 6% between the revenue lines, is that the 4% to 6% also a good assumption for the servicing fees? And then obviously the other ancillary in that range or is your big difference between those two?", "Mike Bell", "I really can't go one by one. But I would point out that SSgA we expect additional growth because you need to annualize the GE Asset Management revenues. So that provides a discreet boost of between 1.5% and 2% to total full year fee revenue for 2017 versus 2016 just giving the additional six months of that. And so I would expect that the SSgA revenues would grow faster than the others. But I mean the trading environment is unclear. On finance, I think we will see continued growth in enhance custody but the market conditions around the agency business are really up unknown area of uncertainty. It will be what it would be but in aggregate we feel comfortable that 4% to 6% is fair enough work.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.", "Marty Mosby", "I wanted to ask a little bit about in NII, and so when you are looking at the 6% increase from fourth quarter of '15 to fourth quarter '16 that only included really one rate hike. The static only has 1% to 3% growth over the next year which would also include an additional rate hike that we just got in last December. So, it seems like we are assuming that the deposit beta is runoff the deposits is accelerating pretty rapidly as you move just to the second rate hike versus what we have seen over the last year. So just I was wondering if you could reconcile those two and then looking at the 6% it looks still on the next rand of raising still a little conservative there?", "Mike Bell", "Well, Marty, again, there are a lot of different factors that are going to coming to play here, a couple of specific data points; you might want to think about for your modeling. First of all, if you're new 4Q '16 is your starting point, I would strongly suggest that you take the 8 million of discreet prepayments out of there; we do not expect that to be the one rate of steady securities prepayments so to the course of 2017. So I think the 547 million in Q4 and back out the eight and you get the 539.", "And so if didn\u2019t look at the 539 compared to our static scenario, there is an up lift of $70 million that basically reflects the Q4, the December rate hike, that we all experienced. So would characterize that $70 million of accretion to be significant benefit and something that we're very pleased with and its driven by not just market conditions but the fact that we feel good, it will focused on the liability pricing actions as well, which makes that as accretive as it is.", "The other factor that I'd urge you to think about here is that, situation in Europe remains unhelpful and in particular the combination of the negative central bank rates, coupled with significant quantitative easing program, means that we continue to see a grind in net interest revenue for the non-U.S. dollar our portfolio. That\u2019s baked into the thinking for 2017 as well obviously it would look be a happier picture, if all we're focused on was U.S.", "Marty Mosby", "And then, Jay, second question was, and always hit this Blackrock thing, couple different ways, but the only thing that I was curious about was given the all new initiative to be able to report on flows that you're seeing. Obviously not by customer but look at aggregate types of statistics. As Blackrock could be a large part of that aggregate, is this the versification in a sense of, foreseeing or real thinking about the new product that you have and then there is not wanting to be too big our reflection in that index?", "Joseph Hooley", "Interesting question, Marty. No, I think that with 28ish trillion, the statistical, the need for data from a statistical reliability standpoint a $1 trillion wouldn't affect that one way the other. It always it in anyway and my discussions with Blackrock in there calculation, and I think everybody feels quite comfortable that we aggregate information that it's all masked and that we have more than enough to create statistical examples and Blackrock wouldn\u2019t effect that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "It's sounded like the sort of diversification initiative the Blackrock is undertaking, that sounded quite on unusual from what you were saying, it was not right as much more common, so someone could focus on just a single provider?", "Mike Bell", "Very unusual, but it is also not a lot of $5.5 trillion around even. So, yes, unusual though. If you think about in my history here, it's quite unusual.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "What give you comfort that if this partnership between Blackrock and JPMorgan turn out to be successful. You don\u2019t end up losing more Blackrock assets down the line. What can you tell us to give us some kind of their\u2026", "Mike Bell", "You could say that about any relationship and I would say we continue invest in the business, we as a specialty provider I would put us up against anybody anytime with regard to our back office middle office, digitization or global footprint, consistent systems. But having said that, we don\u2019t sit back so I referenced earlier Geoffrey the work we have done and the ETF platform. They are first continuing to invest to create the discernable differences and the eyes of the authorized participants and the clients.", "So we view it as our job to get better every day whether it's the way service to client the way we create new products the way we anticipate new demands from our clients and regulations so that\u2019s what we do. That\u2019s what we worry about and think about and so I have all the confidence in the world that we will continue to be a value provider to Blackrock and all of the other clients.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "And are there any particular points in time we should focus on as how long are those all the Blackrock assets going to be tied up with you before they come up again and someone else can compete for them?", "Mike Bell", "No, you should be think about it at the point and time it's just like any other relationship that we have they have terms to them but at end of the day if you are providing value people have little reason not to continue to do business with you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line Gerard Cassidy with RBC.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Mike, you talked about in the processing fees and other revenue line that there is an unfavorable valuation adjustment that affected the number and the number in quarter look like it was negative 65 million versus a positive to 111 million a year earlier. Can you share with us what was the valuation adjustment and how much was that?", "Mike Bell", "Sure, Gerard. First of all, I would urge you to include the tax equivalent adjustment in there. So on operating basis of processing fees and other, on operating basis 121 million in the quarter, but what I was referencing the most significant of the adjustments in the quarter was we had approximately 20 million of unfavorable FX swap cost. So, this is the cost as an example, this would be the cost of converting deposits that we get in Europe over to U.S. dollars to be able to invest and here in the U.S. between the fed funds hike and the continued negative conditions in Europe, not to mention the quantitative easing that the European Central Bank has been doing.", "We have seen FX swap cost get more and more expensive then we saw in particular a lot of volatility in December around in the FX swap markets that further increased the cost of those swaps. And normally, we do get hedge accounting for that so normally that is a negative to net interest revenue, what we saw in the quarter is that we had fewer of those trades they qualified for hedge accounting with some very technical rules around exactly what it take to get hedge accounting. So as a result that ended up in other fee revenue.", "As I said that it was negative 20 million in the quarter. We had a couple of other things as well, we have these investments in various joint ventures, that was a negative outlier in the quarter that, run numbers about negative 9 million and it's firmly a small positive, so that was a headwind. And then we hit some other smaller valuation issues but so its, it was one of those that seemed like a little bit of a perfect storm depressing the other fees for the quarter.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Thank you. And then as a follow-up, obviously, you guys always give us the color on the first quarter equity compensation expense that pops up as well as payroll taxes. I understand that it is a new accounting rules that they are going to put into place this year regarding the tax impact of share based compensation. Should we expect that impact to your numbers in 2017 due to the change in the accounting?", "Mike Bell", "We don\u2019t expect that to be material Gerard. I mean obviously, it depends exactly on market conditions and what would happen to our stock, but we don\u2019t expect that they have a material impact. If it does, I'm sure Eric will talk about it in future quarters.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "I guess I have a quick question on the NIR this quarter may be not so much on the quarters is well but, what did you see for deposit of the quarter, what's the most recent hedge funds move and was there also any impacts from the European debt securities that you had said were causing margin pressure before?", "Mike Bell", "Sure, Brian, it's Mike. First, I rather not give out the specifics on the deposit beta, but suffice to say that the majority of that debt funds hike us accrued to our benefit and that's -- sorry, it was accretive, not a huge amount in the quarter because it was so late in the quarter. But in terms of the benefit, in terms of full year 2017, that benefit is significant income and in terms of your question on Europe the circumstances there have not changed.", "The combination of the negative central bank balances at the negative central bank rates at the ECD coupled with the depressed credit spreads and continue to leave this in this position of this grind, its pushing down that interest revenue, obviously that\u2019s all impacted, that\u2019s all reflected in the expectations, the outlook that we gave you for full year 2017. We're not expecting that situation to get better over the course of 2017. So, it's really unchanged.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "And 'on your fee revenue growth assumptions, the 46% for 2017, think about it, I know you quite a think about it fee rates, direct from the fee rates, I mean if we were to think about it, do you assuming fee rates continue to decline, like you saw declines in asset management, as you say is they flat going forward?", "Mike Bell", "As I said to one of the earlier questions, I mean there any host of things that could impact fee revenue in 2017. I really think about it Brian more as a mix issue as oppose to a fee rate issue in particular. Again, we don\u2019t believe that the cyclical mix change out of emerging markets in hedge funds in 2016 is a long-term secular trend. We think that will bounce back exactly when it does is unclear, but if that get improved then I would expect that to actually be a positive in terms of mix change. And so, it's contemplated as part of the range that we gave you the 4% to 6%. That it's there is a whole set of different scenarios that could place us a different spot in the range.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck", "I had just a question longer term on, how you are thinking about pricing for potential deals and it has to do with the fact that rates are rising? So the value with the soft dollars going up and the mix of revenues that you generated from your business activities, so I am wondering if that factor is into your thinking how you are thinking about CE growth as well?", "Joseph Hooley", "I'll take that, Betsy. This is Jay. You are right and we hope that continues I think between rates and where you are going to see a little more action of foreign exchange side we have a lot of confidence in the growth of our enhanced custody so those revenue streams I think are probably tending in a good way. Some of those are more explosive and the conversation with the client with regard whether somebody is lending securities or doing a certain amount of trading.", "Some were settled and we try that consider all of it and looking at relationships overtime to make sure that they hurl certain profitability metrics for us. So it doesn\u2019t really changed it\u2019s a mix gets more healthy. We would hope as we pointed out in our guidance around margin that we are able to extract more margins in time. And that\u2019s a fact there are fee rates and also the Beacon driven efficiency.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay. And then just separately at your last Investor Day you talked and showed quite a bit around that data analytics keys of the offerings that you are investing in. Just wanted to get a sense of client response take up rate, ability to charge for that\u2019s part of the reason to pick you? Maybe just give us some color there?", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes, now it's I believe you have heard me say this probably too many times that is the future of this place, and clients pay us to settle trades and to calculate net asset values but increasingly the value as expressed in terms of how we can aggregate data pull data together for inside to support any number of these which they have. We have at last count just I think its eight clients have hired us to do kind of a comprehensive aggregation of their data information of product we call data GX. That\u2019s kind of foundation of products or is to be extent that a big client hires us to be the overall integrator of that data.", "On the back of that we think there will be enormous analytics opportunities, not only with us but with others. So, I would say great progress on data GX. And the demand is increasing pretty rapidly as people come to grips whether it\u2019s a compliance service management need or the need to understand different aspects of their information from a standpoint of managing their portfolio for performance. So, I would say off to a good start I think I say after good start, I say competitively, we think we allocates long before our competitors and we're quite optimistic about the trends.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill.", "Jeff Harte", "Just a couple for me. On the 2 billion of incremental qualifying debt to issue for TLAC, I want to make sure getting this right. Should we be expecting an absolute increase in debt or 2 billion in other some currently outstanding issuances as could be replace less more favorable outstanding debt from TLAC?", "Mike Bell", "I do expect this Jeff to be incremental.", "Jeff Harte", "And then I was looking for a silver lining with large transfers as a way of custody assets. I mean does that typically include termination payments or would there possibly some kind of short term revenue benefit from that larger outflow?", "Mike Bell", "No, not really, I mean I appreciate the silver lining was back to but, I think that there is a silver lining for me as that Blackrock is growing in the way is that, we'll grow through this I suspect in a short period of time.", "Jeff Harte", "Okay. And if I just been kind of on a bigger picture on the kind of importance of scale and servicing efficiency, I guess I might be getting at business mix as a servicing covers an awful lot of ground. But can you help differentiate for me State Street from kind of some of the other providers that also have significant scale? And why when we look at a profitability we think State Street is going to be may be come out ahead of some of those competitors?", "Joseph Hooley", "Let me take that one Jeff, this is Jay. And I think that, if you look at the scale efficiencies in this business, they generally anchored around your core settlement and accounting activities, as well as some of the administration tax support. And you know the efficiency comes out of initially your technology architecture and philosophy, one versus many systems and then it grows out of, I would say about the next process layer which is how thoughtful have you been about creating global processes, how advanced are you with regard to creating global standards of excellence and then ultimately which is, what our pursuit is with Beacon is digitizing all that, so you reduce the level of labor by a client technology.", "And if that\u2019s the mental model of how you optimize the efficiency out of a big scale processing business, I would say, we\u2019re well ahead of most of the, if not all of the competitors from the stand point of our discipline of common systems, not a common systems but systems that we own and operate, so that we control. The first phase of our IT and Ops transformation was largely a process and center of excellence move and then this digitization. This last phase is all around optimizing the core and extracting the data for other revenue opportunities.", "And my visibility which is pretty good because this is the business we, and that were well ahead of our competitors, and I think that, if we continue invest at the right pace, I don\u2019t see anybody catching up with us. And the sooner we get to that state of fully digital being able to provide information in data upstream for our clients to me that\u2019s the real prize in this business. So, I don\u2019t think there is a magic formula for what to do, but I would say we are much further ahead in the execution of getting it done.", "Operator", "There are currently no further questions.", "Mike Bell", "Victoria thanks and for those who are still online thanks for your attention.

Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today are our Chairman and CEO, Jay Hooley, who will speak first. Then Mike Bell, our CFO, will take you through our fourth quarter 2015 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.statestreet.com.

This new team is the way ahead transforming State Street to extend our leadership position. Please contact with Liz Bremer at IR at statestreet.com for more information or to register.", "Now, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Hooley", "Thanks, Anthony. Good morning, everyone. Our performance in the fourth quarter reflects the continued challenges presented throughout 2015 including the challenging global equity markets particularly in emerging markets, persistent low interest rates, strengthening U.S. dollar and heightened regulatory expectations. We were successful at managing expenses in the quarter in light of the pressure on revenues. In addition, we grew fee revenue in 2015 and achieved strong new business results as evidenced by new asset servicing commitments of $300 billion this quarter and approximately $800 billion for the full year.", "The challenging conditions notwithstanding, overall I'm disappointed with our full year 2015 performance and how we performed against the various goals we set. We generated 2% operating basis fee revenue growth compared to 2014, which was short of our goal of 4% to 7%. On a constant currency basis our operating base fee revenue was 5.3%. We also fell short of our objective of generating at least 200 basis points of positive fee operating leverage compared to 2014 as we posted a 79 basis point difference in growth. In addition to the challenging revenue environment we experienced regulatory compliance costs and operating losses at a higher level than expected.", "Actual net interest revenue was in line with our outlook, which reflected the continued low interest rate environment and our balance sheet optimization actions. Our efforts to optimize our balance have resulted in lower excess deposits and stronger capital ratios compared to the levels at the end of 2014, position us well for our long-term capital plan. Lastly, returning capital to our shareholders remains a top priority. We increased our quarterly common share dividend to $0.34 per share in the second quarter of 2015, an annualized increase of 14% from 2014 and bought back $1.52 billion in common shares in 2015.", "As you may have already noted the fourth quarter's results also include a number of items and legal settlements, which we have worked hard to address and put behind us so that we can turn our complete focus on growing our business and improving our operations. Mike Bell will discuss how these items impacted our financial statements.", "Now I would like to discuss our asset servicing and asset management businesses. We added $300 billion of new servicing commitments during the quarter across all sectors and geographies. The difficult global market environment in 2015 put significant pressure on our clients, creating a positive environment for cross-selling and clients consolidating their service business with fewer providers. Our asset management business experienced net outflows of $19 billion during the fourth quarter of 2015, driven primarily by new outflows of $19 billion from institutional passive mandates and $10 billion in net outflows from cash mandates primarily from securities lending cash collaterals, partially offset by $11 billion of inflows through ETFs.", "Institutional net outflows were primarily driven by client asset allocation shifts and an expected redemption of one large sub-advisory client that is in-sourcing the business. Redemptions by this client are expected to continue through the remainder of 2016 and assets under management associated with this client was approximately $35 billion at the end of 2015. The low headline net outflows were negative, annualized revenue impact on flows was positive $10 million due to a favorable underlying business mix.", "During the fourth quarter of 2015 we had approximately $11 billion of positive net flows into our ETFs, including approximately $4.5 billion of inflows for SPY our S&P 500 ETF. We continue to invest in our ETFs with a further 13 new launches in the fourth quarter bringing total 2015 launches to 35. Significant fourth quarter launches included three smart beta ETFs and a natural resources ETF, that immediately ranked in the top 10 launches in the U.S. in 2015. In addition, the SPDR DoubleLine Total Return Tactical ETF was the top product launched in the U.S. in 2015 with $1.8 billion inflows. Overall, our SPDR ETF business had five of the top 10 new product launched in the U.S. with combined assets gathered across all new launches of $4.3 billion.", "Going into 2016, we continue to focus on what we can control and to do our best to address those elements we cannot control. As we know, the start of year in global markets has not been good, but regardless of the implications to revenues it is our objective to strive to generate positive fee operating leverage. We started the year with new assets to be serviced that remain to be installed in future periods of $378 billion at December 31st, and we continue to see deep and diverse pipelines, which should help our fee revenues. Our overall strategy is well positioned against global markets, which we believe over the long-term will deliver accelerated growth opportunities.", "Knowing we are off to a difficult start in 2016 we're focused on identifying leverage to improve our performance in 2016 and help us outperform in the current macro-environment. This includes a focus on managing expenses that is in addition to our multiyear transformation program and targeted staff reductions that we discussed on the Q3 '15 earnings call, which is called State Street Beacon. We currently expect State Street Beacon to generate approximately $550 million in the annualized pretax net run rate expense savings by the end of 2020 with approximately $75 million of that run rate savings being achieved in 2016.", "State Street Beacon leverages the foundation built by our business operations and technology transformation program that was completed in 2014. The program will leverage your cloud infrastructure to drive next generation platforms in order to improve scale and flexibility. Digitization of services and solutions will enable automated access across and improve interfaces with our clients. We expect the end result of the program to produce a lower cost client centric integrated operating model delivering timely information to our global exchange platforms. Not only will we continue our firm-wide focus on expenses, but we are also looking for more ways to accelerate revenue growth through cross-selling and product innovation. I am encouraged by some of the developments we've already seen through our digitization work particularly the data solutions we can offer our customers.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Mike, who will review our financial performance for the fourth quarter and then we will be available to take your call -- take your questions. Mike?", "Mike Bell", "Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our operating basis results, I'll comment on two significant items that affected our 4Q '15 GAAP basis results as highlighted on Slide 5. First, we recorded a 4Q '15 charge of approximately $17 million and a liability of approximately $240 million related to the matter in which we invoiced certain expenses to asset servicing clients primarily in the U.S. during an 18 year period. The current period charge reflects an accrual for interest that we intend to pay to the impacted clients. $223 million of the liability or $145 million after tax relates to periods prior to the 2015 fiscal year and appears in the beginning routine earnings balance of our statement of shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2014.", "Please note all prior period financial information within this Slide deck and within our earnings release and addendum have been revised to reflect the impact of the reimbursement on each prior period presented. In addition, we recorded an $82 million pretax gain or $49 million after tax related to the final payoff of a commercial real estate loan acquired as a result of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.", "Now please turn to Slide 9 in the slide presentation for a summary of our operating basis results for 4Q '15 and for full year of 2015. Both 4Q '15 and 2015 full year results reflect the headwinds from challenging global equity market conditions, low interest rates, a stronger U.S. dollar and heightened regulatory expenses. Full year 2015 EPS decreased 3% from 2014 reflecting lower NIR and higher expenses particularly due to the heightened regulatory expectations, partially offset by fee growth and the continued execution of our common stock purchase program.", "Our pretax operating margin of 29.1% and ROE of 10.7% decreased relative to 2014. Compared to full year 2014, full year 2015 fee revenue was negatively impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar largely offset by a similar benefit in total expenses. On a constant currency basis fees grew by 5.3% versus full year 2014.", "Turning to 4Q '15 EPS of $1.21 decreased from $1.36 in the year ago quarter and increased from $1.15 in 3Q '15. Our capital ratios improved sequentially and from year-end 2014 reflecting management actions to reduce risk weighted assets and to also reduce the level of excess deposits on our balance sheet. As we\u2019ve discussed we are particularly pleased with our progress on this priority over the second half of 2015. Additionally, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 per share and purchased approximately $350 million of our common stock.", "Turning to Slide 12, I'll discuss additional details of our operating basis revenue from 4Q '15. Servicing fees decreased primarily due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and lower international equity markets partially offset by net new business. The decrease in international equity markets particularly in emerging markets continues to negatively impact servicing fees. Compared to the year ago quarter, average daily values for the Morgan Stanley Emerging Market Index decreased 16%, while the EFA equity index was down approximately 4%. We estimate that approximately 10% of our servicing fees are tied to emerging markets.", "4Q '15 management fees decreased relative to a year ago primarily due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, net outflows, and lower international equity markets. Foreign exchange revenue decreased due to the lower volatility in volumes. Securities finance revenue increased from 4Q '14 primarily due to new business and enhanced custody and was higher than 3Q '15 primarily reflecting higher spreads. The increase in processing fees and other revenue from 4Q '14 and 3Q '15 reflects higher revenue associated with tax advantaged investments.", "It's also important to note that this line item, which has a number of elements within it, did experience volatility from quarter-to-quarter was higher in 4Q '15 than normal. In addition, the 4Q '15 revenue also benefited from tax advantage investment seasonality, so we expect to find that to be a little bit lower in 1Q '16.", "Moving to Slide 13, you can see that our operating basis net interest revenue continued to be pressured by the prolonged low interest rate environment. The decrease in 4Q '15 average earning assets and corresponding increase in the net interest margin reflects the efforts to reduce client deposits that largely occurred towards the end of the third quarter.", "Now let's turn to Slide 14 to review 4Q '15 operating basis expenses. Importantly, total operating basis expenses decreased 3% compared to both 3Q '15 and the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting lower incentive compensation and other expenses. Other expenses included a $12 million settlement with the SEC related to the previously disclosed allegations of improper conduct in the solicitation of asset servicing business.", "Now turning to Slide 16 to review our capital position. As you can see our capital ratios remained strong, which has enabled us to accomplish a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock purchases. Importantly at December 31st our common equity Tier 1 ratio under both the Basel III fully phased-in advanced and standardized approach increased from September 30th principally due to lower risk-weighted assets. The December 31st fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio at the bank also increased to 5.7% on a fully phased-in basis principally due to the full quarter effect of our proactive efforts to reduce client deposits in September.", "Moving to Slide 17, let me review the financial details of the State Street Beacon program. We expect to achieve annual pretax net run rate expense savings of approximately $550 million by the end of 2020. In 2016, we expect to achieve $75 million in annual pretax net run rate expense savings, which includes the savings associated with the reduction in force that we announced in 3Q '15. In 2017, we expect to achieve an additional pretax net run rate expense savings of at least a $125 million. Included in the targeted $550 million in annual pretax net run rate expense savings are ongoing investments to support the program.", "Importantly, we expect State Street Beacon to improve our operating basis pretax profit margin to at least 31% by 2018 and to 33% by the end of 2020 all else equal. To accomplish our savings targets, we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $300 million to $400 million from 2016 through 2020 and we look forward to providing a further update at our Investor Day on February 24th.", "Now let's move onto Slide 18 and 19 for a review for our 2016 financial outlook. During 2016, we remain focused on our key priorities of returning capital to shareholders, prudently managing expenses and investing in the business to provide solutions to our clients. Although we anticipate that the environment will continue to be challenging in 2016, managing expenses is a high priority. It is our objective to generate positive fee operating leverage relative to 2015. Now please be aware that the year-to-date weakness in the equity markets will adversely affect total revenue. As a reminder a 10% decline in global equity markets is expected to result in approximately 2% of downward pressure on our total revenue.", "While upward pressure on regulatory and compliance cost is expected to continue in 2016, we expect the growth rate of regulatory and compliance expenses to be lower than 2015. We also expect expense growth to be affected by new business as well as continued investments. Also it's important to highlight that as in prior years the first quarter 2016 compensation and employee benefits expense will be seasonally higher due to the effect of the accounting treatment of equity compensation for retirement eligible employees as well as for payroll taxes and associated benefits. We expect the incremental amount attributed to equity compensation for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes in the first quarter of 2016 to be in a range of approximately $130 million to $140 million.", "As you can see, we developed two scenarios for 2016 net interest revenue. The first scenario assumes market interest rates remain static at current levels. Under this scenario, we expect full-year 2016 NIR to be in the range of approximately $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion. The second scenario assumes administered rates in the U.S. increase 25 basis points in both March and June and in the U.K. rates increase 25 basis points in both May and August. Under this scenario, we expect full-year 2016 NIR to be in the range of approximately $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. Additionally, we expect the (2006) (sic) (2016) operating basis tax rate to be in a range of 30% to 32%.", "Turning to the last slide, I would emphasize that returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends remains a high priority. Our 2016 capital plan remains subject to the results of the 2016 CCAR process including a review by the Federal Reserve Board.", "Now before I turn the call over to Jay, I would like to inform all of you that David Gutschenritter, the Company Treasurer has informed me of his intention to retire after 11 years with State Street. Dave has been an incredible positive force in his role as Treasurer. As the industry evolved and the regulatory environment became more complex, Dave brought the talent, processes and leadership needed to assure our continued success. We will miss him tremendously. Dave has agreed to stay on in an advisory capacity through July 30th to ensure orderly transition of his responsibilities. And as part of our succession plan, the Board of Directors has elected Tracy Atkinson to Treasurer affective February 1st.", "In addition to a number of other leadership roles in finance, Tracy has had oversight for Global Treasury for the past five years, so we expect her transition to the Treasurer role to be smooth. Dave has had close relationships with many of you over the last several years and for those of you attending our Investor Day next month, they will have the opportunity to wish him well.", "Now, I'm going to turn the call back over to Jay.", "Jay Hooley", "Thanks, Mike. Crystal, we are all set to open the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.", "Brian Bedell", "Maybe Mike and Jay if you can talk a little bit about the market assumptions that you have underlying the assumption of generating stronger fee growth in 2016 versus the operating expenses? And then maybe if you could just give a little bit more color on what you\u2019re thinking about for operating expenses on an absolute basis in '16 versus '15? Thanks.", "Jay Hooley", "I am sorry Brian, can you just repeat the end of that second part of your question?", "Brian Bedell", "So on the expense side, if you can give us a little bit more color on how you\u2019re thinking about the absolute level of expenses of operating expenses in 2016 versus '15?", "Mike Bell", "Okay. So, that\u2019s helpful Brian. I\u2019ll handle both of those. First, in terms of your question on the market assumptions, candidly Brian, given all the uncertainty in the market environment, I am really reluctant to give you at this point a concrete forecast and that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t include that in the prepared remarks and in the slide presentation. I am sure it's not lost on you that the equity markets thus far in January for example are down high single digits and the emerging markets even worse. And particularly with our mix of business that would be a serious headwind. So instead we\u2019re really focused on achieving overall fee operating leverage in 2016 and we recognize that that would be more challenging if in fact equity markets remain uncooperative for the rest of the year. But we\u2019re focused on as Jay said what we can control. We feel good about the Beacon savings that we\u2019ll get in 2016. We recognize that there is some upward pressure on the regulatory expenses but we think that will be at a lower rate than what it's been in the last -- in 2015. And so we\u2019re really looking at managing really every expense dollar. And that really relates to your second question, which is, in terms of our overall expense growth plan, it will be largely dependant upon fee revenue. We intend to manage expenses at a lower rate than what our fees grow. And again it will be more challenging if the environment is difficult but that\u2019s our plan and that\u2019s why we\u2019re looking at every area of expenses, we\u2019re looking at management layers, we\u2019re looking at procurement, we\u2019re looking at outside consultants, we\u2019re looking at real estate, we\u2019re looking at low return businesses. I mean really we\u2019re looking at the entire spectrum with a goal of getting to that positive fee operating leverage for full year 2016.", "Brian Bedell", "And maybe just talk about the Beacon program a little bit more. Maybe just start with the trajectory at the $75 million and the actual -- the addition of the incremental $125 million in 2017. So from a timing perspective during the year, how should we be thinking of that that layering in the quarters?", "Jay Hooley", "Let me start and I\u2019ll let Mike answer the financial question. But let me just -- I think this will help you understand the pacing. If we go back to five, six years ago, we began with the IT and ops transformation emphasis on transformation. It was really to take our common systems, standardized processes, establish centers of excellence and we also introduced a public cloud and began to rewrite some of those core systems underlying those applications. Beacon takes it to the next step and I can\u2019t emphasize enough that you can\u2019t take the second step unless you have successfully taken the first step. The second step is to -- I\u2019d say wired together all of these different systems which in most financial institutions are not wired together on a real time basis.", "So, in the future state of Beacon I\u2019ll use a simple example. In our fund accounting area, we would expect that an electronic trade invoice coming in from a customer would electronically in real time basis hit the security system, the cash system, the accounting system and update the pricing on a real time basis. So if you let your mind wander in a future state that means our whole environment becomes real time and you could dynamically price funds during the day. That will have the attendant benefits of obviously cost efficiency as you replace human intervention and disparate systems with fully integrated systems. It will also reduce errors and risk but probably most importantly and I keep covering this ground because I am not sure everybody fully appreciates the value of real time information upstream for our customers form office for purposes of risk management, investment management, et cetera.", "So, that\u2019s the journey. Now let me come back to a little bit more narrowly on your question. This next stage of transformation heavily involves technology development and integration. And so there is a little bit of [comp] timing that we were doing in 2015, which will continue in 2016 in building the systems and the integration models, which means that the trajectory of cost saves will start out slowly and build over time. So out of the $550 million you can take the $75 million in '16, the $125 million in '17 that will just continue to build. I will say that the trajectory into a year would probably have a similar path. But Mike, I don\u2019t know if you want to add any color to that?", "Mike Bell", "Sure, Brian, the additional color that I would give you is it's important to note that the $75 million is intended to be a net number in terms of our operating expense impact in full year 2016 compared to operating expenses in full year 2015. So the bottom line is gross savings will be higher than $75 million, but there will be some net spending which in particular is very helpful to position us to get some additional savings in 2017 and 2018, which is even higher than what we'll deliver in 2016. So the spending I would expect to hit to impact Q1, and I agree with Jay, the savings in 2016 will mainly begin in Q2 and ramp throughout the year. So I expect a little bit of a bubble in Q1 and then net savings beginning in Q2 and accelerating through the remainder of the year.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.", "Glenn Schorr", "I just wanted to clarify one thing on that expense comment, the $75 million in 2016, I think is not on top of the $50 million that you've mentioned at the time of the headcount reduction, correct? And that you said your intention is to be a net number '16 versus '15 full year?", "Jay Hooley", "Yes, both of those comments are correct, Glenn.", "Glenn Schorr", "Okay, awesome. Curious I am talking about the investment portfolio, it was what you called ongoing repositioning of the investment portfolio. If you look at your appendix slide, it's now 64% fixed grade, so I am curious on what's driving that change and is it the duration extension on the government side and does that mean that -- what does that mean for your rate sensitivity?", "Mike Bell", "Sure, Glenn. So first of all in terms of the repositioning of the investment portfolio, you are correct that we have skinnied down in particular the floating rate assets that are -- had been denominated in U.S. dollars. And the reason for that is the same thing that we've talked about on earlier calls in 2015 and that is, those are primarily asset backed securities and they are relatively low spread assets compared to for example U.S. treasuries. They also don't get counted as favorably as U.S. treasuries do and they're treated relatively harshly in CCAR because if you recall at the last financial crises, spreads blew out for those assets and therefore the mark-to-market under the CCAR stress test is particularly unfavorable. So the U.S. dollar based floating rate securities in particular are -- I would characterize it is as the least attractive of the portfolio assets that we're on the books say a year ago. So that's been the major driver of wanting to move away from those assets. And in terms of your question on the rate sensitivity, again we look at the interest rates sensitivity through several different lenses and I feel very comfortable there has been no change in our philosophy. We continue to invest through the cycle. Again, we're working to optimize against a number of different regulatory expectations and constraints, but I would characterize it as no material change in our thinking around interest rate sensitivity.", "Glenn Schorr", "Okay. Just one little follow-up on that, when you look at your margin targets, I think they included 100 basis points of hikes through the end of '17, so I am just going to guess and say 50-50 in '16 and '17. Is the math on the impact of the margin, if rates don't change, the same as the math that you gave us on a static and higher rates scenario? I mean, we talk about the same numbers I could just back into that and see that the impact on margin targets if rates don\u2019t change?", "Mike Bell", "Yes, Glenn, I think that's fair. We are going to provide an update at the February Investor Day around the longer term NIM ranges including static, including ideally getting to something like a 3/5 long-term interest rate structure. I think the main pivotal point Glenn though is that I want to make this morning is that we do expect that the Beacon savings will fall to our bottom lines. We expect that the Beacon savings will be additive to profit margins. So when we say all else equal, we know that there will be other things going on in the world that are impacting margins. I think that you've mentioned NIR. NIR obviously can be separately highlighted and analyzed. But the bottom line, most pivotal comments that we're making is, we do expect the Beacon savings to be additive.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Ken Usdin", "Mike, you had good improvement on the Tier 1 leverage ratio which is your limiting ratio as we get into CCAR '16. And obviously with the challenges on the environment translating to challenges for your earnings run rate. I am just wondering, plus the restructuring charges still are coming in and affecting net income. Can you remind us again when you think about CCAR going forward how do you think about your payout ratio? Do you think about it on a net income number or do you think about it on an operating number? And how do these change in the environment if at all change your desire to get through the rest of the buyback to the extent you had recently got an approval and change your thinking at all for going forward?", "Mike Bell", "Sure Ken, I appreciate the question. First, let me just comment on your first piece, because I think it was a very important point and that is, as you can imagine for CCAR, reducing our excess deposits by approximately $36 billion over the second half of 2015 is particularly helpful for us going into CCAR. And obviously we don\u2019t have the CCAR instructions yet, the specifics around the stress test. But any way you slice it, we\u2019re really pleased with the progress that we made and we feel good about the position we\u2019ll be in for the next CCAR, particularly relative to what we would have been in if we hadn\u2019t reduced the deposits.", "On your specific question around the income, both income majors are very relevant. The net income major is relevant and also the operating income is relevant. First the operating income really represents Ken our best estimate of what our run rate earnings are. So, if you think about what the next three or four years are going to be, the operating income is what we think of as the starting point ideally to grow then over the next several years. So I think that\u2019s a very important data point for the upcoming CCAR. Having said that, net income obviously impacts capital, and so left to only that one issue, the restructuring charges or the FX settlement charges that we took in the first and second quarter of 2015 or even this out of pocket issue, all of that decreased capital essentially dollar for dollar, which is why it's very important for us to be managing capital as aggressively as we can.", "Because at the end of the day what we believe to be our binding constraint is actually our overall capital ratios and in particular the next CCAR test will show what does that capital position look like under the stress test. So that\u2019s maybe a longer winded answer than you may have been looking for, but the bottom line is both of those income numbers matter, because the operating income will be more predictive or we expect to be more predictive of what our future income will be. But the net income impacts the capital position that we\u2019re sitting here with today dollar for dollar.", "Ken Usdin", "Thanks Mike. And if I can just then follow up just on the balance sheet, you said $36 billion reduction second half. So can you just -- what was the excess deposits at the end of the year and would you continue to expect additional roll down of those going forward or have you worked it to the point where it's now more manageable? And perhaps you won\u2019t need -- I guess the question is do you have any incremental need left after all this reduction for any preferreds?", "Mike Bell", "So, Ken first to answer your factual question, we estimate that under our historical methodology our excess deposits averaged approximately $26 billion in Q4. Now as we\u2019ve talked about before, that\u2019s the historical definition under the LCR rules, some of what we\u2019ve thought of as operational deposits no longer account so at some point we\u2019re going to flip over to a definition of non-operational deposits that for example would include deposits we have with hedge funds and private equity relationships. And even though those are normal operations with our custody relationships there, for LCR purposes they are accounted as non-operational. But to answer your question factually $26 billion versus our average at Q2 was $62 billion, so a $36 billion reduction there.", "On your question on the -- are we going to push harder and what about the issue around prefs. First of all, Ken the short answer would be that we\u2019re really pleased with what we\u2019ve accomplished. And this has not been a trivial exercise. This is an issue that\u2019s a sensitive one for a number of our clients. And so the fact that we feel good that we got to a win-win with our clients after all these discussions, we think that got us to a real good point. So I would say at this point we don\u2019t feel compelled to drive more off of the balance sheet relative to where they were for example in Q4. But it is something that we\u2019re going to monitor carefully. It is something that\u2019s subject to market conditions. The situation in Europe for example is just not helpful at all. I mean with the ECB cutting to minus 30, talking about possibly cutting further, credit spreads have come in dramatically in Europe because of their quantity of easing. So, for all those reasons, I think we have to continue to monitor this but at this point I feel good about where we are.", "Now your question on prefs is one of those I can\u2019t yet answer fully, because we don\u2019t have the CCAR stress test. I mean obviously we\u2019re in a much better position but until we see the dynamics around that stress test and go through that modeling over the next 60 days. I am just not in a position to give you an estimate at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery with Bernstein.", "Luke Montgomery", "I just wanted to take another quick stab at Brian's question on the 2016 outlook, maybe you've answered it but it wasn't clear to me. When you establish the positive fee operating leverage goal, did you factor in the decline you had in the markets year-to-date or are you assuming year end market levels?", "Mike Bell", "Luke, it's Mike. We certainly factored in what we know about markets as of today, and I think deep down we feel like there's more opportunity for improvement over the course of the year, but I think the most important thing is that we are focused Luke on controlling expenses. The item that we can -- that's within -- best within our control. And we do expect, again barring a catastrophe in terms of further deterioration in markets to be able to get to that net all-in positive fee operating leverage for the full year. Now again it is something that -- because it is subject to market conditions, it's probably something that we want to update you on at the Investor Day in February, at each subsequent quarter our focus and Luke I guarantee the management team is really galvanized around this. Collectively our focus is to generate positive fee operating leverage for the full year.", "Luke Montgomery", "Okay thanks. And then just a follow-up on the balance side. I know it depends on client behavior, but apart from that are you assuming any growth from the current earning assets of $200 billion in your guidance for 2016?", "Mike Bell", "Luke we anticipate a small decline in the average earning assets over the course of the full year but I think the more important point is the point that you've just made, which is, in large part it will be a function of market interest rates and just overall market conditions. But our feeling is that if the Fed funds rate increases by an additional 50 basis points, if Bank of England increases by an additional 50 basis points, that a good chunk of those excess deposits that are remaining will naturally come off the balance sheet and we do expect growth in our core business. So we would expect some growth in the operational deposits from growth in our core business. But I would say net-net I would expect that the average earning assets to be modestly less by year end 2016. Now importantly if there is a crisis again God forbid, all bets are off, I mean we're on a safe haven in terms of crisis so hopefully that's not going to happen, but that would be another wildcard.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Mike Mayo", "Hi, I wanted to understand your guidance a little bit more. So your target had been to grow fee revenues to expenses by 200 basis points, last year it came in at 79 basis point and now your target is simply I guess 1 basis point, right, just 1 positive operating leverage. So on the one hand you were disappointed that you didn't meet the target last year, on the other hand the new target is basically just positive operating leverage. So I just want to reconcile those thoughts of being disappointed but then again lowering the target quite a bit and I think I've heard the reason the lower stock market, lower rates in Europe, currencies and regulatory costs, but rather hear you validate that or you elaborate on it?", "Mike Bell", "Sure, Mike, it's Mike. I'll start and if Jay wants to add. I mean importantly Mike we want to get every dollar of positive fee operating leverage that we can in 2016 and we're committed as we talked about to aggressively managing expenses to work towards achieving that goal. But it's the point that you've made. I mean with equity markets off almost 10% and we're not even through January yet, it just seemed to us to be irresponsible to put a specific number out there even in light of how confident we feel in Beacon. So again as I said to a couple of the earlier questions, I mean sure this is something that we'll talk about through the course of the year, but it's not a question of lowering our expectations. It's being cognizant of the environment and focusing aggressively on what we can control.", "Mike Mayo", "And as far as the actual expense guidance with project Beacon, last year, your core expenses were $7.520 billion and so for this year should we simply subtract $75 million, since that's the net number or that doesn\u2019t reflect the additional expense pressures?", "Mike Bell", "Well, it doesn't reflect for example expenses that I would expect to bring on to service the new business that we're winning out in the markets. So that's why I wouldn't stay away from just a raw expense number and it's going to largely depend upon our fee revenue growth. Since we're in the service business, we tend to need to bring on servicing capabilities to service new revenue. As I mentioned earlier as well the regulatory related expenses will likely increase, we don't think it will increase as much as they did in 2015. But that's why really Mike we're focused on fee operating leverage, positive fee operating leverage as being the overall goal, recognizing that the equity markets in January really make that a challenging objective.", "Mike Mayo", "And then lastly, the way you look at it, what was your pretax margin for 2015 especially since you\u2019re looking to take that quite a bit higher?", "Mike Bell", "29.1%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Beatty with Bank of America.", "Adam Beatty", "I wanted to ask about the NIR guidance and in particular you\u2019ve been asked about some assumptions. You\u2019ve noted in your presentation the impact of foreign exchange on NIR. So I was just wondering, what is kind of your base case for the NIR scenarios was in terms of currency flat from here or something different from that? And then maybe how sensitive that number would be to currency?", "Mike Bell", "So in terms of the NIR ranges that we provided, it essentially assumes today\u2019s foreign exchange currency rates. Now again we recognize that that's a wildcard and as an example if we look at full year 2015 versus full year 2014, we estimate that NIR was negatively impacted by $54 million as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar over the course of 2015. So, obviously I don\u2019t expect that the U.S. dollar will strengthen further, at least at that kind of magnitude that we saw in 2015 but that would give you at least a sense of the magnitude if we had a repeat of that level of strengthening, that\u2019s the ballpark that we can see as a additional headwind in NIR. Obviously if the euro turns around and it got stronger in particular that would be helpful.", "Adam Beatty", "So the portfolio hasn\u2019t been repositioned such that the currency effect will be drastically different?", "Mike Bell", "That\u2019s correct.", "Adam Beatty", "And then turning to the new business wins in asset servicing, you mentioned the positive mix shift in asset management despite the negative flows over the positive revenue impact. So I was just wondering about asset servicing and the new wins, how that mix is shaping up? And also in terms of implementation, how soon you would expect the current backlog to be installed? Thanks.", "Jay Hooley", "Sure Adam let me take that. So I mentioned $300 billion-ish of new commitments on the asset servicing side, a little bit unusual, that was [tilted] to the U.S. with $250 billion of the $300 billion being U.S. and then I think you had $35 billion and $15 billion in EMEA and Asia Pacific. So to me it's a little bit indicative of some of the pressure that the asset management industry is under, now that it's not global but it's probably a little bit more acute in the U.S. And so the opportunity to do more deeper level of outsourcing as well as consolidate more activities with State Street is probably the underlying theme there. You also asked about the backlog, which again is a little bit higher at $380 billion and I think that\u2019s probably historically been in the $200 billion to $300 billion range. It\u2019s elevated because there is some bigger chunkier deals that had a little longer implementation time line. Those should layer in the first couple of quarters of 2016. Additionally, I would say from an outlook pipeline standpoint actually quite good with some different color from the U.S. to the Europe to Asia. Asia continues to be moving in a pretty positive line. Europe is again dominated by the offshore markets which is where the asset is coming from. And I\u2019d say the U.S. it's a combination of hedge and as I mentioned earlier the traditional loan-only managers, who are really grappling with fee pressure and flows and [where] an opportunity for them to streamline their operations and get more efficient.", "Adam Beatty", "That\u2019s great color. Am I right in assuming the asset management outsourcing is relatively high fee versus the current mix or not so much?", "Jay Hooley", "Asset management outsourcing broadly would be very consistent with the existing business from a fee and margin standpoint if I heard your question right.", "Adam Beatty", "Yes, I think you did. Thank you, Jay, appreciate it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.", "Brennan Hawken", "Just a quick follow-up first on the Beacon question and the $75 million. Sorry to come back to it. I just want to make sure I understand. You expected it to be in number but you also talked about growing regulatory expenses albeit at a selling rate. So does that $75 million net reflect what your expectations on the regulatory front or is that regulatory headwind albeit at a declining rate a separate issue and if so can you help us frame the regulatory headwind by letting us know how much -- what the growth rate was full year '15 versus '14?", "Mike Bell", "Sure. Brennan this is Mike. First it's the latter. The regulatory expenses -- regulatory related expenses we look at them as a separate category from Beacon, so I do expect that some piece, although certainly not all of it or anything, but some piece of the Beacon savings would be offset by the additional growth in regulatory related expenses that we expect for 2016. And as we have talked about in the past Brennan I am really reluctant to try to give a very specific number on regulatory related expenses. I just think that at this point it's truly embedded in the enterprise. I mean we're all spending more time and attention on regulatory related issues and I just think that I mean it would take this sort of massive time and motion kind of study to give you a number that would accurately portray it. I mean it's fair to say there is significant upward pressure although as I said it's certainly fair to say that we still expect the bulk of the $75 million of the Beacon savings to drop to the bottom line. Again all the things equal the conversations that we had earlier.", "Adam Beatty", "Sure and I get that it's a tough one to try to frame and then we're in unchartered waters, just figured I'd give it a shot. Second question is on the asset management business. So just curious if you could help us think about the ETF flows. You had a good December which certainly helped out on the quarter, but seems like outflows were a little bit of a struggle on the ETF front for the SPDR's platform in 2015. So obviously you guys are working to try to launch new products as an offset there, but can you give us maybe broadly and strategically whether or not you think that's sufficient? Is it all just Vanguard and Price competition and given how the legacy or the previous SPDR's platform was positioned, you're more subject to that type of competition which is why you're going in the new direction? And how should we think about seasonal outflows which is it the other side of just the seasonal inflows in December, any color you could give us on that front just to help us model for this quarter would be great? Thanks a lot.", "Jay Hooley", "Great Brian, I am happy to pick that one up. Let me give you some numbers and then maybe I'll get to some more of your qualitative questions as to where we're on a journey to make ETF more important business for us. If I look at full year 2015, our net outflows were approximately $23 billion, our net outflows of the SPY which is the S&P 500 was outflows of $31 billion. So if you take the influence of the S&P 500 out of the mix, we would net up [$80 billion] and we would net up $11 billion in the fourth quarter. So there is a -- if you look at trends and you normalize for the S&P 500 which is a very large fund with fairly low fees that move a lot because people use it for liquidity purposes all over the globe. Right in that we have -- we've been on a two year journey to invest in our ETF platform in really two directions. One is that, initially our ETF orientation was more to the institutional market. We've ramped up considerably our intermediary sales force over the last couple of years. And the other place that we focused is on product. And our focus on product which really gets at maybe the heart of one of your questions has been away from the more commoditized type product and more towards the higher revenue yielding products. And so you saw some evidence in my quote, in 2015, we had five of the top U.S. new products in the marketplace and in fact we had 37% of the flows into new U.S. ETFs came to SSGA in 2015. So to me very good evidence that our strategy of not only building up our distribution sales force but reorienting our product towards the higher yielding products. I also referenced the smart beta theme which you tend to read about a lot, lately we think that's a big deal which is to take ETFs and bundle them in an asset allocation model and package them and sell them through largely intermediary market. We introduced three new smart beta ETFs to our model portfolios, there's another name given to that in the fourth quarter. And then the final point I would make, next to final point is that, we continue to be the only of the large players that are willing to open our platform to outside strategies. So the most recent would be the DoubleLine Fund which generated -- which is the largest new fund launch in the U.S. in 2015 at $1.8 billion. So I think we're doing all the things, we're executing on all the things that we set out to execute, and I think we're in a good track to make ETF not only a growth engine within SSGA but a bigger product overall State Street. So we are pleased with the progress.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.", "Jim Mitchell", "One quick follow-up on expenses, just so I fully understand what you're saying. If fee revenue is flat or down, can you have expenses down or is there a presumption of fee income growth despite the equity market decline so far?", "Mike Bell", "Jim, it's Mike. First of all obviously given the uncertainty around the environment it's difficult to answer your question definitively with full confidence. But I stand by what we talked about earlier, which is we do expect to manage expenses at a lower rate above growth in the revenue. At this point, I do expect that as long as markets reasonably cooperated we would still end up with full year net fee revenue growth. But again as we talked about earlier, it's something that we\u2019ll probably need to continue to update you on over the course of the year. But our expectation is to manage expenses aggressively and to manage those to a lower growth rate than the fee revenue.", "Jim Mitchell", "And just maybe on your NIR guidance with two rate hikes, the low end is actually lower than the high end of your additional rate hikes. It seems pretty modest impact from two rate hikes despite the 10-Q disclosure. So is that a change in deposit outflow assumptions or is it just timing in terms of the remaining six months of the year versus the full 12 months and beyond? How should we think about your NIR leverage given your 10-Q disclosures which are much more significant?", "Mike Bell", "Sure Jim. First of all, the 10-Q disclosures importantly, number one, assume no client behavior change. And we do anticipate with a couple of more hikes for excess deposits in particular to come off the balance sheet. Second, importantly the 10-Q disclosures are for a consistent interest rate change globally. And I would tell you that that is in my view highly unlikely to be the case in Europe. The ECB now has cut rates to minus 30, there is talk about cutting that further. As I mentioned earlier the credit spread compression that we\u2019ve seen in Europe because of their quantitative easing program has been significant. So I mean just to give you perhaps a number to help with the modeling, we estimate that on an all in basis this year versus full year 2015 that the euro NIR is expected to decline by approximately $40 million year-over-year and that\u2019s assuming the interest rates in Europe where they sit today, just not factor in fully additional deterioration. So, it is the case that we would expect things to be stronger in the U.S. but that\u2019s a headwind. And again relative to full year 2015, the decline in the excess deposits would also be a headwind to NIR; on the other hand, obviously still very positive versus having the issue of the prefs to pay for those.", "Jim Mitchell", "And then last question from me, about securities lending, you saw short term spreads widen quite a bit in the fourth quarter that seems to be continuing so far. Was most that impact already felt in 4Q or should we see some further benefits to wider spreads if they stay where they are in 1Q on the sec lending side?", "Mike Bell", "Jim it's obviously a little bit early to give you definitive guidance on sec lending for the first half of the year. I would say that we feel very positive about the uptick in sec lending. In Q4 specifically we saw an increase in the average assets on loan, both fully enhanced custody business as well as the Agency business. We saw higher spreads particularly on U.S. equities and believe that the demand for short interest and in particular for specials in Q4 helped significantly. I wouldn\u2019t at this point -- I mean I see nothing to believe that that is going to come down. On the other hand, I wouldn\u2019t try to project additional growth since Q4 was as strong as it was.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Thank you for taking the question. I\u2019ve got a question on the senior secured bank loan book. Do you know where that would be if you look to sit on a mark to market basis rather than an accrual accounts end basis?", "Mike Bell", "Sure Geoff it's Mike. I don\u2019t have the very specific number off the top of my head, because we have been tight in terms of our credit underwriting and also have been investing in the upper end of the credit scale for those leverage loans, it would be closer to par than the overall market. It\u2019s at a slight discount but I want to say round numbers about $0.98 on the $1.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "And what\u2019s the energy component within that portfolio?", "Mike Bell", "It's relatively small. It's approximately $55 million of the $3.3 billion in the overall portfolio.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Jay can you share with us, you mentioned about the new program Beacon as a step two and you needed to take step one of course to get to step two. Is there going to be a step three, is this an involving process? I know this goes up to 2020, which is a ways away, but when you look out longer term is this just an ongoing fact of this business that you've got constantly have these big programs?", "Jay Hooley", "I would say largely, Gerard, I would view this being a two stage event. Stage one complete, stage two just commenced. There will always be opportunities to apply technology to this business both to generate revenue opportunities and expense saves. But in my vision there's Beacon. Since we have gone through the staging of standardization, centers of excellence, rewriting a lot of the applications, I think once we wired them together and for me the Holy Grail is to create an environment within State Street that's all real-time. And if it's all real-time, you have minimal human intervention, you have all the attendant benefits of it and in my mind as we get out to 2020 we should largely be there. Not that there won't be -- I'd say if there was a stage three it would be more revenue oriented. Once we can create a real-time infrastructure, we have the opportunity to build systems and build capabilities to generate global exchange type opportunities is probably where the next big move is. But again it's not cost oriented it's more how you take the data on analytics that are created in this Beacon environment and create information based services to our customers that would be obviously chargeable.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Now is the technology that you're anticipating to get this going, is it all available now or are you anticipating there will be even more advances in technology three years from now that will make deposits even better for the customers?", "Jay Hooley", "That's a great question and I would say we have a plan with a lot of detail around it, but I would fully expect that as we get out in years that technology advances will cause us to make adjustments to the plan. And I'll just give you an example Gerard that hopefully will resonate. When we went into the ITOT as we call it, we were very determined that we wanted to create a cloud environment and we're also very convinced that the only cloud environment that was appropriate would be a private cloud that we would own and operate and control it. I think today it's quite a bit different. We would envision that some of that the test modules that we would build, we might run around a public could. That as long as you encrypt the data you are as safe running it out in the public cloud as you're in a private cloud. And I'd say, if you talk to people that are deeply involved in this world, you would find that to be a fairly meaningful shift in philosophy. So within our Beacon plans some of that is bled-in, but I think for us to imagine what the technology enablements will be five years out is pretty tough to do. I think though it's back to a point that I made and you reinforced which is, unfortunately you can't leap frog. So you have to modify along the way and we think we've got a plan that not only enables us to get to that future real state, but it will also allow us to take advantage of advances in technology as they unfold over the next five years.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Great and then as a second question, coming to you again Jay, you've mentioned that the assets under management this year, a large client was going to take out $35 billion I think you said. Couple of questions, one, why is the client leaving? And two, $35 billion is that a real big customer, medium-sized customer, small customer, how would you characterize that type of client?", "Jay Hooley", "Sure, so I would say it's a customer where we have a long-term multidimensional relationship, this is just one component of it. I would characterize it as a smallest kind of customer and I say that because it's all passive assets. So it' a little bit my SPDR S&P 500 example where the headline number is big but the revenues associated with it are not all that, not significant. The other point I would make Gerard is that, well not a trend, it's not exceptional that somebody would say, I want to run my passive assets myself and this particular customer was a bank decided that as opposed to outsourcing that to us they would in-source it to themselves.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "Hi, just a quick question. On the expense billing program, are the costs associated with that billing error I guess it is? You said you had a $223 million pretax liability associated with that. I was just curious as to why that didn't hit the P&L and is that excluded from your operating guidance when it is expected at P&L, I guess sometime this year?", "Mike Bell", "Brian, it's Mike. First this does relate to overbilling that we have had historically, in fact it goes back to the late 1990s. So as a result rather than charging the Q4 2015 P&L with that amount we have revised the other financial statements that we provided this quarter to basically make an adjustment to the most recent P&L periods and also to the retained earnings account for year-end '14. So this is reflected in that retained earnings statement, so it's already negatively impacted our capital, that piece for the liabilities that I talked about in the prepared remarks, that is behind us at this point. Now, obviously, as you can imagine, other things can develop, but at this point, that\u2019s already reflected in the balance sheet and in prior earnings periods.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "And then just on the operating leverage guidance, so if we\u2019re assuming taking your 10% decline in equity markets, there is 2% decline in revenues, just kind of putting that through the year-to-date numbers, I mean a 7% decline in the equity market thus far equates about 1.4% of decline in the revenues. So given that the $75 million reduction in expenses that you\u2019re expecting to hit is just about 1% of your operating expenses, where also that $75 million of expenses come from to get you to positive operating leverage assuming no further change in equity markets to year end?", "Mike Bell", "Importantly Brian we\u2019re looking number one, at expenses across the board. So I do expect that we\u2019ll find additional expense opportunities beyond what is part of project Beacon. Second, you\u2019re assuming that there is no other fee revenue growth over the course of 2016 in your comments. And I would anticipate that between net new business and potential growth in for example global markets revenue that we would still be able to get there. But again it's something that\u2019s an evolving situation since the market environment is as challenging as it is.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.", "Marty Mosby", "I wanted to focus on the net interest income, which if you look at the last year, you were down 13%, if you adjust for currencies down 11%. That\u2019s really the major source of underperformance relative to the other trust banks that were both up around 8%. So, their ability to add duration on their side, or benefit from rather upticks you get in that fund rate is kind of swamping what you\u2019re having to deal with. Catalysts that you see balancing restructuring or maybe more focus in Europe, how do those catalysts begin to wane and when do you get back on track to be in line with the other peers?", "Mike Bell", "So Marty it's Mike. First, I am really reluctant to try to give you specific comparisons to our various benchmark competitors. Our business mix is very different. As you correctly pointed out we\u2019ve tended to have more impact from changes in Europe than our competitors over the long-term. I think that served us well. But in the near-term that\u2019s a pressure point. We have different portfolios. We have different mixes of business that those portfolios back. So again I would hesitate to try to give you a very specific comparison because I don\u2019t know specifically how they\u2019re managing their balance sheet. What I can tell you is how we\u2019re managing our balance sheet and in terms of the catalyst, as we talked about, we do expect that the recent increase in the Fed funds rate to be particularly helpful. That for example, even though it's just for the U.S. dollars, it does mean that the floating rate assets that we have that are dollar denominated have been resetting over the course of the last three months and that\u2019s been helpful in terms of the near-term NIR outlook. If we do get additional Fed fund increases, again we expect that to do a couple of things for us. Number one, we do expect that to be accretive to NIR, because while we will share in all likelihood some of that with clients, we do typically share a percentage for example of the Overnight Index and would retain a portion of that for ourselves. And then just longer term it's helpful to have these increases in interest rates, because Marty, one of the big things that weighed on us in 2015 is the grind in the fixed rate portion of the portfolio. About two-thirds of the portfolio is fixed rate and that\u2019s been rolling over, the yield on the maturing assets has been quite a bit higher in ballpark like 75 basis points higher than the fixed rate yield of new purchases. So if interest rates particularly in that call it three year, five year, 10 year kind of zone, would increase consistently where the Fed fund rate may increase that would be helpful in terms of reducing that grind. And then maybe lastly, you mentioned it and I am just repeating it. If conditions got better in Europe either in terms of getting the ECB rate back closer to positive territory and ideally some credit spread widening that would be very helpful as well.", "Marty Mosby", "And just another question, if you look at the emphasis you had on trying to push some of the marginal deposits out of the balance sheet, have you seen any implication to customer relationships because of that? Fee income seems to be doing relatively well, market share holding in there. But just was interested that efforts you're doing to try to overcome your emphasis on that side.", "Jay Hooley", "Yes, Marty, let me take that, this is Jay. I would say broadly no. I think that -- what I think we did well is we got way out in front of this. So that was really the beginning of 2015 where we began to have a series of conversations with our customers and there was a shorter percentage of customers who are holding the lion's share of the excess deposits which made it helpful. But we worked with customers over the course of six months to make sure, one, they understood the issue and our pressure point, and two, begin the layer in a set of fees to hold excess deposits on our balance sheet. And so we gave customers enough lead time in order to manage the situation or pay the freight to hold excess deposits on our balance sheet. So I think the nature of the way we went about it and also I think the other thing that's probably safe to say is that, we are probably out front on this. I think everybody else is catching up. So I think this conversation about excess deposits is not unique to State Street anymore, but I think we executed the plan pretty well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.", "Brian Bedell", "Just a clarification Mike on the timing of the run rate for expenses the $75 million and the $125 million for 2016 and 2017 respectively, is that a 4Q '16 and 4Q '17 annualized run rate or rather a full year which should imply higher 4Q run rate?", "Mike Bell", "Brian, this is a full year comparison, so the $75 million is full year '16 versus full year '15 and importantly is a net number to operating expenses. So for example we're going to have some IT spending and just overall programs spending in Q1 and that will continue throughout the year. The $75 million is the gross savings minus the investment spending that I just mentioned. Importantly, it doesn't include any potential restructuring charges. I would suspect that a portion of that $300 million to $400 million of overall expected restructuring charges over the period 2016 to 2020 some of that may impact 2016, that would not be included in the $75 million.", "Brian Bedell", "Right, okay, so then just to imply that as you work through the quarters and we get to the fourth quarter the run rates will be higher than the full year run rate moving into next years?", "Mike Bell", "Yes, that's likely fair. I think the only reason I hesitate a little bit is that the investment spending, particularly the IT spending is somewhat of a fluid situation. So again we will be focused on the net. But I think your modeling assumption is a fair one.", "Brian Bedell", "Okay great. Just lastly one the FX trading, I know the direct sales component of the FX declined much more than the indirect. I guess Jay, is there anything FX product with that other aside from the lower market volatility and would you expect that given what we know about FX volatility in client volumes, do you expect that to rebound in 1Q on that part of it?", "Jay Hooley", "I would say, Brian, it's feels to me more episodic than anything that is a trend line and I think that our volumes were pretty much in line with what we saw in the industry, volatility hung in as now I would view it more of an episodic.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions in queue.", "Jay Hooley", "Thank you for your time and attention this morning and look forward to hopefully seeing all of you in New York on February 24th. Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

The only authorized broadcast of this call will be housed on the State Street website. [Operator Instructions] Now, I would like to introduce Valerie Haertel, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at State Street.", "Valerie C. Haertel", "Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Our first quarter earnings materials include a presentation that Jay Hooley, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ed Resch, our Chief Financial Officer, will refer to in their remarks. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP or operating basis measures to GAAP measures referenced on this webcast, as well as other materials can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Before Jay and Ed begin their discussion of our results, I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in State Street's 2012 annual report on Form 10-K and its subsequent filings with the SEC.", "We encourage you to review those filings, including the section on risk factors, concerning any forward-looking statements we make today. Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of today, April 19, 2013. The corporation does not undertake to revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after today.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman, President and CEO, Jay Hooley.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Thanks, Valerie. Good morning, everyone. Before I get started, I just want to acknowledge the horrific tragedy that's beset our great city this week, and just say that our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone that's been impacted through this event.", "As Valerie noted, our remarks will follow the financial highlights slide presentation that we issued with our earnings press release this morning. And I'll focus my comments on our operating basis results and primarily on the sequential quarter comparisons since those seem to be of most interest you.", "I'm pleased with our first quarter financial results. State Street benefited from stronger-than-expected equity market performance and increase in foreign exchange market volumes and continued strong expense controls across the organization. We continue to bring on new business and our pipelines remain strong.", "If I take you to Page 3, on an operating basis, first quarter 2013 earnings per share was $0.96, which is a decrease of 14% from the fourth quarter of 2012 and an increase of 14% from the first quarter of 2012. It's important to note that the first quarter of 2013 included the effect of $118 million pretax or approximately $0.19 per share after tax of equity incentive compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes.", "Our revenue was slightly higher than the fourth quarter and was 2% greater than the first quarter of 2012, driven mainly by improved equity markets, higher trading services and new business, including the Goldman Sachs acquisition, offset by lower net interest revenue.", "Our core fee revenue comprised of asset servicing and asset management fees increased about 2% to $1.4 billion from the fourth quarter of 2012 and more than 9% from the first quarter of 2012. Importantly, we produced positive operating leverage of 130 basis points compared to the same quarter last year due to our strong expense management. And if you exclude the effect of the first quarter 2013 equity incentive compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes, we achieved positive operating leverage of 145 basis points for the quarter when compared to the fourth quarter of 2012.", "Before I review some additional financial highlights, I'd like to share some thoughts about the strong equity market performance in the first quarter and provide you some color on client investor behaving -- investing behavior.", "As I previously discussed on both the fourth quarter earnings call and on our Analyst Day in February, we saw signs of client rerisking at the end of the fourth quarter of 2012, and it continued as we began the year. As the first quarter progressed, client risk-taking behavior moderated somewhat, but it's still running ahead of prior years.", "While the environment overall feels better, we remain cautious to the ongoing fragile state of global markets. As you're aware, the low interest rate environment weighs at our net interest revenue, and together with high levels of client deposits, our net interest margin. At this point, the Federal Reserve continues to signal its attention to maintain low interest rates for the foreseeable future.", "If I turn to new business, the first quarter 2013 new asset servicing wins totaled $223 billion, which is comparable to the $233 billion in new wins that we reported in the first quarter of 2012. Of the $223 billion in new asset servicing wins this quarter, about 2/3 were from within the U.S. and 1/3 from outside the U.S. Also included in our new business wins are 39 new alternative asset servicing mandates, a client segment that continues to present good opportunities.", "With respect to the remaining installation of 2012 new assets to be serviced of $551 billion, approximately $70 billion remains to be installed in 2013. Additionally, approximately $43 billion of the asset servicing mandates won during the first quarter have not yet been installed.", "Among those clients installed this quarter are the U.S. dimensional funds managed by Dimensional Fund Advisors, an investment manager with over $260 billion of assets under management through it and its affiliates. We're providing a full range of services for this client including accounting for U.S. strategies, custody and securities lending solutions. This is a great competitive win for our U.S. global services team.", "Additionally, State Street Global Advisors total assets under management increased 4% to $2.18 trillion in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, driven by strength in the global equity markets and net new assets to be managed. Within our ETF business, strong markets fueled a 5% increase in our ETF assets under management to a record $354 billion at March 31, 2013, compared to the fourth quarter of 2012.", "Net client inflows were $5 billion in the first quarter driven mainly by securities finance cash collateral pools. We experienced net ETF outflows of $6 billion from both our gold ETF amidst declining gold prices and from our S&P 500 ETF, which historically has outflows in the first quarter as institutions reposition their risk profile in the market.", "These net ETF outflows were partially offset by a strong start to the year in Europe, where we've been focused on expanding our ETF product offerings and inflows into SSgA's sector -- select sector ETFs in the U.S.", "Looking ahead, our business pipelines in both asset servicing and asset management remain strong and well diversified. Higher revenues in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 were driven by strength in trading services offset by lower net interest revenue. And by the way, I've moved to Slide 4 now.", "In trading services, foreign exchange trading revenue for the first quarter increased 24% to $146 million from the fourth quarter of 2012 due to higher volumes and increased volatilities. Securities finance revenue increased about 5% in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of 2012 due to slightly higher volumes.", "Our operating basis net interest margin was 131 basis points in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 136 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2012, partly due to the higher level of client deposits, which Ed will explain in a minute.", "If I turn to expenses, we continue to control our expenses effectively across the organization. Operating basis expenses increased about 6% in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of 2012. Excluding the effect of the equity incentive compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes in the first quarter, expenses actually declined over 1% from the fourth quarter. And compared to the first quarter a year ago, expenses increased 1%.", "Our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program remains on track to deliver the highest level of pretax expense savings for the program of $220 million in 2013, and we continue to expect our transformation program to deliver approximately $575 million to $675 million (sic) [$625 million] in run rate savings for the entire program by 2015.", "Turning to capital on page -- on Slide 5. Our financial strength and disciplined approach to capital management have enabled us to maintain consistently strong capital ratios under Basel I and the proposed Basel III standards based on our understanding of the proposed rules.", "As we reported in mid-March, the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2013 CCAR plan, which included our planned capital distribution program. Following the CCAR results, our Board of Directors approved a $2.1 billion common stock purchase program through March 2014. We completed our previously announced $1.8 billion common stock purchase program in February 2013. Additionally, in February, the board approved a $0.02 per share increase in our common stock dividend, which is now $0.26 per common share payable to shareholders this month.", "So in summary, we're focused on creating value for our clients and shareholders, growing revenue, diligently controlling expenses and distributing capital to our shareholders, which remains a top priority.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Ed, who will provide additional details on our financial performance.", "Edward J. Resch", "Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my comments on Slide 7 of the earnings presentation, which shows a summary of operating basis results for the first quarter and unless noted separately, I'll be referencing only operating basis results.", "Revenue was up slightly in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 and up 2% from the first quarter of 2012. The first quarter demonstrated our commitment to controlling expenses. Expenses increased 5.7% from the fourth quarter of 2012. However, excluding $118 million of equity incentive compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes, expenses were actually down 1.2%, and we achieved 145 basis points of positive operating leverage in the sequential quarter comparison.", "Compared to the first quarter of 2012, we achieved 130 basis points of positive operating leverage. Earnings per share of $0.96 decreased 13.5% from $1.11 in the fourth quarter of 2012 and increased 14.3% from $0.84 in the first quarter of 2012.", "As you may recall, there were several items totaling approximately $36 million on a pretax basis or $0.06 per share that favorably affected our results in the fourth quarter of 2012. The first quarter of 2013 included a negative impact of $118 million on a pretax basis or approximately $0.19 per share of equity incentive compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes.", "Return on equity of 8.9% decreased from 10.3% in the fourth quarter of 2012 and increased from 8.6% in the first quarter of 2012. We purchased approximately $360 million of our common stock during the first quarter at an average price of $54.95 per share, resulting in approximately 463 million average fully diluted common shares outstanding during the first quarter, a reduction of 4.7 million average shares in the sequential quarter comparison.", "Now let's turn to Slide 8 to discuss first quarter operating basis revenue drivers. Servicing fees increased 2.2% to $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2013 from the fourth quarter of 2012 due to stronger global equity markets and higher transaction volumes. Compared to the first quarter of 2012, servicing fees increased 9% due to stronger global equity markets, net new business and the acquired Goldman Sachs Administration Services business.", "Management fees at SSgA increased to $263 million in the first quarter of 2013 from $260 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 due to stronger global equity markets and net new business, partially offset by lower performance fees. Compared to the first quarter of 2012, management fees increased 11.4% primarily due to stronger equity markets and net new business.", "Performance fees in the first quarter were approximately $4 million, down from $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 and up from about $3 million in the year-ago quarter. Money market fee waivers were approximately $6 million in the first quarter, up from $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.", "Total trading services revenue increased 15.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, driven primarily by strength in foreign exchange revenue and electronic trading. Foreign exchange revenue increased 23.7% from the fourth quarter due to both higher volumes and volatilities. Compared to the first quarter of 2012, foreign exchange revenue decreased by 2% driven by lower volatilities, partially offset by higher volumes.", "First quarter 2013 electronic foreign exchange revenue increased 28% and 16% from the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2012, respectively, driven by an increase in volumes of 33% and 35%, respectively. Securities finance revenue was $78 million in the first quarter of 2013, an increase of 5.4% from the fourth quarter of 2012 due to slightly higher volumes. Securities finance revenue decreased 19.6% from the first quarter of 2012 due to lower spreads and volumes.", "Securities on loan averaged $313 billion for the first quarter of 2013, a slight increase from $305 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012 and down 5.4% from $331 billion in the first quarter of last year due to lower overall demand. Processing fees and other revenue in the first quarter of 2013 decreased 18.3% from the fourth quarter of 2012, primarily due to a gain of $10 million from the sale of a Lehman Brothers-related asset recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012.", "Processing fees and other revenue in the first quarter of 2013 decreased 16.1% from the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to a $24 million positive fair value adjustment recorded in the first quarter 2012 related to our withdrawal from the fixed income trading initiative.", "First quarter 2013 net interest revenue of $577 million on a fully taxable equivalent basis decreased 3.8% from $600 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 due to lower yields on earning assets. Fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue in the first quarter of 2013 decreased 4.9% from $607 million in the first quarter of 2012 due to lower yields on earning assets partially offset by lower liability costs.", "As we have noted, higher-yielding fixed-rate securities in our investment portfolio are maturing or paying down and being reinvested at lower rates while floating-rate assets are resetting at market rates. Our net interest margin declined to 131 basis points in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 136 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 152 basis points in the first quarter of 2012. The decline in our net interest margin is the result of both the decrease in net interest revenue and an increase in average earning assets. The increase in average earning assets is driven by the higher-than-expected levels of client deposits we saw in the first quarter. If the current levels of client deposits continue for the full year 2013, our average earning assets will likely grow between 3% and 7% compared to the 2012 full year average, and our operating basis net interest margin will likely be around the low end of the 130 to 140 basis point range, assuming interest rate spreads and prepayments fees remain at their current levels through 2013. This compares to our previous guidance of interest earnings assets growing to a range between 1% and 4%, and our operating basis net interest margin to be in the range of 130 to 140 basis points.", "Turning to operating basis expenses on Slide 9. In the first quarter, we continue to control expenses. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, we reported negative operating leverage of 544 basis points. However, excluding the effect of expenses related to equity incentive compensation for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes, we achieved positive operating leverage of 145 basis points. Compared to the first quarter of 2012, we achieved positive operating leverage of 130 basis points.", "As you can see on the slide, compensation and employee benefits increased 13.1% in the first quarter of 2013 from the fourth quarter of 2012 due to the effect of the $118 million of equity incentive compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes. The first quarter of 2013 included the impact of the targeted reduction in force we announced on the fourth quarter earnings conference call. To date, we realized approximately 10% of the expected $90 million in annual savings, which is on target with our plan. Compared to the first quarter of 2012, compensation and employee benefits expense decreased 2.7%, partially due to the savings associated with the execution of the Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program.", "First quarter 2013 information systems and communication expenses increased 1.3% and 24.1% from the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2012, respectively. The increase in both periods was due to costs related to transition activities in connection with the Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program, as well as costs to support new business. These expenses are expected to increase slightly over the next few quarters and then level off.", "The Business Operations and IT Transformation Program continues to be on track. For 2013, we expect to achieve approximately $220 million in incremental pretax expense savings, resulting in approximately $418 million of cumulative savings. Consistent with our initial forecast for the entire program, we expect to achieve run rate, pretax expense savings in the range of $575 million to $625 million by 2015 compared to year-end 2010, all else equal. Our nonrecurring expenses related to the Business Operations and IT Transformation Program were approximately $25 million for the quarter. We expect these nonrecurring expenses to trend lower this year and in 2014 as we near the completion of the program.", "Lastly, other expenses decreased 7.9% from the fourth quarter of 2012, driven by lower professional fees. Recall also that the fourth quarter of 2012, other expenses included a $14 million onetime Lehman-related client recovery recorded in that quarter.", "Now let me give you some details on our investment portfolio including some highlights from the first quarter. As I outlined in the top half of the slide, Slide 10, the key elements of our strategy remain unchanged. Our investment portfolio decreased slightly to $116 billion as of March 31, 2013, down from $120 billion as of December 31, 2012. We have a solid credit profile with approximately 88% of our portfolio securities rated AAA or AA. The duration of the investment portfolio was 1.7 years as of March 31, 2013, unchanged from December 31, 2012. We will continue to manage the portfolio with a target duration of around 1.5 years but there will be periods of time where we're slightly above or below that target depending on our investment priorities.", "As of March 31, 2013, 54% of our investment portfolio was invested in floating-rate securities and 46% in fixed-rate securities. The aggregate net unrealized after-tax gain in our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios as of March 31, 2013 was $817 million compared to a net unrealized after-tax gain of $698 million as of December 31, 2012. The improvement in the quarter was due primarily to narrower spreads.", "During the first quarter, we invested about $4.5 billion in primarily AAA-rated securities at an average price of $101.22 and with an average yield of 1.05% and a duration of 1.82 years. Of the $4.5 billion, we invested approximately $3 billion in both U.S. and non-U.S. asset-backed securities and the remaining investments were spread among various asset classes.", "The duration gap of the entire balance sheet as of March 31, 2013, was 0.41 years, up from 0.36 years as of December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily in response to a steepening of the treasury yield curve from 2 years to 10 years.", "Turning to capital. Slide 11 has a summary of our strong capital position. As of March 31, 2013, our Tier 1 common ratio was 16.1%. Our estimated pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III NPRs, as we currently understand them, was 10.6%. Also, as of March 31, 2013, the estimated pro forma Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III NPRs, including estimated effects of scheduled runoff and anticipated reinvestment of the securities affected by the SSFA through January 1, 2015, was 11.4%.", "Note that the Federal Reserve's rules implementing the Basel III capital requirements, including underlying capital models, are not yet final and are therefore subject to change, and that the finalization of these rules may result in changes to our projected Basel III ratios. Our capital distribution plan reflects our strong capital position.", "As a percentage of 2013 consensus earnings, State Street's capital plan is the highest of the 18 bank holding companies that participated in the 2013 CCAR process.", "So to summarize, solid first quarter results were supported by increased total fee revenue over the fourth quarter and a continued commitment to prudently manage expenses. We continue to expect the effective tax rate on an operating basis for the full year 2013 to be generally consistent with the last 2 years in the range of 23% to 25%.", "Finally and importantly, we will continue to optimize our strong capital position and expect to return capital in the form of common stock purchases and dividends.", "Now I'll turn the call back to Jay.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Thanks, Ed. Let me briefly close our call with 3 points. First, in the first quarter, we delivered good results amid rising equity markets in a persistently low interest rate environment; we continued to aggressively manage our expenses while maintaining a high quality of service to our clients; and we remain confident in the secular trends that underpin the prospects for growth in our business, and I believe that we're focused on the right value drivers.", "With that, Lisa, we'll open the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Thanks for hosting the call, I know it's a challenging week up in Boston, Jay. My first question is a question of balance sheet size, Ed. Just given all the puts and takes to begin the year that you and Jay walk through, I was hoping you could comment from where you are now, what would you characterize is seasonal and frictional rather than the impact of new core business installation?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, that's a little hard to say. I think it's a combination of clearly some new business, but it's also, I think, a combination of the world being fairly awash in liquidity. I think we're seeing some of the customer deposit flows because of that, because of both factors really. I mean, we saw average deposits up about $6 million over Q4 and TAG had the effect of bringing deposits down about $7 billion, which was in line with what we expected. So we're seeing, I'd say, more liquidity, a greater increase in Europe. The non-U.S. deposits are, we think, awaiting reinvestment. And I would say that that's probably in the temporary category, to your question. But in the U.S. we're seeing deposits up around $1 billion, but that's net of the TAG outflows, so we've seen about $8 billion of USD inflows. We're also seeing another trend, a little bit of a trend, I guess, where the U.S. deposits, half of them are coming into interest-bearing accounts which we think, again, is a reflection of excess liquidity being available in the marketplace, hopefully awaiting reinvestment, but looking for some investment that is obviously safe and relatively market yielding.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Great. And then shifting over to securities lending. I realize the business isn't is as large as it used to be. But we saw a seasonal lift but maybe not as much as we see in the past. Could you just talk through your current outlook for that business and maybe latest thoughts on some of the rule proposals we're hearing out of Europe?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "The seasonal lift, Howard, you mean the dividend season? Is that what you...", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "No, I just meant 4Q to 1Q. I know that we usually see a bump up, Jay, just with the new year.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes. Yes, I think there is some bump up although, as you know, the dividend season, which is the real cyclical high quarter is about to come on us in the second quarter. But I would say generally, securities lending, balances have stabilized in the low-300. I think if you look at quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year, the effect of the downward pressure on revenue has been largely the Fed fund to 3-month LIBOR rate. So I would suggest that the business is kind of in a stable state, I think, waiting for a pickup in merger and acquisition activity which will have a positive effect on that and further leverage in the general financial services system would be catalyst for growth, in addition to any widening of spreads.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then the second part of the question, Jay. Just thoughts on the rule proposals coming out of Europe, any latest views.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "I think it's too early to tell. I think that there's a number of things that are circling around securities finance. But our outlook is really unchanged as far as the business continuing to be a good business for us over time. As the rules firm up, that may change, but no view as of today.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.", "Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "First question I have is I'm just curious, if I look at the assets under custody and administration and clearly you've had some tailwind of favorable markets in new business. But I mean, the pension assets, the pension products there have been relatively flat for several quarters. And I'm just curious, I mean, could you address maybe what kind of mix you're seeing? New business wins coming mainly in kind of fund products and maybe it's the pension clients, where you're seeing some runoff of the clients or business?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, it is a real mix. This quarter, which was -- I think, last year, we had total assets, new asset service of $1.2 billion, this quarter was $230 billion, so kind of an in-line quarter from a longer-term trend standpoint. 2/3 U.S., 1/3 non-U.S., that's a little bit different than what we've seen in the past. But I guess, more to your sector question, pension's kind of stable. We've had some good new business wins there, no losses that I'm aware of, so kind of a net positive. But as you know, in the pension segment, it's a pretty stable segment. Most of these are DB-oriented funds that aren't getting new flows. So on the other side broadly, the funds business, U.S. and non-U.S., obviously benefits from flows and all those things that happen when clients rerisk. And that pipeline and the successes have been very good and as you know in many markets, including the U.S. where a little bit of significant market share leader, and I think we continue to gain on that leadership. I just draw a little bit of a line under Dimensional Fund Advisors, which is a very significant U.S.-based, but with global products in the asset management space, and converting that business this quarter was a big win for us. And we would hope that they will continue to succeed. And with the success, we'll benefit from it as well. So again, we pretty diversified. The only other segment that I would call out would be the alternative segment, which -- and you see this in broad-based flows or asset growth. The alternatives continue to grow. And for us, the growth is twofold. It's -- we grow as the funds grow, we grow as we competitive -- we're successful in competitive new business wins, but also a good deal of that particularly private equity and real estate segment is yet well [ph] source. So that's why I continue to call it out because that should continue to be a ripe area for growth for us.", "Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And maybe just my follow-up. It's for Ed, this is a question in -- possibly it's that not big a deal and may be hard to quantify. But I'm just curious, I mean, I know in the -- probably in the ETF business and some of the funds business and maybe even net interest revenue, there is a little bit of an impact from day count just there being a few -- a couple fewer days in the first quarter. Is there any way of quantifying what that impact is on revenue at all?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, there is. I mean, we think about that frankly more from the perspective of net interest revenue. I don't have that number at my fingertips, Rob, but absolutely, there's an impact in terms of day count. We're looking for the number now. I don't know if we have it immediately available. I could certainly follow up with you after the call.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Ed, I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about just on the servicing line side, did you have any negative impact from FX translation this quarter? And can you -- Jay, I heard your comments about starting rerisking in the beginning quarter and then a little bit of tailing at the end. But just kind of what were the core drivers of the servicing line? It certainly was up nicely, but not as much as it seemed like people were looking for, so what are the key drivers?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, let me start that, Ken. Well, I was looking for a number here. So servicing is up, I think, 2.2% sequentially, 9% year-over-year. So a good year-over-year growth, decent sequential growth. You'll also note that the first quarter is a pretty big installation quarter for us when you think about what was left from last year and what we installed that we committed in the first quarter. So I think on the rerisking, Ken, if I were to walk you through kind of a monthly scenario, which largely mirrors what you see in the U.S. mutual fund industry. We exited last year, December was kind of a peak quarter that traveled through January, February and March, tailed off a little bit, but still running stronger than we've seen in prior years. So I guess the other little nuance would be that as opposed to a rotation, which is flows out of fixed income and into equities, it's been more coming out of cash products. And I suspect not just money funds but other bank cash products has been fueling the little equity run that we've had here. So it's been kind of a tumultuous couple weeks here in the global environment. We'll see what -- how the rest of the quarter plays out, but it does feel a little bit different than years past with regards to some level of resiliency in investor behavior even though we've come off of the peak of the December, January months.", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, and Ken, the answer to your question in terms of currency effect on total revenue, it's fairly immaterial. It's about $10 million down sequential quarter and $14 million down year-over-year first quarter to first quarter. So not much.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then my second question, just kind of a similar question on the asset management fees -- on the fee -- on the asset management fee side because there you did the -- also positive flows, positive AUM growth. I was just wondering, was there any delta in either performance fees, or why did that line not grow more sequentially given the better backdrop than the AUM growth?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes. So that was -- sequentially, it was fairly muted year-over-year, up 11%. The flows within the story would be positive on the security finance-led cash collateral pools. The FX -- the ETFs was a little bit of a mixed story, so we had -- as we've been telling you, we're creating and innovating new products in Europe and the U.S. We saw some good growth in Europe. But the offset was you've seen gold prices and therefore, we've seen some outflows into gold, so that was a little bit of a negative on the ETF side. And you also -- we typically see year end a little bit of a run-up in the S&P 500 ETF, which came off in the first quarter. So those are kind of the quarter-to-quarter trends that occurred. I point you a little bit to the 11% year-over-year and say that we feel pretty good about how that business is progressing. We think we're in some of the sweet spots of the market, passive and ETFs, in particular, albeit, there was a little bit of a muted quarter-over-quarter growth in management fees.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "First one is just a quickie on the average balance sheet. The biggest driver, I think, on the NIM decline is the decline in the other investment line. Just curious, down, what, 16 basis points quarter-on-quarter. Just curious what is producing the biggest drop there.", "Edward J. Resch", "Those are loans we have out to custody clients, collateralized loans that are driving that, as well as our Boeing [ph] investment, nonportfolio assets.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And what's -- is it just utilization that's the biggest driver of the movement because...", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, it's episodic.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "It's episodic. But it's episodic in size, but also you're saying the runoff and that just pushes the yield down.", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. Other one was, just curious if you can frame even in round numbers what the Goldman acquisition added to revenues, expenses and thoughts -- early thoughts on client and revenue retentions thus far.", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes. I mean, Goldman is -- the acquisition is progressing right on track. We announced that and said it was about $120 million annual revenue business with a margin in the range of 30% to 35%, and it's right on track. And in terms of client revenue retention, we're exceeding the 90% target that we put out for every acquisition that we do. So nothing but good news on the Goldman Sachs Administration Services acquisition.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay, that's good. And it sounds like it might have been a modest contributor to the positive operating leverage, but the core is still there and good.", "Edward J. Resch", "Absolutely. Right on both counts, Glenn.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with ISI Group.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Just to go back to the core servicing line. Ed, you mentioned $10 million revenue impact from foreign currency translation. Is that mostly in the servicing line? And then, if you could talk a little bit about the pace of installations. You've installed the large DFA business during the quarter. And inclusive of the other installments from the very strong fourth quarter, should we expect a lagging benefit as we move into the second quarter on the servicing line?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes. The -- it was, as I mentioned earlier, a pretty strong installation quarter given the tail of what was left from 2012 and implementing a good deal of what we committed in the first quarter. In the case of DFA, not completely installed but a good chunk of it installed and should layer in, I think, through the course of the second quarter. So kind of all else equal, yes, we should see the benefits of that roll forward as we move through the year.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great, that's helpful. And then my follow-up would be just on the balance sheet investment strategy. I know that you highlighted a 1.05% reinvestment yield. It's a lot lower than the fourth quarter. I guess, is there any change in strategy in terms of trying to shorten the duration or improve the credit quality that's driving that compression? I know the yields are down in general, but that seemed like a larger drop than I was expecting for the reinvestment.", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, no change in strategy, Brian. We're of the same mind that we've always been, which is investing through the cycle and keeping the portfolio in the range roughly 50-50 fixed-rate and floating-rate. And it's just a question of the market opportunities that we saw in the quarter, so no change there. Back to your earlier question, about 1/3 of that $10 million effect is in the servicing fee line for the quarter.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I was hoping you could help us reconcile, I guess, what you're seeing as far as the environment and what's going on with the servicing business, I guess, versus what we're seeing which is the revenues. So, Jay, I guess on the one hand, you described a little bit of a better risk appetite environment and clearly better markets, and it seems like the middle office in the alternative solutions continue to win a largest share of total business which again, feels like all should result in higher fee rate. Yet we haven't seen that, and it doesn't sound like in the near term that's going to improve. So I was hoping you could help us reconcile that and maybe it's the other part of the business that is maybe seeing more pricing pressure, or the business that you guys are winning doesn't seem to be all that different from a pricing perspective relative to kind of like the a core custody business.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, So I think that's a multi-headed question, although I do -- I continue to remind you of the sequential quarter versus year-over-year, where there was good service fee growth. So I think some of this can't be read into a specific quarter-to-quarter comparison. But generally speaking, the environment, I think the pipelines are good and I think that's a reflection of -- in the asset management world and the alternative world and then the pension world, the asset-owner world, clients are continuing to outsource more work to us. We continue to do better than hold our own with regard to -- on the competitive front. We're continuing to introduce new products to differentiate our service offering. And in concert with that, the pricing environment, I don't think it's changed much, but we've become more disciplined with regard to bidding for new business, with regard to making sure that we're extracting a fair economics from our customers for the value that we're providing. So I think that begins to frame it. I think the risking behavior, as I said, has been episodic but better than last year. And I think if you look at the year-over-year 9% increase in servicing fee, some of that is reflective of a better risk environment. I think that the thing that we're all waiting for and hoping for is that this follow through not only on the move to equities, which we've seen some evidence to, but at some point, you're going to see flows come out of fixed income into equities. And I think that given our position particularly in the asset servicing for asset manager space, we have expectations that that's going to be a good thing once that starts to happen, hasn't happened yet.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then on -- just wanted to go back for a second on the ETF activity we're recently seeing with your business. It seems like first -- second quarter to date, total AUM is down in the $14 billion-ish range and a lot of is yield-driven. I was hoping you can maybe give us a sense of on a net basis, what does that to do to your earnings? I know it's not big numbers, but I think the fee rate that you guys collect on the actual management is a little bit higher relative to what the net impact is because I guess of some of the expenses. But just kind of help us understand that $14 billion of outflows you show in the ETF business, what the net impact of that could be.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes. So to begin with, not really material, but if you look at that GLD product, we share management fees with the Gold Council, and I think we're in a 14 basis point-ish range for what we -- the revenues that we derived from that, so that gives you a little bit of sense of the dimension of the effect.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "I see on Slide 7 of the presentation, you're now including the pretax operating margin, so I see that increased -- I know it's your focus. But I'd like the extra presentation, and that's my question. So if you back out the accelerated options expense for the quarter, that pretax operating margin on the Page 7 goes from 26% to what? I guess it goes to 31%, is that correct?", "Edward J. Resch", "About right, yes.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And then your goal, as pointed out, I think, in Slide 36 from your Investor Day presentation, you talked about the core margin in 2010 of 27.5%, your goal is to improve that by 400 basis point. So your goal is 31.5%. So it's 31% core this quarter, and your goal is 31.5%. And then if you have about $400 million of additional savings from the IT project, all-in, if it drops -- just reduce expenses and that's it, I get a number of 35% pretax operating margin. So if you can correct my math or if you can caution us about potential headwinds you're concerned about as for the reason not increasing that target.", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, I mean, we put the 400 basis point margin target out there, Mike, predicated on 2010's results and as caveated by saying all else equal and obviously, all things are not equal. It's always a little bit dangerous to take a quarter and project it out over a multi-year program. I can't disagree with the math you ran through in terms of -- if you excluded $118 million of expense from the quarter, the margin would be higher. But however, that expense would have to be recognized over the succeeding quarters and years. I mean, our normal amortization period is the vesting period for those awards. So the expense would be over the next 16 quarters, okay? So you have to recognize there are some moving pieces here and to look at the first quarter and say, we're already at or close to our program target is, I think, a bit of a leap. Now we're not signaling by that answer that we think the target is not achievable. We believe we're going to get the $575 million to $625 million out of the expense base, but that's going to occur over time, and we would expect the margin to improve over that period of time in line with what we originally said, not looking at just the first quarter.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Well, just making that 1 adjustment if we spread that over quarters you said, 31%, I guess, should be 30% this quarter and 34% once you have all the savings just by the math. So my follow-up question is, your goal is to become the low-cost producer. What would you perceive as a pretax operating margin for the low-cost producer in the processing business?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, I mean, we've been reluctant to put a number out there for what the low-cost producer is or on our operating margin target other than to quantify what we think the effect of the program will be on the margin, again, all else equal, predicated on 2010. I mean, clearly we think we're making good progress on the project. Clearly, we think we're improving the margin. I think you can see that through the first 9 quarters of the program and its implementation. But to date, we have not put an operating margin target out other than what we've said about its effect on the -- the program's effect on the margin.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Mike, the other thing I might add to that is the -- we do aspire to be the low-cost producer in those activities that have become more standardized and commoditized in the business. And we think that our IT and ops transformation program is aimed right at that. Additionally, by layering in the cloud environment, we also think we're able -- be able to be a lead producer of new products and new capabilities in this business. So the goal is really to make sure on those core activities that we do have the lowest unit cost in the marketplace, but we're continuing to invest through the cloud environment to make sure that we're differentiating our products so that we can have pricing power on the other end. I mean that's the magic combination is to be the -- you have the lowest unit cost but also be the most effective innovator on the product side. We think that's the best combination for us going forward.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.", "Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "You were targeting NIM of 1.3% to 1.4%. Now you're kind of pointing to the low-end of that range. It's only Q1, you're already at 131. So I'm trying to gauge your confidence that you can maintain that guidance going forward.", "Edward J. Resch", "We're pretty confident, Luke, that if, in fact, the assumptions that I articulated relative to portfolio size and balance sheet size and customer deposit levels, prepayment speeds, et cetera, play out, that we'll be able to hit within that guidance. And remember, we're talking about our expectation for the year being a net interest revenue decline in the range of $150 million versus 2012. So we're confident that will be able to do that given those assumptions.", "Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And then I want to return to Alex's question on middle office. Given your commanding market share there, it doesn't seem to be a commodity service at this point. So it's sometimes confusing that you've communicated that the fees you charge for that don't look much different from the back-office outsourcing. You said you're getting paid fairly for their value you provide, but can you just remind us why you can't charge more for this suite of services.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes. Luke, we don't, in any single instance, offer middle-office servicing as a standalone. So it's -- I view it as it's an enhancement to our overall bundle of services. And you're right to point out that we have a significant market leadership in that, which translates into when we're competing for new business, we do well. We compete very effectively because we have the best capabilities. And the more differentiated you are at the point of sale, the more you can hold price. So I think that that's how that translates. I think in very complex opportunities that have a middle-office component, we're highly successful where we attract -- where we really want to win the business and pricing is pretty good because we're differentiated.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Maybe one micro question, one big picture question. The micro question is just on expenses. The drop in other category was really noticeable even apart from the unusual expense in 4Q. So you guys mentioned professional fees is the main factor in that. Is that a sustainable level, or would that bounce back seasonally or with some projects that you plan?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, our focus has been very significantly on that line among others. But in the fourth quarter to first quarter decline, we did have a lower level of professional services. We're not expecting the professional services spend the bounce back to what was in prior quarters, but it may increase somewhat depending on the situation, okay? There are consulting costs in there, for example, for evaluation of regulatory initiatives, things like that. So there may be some increase in the future, maybe it's more of a timing question to some of these expenses from -- that went down in the first quarter, but it's absolutely a line that we're looking at very hard and are trying to make sure that we do not see a rebound in that expense line above what we think is absolutely necessary to comply with the regulatory initiatives, for example.", "Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then bigger picture, you mentioned you're focused on growing your ETF business in Europe. And I'm just wondering if you could give some color on that, talk about -- are you targeting certain market shares, certain parts of that market, certain products? What is your strategy over the next few years to be bigger in Europe?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes. So I would add to that, Cindy, Asia, as well, but a little bit more focus on Europe. So the strategy is to participate in an evolving market opportunity. And I do think, when you look at the ETF business globally, the world is -- Europe is underweight in ETFs, and so we're starting to see those opportunities unfold. And I would say that the way we get at that is really twofold. One is through introducing differentiated product to the market. So we've introduced, I think, it's 40 products over the last 18 months. I'd say creative and innovative products, which are commanding higher fees. So part of our strategy is to not be as much in the commoditized end of ETFs, but be in a differentiated end. A large part of which revolves around the portfolio strategy. But equally important and sometimes not understood, there's a distribution into that. So the distribution in Europe is largely through private banks and other intermediaries. And as a result, we've added wholesalers and distributors in Europe, so that's part of the buildup. I think that's largely in place, so it comes to continuing to introduce new product and distributing it through those wholesalers. So we think the opportunity is emerging, and we think we're well positioned for it. And I would say Asia is a story that's a few innings behind that whole story, but the same thing should unfold.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Bryan Foran with Autonomous Research.", "Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP", "I guess, I hope this doesn't come across as like too simplistic a question. But if I just think about 30 years of trust bank data, not just you but the whole industry, I mean, it just seems like the operating margins have always been about the same level. And I guess, if you step back and think about these as scale businesses and all the investments in technology, why isn't there at some point in the future kind of a step-change up in operating margin? It just seems like for a lot of investors maybe part of the frustration with the whole industry, certainly not you alone, is the benefits of scale never seem to have accrued?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, so let me take a swing at that, Brian. I think for a long period of time, decades, these were growth businesses where markets were growing, new products were being introduced, and there was plenty of opportunity to grow top line and there was enormous need to invest infrastructure domestically, globally, product-wise. I think part of that run-up on the revenue side introduced market-driven revenues to that mix. And then if I just pick a point in time, the last 5 or 6 years, postcrisis, market-driven revenues have declined for all the reasons that we all know. We've all been working on, I'd say, as an industry adjusting to a lower growth environment, which means -- my interpretation of it means we need to get more efficient. We need to be that low-cost producer in that core activity, yet there's still an enormous need to invest in the business. So I think we're -- for State Street, I'd say we're working through a period, where we're adjusting to a lower growth rate, which we think is more temporary than permanent. And there's a lot of things that we spoke about change in environment, whether it's rerisking or some of the market-driven revenues improving. A point to NIR is just a specific and important one. As we get our infrastructure more designed for lower growth environment and the environment changes and we stay disciplined on the cost side, then we think we can change the mix going forward. So I think that's a little bit of where we've been, and I think the transition of what we're doing in this period is trying to become -- is becoming more efficient, more effective. While still investing in the business, we think that, at some point, it will cycle out, and we'll see improved environment, and we'll be in that improved environment with an improved infrastructure. So that should give us the opportunity to generate more returns, which will bring to the bottom line and invest to further distance ourselves from competition would be kind of my streaming thought on that.", "Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP", "And one follow-up on OCI. Do you think, as we move forward with Basel III ratios and maybe with a rate backup scenario and future stress test, OCI will kind of change in any way, be potential for buybacks in the future? And within that, did regulators think about OCI on short-duration securities books the same way they do on longer-duration securities books? It just seems like even in the severe interest rate stress scenario, a lot of the OCI risk in your portfolio would fix itself in 1 year or 1.5 years.", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes. I don't know exactly what the regulators think. I tend to have a view that OCI is OCI at this point. It doesn't really get differentiated between longer-term and shorter-term securities. At least, we haven't really heard anything to that effect. The issue of OCI on a go-forward basis and its potential effect on buybacks, I mean, there is information submitted as part of the CCAR, which does include Basel III-related information. I mean, the official test and the statistics published are Basel I, but the regulators do view our balance sheet under a Basel III regime. So the mark obviously in the Basel III capital ratios is included. I think too, from our perspective, the potential for its inclusion on a go-forward basis with the rules not yet being final, Brian, is one of the main reasons why we put a 200 basis point cushion on top of our 8% requirement, which includes our SIFI buffer. It's because of that uncertainty in part that we've done that. So I guess the punchline is that we need to see what the final rules ultimately are, and we'll look at those and formulate a view on what our Basel III Tier 1 common target going forward should be.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just a quick question on the cost saves from the cloud investment. You're expected to have a $220 million benefit to earnings this year, and I'm just wondering how much of that was used up this quarter.", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, we achieved about $50 [ph] million of the $220 million in the year. I think a linear view of that achievement is what we expect and would expect to see roll through the succeeding quarters of the year, Betsy.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Josh Levin with Citigroup.", "Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "With all the work you've been doing on expenses, how much of your core cost structure would you say is fixed versus variable, and how would that compare to maybe 1 or 2 years ago?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, again, it's always a question of what time frame, Josh, right? And I think that probably the best way to think about is over a relatively short time frame, i.e., a couple of quarters, maybe a year. And we can look at a couple of different lines on the income statement and talk about them in terms of how much is fixed and how much is variable. I mean, the largest one obviously is the compensation line, and that is a function of how many people we have, and we've been taking action on that line over the last couple of years given what our view of the revenue environment is. So you could say, at least, a portion of that is variable given the assumption of a year or so time frame. I think that the other line that we've been looking at very carefully over time is the other expense line. Some of that is actually not really very variable given that there's some amortization of intangibles in that line, for example, which are based on prior acquisitions. But there are other expenses as we had in the first quarter that are in fact variable, which are the professional fees that we had a very good performance on as we've noted. And then maybe in between that is transaction processing, which can vary with market levels and transaction volumes. Usually, we have offsetting movements in revenues, so it kind of nets to a profit if the transaction servicing line goes up. There's a revenue item that's up more than that, and the converse is also true. But I'd say, overall, it's an expense base which over a short to intermediate term, while has some variability is for the most part, a fixed cost expense base. I'd be hesitant to put a percentage on it, but that's how we think about it. I mean, I would put another statement out there, which is our IT expense, which is both people and machines and licensing fees, and we can move that over time, and I'd say over -- again, the year's timeframe. Between the operating range of 20% to 25% is -- which is what we target of expenses, so that's a number that's in the range of $1.4 billion per year, that includes people. So that can be moved around, and that's a function of demand and regulatory imperative certainly lately and the need to continue to invest in the business and develop new products.", "Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. A week or 2 ago, you made an announcement you're appointing a new senior executive to work on. I think it's sort of a big data initiative. I was wondered if you could talk about the size and timing of that opportunity.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, sure. It was -- we introduced a new set of services under global exchange. And you're probably right generally relate it to big data. I think the -- within our business, within our businesses, we have a number of different products and services, which are analytical in nature, data-driven analytics for risk management, for performance management compliance, and we've decided to pull those together into a separate unit so that we could focus more directly on what we think is a pretty big opportunity, which is more in the middle office space. I'd say middle-office and front-office space on the back of our middle-office position, and more and more of our clients as we listen to them are challenged by the need to rationalize their data to make it more available on a real-time basis. And in many cases, we are the ones that have that data. So we formalize the structure that we think will launch us into that space, and we're pretty excited about it, but it's going to take some time to sort out exactly how we position the strategy. But we've given it some heft with the existing structure so that we'll have some ability to invest in this new area. And it is -- it does have a big data orientation to it.", "Operator", "And your final question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.", "James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "I just had a quick follow-up on the expense side. Your compensation expense, I know, Ed, you talked a lot about the other line, your compensation composition expense is down 2.7% or 2.8% year-over-year. Given your outlook on the revenue front, assuming that stays the same, I know it can be tough with -- incentive comp bounces around. But do you think that kind of year-over-year decline is sustainable for the rest of the year, or it's too early to be able to give any kind of guidance there?", "Edward J. Resch", "I think it's really too early. I mean, obviously, we're pleased with the 2.7%, again, reflective of the achievement on the Ops and IT program, as well as the effect of the reduction that we announced in the fourth quarter. But I think it's too early to give you an answer to that question right now.", "James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. And then on -- just one last on the deposits. Have you seen further deposit outflows in the second quarter, or given your kind of discussion on average earning assets, are you seeing it kind of stabilize here, and that's part of the issue?", "Edward J. Resch", "We're seeing it fairly stable.", "Operator", "This concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Jay Hooley for closing remarks.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes. Thank you. Thanks all for being with us here this morning.

Logue - Chief Executive Officer", "Edward J.

(Operator Instructions) Now I would like to introduce Kelly McDonald, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations at State Street. ", "Kelly McDonald", "Before Ron Logue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer, Ed Resch, begin their remarks I would like to remind you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in a Form 8-K filed this morning, as well as State Street\u2019s 2007 annual report on Form 10-K and its subsequent filings with the SEC. We encourage you to review those filings, including the sections on risk factors concerning any forward-looking statements we may make today. Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of today, January 20, 2009, and the corporation does not undertake to revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after today.", "I would also like to remind you that you can find slide presentations regarding the corporations investment portfolio and asset-backed commercial paper conduits as well as our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 earnings press release, which includes reconciliations of non-GAAP measures referred to on this web cast, in the Form 8-K filed this morning, a copy of which can be accessed in the investor relations section of our web site as referenced in our press release this morning.", "Ronald E. Logue", "Good morning everybody. This past week and weekend have been very unsettling in the global markets for financial stocks. Last week two of the larger U.S. banks announced continuing issues and sought further assistance from the government, impacting investor attitudes towards U.S. financial stocks.", "Then yesterday regulatory intervention in the United Kingdom further damaged the market and its impact in the U.S. today is as yet unknown. ", "We, today, announced strong 2008 results and fortunately have built our regulatory capital. Our tier-1 capital stands at 2.49% and our tier-1 leverage ratio stands at 7.74%. Now, despite the two strong ratios, we understand that many of our investors are concerned about the mark to market impact of conduit consolidation on our tangible comingled ratio, therefore we had considered raising additional equity capital.", "To assess that issue and evaluate the current market place we held confidential discussions with some of our institutional investors. Based on these discussions, and given our strong regulatory ratios, our outlook for 2009, the strength of our business, we have determined not to raise equity capital.", "As several of them mentioned, the environment right now is changing very quickly. We are likely going to see additional government initiatives to stimulate a more normal financial market and in fact, as I will explain in a minute, the marks on our investment portfolio have improved over the past two weeks.", "In addition, we expect to generate between 160 basis points and 200 basis points of organic capital over the course of 2009. Obviously the increases in the negative marks in our investment portfolio and in our conduits concern us but we still believe that they are for the most part a result of the lack of liquidity in the market and not a result of their credit quality.", "Although the first two weeks of this year is not a valid statistical sample, we have some room for optimism as the negative after-tax marks in the investment portfolio have improved about $400.0 million after tax while the conduit marks have remained flat compared to December 31, 2008.", "So what happened since the presentation at the Merrill Lynch conference on November 11, when we indicated that our outlook for 2009 was for operating EPS to approach the low end of our 10% to 15% range, and what we meant by that was 6% to 8% increase from 2008? After my remarks, in fact I believe on the very next day, Secretary Paulsen announced that the government no longer would be purchasing troubled assets with TARP funds, which in our opinion further stressed the securities markets and reflected in further degradation in our marks.", "This, followed by the issues with the auto manufacturers plus more dour news about the consumer markets, caused our assumptions about our 2009 outlook to change. Hence, we are adjusting our outlook to expect flat operating earnings per share.", "We believe we\u2019ve had a head start in rebuilding this earnings growth due to our strong financial performance in 2008. Now, in many ways we are unique with respect to our financial performance compared to many others in the financial services industry. We achieved all of our financial goals in 2008, which we will discuss in detail on an operating basis.", "We never reported a quarterly loss. We generated significant positive operating leverage on an operating basis. We achieved record revenue growth. We quietly and successfully integrated our acquisition of Investors Financial while keeping almost all their customers. Throughout the last six quarters of market turmoil all the assets in our investment portfolio and conduits that were due to mature during that period, did in fact, mature at par.", "As we have been saying all of our unmatured portfolio holdings continued to make required interest and principal payments.", "Now regarding our 2009 outlook, we expect servicing fees to be down. New business momentum is strong going into the first quarter. Market disruption has caused many participants to rethink outsourcing of their administrative functions. We don\u2019t think securities lending revenue is going to suffer the kind of contraction some may think. ", "The customers\u2019 flight to quality is expected to become a bigger wave as time goes on and will manifest itself in later quarters and later-year revenue. This should benefit trading as there will be fewer secure firms with which to trade. Likewise, hedge funds, many of which do their own administration or source it to a prime broker, are looking to outsource administration to independent third-party providers, like State Street.", "Managing expenses will be a bigger factor in our performance. Although we will keep our long-term financial goals, we do not expect to meet them this year but we are creating the foundation to allow us to meet those long-term goals in later years.", "Let me briefly be a little more specific about our 2008 performance. For the year and the quarter, whether on an operating or a GAAP basis, we are into profit. On an operating basis, comparing 2008 with 2007 revenue increased 25% against our goal of 14% to 17% and EPS was up 14% against the goal of 10% to 15%. Our return on common equity, also on an operating basis, was 17.9%, ahead of our 14% to 17% goal. Given the background of the market disruption I would say our business performed very well. ", "Looking at the entire year, we saw a continued strength in our servicing, trading, and securities finance businesses, despite weakness in equity markets. Our servicing fee revenue was up 11% in 2008 compared to 2007 and our management fee revenue was only down 10% compared to a decline of approximately 18% on average in the S&P 5000 and the EAFE.", "Due to increasing spread in securities finance and volatility in FX markets both of those businesses grew whether comparing 2008 with 2007 or comparing the quarterly year-over-year rate or the sequential quarter rate.", "Fully taxed equivalent net interest revenue, due to the reduction in the Federal Funds rate as well as the impact of additional deposits left with us, increased 56% comparing 2008 with 2007. The net interest margin certainly outperformed most expectations.", "And lastly, through a combination of revenue growth and cost controls, we achieved about 240 basis points of positive operating leverage for 2008 compared with 2007. ", "Due to the continuing questions we get on our securities lending program let me also differentiate our program for you. First, we act as agent, not as principal. Securities lending provides a vital source of liquidity to equity, bond, and money markets, as well as reduces the cost of trading and settlement thereby benefiting all market participants.", "Our securities lendings funds continue to perform well despite illiquidity in fixed income markets, a dramatic deleveraging of the markets generally, and reduction in the demand of borrowed securities. The investment funds underlying the program are invested conservatively. It is true that some of our customers have suspended participation in our program but that number has not changed significantly since the end of the third quarter when we reported about 10%, or 45, of our customers had suspended participation in our program.", "We have seen increased withdrawal activity from the collateral pools due to the general deleveraging in the market place but have been able to manage these outflows in a manner that protects our customers and in keeping with the flight to quality that I mentioned earlier, we are seeing additional interest in our program from several potential customers.", "Continued wider spreads are expected to at least partially offset the impact of lower volumes until some of our customers resume their lending activities. If spreads narrow we would need to see an uptick in volumes to maintain the same revenue levels. So I would contend that while our securities lending industry is facing challenges, our securities lending program remains strong.", "Let me remind that the two primary ratio we manage to are regulatory. One is our leverage ratio and the other is our tier-1 capital ratio. The corporation\u2019s tier-1 [leverage] ratio is 7.74% at December 31, 2008. We have let it rise to this level to provide us with additional flexibility. The corporation\u2019s tier-1 capital ratio as of December 31, 2008, stands at 20.49%, we believe high by any standard. We have confidence in the quality of our assets, both in the investment portfolio and in the conduits. ", "Now, as some evidence of our confidence in the quality of these assets, in 2008 over $8.0 billion of our structured securities in the investment portfolio paid down. All did so at par despite the fact that they were priced on average at a 7.8% discount to book value. Also, I will remind you that none are in default and all are current for principal and interest. The same could be said for the conduit marks which have improved a bit in early January and all securities are current for principal and interest.", "In the fourth quarter we recorded about $78.0 million in other than temporary impairments, 0.1% of our total average portfolio, I hope you would a agree a very small number on both an absolute and a relative basis. We believe multiple government programs, like the TARP and others, anticipated by Washington will eventually have a positive impact on the overall market environment. Our unrealized marks, at least for the first two weeks of this year, have improved.", "Importantly, we can earn 40 basis points to 50 basis points in organic capital each quarter in 2009. We believe our assets are for the most part going to mature at par. All our assets, both in the investment portfolio and the conduits, as I said, are current for principal and interest.", "Moody\u2019s has reviewed our assets. They consider the ultimate loss on the portfolio to likely be low on a held-to-maturity basis. Our regulatory ratios are among the highest in the financial services industry. ", "We are also making progress at reducing the size of our asset-backed commercial paper program, which stood at $29.0 billion as of December 31, 2007, and was about $24.0 billion as of December 31, 2008.", "So if the FASB proposal is passed as it exists today, we believe we would be required to consolidate the conduits on January 1, 2010. We are managing the conduits to a smaller size, which together with at least four more quarters of additional organic capital growth and hopefully more normalized markets, will help to mitigate the impact of consolidations.", "Now sometimes we are asked why don\u2019t we just consolidate the conduits and put this issue behind us. Well, the answer is simple. Our financial risk is exactly the same, whether we consolidate or not. We still have exposure to the assets, which as we have repeatedly said, we believe the vast majority will mature at par.", "Now until markets begin to repair and resume some degree of normalcy, we expect some volatility to continue in foreign exchange and spreads to remain wider than normal in securities lending, we would say at least during the first half of 2009.", "There is also an emerging strong interest on the part of traditional asset managers to finally outsource the administrative functions of their business and we are talking with many of them now. Now there is no guarantee that we will see many large outsourcing deals this year but we are talking to firms that heretofore would not have entertained the idea.", "And I mentioned earlier, we expect to see additional business from large hedge funds that traditionally self-administer.", "On the expense side, we are executing against our reduction in force and other strategic cost initiatives that we announced in December. We are maintaining very tight controls on headcount and we are budgeting no salary increases in 2009.", "At this point I would like to turn the call over to Ed to give you more detail.", "Edward J. Resch", "I would like to start talking about the investment portfolio, particularly the mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities classes, which in November saw a significant widening of spreads in what we think is an incredibly illiquid market.", "During the quarter we made one classification change in the investment portfolio where we transferred $14.6 billion of RMBS, Alt-A, and CMBS assets to the held-to-maturity portfolio from the available-for-sale portfolio. 97% of these securities are rated single-A or above. As we have said many times, we believe these assets are high quality and we have the ability and intent to hold them to maturity.", "The unrealized after-tax mark widened by $3.0 billion from $3.3 billion at September 30, 2008, to $6.3 billion at December 31, 2008. With respect to the November 7th transfer of the $14.6 billion of assets from the available-for-sale portfolio to the held-to-maturity portfolio, $1.4 billion of after-tax unrealized losses is included in equity and therefore is included in the OCI calculation.", "As of last Friday, January 16, 2009, the after-tax unrealized loss in the investment portfolio had improved by $400.0 million to $5.9 billion compared to December 31, 2008.", "As to the investment portfolio, the illiquidity in the market resulted in an increase in the unrealized after-tax marked to market loss in the conduit portfolio to $3.6 billion, an increase of about $1.4 billion from September 30, 2008, due primarily to higher credit spreads on U.S. non-agency RMBS. ", "As of last Friday, January 16, 2009, the unrealized after-tax loss on the conduits remained approximately flat compared to December 31, 2008.", "Now let me move on to a discussion of our fourth quarter results. This morning all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results as defined in our press release this morning. In Ron\u2019s remarks he highlighted some of the achievements of the year. My remarks will focus on the fourth quarter\u2019s operating results.", "Servicing and Management fees actually performed fairly well, particularly in light of the more than 40% decline on average in market valuations on both the S&P and the EAFE comparing the fourth quarter of 2008 with the fourth quarter of 2007. The continuing volatility in the market benefited our trading revenue growth, particularly foreign exchange, compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.", "Performance in securities finance was also strong on a year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter basis. At quarter end we had $347.0 billion in securities on loan and the duration on the securities lending book was 22 days.", "I would like to stop here and call your attention to the 8-K we recently filed, calling attention to the net asset values in the co-mingled pools of assets that support our securities lending program. These pools represent about one-third of the total $347.0 billion period end securities on loan that I just mentioned. The securities lending business transacts at one dollar while the net asset values of the underlying funds float over time.", "On December 31, 2008, the average current market value of the unregistered funds was approximately $0.939. The issue that we have highlighted is whether our participants in our program, including our SSGA funds that engage in securities lending, will be able to continue under current accounting rules to value the interest in the collateral pools at the transaction price of one dollar, or at the NAV of the underlying pool.", "Customers continue to enter our program knowing that the valuations can vary. We have not had any credit issues on securities in the comingled pools. This disclosure does not affect customers whose cash collateral is managed in separate accounts, which is a significant percentage of our overall book, or any of our registered money market funds.", "Now for the remaining items in the income statement. The increase in processing and other fees on both a year-over-year and sequential-quarter basis was primarily due to increases in product related revenue. Of particular note, however, on the higher fees from the asset-backed commercial paper program, where fees from this program increased from $5.7 million in the third quarter to $28.5 million in the fourth quarter, due primarily to the timing of rates where asset-backed commercial paper funding rates dropped relative to the higher reset rate on the assets.", "Regarding the Investors Financial acquisition, we achieved accretion of $0.06 per share for 2008, significantly ahead of our original plan at the time of the acquisition.", "Regarding expenses, a 6.5% increase in fourth quarter expenses compared to the third quarter. I will comment on only two areas. First, salaries and benefits expenses declined 5% for the third quarter, due primarily to a lower level of incentive compensation. ", "Other expenses, however, were up more than 65% compared to the third quarter, primarily due to three items. One, securities processing costs were higher than normal while the third quarter costs were lower than normal. Two, the cost of regulatory fees and assessments increased more than $30.0 million and three, risk and compliance expenditures increased. We do not expect this level of increase on the other expense line to continue into 2009 but rather expect it to decline about 20% on an annual basis.", "Due primarily to strong customer deposit flows and the lowering of the Fed Funds rate late in the third quarter and again in December, net interest revenue increased about 42% from the year-ago quarter and was up 27% from the third quarter. The 75 basis point cut was unexpected at the time of the third quarter call and so our performance exceeded our expectation at that time.", "Net interest margin of 228 basis points was up 6 basis points from the third quarter of 2008 on an operating basis.", "Now let me turn to the investment portfolio. The size of the investment portfolio has not changed significantly since the third quarter. However, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, the unrealized mark to market losses have widened further as of year end.", "Two issues continue to dominate the financial system, declining housing valuations and weakness in consumer markets as unemployment increases. It appears as if the government\u2019s proposed programs are beginning to impact these two issues but it is far too early to tell if the government actions will eventually return these markets to a more functional state. In our investment portfolio slide presentation we have updated the data through year end for you to review.", "Since our holdings of non-agency RMBS, Alt-A, and subprime asset-backed securities have raised questions, let me provide some additional data on these compared to industry bench marks, particularly the JP Morgan MBS Credit Index for the mortgage-backed securities, and the ABX for various vintages in the [Ntex] indices.", "First, the non-agency prime RMBS holding. The JP Morgan MBS Credit Index shows a loan to value of 71% and State Street\u2019s holdings have an average loan to value of 69%. Credit enhancement, the JP Morgan MBS Credit Index has credit enhancement of 5% whereas State Street\u2019s holdings have an average credit enhancement of 9.1%. 84% of our holdings are rated triple- or double-A and 61% are rated are 2005 vintage or older.", "Then the non-agency Alt-A holdings. The JP Morgan MBS Credit Index shows 24% of these holdings comprised of option ARMs whereas State Street has no option ARMs in its portfolio at all.", "Secondly, the 37% of the Alt-A securities in JP Morgan\u2019s MBS Index are fixed rate whereas State Street has 73% fixed rate. The JP Morgan MBS Index has a loan to value of 75% in its Alt-A holdings whereas State Street\u2019s loan to value is 69%. And the credit enhancement on the Alt-A securities in the JP Morgan MBS Credit Index is 7.5% and State Street\u2019s is 11.1%.", "And last, the subprime asset-backed securities. State Street\u2019s credit enhancement is almost 43% and 45% of its holdings are from vintage years 2005 or earlier. The historic cumulative loss for State Street\u2019s 2005 portfolio is 3.91%, for 2006 is 4.01%, and for 2007 is 3.53%. The [NTEX] market shows 4.95%, 8.1%, and 5.61% for respective periods and the ABX historic cumulative losses are 5.73%, 6.89%, and 5.54%, also for the respective periods.", "I use these three examples to illustrate the differences among our holdings and those referenced in industry-wide tables, which I realize many of you may rely on for information. As Ron said earlier, we expect the overwhelming majority of these assets to mature without loss. We chose them after a thorough review of their quality and risk in those assets.", "I think everyone will admit these are very unusual times and we believe our portfolio has and will continue to perform very well. During the quarter, we recorded $78.0 million of other than temporary impairments and for all of 2008 we reported $122.0 million, or about 0.2% of the average portfolio for the year.", "At the same time, we are not in the corporate lending business. The majority of the loans on our balance sheet are customer overdrafts, mostly overnight, and are not subject to the types of credit risks associated with commercial or mortgage loans. ", "As of December 31, 2008, our portfolio was 89.3% rated triple- or double-A, 78.2% triple-A rated and 11.1% double-A rated. We have had no defaults and all securities are current as to principal and interest.", "For the past two quarters our balance sheet has been larger than normal due to increased liquidity from our customer deposits in the recent market environment and our participation in the Fed\u2019s AMLF facility.", "I remind you that we bear no credit or capital risk for holding the AMLF assets. As we indicated on the third quarter call, we are not reporting revenue from the AMLF program as part of our operating revenue for 2008 or for 2009. Although it has been extended through April 2009 we expect it will be phased out by then. As of December 31, 2008, we left $52.0 billion in excess balances with central banks.", "Ron already talked about the two main ratios that we manage to, leverage ratio which stands at 7.74% as of December 31, 2008, and the tier-1 capital ratio which is 20.49%. On a pro forma basis, considering consolidation of the conduits, as of December 31, 2008, the tier-1 leverage ratio would decline to 5.56% and the tier-1 risk based capital ratio would be 14.73%. Our TCE ratio is 4.46% but is 1.05% on a pro forma basis considering consolidation of the conduits.", "Next, the discussion of the asset-backed commercial paper program. As in the past, you can find a detailed quarterly review of the assets displayed by type, country of origin, and ratings in the asset-backed commercial paper slide presentation. Also there you will find the unrealized after-tax marked to market losses for each asset type and the stresses we apply to them. In the interest of time I will not discuss them in detail today.", "As of December 31, 2008, the conduits held assets of $23.9 billion, down from $25.5 billion on September 30, 2008, due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar as well as asset amortization. As I have said many times, we created this program in 1992, primarily to address customer requests for high-quality, highly-rated commercial paper.", "The conduits have never suffered a credit loss on any asset they purchased, evidence of our strong credit discipline. 78% of the assets are rated triple-, double-, and single-A, compared to an average computed by Moody\u2019s of 51 programs, which is 30%. None of the assets in our conduits are subprime nor are there any SIVs in the conduit program. As of December 31, 2008, the assets continued to have an average weighted maturity of about four years and as I have said, all securities in the conduits are current as to principal and interest.", "As I am sure you aware, the commercial paper market has been considerably strained, particularly in the fourth quarter. As a result, we utilized the CPFF program to prudently manage our year-end liquidity position. As of December 31, 2008, our conduit sold $5.7 billion in commercial paper to the CPFF program and we held just $230.0 million of commercial paper on our balance sheet.", "Due to the high quality of the assets and their performance, we do not currently believe we need to consolidate the conduits. We stress test the assets to support this conclusion, and of course if the credit situation were to deteriorate more severely than the criteria we used in our testing, then we might be required to consolidate them in the future.", "From a funding standpoint the risk of a more immediate consolidation is included in our continuously funding plan. Also, we are well prepared for a consolidation if required by FASB as of January 1, 2010. Also, the CPFF provides us with a liquidity facility for our commercial paper, if necessary.", "As of December 31, 2008, given the market environment, we carried about $43.0 billion in liquid assets on our balance sheet.", "Before I make some concluding remarks I do want to correct some misinformation in the market.  In the fourth quarter of 2007 we took a charge which included $160.0 million we contributed to SSGA\u2019s stable value funds. That infusion was made in January 2008. We took an additional charge of $450.0 million for an infusion made in the fourth quarter of 2008. The January 2008 contribution has been misinterpreted as January 2009. We have not put any money into the stable value funds during 2009. And those funds today are among the healthiest in the stable value industry.", "Let me make a few brief remarks about our outlook for net interest revenue in 2009. First of all, we believe 2008 was an anomalous year with unusually strong growth in net interest revenue and atypical net interest margin expansion. In 2009 we assume that we will continue to invest conservatively, preserving capital, and not reach for yield. ", "We have about $15.0 billion in assets maturing in 2009. The spreads available to us for reinvestment are wider by about 100 basis points than the spreads of the assets maturing. We are evaluating opportunities for reinvestment carefully and are waiting for government programs like the  TALF to take effect so as to create a more normalized environment for new issuances.", "We expect the yield curve to remain steep but with LIBOR spreads coming in as the market more normalizes. We expect interest earning assets to remain relatively stable with those of 2008. ", "Our net interest margin is expected to be around 225 basis points, on average to the year, about flat with the net interest margin of 2008, both numbers excluding the impact of the AMLF revenue. And in 2008 also excluding the SILO adjustment to the interest revenue.", "We also assume that the Bank of England will cut its overnight rate to 1% by April and hold it at that level for the rest of the year, and similarly the ECB to cut its overnight rate to 1.5% in April and hold it steady for the rest of the year. In terms of the U.S. Fed, we expect the Fed Funds rate to stay where it is, 25 basis points, for all of 2009.", "So in conclusion, 2008 was a very successful year for State Street, setting record levels of operating revenue and operating earnings per share in the face of a dysfunctional market and serious issues arising in the financial services industry. While 2009 we believe will be challenging, we also feel we are positioned to perform very well and deliver returns to our shareholders.", "Now I will turn the call back to Ron.", "Ronald E. Logue", "Given our outlook for 2009 as compared to 2008, we believe we have the revenue opportunities and the expense controls to meet our new 2009 goals. Revenue growth is expected to be fairly flat with our record level in 2008. We expect operating earnings per share to be flat from 2008 and we expect returns on common equity to be slightly below the low end of a 14% to 17% range.", "So to summarize, on the revenue side we expect the momentum we achieved in 2008 with wins to be installed in 2009 to benefit us, additional revenue synergies from Investors Financial Service acquisition, strength in the first half of 2009 in trading and securities finance due to the continuing volatility in the market, some improvement in the equity market over the year so that for the year we are assuming a 1000 average for the S&P 500, net interest margin to be similar to 2008 as Ed explained in his remarks.", "On the expense side we expect to retain strong control over headcount, budget for no salary increases in 2009, and in general we expect expenses to be lower in 2009.", "Now it is clear 2009 is going to be difficult for all of us. Revenue and earnings are going to be harder to find. Customers will continue to seek safety and expenses are going to be very tightly controlled. We think the survivors of this financial crisis are going to be the ones that have stronger capital positions, effective risk management processes, and a legacy of strong revenue generation.", "Now we will turn it over to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS.", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "During the quarter how much was moved into held-to-maturity and how much?", "Edward J. Resch", "About $14.0 billion.", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "And is there additional cost? Can I add the two numbers up and come up with an over $2.0 billion additional cost? Or if it got moved or not is there an difference on the impact on TCE?", "Edward J. Resch", "It\u2019s in two pieces. We brought the securities over on November 7th and at that point in time we recognized about a $1.4 billion mark to market through equity. And then since the time it\u2019s been in held-to-maturity the market has declined another $800.0 million, so you have to add those two numbers together to give you the effect on a mark to market basis relative to those $14.0 billion of securities.", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "The $1.4 billion has moved the OCI line, correct?", "Edward J. Resch", "That\u2019s correct.", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "The $800.0 million has not.", "Edward J. Resch", "That\u2019s correct.", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "So theoretically there was no additional cost of moving anything over. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s subprime, RMBS, and Alt-A and things like that got moved over.", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, RMBS, CMBS, and Alt-A.", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "So if there is further spread widening, that will not run through the OCI.", "Edward J. Resch", "That will not affect OCI nor the TCE ratio, correct.", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "And just talking about the TCE, I thought there was a bit of a move by the regulators. Ratings seem to have some more comfort with TCE to risk weighted assets or maybe something in between the regulatory ratio and the TCE ratio. Where does that stand?", "Edward J. Resch", "The rating agencies have expressed some views on that relative to State Street and I think frankly, for one of the rating agencies their thinking on the TCE ratio has moved a bit, to consider it to be more important in their evaluation of us. And the other rating agency that I\u2019m referring to seems to have more of a focus on risk weighted assets and other metrics.", "So I think there is a little bit of a difference as to approach among the two rating agencies that I am referring to and our discussions with them relative to our ratios and our earnings release continue as they normally do.", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "And normally I would say customers don\u2019t care, but how much do customers care now? In other words, if the game plan is no capital raised right now can you run with a 1% for a while?", "Ronald E. Logue", "In terms of customers and in terms of past experience, there has never been that I know of any discussion about that whatsoever, so, yeah, I think we can.", "Now, running with that means consolidation of the conduits, which hasn\u2019t happened.", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "And then in terms of the thought process of the go-forward, we\u2019re kind of levered to the direction of spreads. Not as levered given the move to those some things moved into held-to-mature, but we\u2019re still levered towards incremental widening of spreads. Is there any thought process around, besides constantly monitoring the public markets, another TARP injection, a strategic buyer? Anything along those lines?", "Ronald E. Logue", "Obviously we are going to look at other ways to deal with TCE but I think what we have to do is first of all, obviously it\u2019s a fluid situation. There are going to be a lot of, I would say, different government stimulus programs. I think we have to evaluate that first and obviously take a look at that and depending on what they look like, take advantage of that if we so feel that way. So obviously we\u2019re going to be open to that.", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "On the negative spread in the conduit, you mentioned the reinvestment potential. I think I remember the rules being that you couldn\u2019t actually go up to four quarters before you actually even need to address. The negative spread at the end of this quarter is not necessarily a force on it, is that correct?", "Edward J. Resch", "You\u2019re referring to the slide?", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "Yes.", "Edward J. Resch", "That\u2019s actually reflective of the very positive funding costs at the conduit, given what rates did in the quarter. But you\u2019re correct in your question in that the conduits have to be, let\u2019s call it a going concern. And it\u2019s not a short-term test for a week or a month. The conduit can experience a contraction in its profitability and still be considered a going concern and pass the FEN 46 test.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kenneth Usdin - Bank of America Securities.", "Kenneth Usdin - Bank of America Securities", "On the rating agencies, where do they currently stand as far as the current capital ratios? I think you mentioned that one might be moving towards the analysis of TCE, both have both come out and reiterated their views or changed their views at all?", "Edward J. Resch", "No, we\u2019ve previewed our earnings with them and we\u2019re awaiting their feedback. They have not given us any indication as to their reaction to this earnings announcement. Obviously we have discussed with them all of our capital ratios as part of that process.", "Kenneth Usdin - Bank of America Securities", "Regarding other potential calls on capital, you mentioned a couple of the items that were in the 8-K but as far as right now, are there any anticipated other charges or sizeable hits that could come down the pike like we have seen in the last few quarters, either via market-related disruptions or OTTI and if anything is baked into your assumptions?", "Edward J. Resch", "No, we don\u2019t have anything like that baked into our assumptions. ", "Ronald E. Logue", "And we don\u2019t have anything that we\u2019ve identified either.", "Kenneth Usdin - Bank of America Securities", "Can you talk about on the expense side, you talk about having a lot of flexibility. We know about the severance package but can you just walk us through just the litany of the whole expense base and if you can size relative to 2008 or how much discretionary spending you really expect that could go away as we go forward?", "Ronald E. Logue", "You know about the salary and benefits piece with the severance, the reduction of force that\u2019s taking place. So that\u2019s there. That\u2019s obviously the biggest line item. The second biggest line item is IT and I think, as you know, the way we express that is spending 20% to 25% of our operating expense every year in IT. Now obviously in 2009 we\u2019re going to be closer to 20%, if not at 20%, or maybe even a little lower. Obviously that\u2019s discretionary.", "One of the good things in 2008, because we had such a good year, we got a lot of things done. We built capacity, so we\u2019re in pretty good shape there. So we have some discretionary there.", "The third piece would be other expenses. You can see that other expenses were up quite a bit in the fourth quarter. Again, there, doing some things where we have some discretion and actually where we have some variable expenses in using contractors as opposed to full-time programmers. ", "So we have built in, over the last two or three years, a little more variability in our expenses so we are able to do more than we were able to do three or four years ago.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "I guess I\u2019m grappling, as with everybody else, with the change in guidance and I realize that if indeed you come through with flat operating earnings in 2009 versus 2008 that is probably going to be a heroic performance, but why did you wait until now to lower the guidance? I mean, it\u2019s not a news flash that 2009 was going to be a tough year, so why didn\u2019t you do this at the end of the fourth quarter?", "Ronald E. Logue", "We just waited for the earnings call. There was no real reason why we didn\u2019t do it the. I guess we could have but we were just going to do it in conjunction with our earnings.", "Obviously we also needed to understand what the situation was. We had to approve a budget from our Board in the middle of December, so I would say just normal reason, no particular reason.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Could you repeat any specific line item factors that have led you to lower the guidance from, I think it was up 10% to 15% to flat.", "Ronald E. Logue", "A lot of it had to do with what happened in the last quarter of the year. Let\u2019s talk about rates for a second. You know the Fed rate going down to 0.25%, what\u2019s happening with rates in Europe, the markets themselves in general, in terms of our assumptions of where we thought the equity markets would be, continued dislocation. And all that was emerging and happening in the last couple of months of [2008] as we were gauging basically what we thought we could do and looking at where some of those offsets were. One, expense, and two was the other revenue lines where we could do some things.", "Also understanding that there was significant new business that was sold in the third and fourth quarter that was being installed in the first and second quarters. I think we alluded to it in the press release. We may not have alluded to it here but I believe the number is $317.0 billion of custodial assets that will be installed in the first and second quarter and vary types of revenue. ", "So all of that was being factored in in that equation to come to that conclusion.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Since the improvement in the TCE ratio, which is what you\u2019re forecasting 40 basis points to 50 basis points per quarter, is based on your comfort with your outlook for 2009, what is your comfort level with the new guidance?", "Ronald E. Logue", "We feel pretty comfortable about that. If things got worse, obviously that\u2019s going to have an effect but I think, like a lot of others, we\u2019re thinking towards the latter half of the year, hopefully things will get better with all of the government programs. We\u2019re seeing potentially some continued big business wins. I talked about some of the outsourcing things. ", "Like I said, I can\u2019t guarantee that but the activity in the pipeline and the fundamental business is extremely strong right now. I think a lot of that has to do with the flight to quality so we feel pretty comfortable in terms of the basic business. The securities lendings spreads are still wide. We\u2019re still seeing volatility in the FX markets. So I think there are some offsets there that we feel pretty good about.", "But what we\u2019ve come back to is the fundamental strength in the underlying business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Mayo - Deutsche Bank Securities.", "Michael Mayo - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Can you elaborate more on the decision not to raise capital? You have one of the highest regulatory ratios in the industry but you said that you have the lowest common denominator effect. In other words, one major party says they\u2019re concerned about your capital ratios, even if it\u2019s just one rating agency, that becomes a relevant indicator that you need to raise capital and how did you weigh that against the reaction you got from investors.", "Ronald E. Logue", "Obviously the regulatory ratios are very important to us but there has been continuing concern on the TCE ratio. And yeah, the rating agencies may be going back and forth or having different opinions but I think what we need to do is balance the need for different types of capital versus in terms of earnings. And what we need to do is make sure that we have good data, a good understanding of what we think we need to do and some understanding of how the environment is going to change.", "So there\u2019s not one right piece of data that I can point to but I think it\u2019s all of that.", "Michael Mayo - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Can you give more detail about what the investor feedback was? Was it like 90% said don\u2019t raise capital? Was it unanimous among the large investors?", "Ronald E. Logue", "No, what I can say, I think investors said, you know the financial markets are pretty crazy right now. It\u2019s a difficult time to do something like that. There are government programs that are going to come into play pretty soon.", "As I said, what has happened in the last couple of weeks, you know things have become very disruptive, so there was a feeling that it may not be the best time. And we took that to heart.", "Michael Mayo - Deutsche Bank Securities", "The more general question is, I\u2019ll put words in your mouth, I\u2019m sure you think the stock price is ridiculous relative to the fundamental value of the firm.", "Ronald E. Logue", "Yes.", "Michael Mayo - Deutsche Bank Securities", "So the question is what can you do about it? Would you consider mergers, would you consider selling off pieces of assets? What is in your control to get the stock price higher so this doesn\u2019t become a self-fulfilling prophecy and eliminate the flight to quality benefit that you have?", "Ronald E. Logue", "Obviously I can\u2019t talk about some of those things. What I can talk about, not in detail, but things that we can do to affect TCE and things that we may or may not do in terms of the new government programs. And that\u2019s about all I can really discuss in terms of things we can do.", "Michael Mayo - Deutsche Bank Securities", "The issue is we don\u2019t know what the rules are for capital, and I say that covering the industry and covering it for two decades, what are the rules for capital, and it varies bank to bank, regulator to rating agencies. Do you agree with that and have you spoken to anyone in government about that? Because we don\u2019t know if [inaudible] equities, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s tier-1, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s leverage, or if it\u2019s case-by-case. How can we analyze the industry? Why would anyone put private capital into the industry and how would you manage your business?", "Ronald E. Logue", "You broke up a little bit but I think I have the essence of your question. We look to the regulatory agencies as extremely important and one of the reasons is why they are what they are. And we are going to continue to do that. But we have to look at all the ratios and find some way to moderate the balance in terms of what is the right thing to do. I don\u2019t know what more I can say about that other than it\u2019s truly the balance that we\u2019re trying to find there in terms of the ratios between the rating agencies and regulatory agencies.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "On the various portfolios and the duration of the portfolios, could you give us the duration of the held-to-maturity portfolio as well as the held-for-sale and the conduit at this stage?", "Edward J. Resch", "The investment portfolio duration is 1.69 years at the end of the year. That\u2019s in total. I don\u2019t have the breakout on the HTM portfolio at hand. I think Kelly McDonald can get back to you with the details there. On the conduits, a quarter of a year.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "So one quarter?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, because it\u2019s all floating rate.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "And the liability side?", "Edward J. Resch", "Of the conduits is 25 days. On average.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "How are you thinking about the dividend? Because the dividend does reflect your long-term earnings capability but in this environment where you are triangulating between different investor needs and capital needs, how are you thinking about that going forward?", "Ronald E. Logue", "I guess the best way to answer it is, we\u2019re thinking about it and obviously we\u2019re going to be evaluating that in the first quarter. We\u2019ll take a look at it. I don\u2019t think we have any hard and fast decisions about that at this point in time but it\u2019s obviously one of the things that we can use.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "How much new business did you have coming into the quarter or did you lose any business, besides due to the market deterioration.", "Ronald E. Logue", "Again, you\u2019re breaking up. I think you were asking how much new business did we bring in and how much did we lose?", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "Correct.", "Ronald E. Logue", "We brought a lot of new business, continued record new business. As I said, we are installing $317.0 billion in this year that we won. The fourth quarter numbers, it was about $400.0 billion in asset servicing in the fourth quarter and about $34.0 billion in asset management. ", "Losses were very small in asset servicing. Actually probably smaller than we have seen in past times. And a lot of the losses were basically liquidations in funds as opposed as losses to others.", "And asset management, I don\u2019t have that right now but we will get it for you.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "In the third quarter you mentioned that you had a terminated [DVS] agreement with one of your customers. You took the collateral from Lehman. You set aside $200.0 million in the third quarter. Where is the value of that [DVS] today or did you add to that?", "Edward J. Resch", "We are carrying on our balance sheet that collateral at a value of $800.0 million. We evaluated it at year end and determined that the carrying value was appropriate so we took no additional write-downs on that, subsequent to originally putting it on our balance sheet net of that $200.0 million reserve.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "Is there any time requirement [inaudible] temporary impairment lasts longer than 12 months or 18 months? Are you forced to then make it an OTCI charge even though you may not believe that it is deserved?", "Edward J. Resch", "No, there is no bright line test in the accounting literature. It is an area of judgment and we have what we think is a very robust process around looking at our securities for other than temporary impairment. We have a price screen and a duration screen for how long the security has been at a certain level. That then gives us a population of securities to look at on a more detailed level. We do detailed cash flows on them and the accounting requirement is that if we determine that it is probable, that all amounts due under the terms of the securities will not be collected, then we impair it. And we did so this quarter on 11 securities for a total of $78.0 million pre-tax.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "In your 8-K that you filed on Friday you talked about your unregistered cash collateral pools and how you have been purchasing them and receiving them at one dollar NAV and that the average weighted net asset value was $0.955. Did that cost you any money to keep your customers at one dollar in terms of from a P&L statement, even though the value was about .955?", "Edward J. Resch", "No, it did not. That\u2019s a disclosure item in the NAV calculation. It is presented as part of our financial reporting to the customers of the program and if you recall, the program that we are talking about is one where we operate as agent in the securities lending business. So there is no financial impact to us in the quarter nor do we anticipate that there will be going forward.", "Operator", "This concludes our question and answer session.", "Ronald E.

Please go ahead. ", "S. Kelley MacDonald - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations", "Good morning everyone. Before Ron Logue, our Chairman and CEO and CFO Ed Resch begin their remarks, I'd like to remind you that during this call we may make forward-looking statements relating to the Corporation's business and financial goals, plans and prospects and its business environment among other things.

", "In addition, information relating to this webcast, including information concerning and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures referred to in this webcast is available in the Investor Relations section of our website www.statestreet.com/stockholder under the heading Annual Reports & Financial Trends. ", "Now I'll call... turn the call over to Ron. ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Kelly. Good morning everybody. At State Street, we again are reporting another strong quarter. We are meeting our long-term goals for growth in revenue, earnings per share, through achieving return on equity. Excluding the tax adjustments recorded in the second quarter of 2006, our record operating earnings per share grew 15% and our record revenue grew 16% in the second quarter of 2007. And we achieved 19.2% return on equity. ", "We once again achieved positive operating leverage on a sequential quarter basis, and when compared with the prior year's quarter. This marks the eleventh consecutive quarter in which we achieved positive operating leverage compared to the prior year's quarter. ", "We are leaders in fast growing markets, like hedge fund servicing and electronic trading. We continue to make progress in servicing hedge funds where our assets under administration are $242 billion, and when combined with Investors Financial are $441 billion on a pro forma basis. ", "Our recent acquisition of Currenex which generated significant trading services revenue this quarter, has given us the capability to offer executable streaming prices to the active trading segment of the Fx market, a fast growing segment. ", "As we said, more than two years ago, we expect to grow non-U.S. revenue to 50% of total revenue over time. For the full year 2006, 43% of State Street's revenue came from non-U.S. sources. ", "Our objective is to focus on high growth markets and exceed their rates of growth, which is certainly the case in Europe and Asia Pacific where our business is growing about twice as fast as it is in the United States. ", "For the second quarter, servicing fees, management fess and securities finance revenue all grew in double digits compared to the second quarter of 2006. Servicing fees at 12%, management fess at 22%, and securities finance revenue at 27%; all three were driven by new business from new and existing customers. ", "We won servicing awards for custody, fund accounting and fund administration from two large U.S. mutual funds, Baron's U.S. mutual funds representing $18 billion in assets as well as $12 billion from Fifth Third Bank's asset management group. SSgA's growth came primarily from new business, particularly in the area of quantitative active management. ", "Net interest revenue and net interest margin again performed very well, achieving a 44% increase in fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue compared to the second quarter of 2006 and a net interest margin of 164 basis points during the second quarter of 2007. And Ed will provide further details about these results and our outlook in a few minutes. ", "Trading services revenue increased slightly, up about 1% principally due to the revenue from the Currenex acquisition. As you may remember, trading services revenue in the second quarter of 2006 was its strongest quarter ever growing 53% compared to the second quarter of 2005. ", "On the expense side, we grew our expenses at a rate less than the rate of growth in revenue, which resulted in about a 130 basis points of positive operating leverage on a sequential quarter basis. We achieved positive operating leverage of about 90 basis points in the second quarter of 2007 compared to the second quarter of 2006, our eleventh consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage compared on this basis. ", "Now let me give you just a few new business highlights from the second quarter. On the servicing side, in addition to the awards from Baron Funds and the Fifth Third Bank asset management group, both of which I've already mentioned, HSBC Investments has appointed State Street to manage collateral for its institutional clients, managing and tracking collateralized transactions and providing a reporting service that enables clients to customize parameters including eligibility of collateral, mortuary claimants and concentration limits. ", "Now this collateral management service is a good example of the capabilities we gain when we make acquisitions. We inherited the original version of this service when we acquired the global security services business from Deutsche Bank who have offering this service to its customers in Europe. We have enhanced the service now and it's become a highly sought after by our customers as the role of derivatives plays a much more important role in day to day investment management. ", "I am sure we will find similar, less evident opportunities to enhance our product lines with the Investors Financial acquisition. We were also appointed to provide global custody accounting, independent swaps pricing and reconciliation services to the Somerfield Pension Scheme for \u00a3300,000 million in assets as well as performance measurement services from WM Performance Services, the European performance measurement division of State Street. ", "In Australia, we were awarded an assignment to service $12 billion with the New South Wale's workers' compensation insurer to provide custody, accounting performance and analytics as well as monitoring and reporting for this government agency. ", "Together with IFDS, our joint venture with DST which provides transfer agency and registrar services, State Street has been named the trustee, custodian, transfer agent and registrar responsible for the professional funds group of Montreal. The fund manages 1.9 billion Canadian. ", "State Street Global Advisors also added significant new business. In the second quarter of 2007, about 75% of SSgA's new business was in active management, enhanced indexing, hedge fund strategies and active quantitative management. Net new business at SSgA in the second quarter is $32 billion. ", "Also during the quarter, State Street Global Advisors, an offering what we call edge strategies reached the $10 billion level. These strategies, known as 130-30, offer investors some of the advantages of a hedge fund while continuing to remain closely tied to a benchmark. ", "As I said we're pleased to achieve a very strong first half of the year. The consolidation of Investors Financial is now well underway. We will track our progress each quarter through 2008, so you can evaluate our results just as we did with the Deutsche Bank transaction. ", "Looking into second half of the year, I'll remind you that we typically see a slowing in revenue from trading services as well as securities finance in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. At least that has been the case in the majority of past five years. However like last year, that does not stop us from seeking positive operating leverage on a prior year basis. ", "Let me now update you on the integration of Investors Financial. Since the announcement in February an experienced group of State Street employees has focused on the planned consolidation. Working with their colleagues from Investors Financial, they have brought together the two businesses as smoothly as possible and more importantly provided for a consolidation that is as seamless as possible for our customers. These two groups, now unified at State Street are continuing their work, meeting with customers, refining our plan for consolidation and implementing specific conversions. ", "One of the reasons that we're confident that this consolidation will be a success and a win for the customers is that we are retaining the key relationship managers who will continue to provide the high level of customer service that the customers of Investors Financial have been used to. As I announced last quarter, they will work under the direction of Mike Rogers, now an Executive Vice President of State Street and formerly the President and Chief Operating Officer of Investors Financial. ", "Investors Financial's unaudited results for the first six months of 2007 included annualized revenue growth of 18% and annualized expense growth of 15%. Based on both the strong results at State Street and at Investors Financial in the first half of 2007, we are now revising the financial goals we established in February after we announced the Investors Financial acquisition. ", "We now expect that revenue will grow between 20% and 22%. Excluding merger and integration charges, we expect that operating earnings per share growth will be between 10% and 15%. And that operating return on equity will be between 14% and 17%. ", "We also believe that we will perform in the upper half of these ranges for 2007. The EPS and ROE ranges excluding merger and integration charges are the original ranges we established in January before we announced the acquisition of Investors Financial. ", "Now as a reminder, our operating earnings per share in 2006 was $3.46. ", "Now I'll turn the call over to Ed who will provide some of the details of our financial performance as well as some details as to our expectations for the rest of the year. ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Thank you, Ron and good morning everybody. The first half of the year represents a good start for 2007. We reported strong growth in both fee and net interest income. Our growth in asset servicing, asset management and securities finance continues at a combined rate of about 14% compared to the first half of 2006. Securities finance was particularly strong, as is usually the case in the second quarter. We continue to expand globally, introducing new services to a broad base of customers. ", "We reported strong net interest revenue growth of 44% on a fully taxable equivalent basis, comparing the second quarter of 2007 with the second quarter of 2006. And on the same basis net interest revenue was up 18%, comparing the second quarter of 2007 with the first quarter of 2007. ", "Our net interest margin improved to 164 basis points in the second quarter, up 44 basis points from last year's quarter and up 19 basis points from the first quarter. Obviously the positive trends in our liabilities, I mentioned last quarter, continued into this quarter. I will provide more detail on our net interest income and margin in a few minutes. ", "We achieved positive operating leverage compared to the second quarter of 2006 as well as when comparing the second quarter of 2007 with the first quarter of 2007. The eleventh consecutive quarter, our assets under custody were at a record level for State Street at the end of the quarter. On a pro forma basis combined with Investors Financial, our assets under custody would be about $15 trillion at June 30, 2007. Our assets under management of $1.9 trillion also stood at a record level at the end of this quarter. We included the first and second quarter results for Investors Financial on page 3 of our financial trends package, which I encourage you to review on our website. ", "Based on those six months results, Investors Financial was operating at an annual run rate of about $940 million in revenue and about $660 million in expenses. Those figures represented annualized increase of about 18% in revenue and about 15% in expenses. As you may recall from Investors Financial's fourth quarter conference call, management at that time expected expenses to grow between 21% and 24% in 2007. The difference between the results of the first half and Investors Financial's management's expected increase in expenses is annualized at about $40 million in cost saves and cost avoidance after the acquisition was announced. As a result, our expectations are still that we will remove approximately $350 million from Investors Financial's cost base with approximately $310 million in annualized costs to be removed over the next 18 months. ", "I hope you find an opportunity to review our earnings press release distributed this morning. Please review the financial statements included with our earnings press release and in our financial trends package on our website for detailed information on our financial results. ", "Now to discuss our results. We reported earnings per share of $1.07 which were up 57% compared to $0.68 per share from the prior year quarter including the tax adjustments and up 15% excluding those adjustments. ", "Revenue totaled $1.9 billion for the quarter, an increase of 16.4% from last year's second quarter compared with the 15.5% increase in expenses to $1.4 billion. Return on equity was 19.2% compared with the return on equity from continuing operations of 14% including the tax adjustments and 19.2% excluding those adjustments. ", "Now I would like to discuss the details of our results compared with the prior year's second quarter. Servicing fees were up 12% to $766 million due to new business from existing and new global clients as well as higher daily average equity valuations. ", "Assets under custody at the end of the quarter were at a record of $13 trillion, up 20% from $10.9 trillion a year ago. State Street Global Advisors continues to post very strong results. Investment management fees were $284 million, up 22% due to new business and increases in month end equity valuations. ", "Performance fees were about $20 million, up from $16 million a year ago. Assets under management at the end of the quarter were at a record of $1.9 trillion, up 26% from $1.5 trillion a year ago. Compared to the second quarter of 2006, the month end averages for the S&P 500 in the second quarter of 2007 were up 17%, the EAFE was up 22% and the NASDAQ was up 16%. The Lehman U.S. aggregate total return index was a negative 0.52% at the end of the quarter. ", "Trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange trading and brokerage and other services, was up about 1% to $260 million. Weaker volatility partially offset by stronger volumes drove a 9% decline in foreign exchange trading revenue. Foreign exchange trading revenue was down $18 million to $174 million compared with a record quarter in 2006. ", "Brokerage and other fees were up $20 million to $86 million from the previous year's second quarter. This increase was primarily due to $16 million in fees from Currenex. Securities finance revenue was $162 million, up 27% from last year's second quarter due primarily to an increase on assets on loan. In the second quarter of this year, the average volumes of securities lent increased by more than 30% compared to a year ago and spreads were up slightly. ", "The processing fees and other revenue were down $9 million to $65 million primarily as a result of the consolidation of tax-exempt investments on to our balance sheet at the end of the third quarter of 2006, offset somewhat by income from joint ventures. The revenue resulting from this consolidation is now recorded in net interest revenue. ", "Net interest revenue on a fully-taxable equivalent basis increased $122 million or 44% from $275 million to $397 million. In addition, compared to the second quarter of 2006, net interest margin increased 44 basis points from 120 to 164 basis points. ", "The favorable trends that I cited during the first quarter call continued in the second quarter, higher levels and a favorable mix of customer deposits, a continued favorable non-US rate environment, a higher yield on reinvestments in our securities portfolio and a higher level of lower cost of funds. We increased the average size of the portfolio from $59.4 billion a year ago to $67.7 billion during the second quarter. ", "Mortgage backed securities in the second quarter of 2007 represented about 38% or $25.4 billion of the average investment portfolio. Floating rate asset backed securities in the second quarter of 2007 represented about 36% of the average investment portfolio or $424.4 billion. ", "On a pro forma basis, combined with Investors Financial approximately 43% of the portfolio will be in mortgage backed securities and also about 43% in floating rate securities. The total pro forma portfolio for the combined company would have been about $77 billion as of June 30, 2007. ", "The credit quality of the portfolio at June 30, 2007 has remained about the same as at last year-end, 94% is invested in AAA or AA rated securities. As of June 30, 87% was invested in AAA and 7% in AA related securities. As I mentioned, previously the credit quality of the portfolio will remain relatively unchanged following the consolidation with Investors Financial. ", "Now, I will provide more detail on comparable expenses. Salaries and benefits expenses were $808 million, up 18% from $684 million last year, largely attributable to the impact of incentive compensation due to our improved performance, increased staffing to support new business and acquisitions, and myriad adjustments. ", "Transaction processing expenses increased to $141 million, up 5% due to the increased volumes in the asset servicing business. ", "Other expenses were up 37% at $183 million, due primarily to costs associated with new business initiatives, the acquisitions of Currenex and Investors Financial and increased sales promotional expense. ", "I'll remind you that we calibrated this expense line to match our strong growth in revenue this quarter. Our expectations are that other operating expenses for State Street alone in the second half of 2007 should be consistent with the average of the first two quarters this year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 35%. ", "Let me give you some of the headlines regarding the results of the second quarter compared to this year's first quarter. Revenue was $1.9 billion, up 13.3% or $225 million, compared to $1.7 billion in the first quarter with increases in every line on the income statement except processing fees and other revenues. ", "Expenses were $1.4 billion, up about 12% or $145 million. Earnings per share of $1.07 in the second quarter were up 15% compared to $0.93 per share in the first quarter of 2007. ", "Servicing fees were $766 million, up 7% due to new business and improvement in daily average equity valuations. Management fees of $284 million were up 9% due to new business and improvement in month-end equity valuations. ", "Trading Services revenue was up 18% this quarter compared to the first quarter of 2007 from $220 million to $260 million. This increase was driven by improved volumes in foreign exchange trading, offset partially by lower volatility plus the effect of Currenex in the quarter. ", "Securities finance revenue was up 65% to $162 million from $98 million due primarily to an increase in spreads as well as seasonal demand. The duration of the lending book stands at 35 days at quarter end. ", "Processing fee and other revenue were down 11% or $8 million to $65 million due to lower revenue from leasing and structured products, offset partially by increased income from joint ventures. ", "Net interest revenue and net interest margin improved due to the continuing benefit from execution of our balance sheet strategy as well as continued growth in non-U.S. businesses. As a result, our net interest revenue on a fully-taxable equivalent basis increased by 18% from $337 million to $397 million compared to the first quarter, and net interest margin improved 19 basis points to 164 basis points. ", "We continue to benefit from our non-U.S. growth and the continued favorable non-U.S. interest rate environment, as well as a higher level of free funds. Also our investment portfolio strategies continue to contribute to growth in net interest revenue through portfolio repricing. ", "We issued $1.5 billion of debt during the quarter, $800 million in trust preferred and $700 million in senior debt. We also called for redemption, $500 million or outstanding trust preferred securities in June. ", "I said on last quarter's conference call that, if the current trends we saw continued, we expect our net interest margin for 2007 to be above 135 basis points. Since the trends continued and in fact, improved in the second quarter, we now believe we will be above that level for all of 2007, more likely in the range of 155 basis points. ", "Our transaction deposits are running at historically high levels and non-U.S. rates continue to rise, a favorable factor for us. In addition, U.S. rates have remained steady for a year now. ", "We have experienced these favorable trends for three quarters now, and I am comfortable relying on them in providing this outlook. However we are still cautious about this sustainability over the long term. ", "Also last quarter I was asked about our asset backed securities in the investment portfolio that are backed by sub-prime mortgages. Since there has been continuing interest in that subject, let me add some color. ", "First of all, these are securities that have been issued with sub-prime mortgages as collateral, and they are 78% AAA rated and 22% AA rated. They have performed very well, and the current ratio is down from 80% AAA and 20% AA in the first quarter, reflects the AAA rated securities paid outs. We have an average dollar price of just over par approximating book value at the end of June. And for each vintage year from 2003 to 2006, we have significantly outperformed the Moody's performance data. In addition, the securities have an average 36% credit enhancement on them versus a 5% to 8% historical cumulative loss experienced in the marketplace. ", "So what that means is that, even if losses were to double, we still have more than twice as much cushion than it's needed to protect ourselves from losses in this position. So we are very comfortable in terms of our entire asset backed position as well as the position that is backed by the sub-prime mortgages. We don't expect any significant negative financial outcomes due to this element from our investment portfolio. ", "Regarding net interest revenue, just a few points to keep in mind, our duration gap has not changed significantly from year end. Our assets are about 1.2 years and our liabilities are about 10 months in duration. ", "The investment portfolio is about 1.7 years in duration, flat for the second quarter of 2006 and up from 1.5 years at March 31st, 2007. On a pro forma basis, combined with Investors Financial, the duration of our investment portfolio would have been about 1.6 years. ", "In the second quarter, operating expenses increased 12% from $1.2 billion in the first quarter. Salaries and benefits increased 9%. Transaction processing was up 9%. Information systems & communications were up 2%. Occupancy was up 4% and other expenses were up 45%, primarily as a result of increases in costs associated with new business initiatives, the acquisitions of Currenex and Investors Financial and increased securities processing expenses. Return on equity was 19.2%, up from 17.4% in the first quarter, ", "Let me share with you our plans and outlook relative to capital. In order to protect our regulatory ratios as I mentioned earlier, we have not repurchased any of our stock during the last twelve months due to the adjustments to equity we reported in the fourth quarter of last year and in the first quarter of 2007. Also which we have previously disclosed and which amounted to $390 million after-tax. Additionally we have had to consider the impact of the recent acquisitions of Currenex and Investors Financial in our thinking. ", "We issued about 61 million shares of State Street common stock to Investors Financial shareholders on July 2. Also, as we have said previously, we intend to repurchase about $1 billion worth of our common stock after the Investors Financial closing. ", "The principal capital ratio that we managed to was the Tier 1 leverage ratio. We will continue to target between 5.25% and 5.75% but from time to time maybe above that level if prudence dictates. At June 30, our Tier 1 leverage ratio stands at 6.06% and our tangible common equity ratio is 4.83%. ", "In conclusion, the first half of the year represented a very good start for us. We're continuing to balance growth in revenue against our expenses so as to achieve positive operating leverage on an annual basis. We have revised our expectations for the financial performance of State Street this year due to the performance of Investors Financial in the second quarter and in particular, the strong year-to-date performance of State Street. We are confident about performing the upper half of the revised ranges for all of 2007. ", "With that, I'll turn the call back to Ron. ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Ed. Well we now begin the second half of 2007 with strong first half results from both State Street and Investors Financial and with our plans for consolidation of Investors Financial well underway. We have confidence that we will meet the financial targets we established today, two of which EPS and ROE, were our original financial targets before the Investors Financial acquisition, while the revenue goal has been significantly increased. And again as we have said we believe we will perform in the upper half of these ranges. ", "We have received excellent feedback from customers with whom we are planning conversions. We have added employees to State Street who have been recognized for their customer service and who will contribute to our ongoing success. The acquisition strengthened our lead in our high growth businesses such as services to mutual funds, hedge funds, offshore funds and investment manager operations outsourcing. And we have added the capability to service private equity investments. ", "I'd ask you to also keep in mind our long-term objectives. First, to generate non-US revenue of 50% of total revenue over time. While our overall growth is strong, our growth in Europe and Asia continues to outpace of the US. We strengthened our leadership in the past year in non-US locations and those investments are paying off. With the acquisition of Investors Financial, we expect to begin offering our global services to those customers who previously went elsewhere. ", "Second, to make SSgA a larger contributor to State Street's bottom line. SSgA continues to execute on its strategy of adding quantitative active investment strategies for both new and existing customers which is paying off in growth, in revenue and profits. ", "And third, to prudently work our balance sheet harder. With our net interest revenue and net interest margin up significantly over the past two years, I hope you will agree we are successfully executing on this objective. ", "Now Ed and I would be happy to take your questions at this time. ", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator instructions]. We will take our first question from Glenn Schorr with UBS. ", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "Thanks. Okay, so can I just check what is in the... maybe for Ed... what's in the other expense bucket that would cause a big spike? And I am just trying to get my arms around such great revenue growth across the board and expense growth almost keeping pace. I just want to see, how much is in there related to maybe, Currenex IFIN or any discretionary spending if you could? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Okay Glenn, as I said, we tried this quarter given our view of very strong revenue to calibrate our expenses accordingly. So we have some discretionary spending in there as well as some elements of expense related to the acquisition. Nothing in it of itself is significant or material if you will, but we have acquisition-related clause both for Currenex and Investors Financial. We booked a fair amount of goodwill associated with Currenex and intangibles and there is amortization associated with the intangibles that will be in the run rate for the next number of years. ", "We increased professional services expenses for new business initiatives, really across the company. We spent some money... in info technology, treasury, global securities lending and certain marketing expenses and then lastly the other broad categories, sales promotion. We ramped up our sales effort this quarter given the strength in revenue. So nothing in it of itself is significant but if you add them up and... that's what we did in recognition of the strong revenue picture. I think that my comments going forward for the next two quarters would give you an indication of where our thinking is. Again given our forecast for the rest of the year, in terms of the other expense line being in the range of about $150 million per quarter and that's State Street standalone that's not including IFIN. ", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "Perfect. Exactly what I was looking for. Other... only other question I really have is, so you continue to see good growth in the non-U.S. deposits. And I guess the ability to lag deposit pricing as rates rise. The question I have is, how did the rate go down by 36 basis points in the quarter? In other words, if you look at the interest rate paid on... on interest-bearing non-U.S. deposits. Just interesting, it's great. But it's interesting. ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yes, that's really just the function of the mix Glenn. The mix of the deposits drive that result. ", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "Okay. So is it... is it something that you can influence or is that a function of that's what type of deposits, customers are bringing to you? In other words... ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "It's much more of the latter. I mean, it depends, what form the deposits come in as to the extent to which we can lag or not lag. ", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "Okay, okay. Just... I guess, difficult for us to project but I understand it and appreciate. Thanks. ", "Operator", ": We will take our next question from Mike Mayo with Deutsche Bank. ", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning. ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi Mike. ", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "I didn't fully understand your last answer. It's... you are finding costs in $50 billion and non-U.S. deposits are down 36 basis points. And is there some sort of compensating balances you're getting through the processing business or anything else going on there? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "No Mike, this is Ed. It is as I said a function of mix and you have to get a little bit deeper into that number to recognize that. About 25% of it as of this quarter end is euro-dollar. So it's dollar-based liabilities. And then we have a swap on against some of the residual back into U.S. dollars. So it really is just a function of what the liability mix is at any given quarter as to what we are paying. ", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "And with regard to non-U.S., I guess you had 6% linked quarter growth in assets under custody. What was that growth outside U.S. only... U.S. versus non-U.S.? ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It wasprobably a little more than 50% outside the U.S., Mike. ", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. So revenue growth linked quarter was it stronger outside U.S. and how much? ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, we have been seeing that, although recently, citing that the winds of that I just talked about. We've seen I think a resurgence in U.S. growth, particularly in the mutual fund arena. ", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And why do you think that is a resurgence in mutual funds in the U.S.? ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think there is more interest in outsourcing and mutual funds in the past had probably done a lot of the accounting themselves and let out custody to more general custodians. And now that there are fewer organizations who can do both custody and accounting, it's becoming apparent that, if they want to do that there aren't so many places they can go to get that done especially not with the IFIN consolidation. ", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "And then lastly it looks like you are guiding higher by almost 3% to 4% versus consensus. ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. ", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "And is that because you are feeling better about IFIN because you are feeling better about State Street standalone or both? ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Both. I mean like we said before that these two organizations are mirror images of each other and that's playing out. ", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "And your retention target for IFIN? ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "90%. ", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "And... ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Revenue. ", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "Are you feeling better about that or...? ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Feeling very good about it. ", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And what about the Barclays contract, can you give us an update on that or when would we get an update? ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we are servicing them today. ", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And will there be a change in that or an update or just business as usual? ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Not that I know about. I think there're going to be a lot of... I am sure there are going to be organizations that they are going to look to do things. ", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "All right. ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "But as I am talking to you today, no one has told us they are leaving. ", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. All right, thanks. ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Okay. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Wewill take our next question from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. ", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research LLC", "Good morning guys. ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning. ", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research LLC", "Ed, question for you. I guess unlike everybody else now on net interest margin, a sort of question in my head and going how high is up. Is there sort of a structural limitation to margin here or can it continue to advance this way? And if you could just sort of drill down into that number a little bit because I am adjusting by leaps and bounds here and I am trying to figure out whether I should continue to do that. ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Right. I think probably the best way to think about that is to go back to what I said in February, when we made some comments about '07 through '09 in terms of net interest margin. And there are really, I guess three elements to what I said. One is the investment portfolio and what we're doing on the asset side. The other is our forecast of rates and the third was our liability behavior. And I'd say that from what we've said in February to what we are seeing now we got the first two pretty much right. The investment portfolio on the asset side has behaved as we thought, and our rate prognostication has been pretty good, maybe even a little bit too conservative in that foreign rates have gone up a little more than what we thought. But the big change from what I said earlier and now and what we are thinking about at least the rest of this year is the liability behavior of our customers. And what we are seeing is stronger equity markets and higher volumes and significantly above trend deposits especially in transaction accounts for us. So what we are seeing at least through the rest of the year, Nancy is a continuation of that strength, which is one of the reasons or the main driver of why I said 155 would be the full year margin. But I do have an element of caution to it saying that these balances can be potentially volatile to some degree. ", "So, we are cautious. I am not updating '08 and '09 at this point. I will probably have some more comments about our outlook for '08 and '09 and update my February comments in September. I don't think that there is an answer to the structural margin question that you posed. I think that, we know, we have seen the liability behavior improve fairly significantly for us. And like I said before, if it continues to improve, we will continue to show a greater margin. Right now, we are seeing out to the end of the year in a 155 margin for the full year. ", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research LLC", "Right. Ron, just a quick question for you. One of your competitors has involved in a very large merger, apparently is doing custody business for free at this point. And you have not responded to that pricing. Can you just tell us how customers are responding to this and how you are responding to those pressures? ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. I guess, probably the best way I could say it Nancy is that the customers seek value. It's all about value. It's not about price. And to the extent that we provide added value, I think customers see through that long term. As you know, we have a policy of not doing things for free, not relying on other types of promises of revenue. I don't... I think in long term it's the wrong thing to do. I can cite lots of examples of the business that we lost against biz that were for free where those customers came back. I think we're going to continue to do that. It's really about value. We're going to keep that strategy. It has worked in the past. I believe we'll continue to work in the future. I am sure that we may lose some pieces of business that were zero price bids. That's going to be okay. The business that we are winning, we are winning because people see value. And I believe strongly the value will win over price. ", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research LLC", "Can you point to one product or... in the delivery value, I mean, I understand the concept. But is their a product or a quality of the company or some thing that tends to be the hook there that keeps that business? ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, generally speaking, it probably has to do with some type of accounting components, whether it's daily price mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity, offshore funds. It usually surrounds accounting, because it's much higher degree of difficulty to do and it's very expensive. I think it's one of the reasons why you see a number of organizations outsourcing that because it's getting more difficult and much more complex. Obviously, the emergence of derivatives are a good example of that. It's why we bought Investors Financial because of the strong accounting capability. There are a very few organizations out there who can do it and who can do it at scale. And I think that the real secret there is doing it at a scale and we can, and they can, and not too many others can. And the value is around different types of accounting components. And then from there, there are selective as we call it cross-sell revenue that comes from that. ", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research LLC", "All right. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We will take our next question from Brian Bedell. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Hi thanks, good morning. ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi Brian. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Just to go back on the non-interest margin question I guess, it's on the fund deposit line. So you would not expect that 329 costs to be sustainable, right? I mean that should be trending back up to a level of at least near what it was in the first quarter, in the second half? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Well I mean, I think it depends Brian on what happens with fund rates. I mean the longer that rates continue going up in non-U.S. terms, the longer we have to lag. And in actuality what happened in the second quarter is that our lag lengthened a bit which contributed to another element of our positive results before net interest revenue, net interest margin. But eventually, at some point when rates stop, there will be a rate... the non-U.S. rates stop going up, there will be a cessation of our ability to lag and they'll catch up. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Right. But it sounds like you answered earlier, most of that was due to the mix shift, you got just a bunch of deposits in a much, much lower cost, given I guess those customer preferences of the services. So I guess, what I am asking for the third quarter, is that sort of mix shift in aberration for the second quarter? Do you think those lower cost deposits stick around in the second half? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "I mean we are seeing or we expect to see a continuation of the favorable trends that I have talked about now for the first two quarters of this year continuing into the second half, which is why we increased our full year margin to 155. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then if you think a better way... no, I know you're not updating your estimates yet, but before we had... I think you had an '09 target of 150 at that time was 15 to 20 basis points higher than where you were operating at. Should we consider, if we had the same type of trends that you have been... that we are seeing right now and if that increase over the next two years was driven really by the reinvestment yields on the portfolio, which is very predictable. Then should we think of you guys getting to suitably 165, 170 by '09? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Well, again I don't want to go into '08 and '09 yet, but your basic thesis I think is correct. If I go back to the buildup to the discussion we had in February, which is, we were correct or closely correct on both the asset side and the rate side. If you remember, we forecast rates staying constant both dollar and non-dollar rates for '07, '08, '09 in that workup. So the one big swing factor in the analysis so far has been the liability behavior. And if in fact the liabilities continue to exhibit more favorable characteristics in '08 and '09 than what we modeled them on, yes, we will do better than what we said in February for '08 and '09. That's clearly what's occurred here in the first half of this year and why we are saying what we are saying about all of '07. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "All right, great. And then you also mentioned when you... before you guys closed the IFIN merger, when IFIN came on, they were doing some things also on the deposit side and having sort of some lower deposit costs than you did. That effect is not in the second quarter '07 I assume and so when IFIN comes on there are potential... I think you can do to lower the organization capacity costs, is that correct? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "That's right. And just to round that out, when we modeled revenue attrition in the deal we thought that we would be able offset that in total by bringing some of those lower cost IFIN deposits on. So the net effect between revenue, attrition and the uptick in our net interest revenue would be about a push, we sampled in the deal model. So yes, we expect we'll be able to what we've planned relative to IFIN's treasury function and that's all reflected in our thinking about IFIN's improved performance versus what we had modeled back in February. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Right. And then in terms of your guidance, it would imply just by going back to sort of what you were pre-IFIN that and I guess, in some ways you could say, there is very limited IFIN dilution in the second half. Should we think about it that way? We were at $0.14 dilution for the second half. I know, you got stronger trends in both which is in the market backdrop but... ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "I wouldn't say that our model is certainly not for no IFIN dilution in the second half. We are modeling a slight improvement to that $0.14 number that we put forth back when we announced the deal. But it's not zero. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Right. So it's mostly market. The fact that market's been a lot better really, right? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yes. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Great. And then, so you would expect IFIN to be accretive in '08, instead of mutual earnings in '08. Is that correct? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yes, probably better than breakeven, which what we had said when we announced the deal. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "All right. Okay and just on the cost of servicing fee line that went up a little bit more than I was expecting, anything unusual in that this quarter with HSBC in that this quarter? Is that on a go forward basis? ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "No. It's just... it's just, it's both singles and doubles that keep coming. ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yes,I mean we had good market, Brian and we had good net new business generation and if you put those two together then you have a 12% year-over-year increase. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Right, so HSBC is yet to come in, right? ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Correct. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Or are they coming in the second half? ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Correct. It's right in the second quarter. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Is it the second half? Or when are you getting... ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Second half. Yes. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Second half. Okay. And then and TIAA-CREF [ph] for the securities lending, it was how much of that was in the second quarter? ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I am going to say it, half... a little more than half, has been coming in over time. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. So you still have some to go in the third quarter? ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Little bit, yes. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Right. And then just naturally second quarter is seasonally strong for safe landing but how much of... and I guess not in precise numbers, but I guess I am looking for... what kind of drop we should expect in the third quarter? Was there a substantial amount that was sort of driven by just the higher interest in borrowing securities that you are not related to the tax dividend arbitrages in the second quarter? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Most of the spread this quarter Brian was demand spread. So, yes, I mean I think the broad answer to your question is yes. The seasonality of it, I mean, I point you back to prior years and look at what we have done. It's ranged from 20% down to 45% down on a sequential quarter basis, so... ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "All right. I'd just look at history. All right. Okay. Just one last time on the sub-prime... both the asset back booked, it's like $24 billion, $25 billion, the sub-prime portion of that's like $8 billion, is that correct? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "About seven. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "$7 billion. ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Little over $7 billion. We had about $1 billion in pay down from Q1 to Q2 and that's why the AAA percentage went from 80% to 78%. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Right. And do you expect that to wind down substantially over the near to intermediate term? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "I'd say over the intermediate term. Again assuming we didn't do anything else to the position. Yes over the next couple of years. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Great. Thanks very much. ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Brian. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We will take our next question from Lori Appelbaum with Goldman Sachs. ", "Lori Appelbaum - Goldman Sachs", "That you have already done and plan to do and on the buyback front, what's the pace that you expect to get the billion dollars of shares of... the billion dollars of potential shareholder purchases out? Do you expect to do an accelerated share purchase program or something slower pace over the coming quarters? ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Lori just to let you know, we didn't hear the first part. I think we are going to answer the buyback piece. But what was the first part? ", "Lori Appelbaum - Goldman Sachs", "Ed mentioned strategies in plan to maximize the capital structure. ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. ", "Lori Appelbaum - Goldman Sachs", "That you're doing and along those lines, I was wondering the pace that you are likely to buy back shares whether an accelerated program's likely or something slower pace over the coming quarters. ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Well Lori, we haven't specifically announced what our plans are. It could be an accelerated share purchase program. It could be something else. When we have something to say, we will make an announcement, and tell you what we are doing. But I would expect that no matter what we do, we will get the billion dollar buyback done by the end of this year. ", "Lori Appelbaum - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. So wondered, it's either very rapid or fairly rapid. ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yes. I mean if you consider over six months, we deal with that. ", "Lori Appelbaum - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Fairly rapid. ", "Lori Appelbaum - Goldman Sachs", "Okay.And then I know there have been a number of questions on the margin, just one more. It seems to me that there's a fair amount of conservatism in your outlook for 155 margin, because that implies a decline versus the second quarter and client flows are still strong. And Ron mentioned the goal of becoming more international and working the balance sheet harder. If you could just comment on that. ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well I want to give myself a little bit of room on the downside. I did say that the flows... the client flows while they had been strong, can be volatile. I think that in the past we have seen some decline certainly on a sequential quarter basis for these types of deposit flows. The second quarter was extremely strong with a 164 margin. I just want to be conservative in my outlook for the year. I don't want to set a bar too high and then disappoint. I think 155 for the full year is our best thinking right now as to where we're going to be. ", "Lori Appelbaum - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Banc of America. ", "Kenneth Usdin - Bank of America", "Thanks. Good morning. Okay, Ed just one more on the margin. Earlier in the year you had said that you had about $10 billion of the low yielding or low spread securities rolling off the books. I am just wondering how much of that is already rolled off and how much of is it to come. ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "About half of it's done so far. It was fairly linear throughout the year. If you remember we said we had about $10 billion this year, $6 billion next year and $4 billion in '09 and about half of that $10 billion has matured already. ", "Kenneth Usdin - Bank of America", "And what's the incremental pickup you're getting on kind of stuffs that's rolling off versus your... what you are able to reinvest that at? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "200 basis points. ", "Kenneth Usdin - Bank of America", "Okay. Great. Second question relative to the IFIN deal, I was wondering if you could just give us a little update on both the revenue synergy side and then I have a question about the expense side. On the revenue synergies, you had said you originally expected a kind of a wash of net revenue synergies. From what it sounds is that you're very confident on the retention side, and I am wondering if you could also just talk about the synergy side. Any recognition that you're expecting kind of, off the bat here, how quick and is that net zero, net revenue synergy, in fact, got approved to be quite conservative at the end of the day. ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Ken, this is Ron, it could be, I think it's still too early to tell. We really haven't got into the to the cross-sell piece, which I think is, a lot of it's going to be non-U.S. I think as we are sitting here today, we are probably ahead of our schedule in terms of revenue retention. I think we... in terms of the deal model we assumed that we would have lost some revenue at this point which we haven't. So, to the extent that we can be as successful as we were with Deutsche in cross-sell, which I think we can bring the balances on book here, which we are going to do and continue to be successful in revenue retention. We probably will do better than what we thought in the deal model. ", "Kenneth Usdin - Bank of America", "Okay. And then on the expense side Ed, to your earlier point you said obviously you would initially use the $700 million expense cost base horizon. It's now run rating at $660 million; that includes what's typically a higher second quarter number I would think given the seasonality. So can you just update us relative to the phase-in that you expect? If you're still keeping to your dollar amount over time, can you update us on how you expect phase-in to occur over the second half of this year and then into '08? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yes, we are still expecting the expense reduction to occur in line with the conversions broadly Ken. So our plan right now calls for us to be around 25% completed by the end of the 2007 and approximately 85% to 90% completed by the end of 2008. So the expense reduction and relatively the M&I charges that were merger integration charges that we were talking about incurring will broadly follow that timeline based on our modeling right now. ", "Kenneth Usdin - Bank of America", "So if you kind of gotten 40 out already, just because of the cost avoidance and some in early synergies and you are expecting to get a fourth of 350 that means, in the second half, we've got about plus or minus 50 million bucks to come in to the... on a cost save basis? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yes approximately. ", "Kenneth Usdin - Bank of America", "Okay. Okay, great. As far as... and the last question is just on the... salary line continues to grow faster than the rate of revenues. I think it was 18% this year... this quarter year-over-year versus 16% on the revenue side. And I am just wondering if... is there also incremental spending that you've made either in the hiring side or related to the deals? Could you just give us some more color on why some of the kind of 100% margin stuff like NII isn't falling more directly to the bottom line, especially as it relates to the salaries line? ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Ken this is Ron. One thing I could say is that we added about 400 people in headcount due to the acquisitions. When you add Currenex, Putnam, the primary [ph] group, it's about 400 people into the salary line when you look at that year-over-year. ", "Kenneth Usdin - Bank of America", "Butthat is as it comes with the related revenues, so. ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yes. ", "Kenneth Usdin - Bank of America", "So, why don't we see positive operating leverage related to the salary line then? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Well I think that the main driver of that increase Ken is the incentive compensation associated with the overall higher level of performance. You have to remember that our money management business, which you know has performed very well. SSgA has an incentive scheme which rewards them for performance as do the other performance... incentive performance programs in the company. But when you look at... the business being up 23% year-over-year that's going to drive the level of incentive comp commensurate with that performance. And then you put on top of that the rest of the company's performance which has been very good also. You get incentive comp levels which drive the increase in the line that you're referring to, which are higher than the total revenue growth you alluded to. ", "Kenneth Usdin - Bank of America", "Got it. And I am sorry, one more follow-up just on the deal again. On IFIN, is there any... is any of the margin guidance for the second half related to picking up IFIN like either funding the buyback or anything related? So, you know all things equal, I would kind of agree with the prior questions that would seem that if your trends continue that the margin should kind of stay in the 160s. So is there anything in there that's also related to the deal that, that would pull it down in the second quarter? Is that already considered in the kind of the current margin? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "That's all in comment Ken, it considers everything. ", "Kenneth Usdin - Bank of America", "So I am just asking is there an impact from IFIN on the margin in the second half? That's a negative at all because of the deal or financing related to the deal. ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "IFIN standalone, no, but if you put the IFIN deal related costs and including the financing that we talked about, the buyback of stock, yes. ", "Kenneth Usdin - Bank of America", "Right, that's what I am getting at. So I am just wondering... that's what I am wondering. So on a standalone basis, both margins might be held together, but that's what I am asking, is what the incremental drag from the deal on the margin from the deal costs? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "We have the financing expenses associated with the issuance of the billion dollars of securities. I don't have that number off the top of my head is in terms of margin points but that's reflected in our comments on the 155 margin for the full year. ", "Kenneth Usdin - Bank of America", "Okay. ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "All right? But standalone again State Street and IFIN are above that given that there is a dilutive effect to the margin for the financing. ", "Kenneth Usdin - Bank of America", "Right, that's an important point. Okay, got it, thank you. ", "Operator", "Next question comes from Tom Mccrohan with Janney Montgomery. ", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Hi, Good Morning. ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Good morning. ", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Quick question. Sorry to keep asking the same question on net interest margin. But I think, earlier Ed, you said 25% of your foreign client deposits was dollar based. So I have to say that would imply 75% of your funding is non-dollar based. But most of if not all, I would think of your investment securities are dollar based. So are you benefiting of the yield on foreign client deposits benefiting at all, from the weak U.S. dollar? Or any type of derivatives associated with currency? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Well overall, we are benefiting by the weaker dollar from a revenue perspective by percentage point or so in total. And that applies also to the net interest revenue. Your premise that all of the investments associated with those deposits are in U.S. dollars is not correct though. We have about 25% or about $15 million equivalent in placements. So those are like currencies. ", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "We will move the percentage that we slop back into U.S. versus investing in non-dollar currencies based on our view of where the best opportunities are. But overall there is a benefit to the tune of about a percentage point in terms of growth year-over-year given the weaker dollar, again on a year-over-year basis principally driven again by the strength in the euro and the strength in the pound. ", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "All right. Do you hedge the risk associated with the net interest margin from currency or is it not hedged at all? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "No, we don't hedge. ", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "We don't hedge and I'd just point out just to clarify that overall from the company's perspective, our revenue and expenses are pretty well matched as the currencies. So there is no net exposure that we're hedging. Our revenue is in like currencies as our expenses with a couple of minor exceptions in our offshore centers. ", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. How much of Currenex revenues were in foreign exchange this quarter and I apologize for you to disclose that? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "None. It's in other trading. ", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Other trading. Okay. And did you disclose the dollar amount what that was? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yes, I said $16 million in the quarter, revenue. ", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "$16 million. Thank you. And in connection with how incentive comp is paid in debt line. Is anyone in your organization incentivized or paid an incentive payment for the improvement in net interest income? Is anyone like one to one... I know overall performance, everyone to some extent is benefited but there is people salvage structure type in net interest income goal? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yes. There is nobody or no group directly that's incentivized on the basis of improving net interest income. That's a very... it's a very complicated relationship in terms of the value of our deposits and what the treasury group does on the investment side given the constraints we self impose. And the largest of those is that we want to run certain regulatory ratios and maintain a AA long-term debt rating. I would say that the corporate staff, if you will, which I put treasury is paid on the basis of overall corporate EPS. So, there is an indirect linkage to how well the treasure group does and how much that improves EPS for the company, but no body is directly incented to generate net interest revenue in the sense I think your question implies. ", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Yes, yes I wouldn't think that it will be. And I guess the reason I asked is you guys have done a tremendous job of generating operating leverage. It's just sequentially, I know you had such a good sequential pop in net interest income this quarter but you also had a pretty big sequential pop in staff expenses. So I am wondering if it were not for sequential increase in net interest income this quarter which you still have generated positive operating leverage. And then if payments... incentive payments were tied to the NIIs and the answer will be well yes. But if it's not how much discretion did you have but you have throttled back to growth on staff costs this quarter to generate positive operating leverage if you didn't have the pop in NII. ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Well, I mean not all of the staff costs that are in the salaries and benefits line relate to the treasury group. As we said, I mean that covers the whole company obviously and the performance of the entire company led by the money management business or is one of the largest drivers of the increase in that line. So I think, if you are looking for... looking at staff costs going up and linking that to treasury and net interest revenue I think that's not the right way to think about it. ", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "No, what I am trying to link to it is your ability to manage the operating leverage. If your staff costs are growing as you said at the average of what it is in the first half, say 70% in the second half and NII is not going to keep growing at the same rate, maybe will. Can you still manage positive operating leverage if you don't have the same NII benefits in the second half? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "We think so. Yes, I mean the discretion that we had and the calibration I referred to earlier was a not in the salary line for the most part. It was in the other expense line where we spent the money this quarter on sales promotion and professional fees and things like that, that I have already spoken about. So yes, we try to calibrate our discretionary expense spent in a quarter to our revenue picture. ", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Yes, okay. And one last question and I will drop off, on the Investors Financial deal model that you guys put together. Did you incorporate? I mean, did your accretion/dilution analysis and retention rate assumptions... an assumption that you're going to be offering any type of price concessions to the existing Investors Financial clients to retain them? ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We included that in the aggregate Tom, in terms of assuming that we would retain 90% of the current revenue at the time whether that is either lost revenue or price concessions. ", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Got you. Thanks very much. ", "Operator", "And your next question from Robert Lee with KBW. ", "Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Thanks. Good Morning. I had quick questions on asset management. And I apologize if I missed this, the comments from before but can you give us some color on specifically, what products are driving some of the unique business trends there? And also geographically where you're seeing that... is that also predominantly outside U.S.? That's first question. ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Rob, this is Ron. Lot of obviously is coming from active. But I think as we said that the 130/30 product is becoming a fast growing product. We have got $10 billion now, probably one of the fastest growing products we have had. Geographically again like in the servicing business a lot from outside the United States. Very, very strong growth rates. ", "Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Okay. And was there any meaningful performance fees in the quarter in the revenue? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "About $20 million Rob. ", "Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "And just gelling on your new business products. Are you starting... are more those... I am assuming that more of those have a performance fee component, although, I guess, 130/30 typically doesn't. ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yes, yes I mean, I think probably the way to think about it is that the element of performance fees has roughly doubled over the last couple of years from 3%, 4% of their average revenue to... of the money management businesses average revenue to maybe 8% or 9%. On an annual basis. So around double. ", "Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Sure. You expect that kind of trend giving you, where you see the mix going to, probably, continue for a while? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Well, yes but I am not sure, why I am willing to say that it will double by next year. I think our trend and our emphasis has been to grow on the active business. And I think we are continuing to do that. But given the passive core, I don't think it could get to the level of, maybe, some of our competitors, on a percentage basis. ", "Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Okay. And one last question and I am sure we will see this when the Q comes out, but, is it possible just to get a feel for of the positive operating leverage in quarter? Was that... was a lot of that driven by the asset management business, just given the strong revenue growth even though obviously, incentive comp there is going to be up... is that what you are seeing a lot of the incremental operating leverage comes from? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "We are seeing it across both of the segments. It's not in any one particular segment and I would point out that most of the net interest revenue that is one of the largest drivers of our growth is it accrues to the asset servicing business as we presented in the 10-Q. The asset management business, it doesn't get a lot of benefit from net interest revenue. ", "Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Okay, great. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason Goldberg with Lehman Brothers. ", "Jason Goldberg - Lehman Brothers", "It's been answered. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We will take our final question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, Good morning. On the assets under custody line and obviously you talked a little bit about the growth. Is there any way you can just talk about how net inflows from... in our new business or increased business from existing customers impacted your growth year-on-year, Q on Q relative to prior quarters? ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "That's yes... obviously there was some net inflow growth, a lot of it was net new business however. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then the insurance and other product line within AuC has been stepping up the growth rate pretty nicely there. Could you talk about some of the drivers and outlook? ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, a couple of years ago, we made a concerted effort to really focus on the insurance industry, both outside the United States and inside the United States and we have made some, I think real progress there. Especially as you look at how the pension field is evolving and how insurance companies are playing a more active role there, I would expect that, that will continue to fuel the assets under custody growth, going forward. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then just one for Ed on the mortgage securities portfolio that you were talking about with regard to the AAA rated tranches. Are any of those AAA securities, CDOs that have within them sub-prime or not? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "We have no CDOs that have sub-prime backing them. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. So all your CDOs are AAA tranches within CDOs? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "All of our.... virtually all, 98% of our CDOs are AAA, 2% are AA. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then you mentioned the credit protection? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Right. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "I mean I was just feeling... I am just trying to understand, what kind of credit protection you are talking about? ", "Edward J. Resch - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Well it's quoted in terms of the... the percentage of the underlying mortgages that could default before the asset backed security or the CDO would experience a problem. So, when I say we have 36% credit enhancement, that means the 36% of the mortgage is underlying the securities we have, could default before it worked its way up to our AAA level of protection. And I quote that against the 5% to 8% cumulative loss experience. So you can see that we have in the range of 5 times the level of protection that we feel we need in these security positions. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thanks. ", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ron Logue for any additional or closing remarks. ", "Ronald E. Logue - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well,thank you very much. I have no further remarks and we look forward to talking to you again, next quarter. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. That does conclude today's presentation.

During the quarter, we saw the spread between the rates paid oncommercial paper issued by the conduits and the yield on the assets narrow fora period of time. This pricing has put some pressure on our margins in thisbusiness. However, you should know that this business represents less than 1%of our total annual revenue. So, the amount of decline is not material forState Street overall.", "As we've noted, the commercialpaper has been sold to customers everyday. However, it has been our practice,if needed, to hold a small amount of a paper on our balance sheet from time totime.

Thisincrease was due primarily to $21 million in fees from Currenex. Brokerage andother fee revenue was up 12% from the second quarter of 2007.", "Also due to fixed income marketdisruptions, we saw more volume in securities finance than we usually see inthe third quarter. Securities finance revenue was up 90% from last year's thirdquarter due primarily to higher volumes and improved spreads. And was up 2%compared to this year's second quarter due to the additional revenue from theInvestors Financial business partially offset by slightly lower spreads andslightly lower volumes.", "At quarter end, we have $678billion in securities on loan and the duration of the securities lending bookwas 27 days.", "Net interest revenue on a fullytaxable equivalent basis increased $206 million or 75% from $275 million to$481 million, and was up $84 million from the second quarter.", "In addition, compared to thethird quarter of 2006 net interest margin of 173 basis points was up 51 basispoints and up 9 basis points from the second quarter of 2006.", "The favorable trends that I citedduring the first and second quarter calls continued in the third quarter.Higher levels and a favorable mix of customer deposits, a continued favorable non-USrate environment, a higher yield on reinvestments in our securities portfolio,and a higher level of low cost funds.

Since thetrends continued and in fact improved in the third quarter, plus the benefit weexpect to receive from the recent 50 basis point rate reduction by the Fed, wenow believe we will be above that level for 2007, more likely in the range of160 to 170 basis points.", "This assumed that market trendscontinue, that our transaction deposits continue to run at these historicallyhigh levels, and we continue to benefit from the favorable mix of customerdeposits.", "Looking towards 2008, we expectthe net interest margin to improve to an average for the year in the rangebetween 185 to 195 basis points.

Firstof all, the securities have issued with sub-prime mortgages as collateral, andthey are 73% AAA rated and 27% AA rated. They have performed very well and thecurrent percentage break down which is down from 80% AAA and 20% AA in thefirst quarter reflect the pay downs we have received.", "Each vintage year from 2003through 2006 has outperformed the Moody's performance data. All of the assetspurchased in 2006 and the small amount that we purchased in 2007 are AAA rated.In addition, these securities have an average 37.6% credit enhancement on themversus a 5% to 8% historical cumulative loss experience in the marketplace. So,what that means is that even if losses were to double, we still have more thantwice as much cushion as we need before we would have a loss.", "So, we remain very comfortable interms of our entire asset-backed position, including the position that isbacked by the sub-prime mortgages. Now, I will provide more detail oncomparable expenses.", "Salaries and benefits expenseswere up 43% from the third quarter of 2006 and up 13% from the second quarterof 2007, largely attributable to the cost associated for the staff that joinedState Street from Investors Financial, as well as, the impact of incentivecompensation due to our improved performance and benefits expense.", "Transaction processing expensesincreased up 36% compared to the year ago quarter and 17% from the secondquarter of 2007 due to increased volumes in the asset servicing business. Otherexpenses were up 81% compared to the year-ago quarter and up 16% compared tothe second quarter of 2007 due primarily to cost associated with InvestorsFinancial. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 35%.", "Again, I would like to remind youthat in a few minutes, I'll refer to several slides that are available on ourwebsite. But now, let me share with you our capital plans and answer some ofyour questions about the asset-backed commercial paper conduits.", "First, remember that during thefirst half of 2007, we read our ratios higher than our targeted levels, due tothe expected impact from the acquisition of Investors Financial and the plannedshare repurchase associated with that transaction.", "The principal capital ratio thatwe managed to is the Tier 1 leverage ratio. We will continue to target between5.25% and 5.75%, but may allow this to drift upwards towards 6% if conditionswarrant.", "On July 20th, 2007, we executed a$1 billion accelerated share repurchase program. At September 30th, 2007, ourTier 1 leverage ratio stands at 5.35%. Our tangible common equity ratio is3.49%. Our tangible common equity ratio reflects the growth in the balancesheet from increased customer deposits, and the increased level of liquidity wecarried in response to market conditions in the third quarter.", "Due to the high level of interestin our asset-backed commercial paper program, I will take a few minutes torefer you to several slides which are available on our website. For yourinformation, the data provided by Moody's is as of June 30th, 2007, and StateStreet's data is presented in the aggregate as of September 30th, 2007.", "I would like to begin bydescribing our approach to conduits. First, they are driven by customer demandfor high quality, highly rated commercial paper. These are principally ourcustomers that manage money market mutual funds. The conduits are managed by ourStructured Product Group and are subject to a rigorous credit review process,which includes independent oversight of all asset purchases.", "The conduits are included in ourcontingency plans, both in terms of funding and capital. We believe ourapproach to the asset-backed commercial paper market is different than mostother programs and that no assets from State Street balance sheet are sold tothe conduits, rather they are sourced from the market.", "The first conduit was created in1992 and now in 2007, we have four. The expansion overtime of the conduits hasbeen in response to the customer demand for asset-backed commercial paper. Thefinancial performance of the conduits during this time period has been verystrong. They have never suffered a credit loss on any asset they purchased, evidenceof a strong credit discipline that I just referred to.", "Also, State Street in its capacityas a liquidity and credit provider has also never experienced the loss fromhaving to fund under those facilities. State Street plays several roles,administrator, liquidity provider, and dealer for which we earn fees, but alsonow that we have 10 other dealers across the four conduit programs. Those feesare payout of the difference between the yield on the assets versus the yieldon the commercial paper and the conduits. The fees associated with the programare reported on the processing fees and other revenue line in our incomestatement. The fees represented about $61 million in 2006 revenue and year-to-datein 2007 were about $50 million.", "What are the ratings on theassets that are held for use in the conduits? If you would, please turn toslide 1. Let me make sure you are all aware, most of the assets are pools ofconsumer assets and our investment grade.", "Now let me detail some of theaggregate ratings of the assets within the four conduits that back thecommercial paper. 62% is AAA. 15% is AA. 8% is A, and 10% is not rated by arating agency. However, I should point out that our Enterprise Risk Managementgroup reviews all purchases in the conduits and the assets in this group arestructured to maintain a T-1 or similar conduit rating.", "Those three categories represent95% of the total. The remaining 5% is rated BBB. Let me differentiate theseratings from the average ratings of holdings of a multiseller peer group usingdata provided by Moody's which is graphed on page 10 in the trends packageprovided on our website also.", "First, let me reiterate, theassets in State Street's sponsored conduits are not sourced from our balancesheet. All State Streets conduits hold 62% in AAA rated securities. A peergroup of the major multiseller conduits holds 12%. While State Streets conduitshold 15% in AA rated securities, the peer group holds 13%. While State Street holds10% that are not rated, the peer group holds 41%. While State Street holds 5%rated as BBB, the index of the major multiseller bank sponsors holds 13%. Andwhile State Street holds essentially no assets rated below BBB or belowinvestment grade, the peer group holds 10%. The point of this detail is toprovide data that will help you differentiate generally between the commercialpaper issued by our conduits and that of other programs.", "These comparisons may help youunderstand the confidence we have in the quality of our assets. While as thecountry of origin of the assets and to whom do we sell this commercial paper,please turn to slide 2. The asset allocation is as follows. About 42% of theassets originate from the United States, 30% from Continental Europe and theUnited Kingdom and 22% from Australia. The weighted average maturity of theconduit assets is about four years.", "The conduits historically sellthe asset-backed commercial paper in four currencies with about two-thirds ofthe asset-backed commercial paper denominated in US dollars, a little more than20% is denominated in euros and sterling and about 15% is denominated inAustralian dollars.", "What types of assets arerepresented in the conduits? Please now turn to slide 3. Let me outline in theaggregate the types of high quality assets in the four conduits against whichthe commercial papers are issued.", "First, mortgages. US residentialmortgage-backed securities represent about 15% and have an average FICO scoreof 712 at origination. Australian mortgages represent about 18%. Europeanmortgages represent about 15%. UK mortgages represent about 8%.", "Next step to the mortgage-backedsecurities are student loans, which totaled about $3.3 billion or 11% of thetotal. Almost 83% of which are protected by a 97% guarantee by the US Federalgovernment.", "Next in order are auto andequipment loans which represent about 9% of the assets or $2.6 billion. Thencredit cards receivable which represent about 7% of the assets or $2.1 billionand finally other which includes mostly trade receivables, CLOs and businessand commercial loans, 17% or $5 billion. These assets are sourced from thirdparties and not from State Street's balance sheet. No single asset classrepresents more than 2% of total portfolio assets, except trade receivables at3%.", "For the sake of time, I will notreview the characteristics of each of the asset types held within the conduits,but if you later review the other slides I have provided, you can see in moredetail the characteristics, as well as, our risks and control procedures.", "So, what happened in the thirdquarter? Overall, the asset-backed commercial paper program performed very wellin a period of extreme market stress. We believe that our asset quality was amajor point of differentiation for our conduits during the period of time whensome weaker programs faded away and the overall asset-backed commercial papermarket contracted significantly.", "There were immaterial negativefinancial consequences to State Street in the third quarter as revenue from theconduits declined to about $11.1 million in the third quarter from $13.8million in the third quarter of 2006 and from $17.4 million in the secondquarter of 2007.", "As the third quarter progressedand investors became increasingly concerned about the credit quality of theunderlying assets in conduits, the rates that issuers had to pay onasset-backed commercial paper increased. These rates are generally recorded asspread over the relevant index. For example, the overnight rate or one-monthLIBOR. For State Street, our asset-backed commercial paper spreads widened outto as much as 50 to 75 basis points over the overnight rate, and 60 to 80 basispoints over the one-month rate. These spikes did not last long as they occurredin the weeks leading up to the FOMC meeting in mid-September, at which time theFed decided to lower the Fed funds target rate by 50 basis points to 4.75%.", "This move helped to contractspreads.

State Street provides the conduits withliquidity lines that backstop the asset back commercial paper. These are referredto as liquidity asset purchase agreements and they are provided to enhance thelevel of protection that a holder of the conduits commercial paper has beyondthe high asset quality of the conduits that I have already spoken about.", "If a credit problem occurred withan asset in one of conduits subject to certain conditions. The liquidity assetpurchase agreement could be invoked by the conduits requiring State Street topurchase the asset from the conduit at par. In the event the fair value of theasset in less then par State  Street would be required to take the loss uponpurchase of the asset. In the recent market with spreads on virtually all assetclasses except U.S treasuries having widened, this would result in a loss. Thisloss may be recovered in future periods, depending on State Street's action after the asset ispurchased.", "It is also possible the conduitassets and liabilities could come onto State Street's balance sheet through aconsolidation of one or all of the conduits. This would occur if State Street failedto meet the accounting requirements for non-consolidation under FIN 46-R whichis a complex accounting standard. This is assessed each quarter and morefrequently if events warned, if consolidation were to occur pursuing to FIN46-R then the conduit assets and liabilities would come onto State Street's balance sheet at fairvalue.

To quantify the income statement impact of State Street, if allof the conduits assets were purchased under the liquidity asset purchaseagreements or a consolidation event were to occur in the future using September30th, 2007 estimated fair values, the loss would be approximately $215 millionafter tax.

And if it's 5% assets undercustody should we assume that servicing revenues will go up 5% or is there amultiplier effect?", "Ron Logue", "Well, there could be a multipliereffect depending on the products and services that they buy right away.Traditionally, you start with custody and accounting and sell other productslately. You seem to be selling more products sooner in a cycle.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "Investors Financial, that $315million of savings, how much have you achieved in the third quarter?", "Ron Logue", "I think we said 120?", "Ed Resch", "30 million in the quarter.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "$30 million?", "Ed Resch", "$30 million in the quarter,right.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "Out of the $350 million?", "Ed Resch", "That's the 120 annualized, Mike.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "And you said the margin 1.73% inthe third quarter next year should go between 185 and 195?", "Ron Logue", "Correct.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "So if we take the midpoint ofthat, that would get us to NII 10% higher or we'll be doing something with thebalance sheet that would make NII not go up that much.", "Ed Resch", "I think our thinking right now ismore in the former camp, Mike.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "And would that be due to IFIN ordue to the core of business. The reason I say that is you will be getting $0.05more if you eliminate the dilution from IFIN and if the margin improves the wayyou say it will that would be another $0.05 and I don't want to double count?", "Ed Resch", "You are not double counting. TheIFIN fund is a contributor to that. It's part of it. But you have to rememberthe IFIN effect on the portfolio was about 1/6 or 1/7 the size of the State Street portfolio.So, the main driver still is the improvement. It's the State Street side of the equation, if Ican call it that. And it relates to the assets that are maturing in theportfolio, that are the older ones as well as the strong flows that we have talkedabout now for several quarters on the State Street side.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "And your guidance in the past,you've tried to be conservative, but if you take the $1.15 plus the $0.05 ofthe margin, plus the $ 0.05 for IFIN, you are up to a $1.25 run rate. Timesfour you get to $5 run rate before any growth. So, I want you to just pull usback down to earth here. What was kind of above trend this quarter, may be ifyou can address FX trading volumes, and at least this quarter's NII? And thereason I say that is we don't have those numbers for the second quarter withoutIFIN?", "Ed Resch", "Right. The things that were abovetrend in the quarter, Mike, were the things that you mentioned. The securitieslending, which normally as a sequential quarter decline, it obviously did notdo that this year. A contributor to that was IFIN. But again not the maincontributor to the relative strength in the third quarter.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "How much was sec lending upwithout IFIN?", "Ed Resch", "Sec lending was up $3 million intotal. IFIN was $7 million of that.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "Okay.", "Ed Resch", "So, the old State Street was down a little bitsequentially. So, you have the strength in sec lending. You have the volatilityin the marketplace given what went on and the fixed income market is drivingreally strong FX.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "How much was FX baseline?", "Ed Resch", "IFIN contributed $22 million tothe sequential quarter increase.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "Okay.", "Ed Resch", "Okay. And then you have the NIRperformance that we've already talked about. So, if you put that all togetherand say that we performed inline with our expectations coming into the quarter,we would have been right around what Street consensus was for the quarter.Okay. So, you can almost say that around $0.20 of the overall performance wasdue to those factors, IFIN's overall performance, FX and NIR and sec lending.So, that's what really drove us. So, I think your $1.25 construction times fouris a little bit aggressive given what I just said about the strength in thethird quarter.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "Okay.

But we think it's very, veryremote that a consolidation event would occur and based on our history that wetalked about from the standpoint of our conduit performance on the asset side,as well as, the implications to that of State Street is never having had acredit loss in the conduits or a liquidity asset purchase agreement called bythe conduits against State Street, I think you can say the same thing aboutthat side of the equation.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "How much did revenues go downthis quarter due to ABCP, that wasn't clear?", "Ed Resch", "In the range of $5 million to $10million.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, so you might not see thatcome back?", "Ed Resch", "We might.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "And lastly, but actually twomore; the Barclays contract with IFIN, if you have a renegotiation, what wehear about it, have you had one, can you comment?", "Ron Logue", "If we have one, you will hearabout it. We continue to process through the quarter. Service is good, and weare still doing all of the processing that IFIN did.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "And then lastly, the fixed incomefunds that are actively managed dealing with subprime, it went from $8 billiondown to $3 billion in the last three months. So, does that mean your potentiallegal exposure is $5 billion, and if it isn't can you size potential risk?", "Ron Logue", "It's hard to size potential risk,Mike, people get in and out, there were withdrawals, transfers during thatperiod of time. So it's a difficult thing to do.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "Alright, thank you.", "Operator", "And moving on our next questionwill come from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Good morning. Well Ron, I hadjust sort of a qualitative question for you first. All the press coverage thatyou got during the third quarter, about the funds and the ABCP's, etcetera, howmuch did you have to ramp up the time spent sort of client hand holding duringthe period and were there substantial worries that were voiced by your clientas a result of all this. I mean, so, what was the client reaction is sort ofthe bigger question?", "Ron Logue", "Well, I think the media made moreout of it, than it actually happened, Nancyto be honest with you. First of all, as I am sure you know, we are known forconstant client coverage. So, there weren't any gaps there. We were constantlydealing -- using the relationship managers that we have dealing with theclients. Were there more questions, yeah, but nothing to the extent that therewas panic in the streets here? ", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Alright.", "Ron Logue", "I mean, as I said, the media madefor out of this than what actually happened.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Okay. And also your commentaryabout the ongoing size of the ABCP's, and your comment about what happened. Areyou ascribing some likelihood to a reoccurrence of what happened in the thirdquarter, in other words, do you see the market as having changed in some waythat we get more of these fixed standard deviation event, that will play intoyour thinking about the ongoing size of the conduits.", "Ron Logue", "Well, there is no question thatwill play into our thinking about the conduits. And as I said, I mean I don'tthink anybody would have anticipated 100% loss of liquidity and it's tough tocreate a contingency plan for something like that. But, for a period of timethat's exactly what happened. And so, I think we need to rethink some of thatespecially as it relates to our capital, and we are going to do that.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Okay. Also, I had a question foryou, the benefit of the Fed cut, would you just remind us how this plays intoongoing margin and when the benefit sort of runs out, I mean assuming that wehave sort of a one-and-down event here.", "Ed Resch", "Well, with everything else beingheld constant, which is hard to do Nancy,the 50 basis point cut as the Fed just did, is worth about $50 million to us onnet interest revenue on an annualized basis. A lot of that given where we areconstructed is frontloaded today. So, there will be more in Q4 and Q1 and therewill be in next Q2 and Q3. But, we are still in a position where a 25 basispoint cut is worth about $25 million or $30 million to us on an annualizedbasis.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "And Ron, one another question foryou, if I may? Has there been any changes in portfolio management at SSgA as aresult of the issues with the funds or if you would just remind us what thelong-term record of these funds is and whether clients are still interested inthat long-term record?", "Ron Logue", "Well, there has been no changes Nancy. The long-termrecord has been very good. And I think to prove a point is the fact that weadded about $1 billion in active fixed income in the quarter.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "All right. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And our next question today willcome from Brian Bedell from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Good morning, guys.", "Ron Logue", "Hi, Brian.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Just a few questions. Startingwith the business wins that you said that funding over the next couple ofquarters, these are mostly custody and accounting mandates. Do you have alsosec lending assignments and effects both in there as well?", "Ron Logue", "Yes.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "You do. Okay. So that leads intothe next question. Clearly the volumes in volatility were very strong in thequarter. But, if you had to mention roughly, what proportion of third quarterupside and effects in sec lending was due to just your cross sale into yourother custody mandates and also, I think, TIAA-CREF was coming online in seclending?", "Ron Logue", "Yeah. I tried to say obviously aswe keep adding customers, the FX securities lending haven't really gauged thatfrom that point. But my bet would be that it's relatively small.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. But you are sayingbasically these new mandates are coming on with additional cross sales as well.", "Ron Logue", "Yes.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And the pricing of thesemandates should we assume that there -- will ensure that the larger deals arepriced lower given the scale and size arguments to that. But should we expectroughly similar pricing on assets under custody overall with these pricing?", "Ron Logue", "I guess I will characterize themas market price. Any time there is accounting whether -- it's not a commoditykind of pricing.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Right. Okay. Great. Ed, yourtarget of 185 to 195 for '08, what are your assumptions for the Fed fundsrates, say at the end of the '08 and the European Central Bank rates on that?", "Ed Resch", "I will give you all theassumption that underlie that Brian. In terms of Fed funds, our currentassumption is that there will be 475 flat throughout all of '08 or the dollarswill stay where they are until the middle of the year and they will increase 25basis points. The euro will increase one more time this year, and then go up tofour in a quarter and stay flat. The pound will stay where it is, 575 flat fromnow through the end of next year. And Japanese yen will have one more increase,25 basis points and be 75 basis points flat for all of next year.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. So fairly staticconditions. If the Fed gets further and ECB stays in your target range, isthere an upside to your NIM, guidance based on that? ", "Ed Resch", "Sure. It depends on how and howmuch and when the Fed would have cut. But based on what I said before in termsof a Fed rate cut, all else equal, that's a positive event for us.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Alright and...", "Ed Resch", "Let's say modestly though Brian,I mean assuming it's another 25, because there is not a huge impact to thenumbers I gave for '08 .", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Right. And then just for therates that you are paying on foreign deposits, you were able to keep that lowagain. Can you talk about your confidence and your ability to keep that let'ssay well below the ECB rates going forward?", "Ed Resch", "As the foreign central banks haveraised rates, we have had the ability to lag as we've talked about. That willwork itself through in a quarter or so, if they stop raising and things willcatch up.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Right, so that I mean in otherwords you have come down from that 365 in the first quarter to 329 in thesecond quarter and 325 this quarter. So, what you are saying is we shouldexpect upside pressure on that and in the fourth quarter and first quarter?", "Ed Resch", "Yes.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Buyback towards sort of what youwere before in the first quarter?", "Ed Resch", "Yeah. I think that's a goodguess.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And just within, Ronif you want just talk about one question on the conduit again. With your plans for the future size of that, if you werenot to buy any assets into the conduits, if you were to stop doing that, howlong would it take to runoff? I know you don't want to close it to zero, butjust to gauge the size of that?", "Ron Logue ", "No, I think as quoted theweighted average maturity of four years.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Right, okay. So, we should juststraight line that basically?", "Ron Logue", "Yeah.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Is your plan to sort of letthat run down for the time being?", "Ed Resch", "", "Yeah, I don't want to telegraphanything we're going to do that, but we're definitely going to look at it interms of relationship to the capital ratios. And obviously compare that to themarket conditions and take advantage of the market conditions and converselydon't be disadvantaged by the market conditions in that period of time.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Right.", "Ed Resch", "", "But directionally you are right.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Right, in just terms of, I meanjust using that, I mean clearly it's the earnings contribution doesn't seem tosupport any kind of additional hit on the capital that you bring on.", "Ron Logue", "Right.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "I think you mentioned quickly onIFIN, you said the retention is currently on track you have retained all of theclients so far or most of the clients?", "Ron Logue", "On the top 30, we only know ofone that's leaving.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. So is it fair to say youare ahead of your 90% retention target as of right now?", "Ron Logue", "Oh yeah.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Okay great. And then the $141million M&I charges what should we expect for charges going forward fromthe M&I one?", "Ed Resch", "Brian, we're going to be inlinewith what we have modeled, its just that the nature of the charge this quarterwas front loaded. The main drivers of the charges, because we abandoned our oldheadquarters building at 225, Franklin Streets, so over $90 million of the $140is because of that. But we're going to be over the transaction right in themiddle of the range we put out.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, the most of its already putthrough essentially a good chunk of it is already charged off?", "Ed Resch", "Yeah, but I mean the range was$250 million to $275 million, so we are going to be in the middle of that forthe whole transaction.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Right and that's coming through'08 essentially.", "Ed Resch", "Yes.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Yes, okay. Great thanks verymuch.", "Ron Logue", "Thanks Brian.", "Operator", "And our next question today willcome from Banc of America's Ken Usdin. Please go ahead.", "Ken Usdin - Banc of America", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Ron Logue", "Hi, Ken.", "Ken Usdin - Banc of America", "Hi, Ron. Ed, could you just walkthrough again on the capital side, 3.5% TCE this quarter? Just any idea of whenyou expect to rebuild? How gradual that will be? And then your plans for justfuture capital management, when might we see you buying back stock in thefuture, and any changes in the capital management strategy?", "Ed Resch", "Right. Well, in terms of the TCE,we can rebuild that fairly quickly just based on internal capital generation.And I would expect that we'd be above 4%, again holding everything constantwithin two quarters based on how much we can move it in a quarter. It's in therange of 40 basis points or so per quarter up.", "In terms of the accelerated sharerepurchase, that's still ongoing. When it's concluded we will obviouslyannounce that. But that's still progressing. And in terms of the fourthquarter, I think it's fair to say given everything that we have talked abouttoday on the call relative to capital and other things, we are not going to bebuying back any stock in the fourth quarter and as we move forward into '08 wewill be still carrying forward our philosophy of buying enough to offset comprelated dilution, but committing to not much beyond that. We want to retain ourflexibility from a capital standpoint. So, back to I would say business asusual, at least at this point going into '08.", "Ken Usdin - Banc of America", "Okay. Got you. And on IFIN, youmentioned $30 million on 120 run rate this quarter. I know you are on track toget 350. Can you just talk about where you are as far as timing of getting to350? Are you are ahead of plan at all? Are we going to see kind of ratable? Canyou just run us through, now your current thinking as far as that deal model ofrecognition of cost saves?", "Ed Resch", "Yeah. I think that the deal modelas we outlined it is basically in line from an expense reduction standpoint,where the reductions will occur pretty much ratably overtime as we've modeledit, lined up with the conversions that I talked about.", "The real increment from aperformance standpoint on the IFIN transaction versus the deal model has beenon the revenue side, where we've had stronger revenue than we anticipated.We've had, as Ron noted, higher than a 90% revenue retention rate. Saying it inanother way, we've had less than 10% attrition. So, the driver are the justhaving a dilution or a little bit better than having a dilution is on therevenue side.", "So, expenses will come out as wemodeled ratably. Most to be accomplished by the end of next year, maybe we'llhave a little bit spilling over in to the first quarter of '09 from the expensestandpoint.", "Ken Usdin - Banc of America", "And from an accretion dilutionperspective, can we take the same magnitude of change in '07, and take that tothe magnitude of accretion versus the original flat guidance, or is there evena little bit more pickup because you get into the business going better thanyou expected also?", "Ed Resch", "Well, I wouldn't extrapolate thestrength this quarter into '07. I think that we had a better start from arevenue standpoint, as I pointed out and what we had modeled. But as we thinkabout '08 right now, based on everything we are seeing with the customers andall the conversion plans that are in place, we are going to do better than flatnext year. But I wouldn't want to get too far into that at this point.", "Ken Usdin - Banc of America", "Okay. And then last thing just onIFIN also, just on the revenue side, can you give us even just some color ofany examples of revenue synergies? I know you hadn't quantified any, you hadstill the net negative synergy built into your model upfront. Can you talkabout your outlook on revenue synergies? Any examples you've already gotten ormagnitude of such?", "Ron Logue", "Ken, this is Ron. We are verypretty sure we are going to get some cross-sale revenue. Those things arebeginning to start, but you are not going to see anything in the third quarterand in the fourth quarter of any substance. A lot of that will happen as thoseaccounts get converted. So, we don't see a whole lot there right now in termsof what we consider a cross-sale, and as you know there was no cross-salerevenue in the deal model.", "Ken Usdin - Banc of America.", "Right. So that's not in your planfor '08 either?", "Ron Logue", "Well, some will be, but it's notnecessarily in the plan.", "Ken Usdin - Banc of America.", "That's what I mean. It's not inthe plan for '08, okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "", "Our next question today will comefrom Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you. Hi, Ron.", "Ron Logue", "Hi, Gerard.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "Question on the business wins, Iknow it's a sensitive subject, but how much of the business wins may have beendue to your large competitor that's going through an integration just versuspure plain old, good old fashion business wins?", "Ron Logue", "It's hard to tell, Gerard. Ithink there is a lot of other thinking going on when big organizations move. Alot of it really has to do with accounting, not necessarily custody, and someof these situations are caused by realization that accounting no longer wantsto be internalized, and usually when that happens there, there aren't too manyorganizations that they can go to so and get things done at scale as they arebig organizations. So that plays a big role.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "", "I see. And then Ed on youroutlook for the different interest rate environments from the different partsof the world, can you list the top two which has the biggest impact on themargin?", "Ed Resch", "Well, the biggest one, by far, isthe USrate environment, and then probably to say a year old after that Gerard.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "Great. Thank you.", "Ron Logue", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question will comefrom Dave Hilder with Bear Stearns. Please go ahead.", "Dave Hilder - Bear Stearns", "Good morning and congratulationson a great performance, and thanks for the guidance. Just a couple of unrelatedquestions, Ron, it certainly seems like directionally you are thinking aboutreducing the size of the conduit, is that fair?", "Ron Logue", "Well, we are going to take a lookat it. I think it's very, very important that we protect our capital ratio, andI think probably the one big variable this quarter is the kind of marketdisruption that we've seen, and I think we need to make sure that we can beprepared for very unusual, I guess, I had used the word unprecedented markettype disruptions coming from different angles, and one of the ways to deal withthat is to insure your capital ratio, and I think that's important. Soovertime, directionally you are going to see us do things that protect thoseratios, and this could be one of those things.", "Dave Hilder - Bear Stearns", "That certainly sounds like a goodstrategy. In the quarter, Ed, could you tell us what roughly the amortizationof intangible expenses was?", "Ed Resch", "Sure. Okay for Q3 $15 millionplus another $17 million. So $32 million of intangible amortization and thatincludes both Currenex and IFIN.", "Dave Hilder - Bear Stearns", "Okay. Great. Thank you. And onthe IFIN, the one of the top 30 clients of IFIN that you know is leaving. Iassume that's Barclays.", "Ron Logue", "No.", "Dave Hilder - Bear Stearns", "And then this is a tougher one onthe Prudential suit, Ron, you described the complaint is really outlining adisclosure of communication issue. But the complaint also notes that State Street was ina risk of fiduciary. And as I understand the standard of judgment there wouldbe higher for a liability, really more of a prudent investor standard ratherthan simply a disclosure issue as you might have in a different type of action?", "Ron Logue", "As you might imagine, I reallycan't comment based on the litigation, Dave.", "Dave Hilder - Bear Stearns", "Okay. Well, I did want to giveyou a chance.", "Ron Logue", "Yeah. Okay.", "Dave Hilder - Bear Stearns", "Thanks very much for all theinformation you've provided.", "Ron Logue", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Movingon, we will now hear from Andrew Marquardt from Fox-Pitt Kelton. Please goahead.", "Andrew Marquardt - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Good morning, guys.", "Ron Logue", "Good morning.", "Andrew Marquardt - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Sorry, if I missed it, but interms of the net interest margin outlook, can you talk about the sensitivity tothe ECB and changes in the rates there?", "Ed Resch", "Well, it's the second mostimportant currency after the US dollar, but still the vast majority of thesensitivity as it relates to our rate expectations is relative to the USdollars. So, I don't want to put it in terms of a basis point affect on them,but it's not terribly significant relative to the dollar.", "Andrew Marquardt -Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Okay. And then what would be thescenario that would make the margin in general go down for you guys? It seemslike there are a lot of factor that make you go up.", "Ed Resch", "Well, I think the biggest onewould be if we saw a reduction in the currently favorable customer flows thatwe've talked so much about. If they were to decline overall, if they were to beless transaction accounts, which are a very low cost for financing or there wasto be a less attractive mix. That's probably the biggest potential risk if Ican call it that. It's what we have said in terms of the margin. But again wedon't see those things happening. And that's why we gave the guidance that wegave relative to next year.", "Andrew Marquardt - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Great. That's helpful. Lastly, interms of asset-backed CP programs, can you comment in all about the news aroundthe creation of the super conduit over the weekend and then early this week,and how that might affect your dealings with the situation and any color on that.", "Ron Logue", "It's probably something that'sbeneficial for the market. But it's not really going to affect us, because wedon't have any sales as you know. So, you wouldn't see us participate in it anyway but anything that can come to market is going to be a plus for us.", "Andrew Marquardt -Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Okay. Thank you.", "Ron Logue", "I think we can take one morequestion.", "Operator", "And the final question fromtoday's roster will come from Tom Mccrohan from JanneyMontgomery Scott. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Tom Mccrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Hi. Thanks for taking the call.", "Ron Logue", "Hi, Tom.", "Tom Mccrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Great results. Couple offollow-up questions, most have been answered. The treasury-led [master] conduitthat's been discussed in the papers, are you guys participating in thosediscussions in anyway?", "Ron Logue", "No. We are not.", "Tom Mccrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Would you benefit from that inany way or --?", "Ron Logue", "No. We don't think so. Because wedon't have any sales other than the market generally benefiting would help us.But we have no need to participate. We don't have any of those types of assets.So, there would be no direct benefit.", "Tom Mccrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "No direct benefit. Great. And inconnection with the relatively weak US dollar, can you guys just quantify if atall, how your results could have been benefiting from a weak US dollar?", "Ed Resch", "", "Yeah. Overall Tom, it's a coupleof percentage points of revenue growth on an annual basis. ", "Tom Mccrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Yes.", "Ed Resch", "And that obviously offset to themost part by a similar growth in expenses, given the fact that we are matchedpretty much in terms of revenue in expense by currency.", "Tom Mccrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Perfect. Okay. And my lastquestion, really just again on the TCE ratio, Ed from your earlier comments, itseemed like the ratio was really adversely impacted somewhat from you guystaken a more defensive posture during the quarter. You talked about being alittle more liquid, and you had previously talked about a projected pro formaTCE ratio of about 4.4% I believe, if you guys close the IFIN deal. So, if wejust assume that the 3.5% ratio we saw this quarter is primarily a function ofsimply this posturing?", "Ed Resch", "Well, that's part of it. As I'vesaid, as part of our contingency planning, given the market events that we sawraised incremental liquidity, and that at quarter end was about $7 billion, andthat was held and obviously invested on the asset side in short-terminstruments. So yes, that's part of it. But, again it's going to take us acouple of quarters all out sequel to build our ratio back to where we want itto be.", "Tom Mccrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "When you talked about growth nextJune, the balance sheet of 5 to 10, also the kind of a normalized balancesheet, you are normalizing pretty much for the added liquidity?", "Ed Resch", "Well, yes right, exactly. So, ifyou take out the incremental liquidity we had in the third quarter, you cankind of roll the balance sheet forward and apply growth rate to it.", "Tom Mccrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "But what would have been anormalized balance sheet this quarter?", "Ed Resch", "Well take about $7 billion of theaverage.", "Tom Mccrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Take $7 billion off, okay.", "Ed Resch", "Yes.", "Tom Mccrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Great, thanks very much.", "Ron Logue", "Okay.", "Operator", "And there is no additional timefor further questions. I would like to turn the call back to the Mr. Logue foradditional or closing remarks.", "Ron Logue", "Thank you, and thank you all forattending. I know we gave you an awful lot of data today. We thought it wasvery important given what's happened in the third quarter, that you have whatyou need that would hopefully differentiate some of the programs we have fromsome of the others. And again, I thank you very much for the time.", "Operator", "Thank you everyone for yourparticipation. That does conclude today's conference.

Now I\u2019d like to introduce Kelley MacDonald, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations at State Street. Please go ahead.", "Kelley MacDonald", "Good morning everyone. Before Ron Logue our Chairman and CEO and CFO Ed Resch begin their remarks, I\u2019d like to remind you that during this call we may make forward-looking statements relating to the corporation\u2019s financial outlook and business environment, exposure to claims and the adequacy of it\u2019s reserves among other things. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements. As a result of various important factors including those discussed in State Street\u2019s 2006 Annual Report on form 10-K, and its subsequent filings with the SEC we encourage you to review those filings including the sections on risk factors concerning any forward-looking statements we may make today. Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of today, January 15, 2008, and the corporation does not undertake to revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after today. In addition information related to this webcast including information concerning and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures referred to in the webcast is available in the Investor Relations section of our website www.statestreet.com/stockholder under the heading Annuals Reports and Financial Trends. I\u2019d also like to remind you that this morning we will be using several slides to illustrate some of the material that Ed Resch will present regarding the performance of assets in the commercial paper conduits. You can access these from our website and some are also included as an addendum in our print package which is also available on our website. ", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ron.", "Ronald Logue", "Thank you Kelley and good morning. On January 3rd, we told you of the actions we were taking to put the issues concerning a small number of active fixed income strategies managed my SSgA firmly behind us. We also shared with you our expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2007. Let me confirm those expectations and explain in some more detail why we believe this performance will serve as the basis for further momentum in 2008. Ed will then provide specific detail with respect to our results, the investment portfolio and our asset back commercial paper program. I\u2019ll then return and provide an outlook for 2008 given market conditions we expect as well as our position within the industry. ", "State Street this morning reported a strong year\u2019s performance with increasing revenue and operating earnings per share in each successive quarter, excluding the impact of a $279 million after tax charge associated with certain actively managed fixed income strategies at State Street Global Advisors and the merger and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Investors Financial in July of 2007. ", "Excluding the tax adjustments recorded in 2006 as well as the charge and merger and integration costs in 2007, both our earnings per share on an operating basis and our revenue grew 32% in 2007 compared to 2006. Also excluding the 2007 costs just mentioned and the tax adjustments in 2006, we achieved 17.7% operating return on equity in 2007 compared to 17.1% in 2006. Also excluding the impact of a charge in the merger and integration costs in 2007 we once again achieved positive operating leverage of 500 basis points on an annual basis. Just looking at the fourth quarter\u2019s results we achieved 410 basis points of positive operating leverage on a sequential quarter basis and significant positive operating leverage of 1280 basis points when compared with the prior year\u2019s quarter. ", "Strength in our asset servicing and asset management business including internationally, continues to drive our results. On a year over year basis servicing fees increased 24% and management fees grew 21%. While market conditions in the second half of the year presented challenges it also created more opportunities for over performance in foreign exchange and in securities finance. Foreign exchange revenue in 2007 was up 31% and securities finance revenue was up 76% both compared to 2006. ", "Now let\u2019s talk about some of the fourth quarter wins which include on the servicing side, we\u2019ve been appointed to provide a range of investment services for \u20ac620 million in pension fund assets for Royal [Corsin] a leading food producer in The Netherlands. State Street will provide Royal [Corsin\u2019s] three pension funds with global custody, accounting, regulatory reporting and performance measurement and analytic services. ", "State Street has been appointed to provide a range of custody, accounting and fund administration services to the Excelsior Funds. This mandate expands State Street\u2019s services to Columbia Management, Bank of America\u2019s asset management arm by $20 billion in assets for a total of $320 billion. State Street Global Advisors also added significant new business as well. State Street has been appointed by the pension schemes of the British Airport Authority Pension Trust to manage \u00a3330 million of Global Equity 130-30 mandate. New York State teachers also opted to renew contracts with State Street Global Advisors for their management of an $886 million passive international equity account. Puerto Rican government employees\u2019 retirement system appointed SSgA to manage $60 million in an active large cap strategy. ", "Net new business for SSgA for 2007 was $116 billion. Of note is the growth in our ETF assets from $134 billion in the third quarter to $171 billion in the fourth quarter, and increase of 28%. Not let\u2019s turn to our balance sheet for a minute. ", "Net interest revenue and net interest margin again performed very well achieving a 55% increase in fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue in 2007 compared to 2006 and a net interest margin of 171 basis points in 2007. Our investment portfolio is performing as expected. As you can see from the improvement over the past year in net interest margin, our strategy is bearing results. Ed will provide further details about these results and our outlook in a few minutes. On the expense side, excluding the fourth quarter charge and the third and the fourth quarter merger and integration costs, our expenses on an operating basis grew at a rate less than the rate of growth in revenue which resulted, as I said, in about 500 basis points of positive operating leverage on an annual basis.", "We\u2019ve not completed the first six months of the consolidation of Investors Financial and we\u2019re confident that we will achieve our customer revenue retention target of 90%. As you can see from the press release issued this morning, the performance of the business we acquired from Investors Financial was excellent and has exceeded our expectations adding $462 million in revenue since the July acquisition. We reported $0.06 dilution per share for the six month period from the acquisition ahead of our model of $0.14 dilution per share that we provided in February, 2007 when we announced the transaction. We also expect the acquisition to be modestly accretive this year slightly ahead of our plan. The consolidation is proceeding according to plan. We have retained key talent from Investors Financial and have also outlined plans for conversion of customers and their accounts are being converted according to our plans. As they convert, we are removing costs on schedule while also providing access for those customers to a broad range of new products and services.", "Let me comment on the position of our Asset Back Commercial Paper conduits. As we explained last quarter, the assets backing this commercial paper do not come from our balance sheet but rather from high quality assets that we select and then the conduits sell in the form of commercial paper to our customers. This is a somewhat unique program, very different from other programs you\u2019ve been reading about, many of which are backed by less highly rated assets or have a higher percentage of unrated assets or contain sub-prime assets. The ratings on the assets backing the commercial paper in the space responsive conduits are primarily AAA or AA and none are sub-prime. Most of the assets benefit from asset-specific credit enhancement. In addition, State Street provides liquidity and credit facilities to the conduits as we have disclosed in our SEC filings in the past. We do not have concerns as to the overall quality of the underlying assets in the conduits. ", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ed who will provide some of the details of our financial performance, further information about performance of the assets in our investment portfolio and the Asset Back Commercial Paper program. ", "Edward Resch", "Thank you Ron and good morning. This year certainly underscored the strength of our business. We reported strong growth in both fee and net interest revenue, and please note that all of the numbers I am presenting will include the results of Investors Financial beginning in July. ", "Our growth in assets servicing, asset management and securities finance revenue continues at a combined rate of about 29% in 2007 compared to 2006. Trading services revenue and particularly securities finance revenue performed very well in the second half of the year given the volatility in the market. We continue to expand globally introducing new services to a broad base of customers. Approximately 41% of our revenue came from non-US sources in 2007 which is above the 39% pro-forma with Investors Financial for 2006. We reported strong net interest revenue growth of 75% on a fully taxable equivalent basis comparing the fourth quarter of 2007 with the fourth quarter of 2006 and on the same basis; net interest revenue was up 19% comparing the fourth quarter of 2007 with the third quarter of 2007. Our net interest margin improved to 195 basis points in the fourth quarter, up 62 basis points from last year\u2019s fourth quarter and up 22 basis points from the third quarter. ", "Obviously the positive trends I mentioned last quarter continued into this quarter as well as some benefit from the two recent cuts in the FED funds rate, the last one of which will have greater impact on the first quarter of 2008. I will provide more detail on our net interest income and margin and the outlook for 2008 in a few minutes.", "Excluding the impact of the charge and the merger and integration costs, we achieved positive operating leverage on an annual basis or as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 as well as compared to the third quarter of 2007. For the 13th consecutive quarter, our assets under custody were at a record level for State Street at the end of the quarter. Our assets under custody were $15.3 trillion compared to $11.9 trillion on December 31st, 2006. Our assets under management stood at $2.0 trillion at the end of this quarter. As Ron noted, the business acquired from Investors Financial continued to perform well. As we reported this morning, total revenue in the fourth quarter in 2007 compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 including Investors Financial was up 53% and excluding Investors Financial total revenue was up 38%. ", "In the second half of 2007 we saved $170 million annualized excluding certain variable expenses that are tied to the revenue increases from the acquired Investors Financial business as well as the amortization of intangible costs. So for 2007, we achieved in the second half of the year 24% of the total savings target which was $350 million which we set last February. Our expectations are that we will achieve about 80% to 85% of the savings target in 2008 consistent with our original plans. As we convert client accounts, we will be able to reduce the expense base. Due to continued strength in revenue growth from customers we acquire from Investors Financial we now expect the acquisition to be modestly accretive to 2008 results. ", "I hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to review our earnings press release distributed this morning. Please review the financial statements included with our earnings press release and in our financial trends package on our website for detailed information on our financial results. Now to discuss those results.", "This morning all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results excluding for 2007 the charge associated with the under performance of certain fixed income strategies at State Street Global Advisors, the merger and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Investors Financial and for 2006 the tax adjustments.", "On an operating basis, earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $1.38 up 60% from $0.86 per share last year and up 20% from the third quarter. Revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled $2.496 billion for the quarter, an increase of 52.8% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter compared with a 40% increase in expenses to $1.649 billion on an operating basis. Compared to the third quarter of 2007 revenue was up 10.6% and expenses on an operating basis increased 6.5%. Return on equity on an operating basis was 18.7% in the fourth quarter up from 15.9% in 2006 and up from 15.8% in the third quarter. Servicing fees were up 39% from the fourth quarter of 2006 and up 3% from the third quarter. Management fees were up 17% from the fourth quarter of 2006 and down 1% from the third quarter. Performance fees were about $21 million down from $24 million a year ago, and up from $19 million in the third quarter of 2007.", "Higher volumes and stronger volatility in our foreign exchange business drove a 79% increase in foreign exchange trading revenue compared with the fourth quarter of 2006 and up 13% from the third quarter. Brokerage and other fees were up $38 million or 61% to $100 million from the previous year\u2019s fourth quarter. This increase was due primarily to $23 million in fees from [Current Ex]. Brokerage and other fee revenue were up 4% from the third quarter of 2007. Also, due to fixed income market disruptions we saw continued demand for securities finance in the fourth quarter. Securities finance revenue was up 184% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter due primarily to improved spreads and higher volumes and was up 55% compared to this year\u2019s third quarter due to improved spreads. At quarter-end we had $662 billion in securities on loan and the duration on the securities lending book was 26 days. Net interest revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $245 million or 75% from $328 million to $573 million and was up $92 million from the third quarter. In addition compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 net interest margin of 195 basis points was up 62 basis points and up 22 basis points from the third quarter of 2007.", "Some of the trends that benefited us in the fourth quarter include higher yields on reinvestments in our investment portfolio, lower cost funding due in part to the 100 basis point decline in the FED funds rates since August and the impact of additional revenue from Investors Financial. The average investment portfolio increased from $65.7 billion to $75.9 billion during the fourth quarter from the year-ago quarter and was up from $74.6 billion in the third quarter of 2007. Mortgage backed securities in the fourth quarter represented about 39% or $30 billion of the average investment portfolio. Floating rate asset backed securities in the fourth quarter of 2007 represented about 32% of the average investment portfolio or $24.5 billion. The credit quality of the portfolio at December 31st, 2007 has remained about the same as at last year-end, 95% is invested in AAA or AA rated securities. As of December 31st, 2007, 89% was invested in AAA and 6% in AA rated securities. None of our asset backed or mortgage backed investment portfolio securities was downgraded. Three asset backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages that we own totaling $10 million have been placed on watch for downgrade due to rating agency concerns regarding certain financial guarantors. ", "If the current trends we have been seeing continue we expect our net interest margin for the full year 2008 to be in the range of 185 basis points to 195 basis points, probably toward the higher end. This outlook assumes that growth in the non-US transactions balances may abate somewhat, that we maintain the existing favorable mix of customer liabilities and expectation that the investment portfolio will re price upwards as about $7 billion in older fixed rate securities mature in 2008 but these will be reinvested at lower rates than the 2007 maturities. A generally declining interest rate environment worldwide but more uncertainty in the current rate environment than we have previously seen. Future rate cuts from the FED will help us but the benefit may tail off a bit in the second half of 2008. Declining rates in Europe we expect will reduce spreads. We expect our \u201908 average balance sheet to be roughly flat with the average balance sheet in the fourth quarter of 2007. ", "Our duration gap has not changed significantly from year end. Our assets are about 12 months and our liabilities are about nine months. The investment portfolio duration is about 1.4 years down slightly from 1.5 years in the fourth quarter of 2006 and also down from 1.5 years in the third quarter of 2007. ", "Now I\u2019ll address the asset backed securities that are collateralized by sub-prime first lien mortgage assets, an element of the portfolio that I have been commenting on since last March. First of all the portfolio has performed very well. Our portfolio of asset backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgage is $6.2 billion as of December 31st, 2007. Seventy-one percent of the portfolio was rated AAA and the remaining 29% is rated AA. None of the securities have been downgraded. We have a 40% average credit enhancement based on the structure itself which gives us confidence that securities will mature at par. This means that even if every mortgage backing the security were to default we would not lose $1 until the recovery rate for that security fell below 60%. And further, the assets we believe are well diversified by vintage, geography and originator. ", "I\u2019ll now turn back to expenses and just a reminder, on speaking about them on an operating basis. Salaries and benefits expenses on an operating basis increased 35% compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 due primarily to the additional staff from Investors Financial and staff added to service new business. Compared to the third quarter of 2007 also on an operating basis salaries and benefits expense increased 2% primarily for additional headcount to service new business partially offset by reductions in Investors Financial staff. Transaction processing expenses increased 52% compared to the year ago quarter primarily due to the acquisition of Investors Financial as well as increased volumes in the asset servicing and trading business and 12% from the third quarter of 2007 due primarily to increased volumes. Other expenses were up 84% compared to the year ago quarter and were up 30% compared to the third quarter of 2007 primarily due to acquisition costs, fees such as for professional services and recruiting and securities processing costs. Regarding this increase we had amortization costs for intangibles related to the acquisitions we did this year and in addition we calibrated spending due to the strong revenue we experienced in the quarter. Lastly we incurred some expenses due to the significant growth in the business. ", "Let me review in detail our capital structure following the $279 million after-tax charge we recorded in the fourth quarter to address legal exposure and other costs associated with the under performance of certain actively managed fixed income investment strategies. The principal capital ratio that we manage to is the Tier 1 leverage ratio. We will continue to target between 5 \u00bc% and 5 \u00be% over the long term but will allow our leverage ratio to reach 6% or slightly above in order to preserve flexibility in what appears to be continuing volatility in the market. At December 31st, 2007 our Tier 1 leverage ratio stands at 5.27%, down from 5.40% as of September 30th, 2007. The decline was driven by the legal reserve we recorded in the fourth quarter and growth in average assets offset partially by net earnings. Our tangible common equity ratio 3.49% level with 3.49% as of September 30th, 2007. This ratio was negatively affected by the reserve but was offset partially by net earnings.", "We announced this morning that we intend to conduct a public offering of approximately $500 million of non-dilutive securities for treatment as Tier 1 capital. We propose to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. Goldman Sachs will act as sole book runner. ", "Now let me answer some of your continuing questions about the asset backed commercial paper conduits. On our website we have provided an update to the slides we presented on our third quarter call. I will not discuss them in detail but suggest that you review these to update your knowledge as to the commercial paper conduit program at State Street. I will however refer to the first slide. As I stated last quarter, we created this program in 1992 primarily to address customer requests for high quality, highly rated commercial paper. The financial performance of the conduits during this time period has been very strong. They\u2019ve never suffered a credit loss on any asset they purchased, evidence of our strong credit discipline at State Street. Also, State Street in its capacity as a liquidity and credit provider has also never experienced a loss from having to fund under these facilities. We believe our approach to the asset backed commercial paper market is different than most other programs in that no assets from State Street balance sheet are sold to the conduits rather they are sourced from the market. ", "The first slide in the conduit group illustrates my point. Here you can see the assets by rating of State Street conduit program as of December 31st, 2007 on the left compared with the Moody\u2019s multiseller bank index as of August 31st, 2007 on the right, the last date for which data is currently available. As you can see here, the numbers did not change that much from what we disclosed in the third quarter. For State Street conduit program the three categories of AAA, AA and A represent 85% of the total. Five percent is rated BBB and the remaining 10% is non-rated. Let me differentiate these ratings from the average ratings of the holdings of a multiseller peer group using data provided Moody\u2019s which is on page 10 in the trends package provided on our website. ", "First, just to reiterate the assets in State Street\u2019s conduits are not sourced from our balance sheet. While State Street\u2019s conduits hold 61% of AAA rated securities, a peer group of the major multiseller conduits holds 11%. While State Street\u2019s conduits hold 16% in AA rated securities the peer group of the major multiseller conduits holds 13%. While State Street holds 10% of securities that are not rated the peer group of the major multiseller conduits holds 42%. While State Street holds 5% rated as BBB the index of major multiseller bank sponsors holds 12% within this rating category. And while State Street holds essentially no assets rated below BBB or investment grade the peer group of major multiseller banks holds 11%. And none of the assets in our conduits are sub-prime nor are there any structured in investments in the program. ", "The point of this detail is to provide data that will help you differentiate generally between the commercial paper issued by our conduits and that of other programs. These comparisons may help you understand the confidence we have in the quality of our assets. So what happened in the fourth quarter? Overall the asset backed commercial paper program continued to perform very well as it did in the third quarter. We believe that our asset quality was a major point of differentiation for the conduits during the period of time when some weaker programs exited the market and the overall asset backed commercial paper market contracted significantly. Our overall weighted average maturity of the commercial paper at the end of the fourth quarter of 2007 was approximately 20 days compared to approximately 23 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2006 and approximately at the end of the third quarter of 2007. ", "We disclosed that we held $730 million in State Street sponsored asset backed commercial paper at September 30th, 2007 and $222 million at October 15th, 2007 most of which was associated with our two Australian conduits which are much smaller than either of the other two. As of December 31st, 2007 we held $2 million of the asset backed commercial paper on our balance sheet and as of last Friday, January 11th, 2008 we held $58 million of the paper, well within our typical holdings as a dealer in the paper. We do not anticipate the consolidation of the conduits. If due to the triggering of liquidity asset purchase agreements or due to [FIN 46-R] we were required to acquire all the conduits\u2019 assets or consolidate the conduits using December 31st, 2007 estimated fair values, the loss would be approximately $530 million after tax. If the assets are the result of consolidation under [FIN 46-R] this would be an extraordinary loss for financial reporting purposes. This loss would reverse back into income over the remaining lives of the assets assuming the assets were held to maturity and State Street recovered the full principal amount of the securities as anticipated. ", "From a funding standpoint the risk I just described is included in our contingency funding plan. We believe that we can access multiple sources of liquidity to fund any such asset purchases. Our sources of this liquidity include borrowing from the overnight inter bank or repurchase markets issuing corporate commercial paper, issuing bank CDs and time deposits, and/or accessing the FED discount window. We in fact, as part of our contingency plan in the second half of 2007 raised approximately $14 billion of incremental liquidity given the market environment. Also we reduced the size of the program slightly in the fourth quarter. As Ron said last quarter it will take some time before we can size it in line with our capital. As you may remember it was $29.2 billion as of September 30th, 2007 and it stood at $28.8 billion as of December 31st, 2007. ", "So in conclusion, 2007 was a very strong year for State Street in terms of operating performance with nearly every revenue line on the income statement up in double-digits. We hope the information we provided about our balance sheet and our conduit program has been helpful and now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Ron who will provide our general outlook for 2008.", "Ronald Logue", "Thank you Ed. Looking back over the quarter and the year, I\u2019m certainly pleased with the performance of our core businesses. I think it\u2019s striking when you consider that even after the reserve we took we achieved earnings per share growth at the lower end of our original financial targets finishing the year at 10% annual earnings per share growth. I think it says something about the resiliency of our business and I believe, is as some think; we are headed for a slower growing economic environment in the US. This resiliency along with the momentum we have built up will allow us to continue to grow revenue faster than our competitors. ", "So specifically looking at the outlook of 2008 we expect our earnings per share on an operating basis excluding merger and integration costs to increase 10% to 15% compared to 2007 operating basis results of $4.57 per share. We expect our revenue to increase between 14% and 17% including Investors Financial, up from our traditional goal of 8% to 12%. We expect our operating return on equity to be between 14% and 17%. We expect to achieve these goals at the lower end of these ranges. We will have more detail for you on February 5th at our Investor and Analyst forum in New York City. We will also continue to perform against the tactics I laid out more than three years ago. We target positive operating leverage on an annual basis. We will continue to prudently manage our balance sheet to improve the return from our net interest revenue without taking significant credit or interest rate risks. Our non-US business stood at 41% of total revenue as of December, 2007 up from 39% pro-forma level as of December 31st, 2006 due to the Investors Financial acquisition. We expect growth in this business to continue to outpace the growth in the US as we execute against our goal of achieving 50% of our total revenue from non-US sources and since we have a higher percentage of our revenue coming from outside the US than our competitors, we believe this will be an important growth engine for us.", "We expect to see growth at SSgA continue to be a strong contributor to State Street. I also want to clarify that SSgA\u2019s US money market and cash funds are performing strongly and are well positioned for the current market environment with no exposure to asset backed commercial paper, SIBs, CDOs, or sub-prime home equity asset backed securities. Growth in SSgA\u2019s mutual fund cash funds increased 37% to $37.7 billion at December 31st, 2007 up $27.6 billion a year earlier.", "I also want to remind you that SSgA acts as a collateral manager of CDOs amounting to $6.7 billion which are issued by others. You may have read that one or more of them are subject to liquidation by the trustee. That decision and any impact on the funds will not be borne by SSgA but rest with the issuer. There is no financial impact to State Street. ", "So we begin 2008 with momentum from a strong 2007 operating result from both State Street and the acquired Investors Financial business and with our consolidation of Investors Financial exceeding expectations. I believe the winners in this business will be the organizations that can generate top line revenue growth even during slower economic environments. I also believe we know better now how to bring the strong revenue growth down to the bottom line. But for these reasons we have confidence that we will meet our 2008 financial goals despite what we anticipate in the US to be a less robust equity market. Ed and I are now happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from Ken Usdin \u2013 Bank of America", "Ken Usdin \u2013 Bank of America", "Good morning, Ed I was wondering if you could just talk us through on the net interest margin guidance, what your exact rates forecasts are as far as number of cuts or [inaudible] in the US or abroad and also what your expectation is for the funding costs for the capital raise and if that\u2019s incorporated within the guidance.", "Edward Resch", "Well I\u2019ll start with the second one first, I can\u2019t comment specifically as I\u2019m sure you appreciate because we just announced the transaction this morning, but we do have an estimated cost of the capital issuance included in the guidance for the year. We have a couple of offsetting things going on in terms of the margin in 2008 which is why I said that we were sticking with the 185 to 195 but probably will be toward the higher end. We\u2019re approaching certainly the first half of the year on a very conservative basis where we anticipate that we\u2019re going to be growing capital and we\u2019re thinking about the balance sheet on average as being relatively stable with the fourth quarter, the NIM being stable and we\u2019ll grow the capital and run the ratios at or above the top end of the ranges and we\u2019re doing this for the reasons we said previously, which is conservatism. We\u2019ll also probably not be buying back any stock in the first quarter and maybe the first half. ", "In terms what we expect in terms of the FED we have the probable benefit which is partially baked into our NIM expectation of the FED cutting. We expect them to cut at the end of this month down to 4%. If they go below that and there\u2019s possibly more of a likelihood of that in the last week or so than there was before that, we have the offset in our forecast for the ECB of the Bank of England which we\u2019re currently forecasting the ECB to be down about 3% to 3\u00be% and the B of E to 4% to 4\u00be % by mid year so the proposed FED decreases will help us in terms of net interest margin. The proposed foreign central bank decreases, principally the ECB and the Bank of England will hurt or net interest margin. The bias is toward the FED helping a little bit more than the foreign central banks hurting us because we\u2019re still much more dominant in terms of the FED. But that\u2019s our rate forecast and the reason why we have the margin still at around 195.", "Ken Usdin \u2013 Bank of America", "So just to be clear, if the FED goes further than 4 and the foreign central banks don\u2019t move there could potentially be upside.", "Edward Resch", "Yes.", "Ken Usdin \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay my second question is just on the capital, understanding the conservatism that you want to have and building up to 6% can you give us any color or commentary you have on any negative impacts you expect on capital from incremental negative pricing on the APS that you hold or any other negative calls on capital that you might expect through the year.", "Edward Resch", "We really don\u2019t have any negative calls on capital expected this year and the mark on the investment portfolio is something that we have in our plans and we have an expectation already baked in, in terms of the capital guidance I just gave you. ", "Ken Usdin \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Good morning guys, lets just circle back to that question on the ECB rates and the Bank of England rates if the foreign governments lower their rates doesn\u2019t that help your non-US deposit costs of which were about $64 billion and shouldn\u2019t that be a positive\u2026?", "Edward Resch", "Yes it will on the liability side Brian but we have assets generally shorter than liabilities in those currencies affected by those rates so the assets will re price more quickly than the liabilities which is why it\u2019s a net negative for us right now given where we\u2019re positioned.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Right that your assets are much, your level of assets are substantially lower than the $64 billion correct that are key to [those rates]?", "Edward Resch", "Yes that\u2019s why I said that the US FED rate cuts on balance will help us more than the foreign rate cuts will hurt us.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Right, near term. But I would just think it\u2019s the, if the ECB is actually cutting that would be enough of a positive driver on your deposit costs that that would give you actual NIM expansion, so that would be actually a good environment for this year if everyone was cutting, but you\u2019re saying no, its really just more\u2026.", "Edward Resch", "Net it\u2019s not.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Okay the $298 deposit costs that we saw in the fourth quarter versus the $325 is that, what was the main driver of that decline?", "Edward Resch", "Decreased US rates. ", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Of non-US deposit costs, the $325 to $298\u2026oh are you basing that off of the US rates?", "Edward Resch", "Our deposit costs went down overall because of the decreasing US rates.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "No, the non-US deposit costs, you said they went down from 325 basis points in the third quarter according to your average balance sheet down to 298 basis points in the fourth quarter. The $64 billion of non-US deposit costs?", "Edward Resch", "Okay.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "So they went down from 325 basis points to 298 from the third quarter to the fourth quarter? My question is are you linking those to the FED decline or is there some other driver of that reduction in deposit costs outside of the US?", "Edward Resch", "Well part of it is because we swap a portion of that back to US dollars, that\u2019s the main driver of that decline.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Okay I got it, so you\u2019re actually more leveraged to the FEDs even on that line on that deposit line. Then just switching over to your outlook for \u201908, how are you thinking about securities lending revenue and foreign exchange trading in your \u201908 outlook?", "Ronald Logue", "I don\u2019t think you can take the fourth quarter numbers and multiply them by four. We\u2019re still seeing some volatility in foreign exchange. My sense is and again this is our forecast, we would think that gradually over time they would come back down into more normal levels and that\u2019s what we\u2019re planning for anyway. ", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Right, do you see it in the near term them staying at elevated levels for both securities lending and foreign exchange trading?", "Ronald Logue", "Well I guess you would have to define the near term, maybe in the next month or so but I would think that it would come down beginning towards the end of the first quarter would be our guess.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Right okay. So when you say more normal levels, you\u2019re run rate say earlier in the early part of this year?", "Edward Resch", "Back to the early part of I\u2019d say, the first half of 2007 be more representative.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Okay and so that\u2019s implied in your guidance for \u201908?", "Edward Resch", "Yes.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Okay and what are you assuming for equity market returns in \u201908?", "Edward Resch", "We\u2019re assuming a flat S&P, high 14s, around 1500 for the full year on average. It\u2019s obviously up from where we are today but when we entered the year that was our expectation from a budgeting standpoint. ", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Okay and then the processing fees being down from $61 million to $38 million was most of that due to contracting spreads in the conduits or you also mentioned lower JV revenue.", "Edward Resch", "Both, you\u2019re referring to processing fees in the quarter Brian right?", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Yeah, the $38 million.", "Edward Resch", "Yes, the conduits had a bit of a negative affect there. We have a lot going through that line as you know, we have the equity pick-up, we have certain tax advantage investments that we do, there\u2019s a service fees, software fees from some software that we sell, so it\u2019s a mixture of a lot of different things that go into that line, but the conduits were down from a revenue standpoint as well as the equity. ", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Right but assuming that the cost of rolling over that CP are lower now because of the quality of your program should we expect that to bump back up closer to the $60 million type of normalized level?", "Edward Resch", "Assuming that we keep the conduits at the same size the answer to that question is yes but as we said we expect to better calibrate the conduits as against our capital so the answer over the longer term is probably no.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Okay great and then just lastly on the core servicing, can you just remind us again you went $825 billion last quarter in asset servicing mandates, if you can just remind us how much of that is included in fourth quarter numbers?", "Ronald Logue", "I could give you a calculated guess here, I\u2019d say maybe somewhere between a third and a half, we will continue to be installing in the first and second quarters of this year. ", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Okay so about roughly a half is already in the numbers?", "Ronald Logue", "Yes.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "And then the $300 billion obviously none of that is converted in the fourth quarter yet?", "Edward Resch", "A little bit but not a lot.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Great thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr - UBS", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "Just a couple of quickies, I think you mentioned $116 billion in net inflows for the year, can you just tell us what it was in fourth quarter and maybe separate any impact on [BOCO] the internationally people that left?", "Edward Resch", "Was that net inflows of what?", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "I think you mentioned $116 billion for the year.", "Edward Resch", "[inaudible] Net, new business?", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "Correct. What was fourth quarter and what was the impact on the team that left in Boston Company. ", "Edward Resch", "I don\u2019t see any real impact on the team that left at this point. Fourth quarter it was flat. ", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "Fourth quarter was flat.", "Edward Resch", "Yes.", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "Okay and on the money market side, given the strength I\u2019ve seen in the industry, that was kind of interesting assets under management were actually down 1% in the quarter, anything special there?", "Edward Resch", "No, nothing real special. ", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "And I think you just went through the net new business of like a trillion over the last two quarters, did I miss a comment, did you make a comment on the current state of pipelines. ", "Edward Resch", "Pipeline is still strong, servicing business is strong especially outside the United States. We\u2019re going to anticipate in a strong pipeline and continued strong winds.", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "Great and then maybe last question on the ABCP conduits, I think you\u2019ve done a great job showing us the quality of the underlying assets, and given us some maturity comments and what\u2019s on balance sheet, if we could step back for two seconds and just think, okay you give us, if it all comes on balance sheet what the after tax loss would be and that\u2019s just a mark to market and that spreads wide and I\u2019m certain of the asset classes deteriorate, right? Because there\u2019s a big widening this quarter but spreads wide a lot, so is there an in between, is the worst case is nobody wants to roll these anymore and all of it comes on balance sheet and that\u2019s your mark to market hit right?", "Edward Resch", "Right.", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "In the interim, is there any other way we should be thinking about what a cushion or [subordination] protection would be if, or is it black and white, is it it either continues to roll or it comes on balance sheet?", "Edward Resch", "I\u2019ll take a shot at that Glenn, it\u2019s not black or white and we present the analysis as though all of the $28.8 billion came on as of 12/31/07. In reality the conduits are comprised of over 800 individual positions and each one of those positions has a liquidity asset purchase agreement associated with it. So there is a continuum if you will from one liquidity asset purchase agreement being invoked which would mean we\u2019d have to buy the assets from the conduit at par to the full consolidation of all $28.8 billion. So it\u2019s not a black or white situation where it\u2019s zero or $28.8 billion. An important point to note though from a P&L standpoint is that related to the liquidity asset purchase agreement if it was to be invoked, there would probably be a loss associated with the purchase of a specific asset assuming it\u2019s in an unrealized loss position, because we\u2019re obligated to purchase at par. ", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "And as far as right now, you mentioned the small amount that\u2019s on balance sheet, so we\u2019re to assume that everything else is rolling and can you make a comment on what the yield on the paper and aggregate has done over the last three months.", "Edward Resch", "You\u2019re correct, everything is rolling. We only have the $58 million on the books as of last Friday. Things have actually overall gotten a little bit better as [Libor] has come in with the new year, I think there\u2019s a general expectation in the asset backed commercial paper market that rates are coming down so there\u2019s an overall higher level of interest. The cost of the funding overall for the program in the fourth quarter was 5.584%.", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "Great okay thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Thomas McCrohan \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Thomas McCrohan \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Good morning everyone, two quick questions, one on Investors Financial and a follow-up on the investment securities portfolio available for sale. The baseline results that you included in the press release for Investors Financial, can you just give us a sense what\u2019s included in the fee revenue categories, what clause [inaudible] performance Investors Financial and what\u2019s included in other revenue in that bucket in the baseline results.", "Edward Resch", "Let\u2019s just do it from the bottom up. All other revenue is basically their net interest revenue. Fee revenue is everything else. And what\u2019s been driving the over performance for Investors Financial were the first two quarters since we\u2019ve acquired it has been strong fee revenue, especially fee revenue retention which has been higher than what we have modeled, and then stronger net interest revenue for some of the same reasons we talked about net interest revenue being strong at overall State Street.", "Thomas McCrohan \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Net interest revenue for those guys at least last trend report I had from them was, it didn\u2019t seem like that was a big driver, they were generating about $50 million of net interest revenue in Q1 of \u201907, they did $40 million this quarter, so it seemed like a lot of the out performance was more on the fee side, is that fair?", "Edward Resch", "It\u2019s both net interest revenue and fees have been very strong for Investors Financial.", "Thomas McCrohan \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Even though they were $10 million higher in the first quarter of 2007?", "Edward Resch", "Yes.", "Thomas McCrohan \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. Can you give us a feel for how much foreign exchange fees are included in that $201 million of fee revenue for Investors Financial?", "Edward Resch", "Yes I can, foreign exchange for the full year was $43 million. ", "Thomas McCrohan \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Forty-three so that, and they did like $18 million in Q1 of \u201907 so that was a big part of their ability to out perform and how about core servicing fees, do you have them for the quarter?", "Edward Resch", "For the quarter?", "Thomas McCrohan \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Yes, the $43 million you gave me was for the quarter or the year?", "Edward Resch", "For the year.", "Thomas McCrohan \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Oh for the year, okay.", "Edward Resch", "What would you like Tom?", "Thomas McCrohan \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "The core servicing fees for Investors Financial?", "Edward Resch", "Okay for the full year, $304 million.", "Thomas McCrohan \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay, maybe I\u2019ll just follow-up with you later; I\u2019m not sure how that drives the two in one. And securities portfolio, can you just talk a little bit about the unrealized losses that seem to be growing this year, is that a function of changes in interest rates and if so which rates should we be looking at or is it just more of a liquidity hit that you\u2019ve been taking this quarter. I mean unrealized losses this quarter went up about $400 million, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense, is that going to reverse itself next year or what should we be tracking for that.", "Edward Resch", "Well we have two somewhat offsetting factors going on in terms of the mark. First of all it\u2019s a function of US interest rates in the investment portfolio and with the benefit that we\u2019ve received from the FED cutting rates in the US we\u2019re actually seeing a decline in the unrealized mark associated with that element of the mark. But we are seeing a continued illiquidity in certain of the asset classes especially the asset backed element of the portfolio which is more than offsetting the benefit we\u2019re receiving from the FED rate cuts. So net net it\u2019s been a negative because of the lower liquidity in the second half of \u201907 than what we had previously. ", "Thomas McCrohan \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay well thanks very much.", "Operator", "At this time there are no further questions in queue, so I\u2019ll go ahead and turn the call back over to Mr. Ron Logue. Please go ahead.", "Ronald Logue", "Thank you, I don\u2019t have any further comments other than we hope to see all of you February 5th at our Investors Conference in New York City so we\u2019ll see you then.

[Operator Instructions] Now I\u2019d like to introduce Kelley MacDonald, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations at State Street.", "Kelley MacDonald", "Good morning everyone. Before Ron Logue our Chairman and CEO and CFO, Ed Resch begin their remarks I\u2019d like to remind you that during this call we may make forward looking statements relating to the corporations financial outlook and business environment, exposure to claims and the adequacy of its reserve among other things. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward looking statements as a result of various important factors including those discussed in State Street\u2019s 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K and is subsequent filings with the SEC.", "We encourage you to review those filings including the sections on risk factors concerning any forward looking statements we may make today. Any such forward looking statements speak only as of today, April 15, 2008, and the corporation does not undertake to revise such forward looking statements to reflect events or changes after today. In addition, information related to this webcast including information concerning and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures referred to in this webcast is available in the Investor Relations section of our website www.StateStreet.com/Stockholder under the heading annual reports and financial trends.", "I\u2019d also like to remind you that this morning we will be using several slides to illustrate some of the material that Ed Resch will present regarding the performance of the assets in the corporations investment portfolio and of the Commercial Paper conduit. You can access these from our website and some are also included as an addendum in our trends package. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ron.", "Ron Logue", "Good morning everybody. Before we begin to review the results of the quarter let me give you my thoughts on the impact on State Street of the turmoil we\u2019ve seen in the financial market in the past quarter. I\u2019ll provide an overview of the quarter and Ed will provide details behind our performance as well as some specific detail with respect to our investment portfolio and our asset backed Commercial Paper program. I\u2019ll return to give our view on the outlook for the rest of 2008.", "During the quarter, as I\u2019m sure you are well aware, unprecedented illiquidity continued in the fixed income markets. At the end of the fourth quarter things seemed a little better but in February the markets froze up again and then equity markets declined rapidly to about 1,350 on average for the S&P, the point that we estimated on February 5th for the entire year. It obviously remains to be seen where we\u2019ll go from here but we are still assuming an average of about 1,350 for the S&P. At the same time the Fed has taken action to support the financial community, decreasing the rate at which banks can borrow and also cutting the Fed funds rate by 200 basis points in three meetings.", "What\u2019s been the impact of these events on us? First of all, and very importantly our core businesses remained strong, outperforming the markets on both the equity and fixed income sides. Compared to the first quarter of 2007 our fee income grew 43% and was up 29% excluding the revenue from the acquired Investors Financial business and principally to our success in selling our products and services to new and existing customers. We strengthened our capital position with the issuance of $500 million of tier one qualified regulatory capital in the middle of January and of course, as you can see we supported our equity with strong net earnings.", "Our trading business and our securities finance business both recorded significant increases compared to the prior year and the prior quarter. Net interest revenue also increased 92% compared to the prior years first quarter. This quarter did not go without its challenges, however. Due to continuing illiquidity the mark to market on our investment portfolio increased as of March 31, which Ed will discuss in a few minutes. We also saw an increase in the unrealized loss on the assets held by our conduits. The decline in equity valuations provided some headwind against growth both in asset servicing and asset management fee revenue as well. Considering the decline in the equity markets both businesses performed well, fueled by net new business.", "State Street, this morning reported a strong quarter\u2019s performance with increased revenue on nearly every line of the income statement when compared to the prior years first quarter. Our total revenue increased more than 50% and our operating earnings per share excluding the merger and integration costs in the first quarter of 2008 were up 49% compared to the first quarter of 2007. Also excluding these costs we achieved 19.4% operating return on equity in the first quarter of 2008 compared to 17.4% in the first quarter of 2007.", "We are off to a strong start in performing against our goals which, as you know, our growth and revenue of between 14% and 17%, growth in operating earnings per share of 10% to 15% and achieving an operating return on equity of 14% to 17%. Even excluding the revenue from Investor Financial, comparing the first quarter of 2008 with the first quarter of 2007 revenue grew 39%. Also excluding the merger and integration costs in the first quarter of 2008 on an operating basis we achieved positive operating leverage of 810 basis points, our 14th consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage when measured on a year over year basis.", "Considering the market challenges we are pleased with the strong year over year growth in our core businesses, our asset servicing and asset management businesses including internationally. On a year over year basis servicing fees increased 34% and management fees grew 7%. Those same market conditions also presented opportunities for over performance in foreign exchange and in securities finance as was true in the second half of 2007. Foreign exchange revenue in the first quarter was up 74% compared to the first quarter of 2007 and securities finance revenue was up more than 200%.", "We\u2019ve now completed the first nine months of the consolidation of Investors Financial and we remain confident that we will achieve our customer revenue retention target of 90%. As you are no doubt aware, we have been servicing [Bockley] Global Investors since we acquired IBT last July and have been in discussions with them from that point about an ongoing servicing relationship. I\u2019m pleased to announce that we have now finalized an agreement with [Bockley] Global Investors to continue our servicing relationship. State Street will provide a wide range of investment operation services to BGI from our current locations that include Sacramento and Boston.", "This agreement follows a comprehensive review by BGI and they made their determination based upon the solution that would provide the most benefit to their clients and their shareholders. Obviously we are thrilled with this development but as you can appreciate we won\u2019t be discussing any further details beyond the facts that I\u2019ve just outlined. We will not be commenting publicly from here on about BGI or the terms of our agreement.", "As you can see from the press release issued this morning the performance of the business we acquired from Investors Financial was excellent and continues to exceed our expectations, adding $232 million in fully tax equivalent revenue in the first quarter from Investors Financial we reported a neutral result per share this quarter up from $0.01 dilution in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect the acquisition to be modestly accretive this year slightly ahead of our original plan.", "The consolidation is proceeding according to plan. We have already converted almost 40% of the customer products. We already have commitments from customers representing 91% of the annualized revenue. As customers convert we are removing costs while also providing access for those customers to a broad range of new products and services. Beyond the success of the Investors Financial consolidation some of the first quarter wins include, on the servicing side first from TIAA CREF we won $225 billion in assets for which we will provide custody, accounting and daily valuation for mutual funds and separate accounts and 529 plans as well as statutory accounting and unit value calculations for non-managed separate accounts.", "We also secured a new mandate from the Municipal Employee\u2019s Retirement System of Michigan to provide a range of investment services including daily accounting and performance measurement for $6 billion in public fund assets. Very importantly we renewed relationships for servicing assets with five public funds for a total of $186 billion in combined assets. The funds renewing their business include State Retirement and Pension System of Maryland, the University of California Regents Group, The Montana Board of Investments, the City of Philadelphia Board of Pensions and Retirement, and the Minnesota State Board of Investment a customer for over 20 years.", "In addition, the State of Nebraska renewed a servicing mandate for $12 billion an agreement that we have held since 1995. We also retained the British Petroleum Pension Trustees Limited to continue providing custody, accounting, securities lending and performance measurement services to the funds approximately \u20a414 billion in assets. We\u2019ve been servicing BP for over 20 years as well. State Street will provide custody, accounting, and fund administration for Five Scotiabank International Wealth Management Fund based in Cayman.", "State Street is providing custody, fund accounting and investment management services to Scotiabank since February 2002. Expanded mandate State Street will now service approximately $4.54 billion Canadian Dollars in total assets for Scotiabank. State Street International Financial Data Services our international transfer agency joint venture with EST have been appointed by Rensburg Fund Management to provide a range of service solutions for its UK Uni-trust Fund for approximately \u20a41 billion in assets.", "We also had a joint win from ING Direct between Investor Services and SSGA. Service three new ING Street Wise funds and manage four investment strategies for each of those funds. These wins plus many others totaled about $600 billion in assets serviced. State Street Global Advisors also added significant new business as well. California Public Employees Retirement System renewed their contract with State Street Global Advisors for providing currency overlay strategies for $2.6 billion. Los Angeles City Retirement System retained SSGA to manage a $701 million MSCI World X US Index Portfolio.", "SSGA was appointed by Universities Superannuation Scheme Limited to manage \u20a4100 hedge fund mandate. The portfolio will be specifically tailored to meet US investment objectives and will be managed on a segregated basis by SSGA. Nestle Waters USA chose SSGA to provide target date funds as its qualified default investment alternative in its 401(NYSE:K) plan. Net new business at SSGA for the first quarter of 2008 totaled $69 billion. In the first quarter 51% of SSGA\u2019s new business came from asset strategies, continuing emphasis for SSGA. ", "Let me now turn to our balance sheet for a minute. Net interest revenue and net interest margin again performed very well. A 92% increase in fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2007. A net interest margin of 220 basis points in the first quarter of 2008. Our investment portfolio is performing as expected. We have benefited from the recent actions of the Fed in cutting the Fed Funds Rate. Ed will provide further details about these results and our outlook in a few minutes.", "With pressure from a decline in equity markets we will watch expenses carefully adding people primarily to support our growth outside the US and service new customers while managing our rate of expense growth against our revenue growth. However, we will continue to invest in the technology needed to support new product development which we believe will continue to fuel our growth. We also continue to make investments in risk and compliance infrastructure as global regulatory requirements change.", "Despite the turmoil in the markets over the past quarter I\u2019m very pleased with State Street\u2019s performance. Both growth in revenue as well as operating earnings per share. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ed who will provide some of the details of our financial performance last quarter, further information about the performance of the assets in our investment portfolio and the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Program.", "Ed Resch", "Good morning everyone. This quarter certainly underscored the strength of our business. We reported strong growth in both fee and net interest revenue. Please note that all of the numbers I am presenting will include the results of the acquired Investors Financial Business for the fourth quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008.", "Our growth in Asset Servicing, Asset Management and Securities Finance revenue continues at a combined rate of about 43% compared to the first quarter of 2007. Trading Services revenue, particularly Securities Finance Revenue performed very well given the volatility in the market. We continue to expand globally introducing new services to a broad base of customers. We also reported strong growth in debt interest revenue. Obviously the positive trends I mentioned last quarter continued into this quarter as well as some additional benefit from the three cuts in the Fed Funds Rate this quarter.", "I\u2019ll provide more detail on our net interest income and margin in the outlook for 2008 in a few minutes. Our assets under custody at March 31, 2008, were $14.9 trillion compared to $12.3 trillion on March 31, 2007. Our assets under management stood at $2.0 trillion at the end of this quarter up from $1.8 trillion at March 31, 2007. As Ron noted the business acquired from Investors Financial continue to perform well as we reported this morning total revenue in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2007 including Investors Financial was up 52% and excluding Investors Financial total revenue was up 39%.", "Excluding variable expenses resulting from revenue growth in the first quarter of 2008 we saved an additional $59 million for cumulative expense savings of $140 million since the acquisition closed. That\u2019s an annual rate of $190 million. We are on track to achieve our annualized target of $350 million we set last February. Due to continued strength in revenue growth from customers we acquired from Investors Financial we now expect the acquisition to be modestly accretive to our 2008 results.", "I hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to review our earnings press release distributed this morning. Please review the financial statements included with our earnings press release and in our financial trends package on our website for detailed information on our financial results. Now to those results. This morning all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results excluding the merger and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Investors Financial in the fourth quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008 and the fourth quarter 2007 charge related to certain income strategies at State Street Global Advisors.", "On an operating basis earnings per share in the first quarter were $1.39 up 49% from $0.93 per share last year and up slightly from $1.38 in the fourth quarter. Revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled $2.6 billion for the quarter an increase of 52.2% from last years first quarter compared with a 44.1% increase in expenses to $1.748 billion on an operating basis. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 revenue was up 4.2% and expenses on an operating basis increased 6%.", "Return on equity on an operating basis was 19.4% in the first quarter up from 17.4% in the first quarter of 2007 and up from 18.7% in the fourth quarter. Servicing fees were up 34% from the first quarter of 2007 due to the additional revenue from Investors Financial customers as well as increases in new business from existing and new customers. They were down slightly from the fourth quarter due entirely to the decline in market valuation offset partially by growth in net new business.", "Management fees were up 7% from the first quarter of 2007 due primarily to net new business partially offset by a declining performance fees and the impact of a decline in the equity markets. Management fee revenue was down 6% from the fourth quarter again due primarily to a 10% decline in equity markets and lower performance fees. Performance fees were about $7 million down from $15 million a year ago and down from $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.", "Based on our strong securities finance business we saw continuing strength in the cash and money market assets under management up 5% from last years first quarter and up 8% from the fourth quarter. We saw an 8.4% decline from the fourth quarter of 2007 or a little less than $100 billion in the equity assets less than the 10% decline in quarter end equity valuations. Fixed income assets increased about 6% a rate higher than the market averages. ", "Higher volumes and stronger volatility in our foreign exchange business drove the 74% increase in foreign exchange trading revenue compared with the first quarter of 2007. Foreign exchange revenue was up 5% from the fourth quarter due primarily to increased volatility partially offset by a decline in volumes. Brokerage and other fees were up $33 million or 49% to $101 million in the previous years first quarter. This increase was due primarily to $22 million in fees from the Currenex business which was acquired in March 2007 as well as increases in the non-US transition management business.", "Brokerage and other fee revenue were slightly higher than the fourth quarter of 2007. Also, due to the fixed income market disruptions we saw continued demand for securities finance in the first quarter. Securities Finance revenue was up 209% from last years first quarter due primarily to improved spreads and was up 18% compared to last years fourth quarter also due primarily to improved spreads following significant actions by the Fed. We had $644 billion in average securities on loan and the duration on the securities lending book was 26 days.", "Processing and other fees declined 26% from the prior years first quarter and decreased slightly from the fourth quarter. The reason for this result is that we recorded a loss of $11.6 million on the purchase of $850 million of AAA assets except for one security which was rated AA from two of our conduits under a liquidity asset purchase agreement. Due to the market volatility we recorded approximately $12 million of mark to market adjustments. Economically we do not expect the loss and therefore we expect to recover this adjustment as the assets mature.", "In addition, conduit related revenue of $11.6 million was lower compared to the first quarter or the fourth quarter of 2007 down $14 million from the first quarter and down $2.4 million from the fourth quarter. Net interest revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased from the first quarter 2007 by $311 million or 92% from $337 million to $648 million and was up $75 million from the fourth quarter. In addition, compared to the first quarter of 2007 net interest margin of 220 basis points was up 75 basis points from the first quarter of 2007 and was up 25 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2007.", "Some of the trends that benefited us in the first quarter compared to the year ago quarter include improved spreads on our portfolio caused primarily by the lower cost funding due to the recent actions by the Federal Reserve. The impact of additional revenue from the acquired Investors Financial business and increased transaction deposits from non-US customers. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008 we benefited from the improved spreads due to the recent actions by the Fed offset partially by a slight change in customer mix.", "Now let me turn to the investment portfolio. The average investment portfolio increased from $65.6 billion to $73.3 billion during the first quarter from the year ago quarter and was down from $75.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007. Mortgage backed securities in the first quarter of 2008 represented about 40% or $29 billion of the average investment portfolio. Floating rate asset backed securities in the first quarter 2008 represented about 33% of the average investment portfolio or $24.1 billion.", "We believe this portfolio overall is conservatively structured and well seasoned. The portfolio has been performing well, has been withstanding the market stresses and is well diversified. If you look at slide two in the Investment Portfolio slide package on the website you can see the ratings of the portfolio over time. Ninety fourth percent are AAA and AA similar to year ended 2007. Eighty seven percent are AAA and 7% are AA. Four percent are rated A and 1% are rated BBB. No securities are rated below BBB.", "A lot has been said over the past few months and quarters regarding the extraordinary events impacting the fixed income markets. These are not ordinary times and these are not orderly markets. Despite the high credit quality of the investment portfolio the illiquidity in the marketplace and resulting prices affecting fixed income securities have caused the unrealized pre-tax loss on our portfolio to increase to $3.2 billion at March 31, 2008, up from an unrealized pre-tax loss of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2007 and an unrealized pre-tax loss of $309 million a year ago.", "We believe that these prices are not reflective of the underlying value of the securities. Several examples will help me illustrate that point. Look at the element of the portfolio we hold in student loans, about $9.2 billion, the vast majority about 90% of which is covered by a 97% federal government guarantee. At December 31, 2007, these securities were trading at 98% of par. Today they are trading at 92% of par. There has been no significant change in the credit quality of the securities so what are the markets telling us?", "I think that the market is confirming that it is illiquid. In fact, there are few buyers or few sellers at this price. Or look at the 18 sub-prime securities that the rating agencies put on credit watch at the end of January. They just recently reaffirmed the ratings on 17 of these leaving only one unwatched due to its down grade of the insurance wrap provider. They are all rated AA but are priced between 40% and 89% of par at March month end.", "These are just two examples of the impact that the current market dislocations and sporadic for selling have had on market prices for investment grade bonds. We continue to believe that our portfolio is not at risk of permanent impairment and is not currently other than temporarily impaired. We base this belief on the result of the extensive credit analysis that we have performed and continue to perform in the portfolio and believe that we will cover the principle at maturity.", "I\u2019d like to stop here and provide you a deeper look into the securities within the portfolio. If you would turn to slide three in the Investment Portfolio slide package you can see some of the data I am presenting. First, 15 securities have been downgraded as of March 31, 2008; these 15 securities do not include those securities that were downgraded based on downgrades of the insurance wrap provider. Based on the total number of securities downgraded by the rating agencies during the past two quarters we believe the number of rating agency actions affecting our securities is very modest and is a testimony to the quality of the assets in our portfolio.", "Lastly, I\u2019ll address the asset backed securities that are collateralized by first liens sub-prime mortgages, a portfolio which I have been commenting on since the second quarter of last year. This section of the portfolio has a $933 million unrealized pre-tax loss at March 31, 2008, which is about one third of the total unrealized pre-tax mark to market loss for the entire portfolio. If you turn to slide four and five, first of all the portfolio has performed as we have expected.", "Our portfolio of asset backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages is $5.9 billion as of March 31, 2008, down from $6.2 billion as of December 31, 2007. Seventy percent of the portfolio was rated AAA and the remaining 30% is rated AA. Three of the securities have been downgraded, again, a very small number in light of the downgrades issued by the rating agencies over the last few quarters. We have a 41% average credit enhancement based on the structure itself which gives us confidence that these securities will mature par. ", "You can see this credit enhancement grow over time with pay-downs that we\u2019ve received. Last March the credit enhancement was 34% which is increased to the 41% I mentioned as of March 31. This means that even if every mortgage backing and asset were to default we would not lose one dollar and deliver recovery rate for those assets fell below 59%. Further, we believe the assets are well diversified by Vintage Geography an originator.", "As I just noted the negative mark to market on this portion of the portfolio has increased to about $933 million with no securities on credit watch. Since so many securities in the category have been downgraded industry wide over the past two quarters we have confidence that our credit process at State Street has served us well to date and that we expect these securities to mature at par. However, during the quarter we recorded $11.5 million in other than temporary impairment which was one asset backed security collateralized by home equity lines of credit and wrapped by Figic as the insurance provider.", "Based on our credit analysis of the underlying collateral and our assessment of the wrap provider we concluded that a portion of the fair value decline was attributable to credit and therefore we wrote the securities down to its current fair value. If you review slides six through eight you can also get some further detail about the monoline coverage we have on the portfolio. Mostly in the municipal bond book. Note that our overall rating will decline only slightly from 94% to 92% if all the wraps were simultaneously removed.", "The last line gives you a breakdown of the assets by wrap provider where you can see that 99% of the coverage is due to the municipal bond investments usually a very high performing asset class. In conclusion of my remarks on the unrealized mark to market loss in the securities portfolio why do we have such confidence in our portfolio when many other are writing down assets? We are very selective in the assets we buy and put these choices through a rigorous credit process. On an ongoing basis we monitor the performance of these securities and have found them all to be performing well.", "Our investment portfolio consists of securities with significant levels of structural credit enhancement which provides protection against difficult economic environments. I hope my remarks have given you some comfort in our portfolio so you can understand the source of our confidence.", "As to our outlook for interest revenue for the remainder of 2008. In February, I commented that due to the actions of the Fed in January we were increasing our outlook for 2008. I said that we expected net interest margin to be between 2.0% and 2.10% and that the Fed would hold steady at Fed Funds Rate of 2.5%. Obviously the Fed has been more aggressive in cutting the Fed Funds Rate that we expected and so now we believe that the US rates will be 2% by year end. Due to the current market environment we still believe that an interest margin will be between 2% and 2.1% however it may trend toward the upper end of that range.", "This outlook for the year assumes that growth in non-US transaction balances may moderate from the levels we have seen in 2007 but we maintain the existing favorable mix of customer liabilities and an expectation that the investment portfolio will re-price as about 7 billion older fixed rate securities mature in 2008 but these will be reinvested at lower rates than the 2007 maturities carried. Also, I should mention that we are not purchasing securities in any significant amount right now as we are continuing to increase our liquidity in the face of the current market disruption.", "Future rate cuts from the Fed will help us but the benefit may tail off in early 2009. In February we provided an outlook that the ECB will be at about 3.5% by year end and the Bank of England will reduce rates to about 4.75%. We still believe these are realistic estimates. These declining rates in Europe we feel will reduce our spreads and as the US Fed stops cutting rates the benefits we have been enjoying will abate and so in the second half of the year we may not see the net interest margin that we\u2019ve enjoyed this quarter.", "Lastly, we expect the average \u201908 balance sheet to be roughly flat with the average balance sheet in the fourth quarter 2007. Our duration gap has not changed significantly from year end. Our assets are almost 12 months and our liabilities are eight months. The investment portfolio duration is about one year seven months up slightly from the fourth quarter 2007 and from the first quarter 2007. ", "I will now turn back to expenses. As a reminder I am speaking about expenses on an operating basis. Salaries and benefits expenses increased 44% compared to the first quarter 2007 due primarily to the impact of incentive compensation as a result of improved performance, the impact of additional staff from Investors Financial as well as staff added to service new business wins. Compared to the fourth quarter 2007 salaries and benefits expense increased 14% primarily for incentive compensation due to improved performance and higher benefits costs partially offset by reductions in Investors Financials staff.", "Transaction processing expenses increased 26% compared to the year ago quarter due primarily to the acquisition of Investors Financial as well as increased volumes in the asset servicing and trading business and declined 12% from the fourth quarter of 2007 due primarily to receipt of a depository rebate. Occupancy expense increased 17% from the first quarter of 2007 due primarily to the costs associated with Investors Financial and was up 3% from the fourth quarter of 2007 due to investments to support new business particularly in Europe.", "Other expenses were up 106% compared to the year ago quarter primarily due to higher professional fees, increased securities processing costs and the impact of the amortization expense associated with the acquisitions we completed in 2007. They were down 6% compared to the fourth quarter 2007 primarily due to lower Investors Financial costs and lower securities processing costs. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 34.0% down from 35.0% in the first quarter of 2007. We expect our tax rate for all of 2008 to be about 34%.", "Let me review in detail the capital structure at State Street. The principle capital ratio that we manage to is the tier one leverage ratio. We have historically targeted between 5.25% and 5.75% but given the market environment we expect our leverage ratio to grow to a level above the top of the range in order to preserve flexibility in what appears to be a continuing volatile market. At March 31, 2008, our tier one leverage ratio stand at 6.08% up from 5.26% as of December 31, 2007. The increase was driven by the issuance of $500 million of tier one capital in mid January, our strong net earnings offset partially by growth in average assets.", "Our tangible common equity ratio is 2.92% down from 3.49% at December 31, 2007. Our tangible common equity grew approximately $764 million in the first quarter largely from retained earnings; employee based stock compensation and the amortization of intangibles. However, the growth was more than offset by the after tax increase in the FAS 115 mark in addition to the lower level tangible common equity period end total assets grew by about $12 billion.", "Next let me review the impact of the assets held in the conduits in relation to our capital. Our out website we have provided an update to the slide we presented on the third and fourth quarter calls. In the interest of time I will not discuss them in detail today but suggest that you review these to update your knowledge as to the Commercial Paper Conduit Program at State Street. I will however, refer to slides two through five.", "As I stated last quarter we created this program in 1992 primarily to address customer requests for high quality, highly rated Commercial Paper. The conduits have never suffered a credit loss in any asset they purchased, evidence of a strong credit discipline that I just referred to. Due to illiquidity in the market and pursuant to the terms of the liquidity asset purchase agreement between State Street Bank and Trust and the conduits we were required to purchase $850 million in assets from the conduits and brought them on to our balance sheet during the first quarter.", "This purchase was not due to a credit event, i.e. not triggered by default or downgrade of any underlying conduit securities but simply due to wider spreads in the asset backed commercial paper caused by illiquidity. These assets are primarily backed by residential mortgages and student loans and all are rated AAA except for one which is rated AA. We classified the in the available for sale portfolio and as you may recall from our earlier presentation they are floating rate assets.", "We firmly believe these are high quality assets and like the other securities in our investment portfolio we expect them to mature at par. As I explained previously this caused a small pre-tax loss of about $12 million which flowed through our income statement in the processing and other fee revenue line. We believe this amount will come back to us as the assets mature in the future.", "The first slide in the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Group illustrates my point. Here you can see the assets by rating and State Streets conduit program as of March 31, 2008, on the left compared with the Moody\u2019s Multi-seller Bank Index as of December 31, 2007 on the right, the last date for which data is available. As you can see here the numbers did not change that much from what we disclosed last quarter. ", "For State Street\u2019s conduit program the three categories of AAA, AA, and A represent 82% of the total. Seven percent is rated BBB and the remaining 11% is non-rated. Whereas the data from the Moody\u2019s Multi-seller Bank Group shown in the graph on the right has 34% rated AAA, AA, A, 24% rated BBB, BB, B, and 41% is not rated with one percent noted as other. While State Street holds essentially no assets rated below BBB or investment grade the peer group of major multi-seller banks hold 12%. None of the assets in our conduits are sub-prime nor are there any structured investment vehicles in the conduit program.", "The point of this detail is to provide you data that will help you differentiate generally between the Commercial Paper issued by our conduit and that of other programs. Now turn to slide three in the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Package. Here I update the data I presented on February 5th on our investor and analyst day. As you can see the unrealized loss on the conduits investments as of March 31, 2008, if we had to consolidate all of them on our balance sheet is about $1.5 billion after tax.", "Again, reflective of the issues I mentioned in connection with the unrealized negative mark on the investment portfolio. The assets continue to have a weighted average maturity of about four years and the paper has a weighted average maturity of 16 days down from 20 days at December 31. As of March 31, we had funded about $292 million of our own asset-backed Commercial Paper on our balance sheet. Also, 39 of the assets in the conduits have been downgraded and about 112 securities have been put on credit watch. These actions are primarily due to downgrades of the insurance providers mostly in Australia.", "Further to my point that we do not rely on insurance wrapper to define the quality of the underlying assets. About $3.3 billion or 12% of the assets in the conduits are wrapped by a diverse group of monoline insurers. Slide four in the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper slide package provides a breakdown of the diversity and asset type and the provider by name of insurer. What happened in the first quarter?", "Overall, in an uncertain market our asset backed Commercial Paper program continued to perform well. We believe that the quality of the conduit assets continue to be a major point of differentiation for us. As I just explained we believe the resulting mark to market loss on the purchase of the small portion of the conduits assets in the first quarter will come back to us as the assets mature.", "On slide five we provide some data showing the impact of consolidation of all the conduit assets on to our balance sheet. As you can see, assuming no management action on our part the impact on our leverage ratio would be about 109 basis points from 6.08% to 4.99% and on intangible common equity ratio about 132 basis points from 2.92% to 1.60%. We obviously would have taken action prior to quarter end if we had believed any consolidation event was imminent for March 31.", "From a funding standpoint the risk of consolidation is included in our contingency funding plan. We believe that we can access multiple sources of liquidity to fund any asset purchases from the conduits. Our sources of this liquidity include borrowing from the overnight inter-bank or repurchase markets issuing corporate Commercial Paper, issuing bank CD\u2019s and time deposits and/or accessing the Fed discount window. As we did in the second half of 2007 in the first quarter we continue to carry incremental liquidity given the market environment.", "In the first quarter the conduits also issued about $20 million in incremental subordinated debt to provide additional first loss protection. In addition, as I explained earlier we purchased about $850 million in conduit assets under the existing liquidity asset purchase agreements. Neither of these actions affected our conclusion that we are not required to consolidate the conduits at March 31 under current accounting guidance.", "Regarding the size of the entire conduit program, as you may remember it was $29.2 billion as of September 30, 2007, and it stood at $28.8 billion as of December 31, 2007, and it stands at $28.3 billion as March 31, 2008. In the asset-backed Commercial Paper section of the slide I also have included some supplementary slides which are updated from previous presentations and which list the type of assets and the country of origin of the assets as well as some details of our program for your reference later.", "Overall the first quarter provided a very good start to the year in what were and continue to be challenging markets. We hope that the information we have provided about our balance sheet and our conduit program has been helpful. I have also updated the information we presented at our investor and analyst day in February in order to help you better understand State Street. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Ron who will provide a general outlook for 2008.", "Ron Logue", "As I said in last quarters call I believe that the momentum we establish in 2007 plus the resiliency that enables us to manage through market turmoil will provide opportunities for us in 2008. In the midst of a decline in equity valuations our asset servicing and asset management businesses performed very well. Each growing compared to the prior years first quarter. The drivers for this performance remain our strong international presence and our ability to cross sell into our existing and acquired customer base.", "Our strong position in our trading business and in securities finance continues to benefit our results during unprecedented illiquidity in the fixed income market. Our net interest revenue also looks to be a reliable source of income at least well into 2008, although the benefit would diminish as the Fed either starts cutting rates or begins to tighten. ", "We also announced two senior appointments last week. First, Scott Powers was named CEO of State Street Global Advisors reporting to me. Scott will join SSGA from Old Mutual US where he was CEO of the US operating unit of London based Old Mutual PLC. He will serve on our operating group, our senior most strategy and policy making team, he has a significant commitment to client service as considerable experience in managing a large quantitative and active investment management organization.", "Additionally, Scott has a strong global perspective. He is committed to building on the depth of talent and experience of SSGA\u2019s leadership team. Also joining our operating group is Maureen Miskovic who is joining State Street as our Chief Risk Officer also reporting to me. Maureen has an extensive background in risk and treasury, both at Lehman Brothers where she was Chief Risk Officer and a member of the investment and diversity committees as well as at Morgan Stanley where she served as treasurer in London, responsible for capital planning, bank relations and cash management for their European and Indian businesses.", "With our considerable global growth over the past five years we created this roll in order to advance the strategy for our risk organization at a time of unprecedented complexity and change within the financial services industry. Maureen was formerly a director of State Street and stepped down from that role to join our staff.", "Specifically regarding our outlook for 2008 we expect our earnings per share on an operating basis excluding merger and integration costs to increase 10% to 15% compared to the 2007 operating basis results of $4.57 per share. We expect our revenue to increase between 14% and 17% including Investors Financial up from our traditional goal of 8% to 12%. We expect our operating return on equity to be between 14% and 17%. ", "I realize that we achieved above these levels in the first quarter but in the second half of the year we anticipate the comparisons will be more challenging and so for now we will stick to our outlook of achieving at the middle of the range. We begin 2008 with momentum from the strong 2007 operating results from both State Street and the acquired Investors Financial business and with our consolidation of Investors Financial exceeding expectations.", "Our core businesses are performing well fueled by continued new business wins and a strong pipeline and we are planning now for the eventuality of lower market driven revenue relative to the higher levels we have experienced in the last two quarters due to unprecedented market conditions. With that Ed and I will be happy to take your questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Deutsche Bank.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Just a little more color on keeping the midpoint of your 10% to 15% EPS growth and as you pointed out you exceeded first quarter expectations you highlighted new servicing which I think totaled about 4% of your total servicing. You saying that Investors Financial is now accretive so are you seeing tangible evidence of this slow down that you expect because the only information you gave us was the margins might go from 220 down to 210 or a bit below. Anything else that\u2019s on your mind.", "Ron Logue", "We are not seeing any tangible evidence of any slow down. I think it\u2019s quite frankly just our conservative nature not knowing what\u2019s happened and the unprecedented events in the marketplace which I would say we are doing two things. We are being very cognizant of that and we are planning for a reduction in the market driven revenue. We are working a lot on the expense side. We just think the later half of the year may be a little bit more difficult from a comparison point of view and we want to be in a position where we can still generate positive operating leverage albeit not 810 basis points but positive operating leverage. It\u2019s more of not knowing what we don\u2019t know.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "The transaction processing services revenue there was a $22 million decline, is that a one quarter decline and then it bounces back or is that something we should view as permanent?", "Ron Logue", "It\u2019s probably more of a one quarter decline. I think that\u2019s where the DTC rebate was if I\u2019m not mistaken.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "The other income related to conduits you said that\u2019s $12 million that should come back too?", "Ron Logue", "I guess it depends on the market.", "Ed Resch", "We took the hit and we have the assets, we said they are virtually all AAA assets and we expect them to mature at par. They are performing well and if we are right in that statement the loss that we took of about $12 million will come back to us over time.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "That\u2019s another $34 million that would come back from the first quarter. Are you really being that conservative?", "Ed Resch", "The last point that I addressed will not all come back in this year. It depends on the maturity of the assets. It will be over time.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "As far as Investors Financial you retained 91% of the revenues, I assume that includes Barkley\u2019s?", "Ron Logue", "", "Its does, yes.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "It\u2019s been a few months since you had this acquisition now so should we think of that as a final number or close to final?", "Ron Logue", "I don\u2019t know if we are going to declare victory right now but we are close.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Lastly, when we look at the press release the unrealized securities losses seem to have gone up $1 billion and on this call you said it went up $2 billion. Are there offsets or am I reading something wrong?", "Ed Resch", "We were talking about two unrealized losses on the investment portfolio that went from $1.1 billion to $3.2 billion and the other was relative to the conduits and that went from about $900 million pre-tax to about $2.5 billion pre-tax. Two separate discussions.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with UBS.", "Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS", "In terms of the $850 of assets brought on from the conduit can you just review again what triggers that and how that\u2019s different from all the other assets that are inside the conduit?", "Ed Resch", "The relationship between the conduit and State Street Bank and Trust is one where State Street Bank and Trust has provided the conduits what are called liquidity asset purchase agreements and those allow the administrator of the conduits to require State Street to buy assets from the conduits at the conduits carrying value. They have the ability to do that based on certain conditions one of which is that they see illiquidity in the Commercial Paper market so the way to solve that problem is to sell assets and therefore not have to fund those assets in the marketplace.", "Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS", "The bottom line is if some of the CT doesn\u2019t roll you could blow out some assets or bring it on balance sheet, you brought it on balance sheet because you thought the assets were money good.", "Ed Resch", "Exactly right.", "Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS", "In terms of the comment on the new business wins, from your comments it sounds like you are including renewals retentions inside the new business win number. If that is correct, can you break out what\u2019s new new versus what\u2019s retained?", "Ron Logue", "No, we are not including the renewals.", "Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS", "Good, so the 600 is 600 good new win number. I\u2019m not sure you mentioned it but I\u2019m assuming that the BGI has a new contract in place; could you say how long that contract is in place for?", "Ron Logue", "All I can say is its long term.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Brian Foran with Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "If I got the math right I think you implied about $700 million of the unrealized losses are from student loans and then about $900 million is from sub-prime MBS, can you break out what the rest of that would be by product?", "Ron Logue", "You are right, pre-tax as of March 31, $700 million, let me just run them down for you. I\u2019ll exclude the treasuries and agencies that are positive territory. Mortgage backed about $700, foreign mortgage backed about $200, credit cards about $200, CMBS $150, CLO $100 and sub-prime about $950, all pre-tax.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Bank of America Securities.", "Ken Usdin \u2013 Bank of America Securities", "I was wondering if you could walk us through again the NIM guidance. With 200 basis points this quarter the NIM up 25 basis points to 220 can you walk us through how the 200 basis points and its perspective cuts would help at least the second quarter and what actually would happen to really get it down all the way to a 2% level to continue to think its only 200 to 210 for the full year. I want to understand the mechanisms and when you would expect that the turn relative to the end of the US cut cycle.", "Ed Resch", "The things that gave us the strength this quarter are the things we are worried about disappearing going forward. That\u2019s why we suggested that we think for the full year we are probably toward the high end so let\u2019s say 210 for this discussion. The things that could impact us from 220 in the first quarter to 210 for the full year are slow Fed rate cuts. We don\u2019t see the depth to the Fed rate cuts that existed in the first quarter going forward for any period of time. ", "We see starting of foreign rate cuts which have a negative effect to us. Remember we said that if the foreign rates, principle the Sterling and Euro were to decline that would be a drag on our net interest revenue and net interest margin and we are seeing some of that. Additionally as the assets re-price that are maturing, there are about $7 billion of fixed rate securities maturing this year remaining the proceeds will be reinvested at the lower rates. ", "In addition to that we are being very conservative in terms of our reinvestment because of the current market environment that we see ourselves in. You put all of that together for the last nine months of the year that\u2019s why we think that the full year NIM will be around 210.", "Ken Usdin \u2013 Bank of America Securities", "As always and has been for the last couple quarters some of that conservatism is based on the absence of things that have continue to keep longer than expected anyways?", "Ed Resch", "Yes.", "Ken Usdin \u2013 Bank of America Securities", "Even though rates are slowing the rate of cuts is there not a lagging benefit of just the pull through from what\u2019s already happened into the future.", "Ed Resch", "Sure, it\u2019s about a quarter.", "Ken Usdin \u2013 Bank of America Securities", "My other question quickly relates to the conduits and the sub-prime. I well understood all your points about money good assets. Is time at all a function of any decision to either have to bring assets on to the balance sheet from the conduit or mark as other than temporary impaired any of the sub-prime assets? Is any elongation of time\u2026?", "Ed Resch", "Yes, we are talking about related concepts but in some ways very important differences exist between the accounting that we are required to apply to the investment portfolio versus the accounting that we are required to apply to the conduit. They are related. Time certainly does matter, the notion on the portfolio the question we ask is the portfolio other than temporarily impaired, are there securities that we believe will not be performing and we will suffer a credit loss on. ", "The answer to the question is yes relative to a security we have to write it down as a fair value at the time we determine that. We did that one security this quarter. The longer the market stays disrupted and the longer prices stay low the more potential there is for impairments going forward all else equal. Right now in the quarter we felt that we only needed to impair the one security given that we could conclude that there were not expected losses in the investment portfolio.", "Related on the conduit the models that support our FIN46 analysis which determine whether we have to consolidate or not have a credit element to them in addition to a basis risk element. The credit element has a similar concept that I just described in terms of the accounting theory whereby we need to make sure that the model that we use reflects current market expectations. The longer the market stays disrupted the greater the pressure is on the credit element of the FIN46 model.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Brian Bedell with Merrill Lynch.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Can you tell me how comfortable you are with your current capital position given the market stress and liquidity we are seeing and what brought on to the balance sheet and taken against your OCI, to what degree you would be willing to come back and do another debt offering to bolster your capital position?", "Ed Resch", "We are comfortable with where we are; obviously our capital position is something that we monitor all the time. We don\u2019t have any plans at this point to come to market with another offering. It is something that we constantly talk about. Obviously the widening of the unrealized losses in the first quarter from year end is something that we are on top of. We said coming into the year that we were going to be conservative and build up capital. We\u2019ve clearly done that, however the rate of widening of the unrealized loss on the portfolio specifically has outstripped our capital generation for the quarter.", "You\u2019d think it was an extraordinary quarter in that regard but it is something we are looking at. The one element of our ratios that we are particularly focused on is our tangible common equity ratio. We need to rebuild that. We build tangible common equity, we build that ratio at 40 to 50 basis points a quarter and in a normal quarter. If the portfolio mark did not change at all in the second quarter we would expect to see a 40 to 50 basis point improvement in our TCE ratio.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "What are your goals, your target ratio range on the tangible common?", "Ed Resch", "Four and a quarter, we\u2019d like to be.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "How quickly do you think you can get back to that level?", "Ed Resch", "If you assume that the portfolio mark does not change at all we\u2019d be in two or three quarters above the 4% level. Again, that\u2019s all else equal.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "You were saying something else before I interrupted you, I\u2019m sorry.", "Ed Resch", "I think I was just concluding my comment.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "If we could talk about the net interest income, remind me again of what you were saying about average earning assets for the full year outlook relative to the first quarter levels.", "Ed Resch", "We said we expected the full year \u201908 average balance sheet to be about what it was on average for the fourth quarter. We had about $12 billion above where we thought we would be at first quarter end given very strong customer deposit flows.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "On new business, can you talk about the timeline of conversion of the $600 million of new business?", "Ron Logue", "It is being converted as we speak. It will go into the second quarter.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "That quickly, all of the $600 million in the second quarter. So that will come on to the P&L pretty quickly. The $800 billion that you won in the fourth quarter where do we stand on conversion?", "Ron Logue", "Most of that converted.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Already in the first quarter run rate or still some in the second quarter?", "Ron Logue", "Yes.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Does the BGI contract change your outlook at all; did that impact your IFIN dilution guidance at all?", "Ron Logue", "No", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "That wasn\u2019t different from your expectation.", "Ron Logue", "", "No, that was assumed.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Thomas McCrohan with Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "I have a follow up on the comment which you first addressed on the BGI renewal it was pretty important to you guys. Ed, you had mentioned in your prepared remarks that you issued additional first loss notes can you remind me what the dollar amount was of those additional notes and what the interest rate was for those notes?", "Ed Resch", "It was $20 million across the two large conduits so the Australian conduits were not part of that raise and the rate that we paid was commensurate with the market rate for those types of instruments. It was above 20%.", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Going into the quarter it was about $32 million first loss notes, so you increased it from $32 million to $52 million?", "Ed Resch", "Yes, that\u2019s correct.", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "The models that you are talking about related to the accounting on whether or not you have to consolidate this is that what triggers whether or not to issue the additional first loss notes?", "Ed Resch", "Yes, the purpose of the additional note issuance was to give ourselves more cushion in the FIN46 model specifically from a credit perspective.", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Its fair to say that its hard to envision this conduit ever being consolidated given that its been such an awful environment, you have obvious buyers for first loss notes if you want to issue some more paper. Is there a simple way to articulate and what instance would you ever have to consolidate this because it seems like worse case was this quarter, maybe there\u2019s more of a down side and in that event you just sold $20 million of additional first loss notes and you are able to keep this thing off your balance sheet. Under what conditions would you ever have to consolidate this?", "Ed Resch", "First of all the market for these types of notes is not infinite. There is a double edge sword effect if I can call it that by issuing those notes and that affect is to raise the expenses of running the conduit because of the coupon on that debt. You have to balance off the economics of raising the data assuming there was a market for it against the ongoing requirement for the conduits to operate at a profit. The interest expense on the sub-debt goes against the spread that the conduit earns on the assets against the Commercial Paper costs.", "Additionally I would never want to say never to that question. I could conjure up a scenario where there was even more significant credit disruption in the market place with significant levels of downgrades that could flow through to our conduit FIN46 model and significantly stress the credit element of the model. You are right, the first quarter was very challenging and we in part issued the notes to make sure that we got through it as of March 31. I would not say there is no scenario into which the conduits could be required to be consolidated.", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "To confirm, this is the first quarter in the last five that you\u2019ve had an issue for the conduits, that issue of additional first loss notes, I want to confirm that?", "Ed Resch", "That\u2019s correct.", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "The investors that bought the notes are they the same universe that were holders of the initial $32 million of first loss notes?", "Ed Resch", "They were in part and there were some new investors also that came in.", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "It sounds like you are saying the only way you have to consolidate this is if there are no buyers of additional first loss notes?", "Ed Resch", "You have to have no buyers, you\u2019d have to have a very significant negative credit event like I just described with significant downgrades, for example or you could have the accounting rules change.", "Operator", "You have a follow up question from the line of Brian Foran with Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "How the $3.2 billion of unrealized losses is being derived, i.e. model versus mark to actual cash bids something like that and any sense of if it is mark to model for any of these products what it would be if you were marking to the cash bids?", "Ed Resch", "The marking on the conduits is\u2026", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I\u2019m sorry, on the portfolio.", "Ed Resch", "The portfolio is 99% from interactive data corp. It\u2019s a pricing service that we use and have used for pricing portfolio assets. It is under PHAS157 a level two pricing source. There is very little if any mark to model in evaluating the portfolio assets.", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "From the standpoint of capital should we think about the unrealized loss in the portfolio as well as the unrealized loss in the conduit as core related events, i.e. if you had the kind of credit event you are describing that would make you take the conduit on to balance sheet wouldn\u2019t that also be the type of credit event that would make you realize some of these losses? If that\u2019s a fair way to think about it what could be the worse case for the tier one leverage in that kind of scenario?", "Ed Resch", "I think it is a fair way to think about it. I think that the risk relative to the conduits I just described of a credit event, significant credit downgrades coincide with impairment risks relative to the assets in the investment portfolio. We\u2019ve tried to portray some of the scenarios that on a pro-forma basis in the slides again there are a lot of assumptions underlying those numbers not the least of which is that we did not take any management action in advance of March 31 in anticipation of any of these adverse events occurring. We do have some ability to react to anticipated capital events and get the ratios back in a stronger position than we presented on a pro-forma basis in those slides.", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Lastly, is your comment on the conduit interpreted as if it becomes unprofitable to keep the conduit off balance sheet even though you could issue the short term paper to fund it, i.e. spreads stay wide enough that the conduit doesn\u2019t make any money even if it could stay off balance sheet. Does that then prompt a decision to bring it on balance sheet even if there is a big capital impact or are you just saying that there is a scenario where you\u2019d rethink how much sense it makes to have the conduit if it\u2019s permanently not profitable or marginally profitable?", "Ed Resch", "The fact that the conduit would stay off balance sheet is the requirement to do that is that the conduits over the longer term are profitable. We could not fund the conduits in a negative cash flow or a negative profit position for a period of time and keep them off balance sheet.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Richard Bove with Punk Ziegel.", "Richard Bove \u2013 Punk Ziegel", "There\u2019s a conflict in the way you gentlemen opened up the meeting and what investors are hearing, the stock is now down 6.5 points roughly speaking and I think it\u2019s for three reasons. One, if you look on page eight of your quarterly financial trends package you chose virtually every category of assets and custody assets under management is down on a sequential basis. Two, you suggested that the second half might be weaker than the first half. And three, it\u2019s apparent from the questions that most people feel that your earnings are overstated because you haven\u2019t handled the conduit properly from their perspective.", "I\u2019m wondering, given the dramatic negative reaction to this conference call what defense, so to speak, does the company have relative to why the accountants have agreed with it, why the regulators presumably have agreed with you in terms of your accounting treatment and do you really expect the second half to be that bad, the stock is now down 7.25 points what can you say that would suggest that this market reaction is perhaps inappropriate?", "Ron Logue", "Let me address three questions, I think the issue was the assets on the custody, equity and fixed income valuations for the quarter. I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that. In terms of the last half of the year, what we are doing is just we are being characterized as we normally are, being conservative. We have a lot of market driven revenue that\u2019s been driving the first quarter. What we have to do is prepare for more orderly markets and what\u2019s important, what you need to look at is the fundamental business, it\u2019s very strong.", "Our sense is when markets come back that we are still going to have that very strong revenue growth from the fundamental business. However, we don\u2019t know when that\u2019s going to happen and I think as a company, it\u2019s important for us to plan for the worst case scenarios not the best case scenarios. That has helped us for 14 straight quarters to deliver positive operating leverage. We are going to continue to do that. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the latter half of the year but I\u2019ve got to prepare for worse times as opposed to good times and not plan and hope for the same kind of benefits that we\u2019ve been getting recently.", "In terms of the conduits in the portfolio we keep coming back to the same thing, the credit quality in the portfolio is very strong, evidenced by the few downgrades vis-\u00e0-vis the other downgrades in the industry. We and our accounting firm and others feel very strong that the quality in those portfolios are very high and there\u2019s not a need to do any of that.", "Operator", "Your final question is from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.", "Robert Lee \u2013 KBW", "Most of my questions have been answered but I still have one. There has been some, this relates to City Street, there have been some reports on some trade rags that you and City have put City Street on the block and the extent it would, from the numbers being thrown around in the press would result in a least a couple hundred million dollars of proceeds it seems. Is that something you can comment on, along those lines are there any kind of ancillary businesses that you would think about exiting if there was an opportunity to get out of them at a reasonable price and raise some incremental capital?", "Ron Logue", "I really can\u2019t comment on any of that.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time.

", "Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in State Street's 2007 annual report on Form 10K and its subsequent filings with the SEC, including in particular its current report on Form 10K dated June 2, 2008.

", "Now I'll turn the call over to Ron.", "Ron Logue", "", "Thank you, Kelley, and good morning. Let me start by characterizing our performance in view of the continuing market turmoil that all financials have been dealing with since last August. ", "I think the question for all of us is:  How are we going to look once we emerge from this crisis? The answer for us and for other trust banks, I think, lies in four areas. ", "First, how is our core business doing, and are we continuing to grow revenue?", "Second, what will be the effect of future market-driven revenue compared to current elevated levels?", "Third, how are we dealing with expense control? ", "And fourth, what will be the outcome of our on and off-balance sheet issues?", "Our core business continues to remain very strong, as evidenced by our second quarter results. Two indicators that are telling of a strong sequential quarter growth in servicing fee revenue, fueled by large new business wins in previous quarters and continuing this quarter and better-than-expected results in asset management fee revenue.", "Second, our securities finance revenue continues to be very strong, taking advantage of disrupted financial markets, but we would expect this uncharacteristic growth to moderate in the second half of 2008. ", "Foreign exchange revenue has already begun to decrease this quarter from previously elevated levels, and as Ed will report shortly, we expect net interest margin to increase slightly from our previous outlook.", "Third, balancing our spending to ensure a long-term success with the need to consistently generate positive operating leverage has never been more important than it is now. I'm pleased with our ability to moderate the growth of our salary and benefit expense first quarter to second quarter, and we need to continue to place a strong emphasis on controlling expense and we will. ", "And last but not least, the quality of the assets in our investment portfolio and asset-backed commercial paper program continues to be strong, as Ed will discuss. The respective marks on the investment portfolio and the conduits have stayed pretty much the same quarter to quarter, and we currently believe that the investment portfolio is not other than temporarily impaired and that the conduits do not need to be consolidated onto our balance sheet. Regardless, we have strengthened our capital position and our tangible common equity with the issuance of $2.8\u00a0billion of equity capital and by continued strong internal capital generation in the second quarter.", "Because of our strong performance in the first half of 2008, we now expect our growth in operating earnings per share to approach the high end of the 10% to 15% range and operating return on equity to also approach the high end of the 14% to 17% range. We also believe our revenue growth will exceed the high end of the 14% to 17% range. ", "So let me talk about our accomplishments this quarter in some more detail. State Street this morning reported a strong quarter's performance, with increased revenue on nearly every line of the income statement when compared to the prior year's second quarter and was up on nearly every line compared to the first quarter of '08. ", "Compared to the first quarter, our total revenue increased 4% and our operating earnings per share, excluding the merger and integration costs in the second quarter of 2008, was up 1% compared to the first quarter of 2008. Also excluding these costs, we achieved 19.3% operating return on equity in 2008 compared to 19.4% in the first quarter of 2008. Overall, the results of the first half are very strong.", "Even excluding the revenue and operating earnings from Investors Financial and comparing the second quarter of 2008 with the second quarter of 2007, revenue grew 27% and operating earnings per share increased 29%. Also excluding the merger and integration costs in the second quarter of 2008, on an operating basis we achieved positive operating leverage of 650 basis points, our 15th consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage when measured on a year-over-year basis. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, we achieved about 30 basis points of positive operating leverage.", "Considering the market challenges, we are pleased with the strong growth in our core businesses in the first half of 2008. Compared to the first quarter of 2008, we increased servicing fees 2% and management fees grew a little less than 1%. Trading services revenue was down 13% in the second quarter from the first quarter, a trend which may continue into the third quarter, when we typically experience lower revenues compared to the second quarter. ", "Also looking at the second quarter of 2008, we enjoyed a certain amount of overperformance in securities finance. Securities finance revenue was up more than 16% comparing the second quarter with the first quarter. I caution you, however, that you cannot extrapolate the strong results in securities finance revenue in forecasting the second half of 2008. Typically, we see a decline in securities finance revenue from the second quarter to the third quarter. ", "Partially offsetting the expected slowdown in trading and securities finance revenue is the expected strength in net interest revenue in the second half of 2008 compared to the second half of 2007, and Ed will provide more details about this shortly.", "We've now completed the first 12 months of the consolidation of Investors Financial, and we remain confident that we will retain at least 91% of the customer revenue. As you can see from the press release issued this morning, the performance of the business we acquired from Investors Financial continues to exceed our expectations, adding $253\u00a0million in fully taxable equivalent revenue in the second quarter from Investors Financial. We reported $0.02 in operating earnings per share this quarter from Investors Financial, up from a neutral result in the first quarter. We now expect the acquisition to be accretive this year, significantly ahead of our original plan.", "The consolidation is proceeding according to plan. We've already converted about 47% of the customer products. As customers convert, we are removing costs while also providing access for those customers to a broad range of new products and services.", "Regarding new business won during the quarter, we won $400 billion of asset servicing new business. Some of the second quarter wins include, on the servicing side, John Hancock consolidated an additional $24 billion in assets with State Street to provide custody and fund accounting for 43 additional funds, bringing the total assets serviced for all John Hancock funds to $125 billion in 228 funds. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as managing member of Maiden Lane LLC, awarded State Street a mandate to provide custody, collateral administration, and LLC administration services for $30 billion in assets. ", "State Street renewed contracts with five long-standing public fund clients for whom it services around $181\u00a0billion in combined assets. These included the state retirement and pension system of Maryland, the University of California Regents' scheme, the Montana Board of Investments, the State of Nebraska, as well as the Minnesota State Board of Investment, a State Street customer for over 20 years. We also renewed the contract with the Teachers Retirement System of Texas, the fourth-largest public pension fund in the United States, for a variety of custody, accounting, analytics and securities lending for $110 billion in assets. ", "Apostle Asset Management, an Australian asset management firm, has appointed State Street to provide custody and investment administration services for 2 billion Australian dollars in five Apostle-branded funds being offered to local investors. ", "This quarter, we also acquired Deutsche Bank's Swiss fund accounting business, which will enable us to provide fund accounting services for Swiss-domiciled funds. We will initially service 16 investment funds with approximately 4 billion Swiss francs in assets.", "State Street Global Advisors added significant new business as well. San Bernardino, California County Employee's Retirement Association approved investing $360 million in SSgA's liquidity strategy cash portfolio. Lincoln Financial has selected SSgA for an extensive sub-advisory relationship and management of six new investment portfolios and two existing index funds. In the second quarter, 35% of our new business came from active strategies, a continuing emphasis for SSgA. ", "Now turning to our balance sheet, net interest revenue and net interest margin again performed very well, achieving a 73% increase in fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the second quarter of 2007, and a net interest margin of 231 basis points in the second quarter of 2008. Ed will provide further details about these results and our outlook for net interest margin in a few minutes.", "So, despite the continued turmoil in the financial markets over the past quarter, I'm very pleased with State Street's performance, both growth in revenue as well as operating earnings per share. We will continue to watch expenses closely as we target positive operating leverage on an annual basis and maintain our focus on continued global growth across our business.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Ed, who will provide some of the details of our financial performance last quarter as well as further information about the performance of the assets in our investment portfolio and the asset-backed commercial paper program.", "Ed Resch", "", "Thank you, Ron. Good morning, everyone.", "This quarter again underscored the strength of our business. We reported strong growth in both fee and net interest revenue, and please note that the numbers I am presenting for the first two quarters of 2008 include the results of the acquired Investors Financial business. ", "Our growth in asset servicing, asset management, and securities finance revenue continued at a combined rate of about 33% compared to the second quarter of 2007. Trading services took advantage of volatility in the market, and securities finance revenue benefited from steepness in the short end of the yield curve. We also reported strong growth in net interest revenue. We continued to benefit from the action in late March by the Federal Reserve; however, we expect the benefit of the recent cuts will moderate over the second half of 2008. I'll provide more detail on our net interest income and margin and the outlook for 2008 in a few minutes.", "Our assets under custody at June 30, 2008 were $15.3 trillion compared to $13 trillion on June 30, 2007. Our assets under management stood at $1.9 trillion at the end of this quarter, down slightly from June 30, 2007. ", "As Ron noted, the business acquired from Investors Financial continued to perform well. As we reported this morning, total revenue in the second quarter of 2008, including Investors Financial, compared to the second quarter of 2007 was up 39%. And excluding Investors Financial, total revenue was up 27%. Investors Financial contributed $0.02 to the operating earnings per share in the second quarter, ahead of our original outlook. ", "Excluding variable expenses resulting from revenue growth at Investors Financial, in the second quarter of 2008 we saved an additional $69 million. As a result, the savings over the last four quarters is $209\u00a0million, and we are on track to achieve our annualized target of $350 million we set in February of 2007.", "We previously thought that the Investors Financial transaction would be modestly accretive in 2008 excluding the impact of the merger and integration costs. Due to continued strength in revenue growth, we now expect the acquisition to be about $0.05 to $0.06 accretive to our 2008 results, significantly ahead of our original plan at the time of the acquisition.", "I hope you've had an opportunity to review our earnings press release distributed this morning. Please review the financial statements included with our earnings press release and in our financial trends package on our website for detailed information on our financial results. ", "Now on to the results. This morning, all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results, excluding the merger and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Investors Financial in the first and second quarters of 2008. ", "On an operating basis, earnings per share in the second quarter were $1.40, up 31% from $1.07 per share last year and up 1% from $1.39 in the first quarter. Revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled $2.7\u00a0billion for the quarter, an increase of 39.7% from last year's second quarter, compared with a 33.2% increase in expenses to $1.809\u00a0billion on an operating basis.", "Compared to the first quarter of 2008, revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was up 3.8% and expenses on an operating basis increased 3.5%. ", "Return on equity on an operating basis was 19.3% in the second quarter, up from 19.2% in the second quarter of 2007 and down from 19.4% in the first quarter. ", "Servicing fees were up 28% from the second quarter of 2007 due to the additional revenue from Investors Financial customers as well as increases in new business from existing and new customers, offset partially by an 8% decline in the daily average equity market valuations. They were up about 2% from the first quarter due to growth in net new business and a slight increase in daily equity valuations. ", "Management fees were down 1% compared with the second quarter of 2007 due primarily to the impact of a 10% decline in the average month end equity valuations and a decline in performance fees, offset partially by business from existing and new customers. Management fee revenue was up slightly from the first quarter due primarily to a slight increase in the average month end equity valuations offset partially by lower performance fees.", "Performance fees were about $4 million, down from $18 million a year ago and from $7 million in the first quarter of 2008. ", "Our cash and money market assets under management were down slightly, about 3%, from last year's second quarter. ", "We experienced a 6% decrease in equity assets from the second quarter of 2007, a good performance when compared with the 15% decline in quarter end equity valuations. ", "Fixed income assets increased about 19% compared to the second quarter of 2007, a rate higher than the market averages.", "Increased volatility and higher volumes in our foreign exchange business drove a 30% increase in foreign exchange trading revenue compared with the second quarter of 2007. Foreign exchange revenue was down 14% from the first quarter, due primarily to lower volatility and a slight decline in volumes.", "Brokerage and other fees were up $7 million or 8% to $93 million from the previous year's second quarter. This improvement was due primarily to strength in electronic trading and current ex businesses. ", "Brokerage and other fee revenue was down 8% from the first quarter due to a decline in third-party trading revenue, offset partially by an increase in U.S. transition management mandates.", "Also, the steepness of the short end of the yield curve contributed to the increase in revenue from securities finance in the second quarter compared to the year ago quarter. Securities finance revenue was up 117% from last year's second quarter, due primarily to improved spreads partially offset by lower demand, and was up 16% compared to this year's first quarter, also primarily due to a continuation of improved spreads and the impact of the dividend season in Europe. We expect the benefit from spreads to moderate in the second half of this year. ", "We had $672\u00a0billion in average securities on loan and the duration on the securities lending book at June 30, 2008 was 25\u00a0days. ", "Processing and other fees increased 18% from the prior year's second quarter. This improvement was due to revenue associated with Investors Financial. The revenue increased 43% from the first quarter, primarily due to structured products. Asset-backed commercial paper related revenue of $13.2 million was down 23% compared to the second quarter of 2007 and up $2 million from the first quarter of 2008.", "Net interest revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased from the second quarter of 2007 by $288\u00a0million or 73% from $397 million to $685 million and was up $37 million from the first quarter. In addition, compared to the second quarter of 2007, net interest margin of 231 basis points was up 67 basis points and was up 11 basis points from the first quarter of 2008. ", "Some of the trends that drove our improved performance in the second quarter compared to the year ago quarter include a larger balance sheet, improved spreads on our fixed rate portfolio caused primarily by the lower cost funding due to the recent actions by the Federal Reserve, the impact of additional revenue from the acquired Investors Financial business, a steeper yield curve from overnight to three months, and the impact of our equity offering in June.", "Compared to the first quarter of 2008, in the second quarter of 2008 we benefited from improved spreads due to the actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve, offset partially by a lower rate environment. We generated lower revenue from noninterest bearing deposits and our equity.", "Now let me turn to the investment portfolio. The average investment portfolio increased from $67.7\u00a0billion to $71.7\u00a0billion during the second quarter from the year ago quarter due to the impact of the Investors Financial acquisition and was down slightly from $73.3 billion in the first quarter of 2008. ", "Mortgage-backed securities in the second quarter of 2008 represented about 38% or $27 billion of the average investment portfolio. ", "Floating-rate asset-backed securities in the second quarter of 2008 represented about 34% of the average investment portfolio or $24.6 billion. ", "We believe this portfolio is conservatively structured and is well seasoned. The portfolio has been performing well, is diversified, and has been withstanding market stresses. All of the assets are current as to principal and interest. ", "During the quarter, particularly in late May and early June, we saw credit spreads tighten, causing an improvement in the after-tax unrealized mark of about $500 million. But offsetting that we had a increase in the after-tax and unrealized mark of about $600 million due to the impact of higher U.S. rates on fixed-rate securities. As a result, while the tone of the market is slightly improved, the unrealized marked-to-market loss after tax is about $2.0\u00a0billion, up about $72 million from March 30, 2008.", "We continue to believe that these prices are not reflective of the underlying value of the securities if held to term, but indicate a continuing lack of liquidity in the fixed-income market. In past quarters I have presented considerable detail about the investment portfolio, specifics about the ratings of each asset type, and considerable detail on the subprime portfolio. I recently have also added data on the unrealized loss by asset type as well as stresses we applied to each of these assets to give us confidence as to their underlying quality. Those are updated and available to you on our website. As I just indicated, the amount of unrealized loss has not changed materially from the first quarter level, and I strongly urge you to review those slides. ", "In addition, you're probably aware of the downgrades to the monoline insurance providers during the past quarter. Those downgrades had a minimal effect on the unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. Almost all of those downgrades affected our municipal bond portfolio, which is in an unrealized gain position at the end of the quarter.", "Now, as to our outlook for net interest revenue for the remainder of 2008, last quarter I revised our outlook for net interest margin for 2008. I said that we expected the margin to be between 200 and 210 basis points, probably nearer the high end of the range. In the current environment, we now expect our margin on average for the full year to be about 215 basis points or slightly higher based on the following assumptions:  ", "That we maintain the existing favorable mix of customer liabilities.", "An expectation that the investment portfolio will reprice as about $7\u00a0billion in older fixed-rate securities mature in 2008, but that these will be reinvested on average at modestly lower rates than in 2007. Also I should mention that we continue to minimize our portfolio reinvestment as we maintain our liquidity in the face of the current market environment.", "And lastly, that the level of non-U.S. transaction balances remains at current levels. ", "In February we provided an outlook that the ECB will reduce rates by 50 basis points to about 3.5% by year end, and that the Bank of England will reduce rates by about 75 basis points to about 4.75%. Since the ECB has already raised rates once in early July, we now believe that these two central banks will either hold steady from here or possibly raise slightly, either of which action is slightly beneficial to us for the rest of this year.", "As the U.S. Fed stops cutting rates, the benefits we have seen and been enjoying will abate, and so in the second half of the year we may not see the net interest margin at the level we reported this quarter. ", "We continue to expect our '08 average balance sheet to be roughly flat with the average balance sheet in the first quarter of 2007. ", "Our duration gap has not changed significantly from year end. Our assets are about 11 months, and our liabilities are about 9 months. The investment portfolio duration is about 1.5 years, down slightly from the second quarter of 2007 and flat with the first quarter of 2008. ", "I'll now turn back to expenses, and just as a reminder, I'm speaking about expenses on an operating basis.", "Salaries and benefits expenses increased 31% compared to the second quarter of 2007 due primarily to the impact of additional staff from Investors Financial and higher staffing levels to service new business as well as increased benefits expense. Compared to the first quarter of 2008, salaries and benefits expense was approximately flat, primarily due to a lower level of incentive compensation, offset partially by higher benefit costs and the impact of increased staffing levels to support growth. ", "Transaction processing expenses increased 22% compared to the year ago quarter, primarily due to the acquisition of Investors Financial and increased volumes in asset servicing and the trading businesses. They increased 6% from the first quarter of 2008, due primarily to the impact of the receipt of a depository rebate in the first quarter. ", "Expenses for information systems and communication increased $36 million or 28%, primarily due to the impact of Investors Financial and costs to support growth in Europe.", "Occupancy expense increased 17% from the second quarter of 2007 due primarily to the cost associated with Investors Financial and was up 5% from the first quarter of 2008 due to investments to support growth, particularly in Europe. ", "Other expenses were up 63% compared to the year ago quarter primarily due to the impact of professional fees and the amortization expenses associated with Investors Financial, as well as securities processing costs. They were up 15% compared to the first quarter of 2008, primarily due to professional fees and globalization efforts. ", "Our tax rate for the first quarter was 34%, flat with the first quarter. As we disclosed in this morning's press release, we completed the divestiture of our 50% investment in CitiStreet in early July, resulting in a gain of about $0.47\u00a0per share. Taking into account this divestiture, we expect the effective tax rate for 2008 to be 34.6%. Excluding the impact of the divestiture of CitiStreet, the expected effective tax rate for 2008 remains at 34.0%.", "Now turning to our capital ratios, the principal-capital ratio that we manage to the Tier 1 leverage ratio, we have historically targeted between 5.25% and 5.75%, but given the market environment, we expect our leverage ratio to grow to a level above the top of that range in order to preserve flexibility in what appears to be continuing volatility in the market. At June 30, 2008, our Tier 1 leverage ratio stands at 8.24%, up from 6.09% as of March 31, 2008.", "Our tangible common equity ratio was 5.40%, up from 2.92% at March 30, 2008. The increase was driven by the $2.8\u00a0billion equity issuance we completed in June and approximately $550 million of organic capital that we generated in the second quarter.", "Next, I will briefly describe the conduit assets in our asset-backed commercial paper program. As in the past, you can find a detailed quarterly review of the assets displayed by type, country of origin and ratings on our website located with the second quarter materials. Also there you will find the unrealized after-tax marked-to-market losses for each asset type and the stresses we applied to them. In the interest of time, I will not discuss them in detail today. ", "As of June 30, 2008, the conduits held assets of $28.4 billion, nearly flat from $28.3 billion on March\u00a031, 2008. The asset amortization was offset partially by new asset purchases as well as the impact of the continued weak dollar. Also during the quarter we issued $15 million of additional subordinated debt to further mitigate consolidation risk, bringing the total amount of first loss notes available to the conduits to $67 million.", "As I stated last quarter, we created this program in 1992 primarily to address customer requests for high-quality, highly rated commercial paper. The conduits have never suffered a credit loss on any asset they purchased, evidence of our strong credit discipline. Eighty-two percent of the assets are rated single A or above. ", "In the second quarter, 125 additional securities were downgraded due to the downgrade of the monoline insurance providers, and none of the assets in our conduits are subprime nor are any structured investment vehicles in the conduits. ", "The unrealized loss on the conduit assets as of June 30, 2008 is about $1.6 billion after tax, again reflective of the illiquidity in the market, up from $1.5 billion after tax at March 31, 2008. ", "The assets continue to have an average - weighted average maturity of about four years, and the paper has a weighted average maturity of 20 days, up from 16 days at March 31. ", "As of June 30, we had funded about $212\u00a0million of our asset-backed commercial paper on our balance sheet, and all the securities in the conduits are current as to principal and interest. Due to the high quality of the assets and their performance, we do not currently believe we need to consolidate the conduits. On a pro forma basis as of June\u00a030, the consolidation of the conduit assets onto our balance sheet would reduce our leverage ratio by about 117\u00a0basis points from 8.24% to 7.07%, and the tangible common equity ratio about 182 basis points from 5.40% to 3.58%. ", "From a funding standpoint, the risk of consolidation is included in our contingency funding plan. As of June\u00a030, 2008, we carried about $18 billion in liquid assets on our balance sheet given the market environment. In addition, we believe that we can access multiple sources of liquidity to fund any asset purchases from the conduits. Our sources of this liquidity include borrowing from the overnight interbank or repurchase markets, issuing corporate commercial paper, issuing bank CDs and time deposits, and/or accessing the Fed discount window.", "So overall, in the second quarter we continued to perform well in what we think was an economically challenging period. We hope that you review the information we have provided on our website, adding further detail to our discussion of the investment portfolio and our conduit program. ", "And now I'll turn the call back to Ron.", "Ron Logue", "Thank you, Ed.", "As outlined at the beginning of this call, I'm very pleased with State Street's performance, both on a sequential quarter and year-over-year basis. Not only have we built momentum in growing our core business but also we've proven our resiliency in the face of quite unprecedented market conditions.", "Although the declines in the equity markets have pressured our fee revenue in the second quarter compared to a year ago, our new business won over the past few quarters has contributed to that strong performance. We continue to benefit from our focus and our ability to cross sell into our existing and acquired customer base as well as our solid global footprint. ", "Our strong position in our trading business and in securities finance benefited the second quarter results, which should moderate in the second half of the year. While our net interest revenue continued to be strong, we can expect those results to moderate also as we will no longer benefit from the Fed rate cuts of late 2007 and the first quarter of 2008. And we look forward to continued stronger-than-expected performance from SSgA as the new asset management team makes an impact. ", "I want to assure you that we continue to watch our expenses carefully, recognizing that these challenging times continue. We are committed to achieving annual positive operating leverage, so we must be sure that our rate of revenue growth exceeds our rate of expenses growth, even in more difficult markets. ", "Specifically, I will just remind you of my earlier comments regarding our outlook for 2008. The achievement of all of these goals excludes the non-operating gain from the divestiture of CitiStreet, which closed in the third quarter. We expect our earnings per share on an operating basis, excluding merger and integration costs but including the recent capital raise, to increase 10% to 15% compared to the 2007 operating basis results of $4.57 per share, approaching the high end of that range. We expect our operating return on equity to be between 14% and 17%, also approaching the high end of the range. And we expect our revenue growth to exceed the high end of our 14% to 17% range.", "We revised our outlook regarding our level of performance to these goals based on the strength of the first half of 2008. In the second half of the year we anticipate the comparisons will be more challenging. ", "Our consolidation of Investors Financial continues to outperform our original expectation, retaining 91% of their revenue and earning $0.02 per share excluding the merger and integration costs in the second quarter. ", "In addition, based on our performance in the first half of 2008, our core businesses are core businesses are performing well, fueled by continued new business wins and a strong pipeline. ", "We continue to watch our costs carefully, as we head into a more challenging period. ", "Ed and I will now be happy to take your questions.", "Questions-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Glenn Schorr - UBS.", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "", "I'm not sure if I missed it or not. Did you talk about where you envision the size of the conduit and securities portfolio to be as of year end based on maturities coming due and paydowns?", "Ed Resch", "In terms of the conduits, the maturities in the conduits are about $1 billion a quarter, and we're committed to right-size those conduits, as we've said since we've been talking about them in great degree since the last year. ", "The issue there is, though, that we cannot just have a linear decay because of the impact of the FIN\u00a046 models, so I don't have a target that I could say that we're reaching for by the end of the year. But our commitment is still the same. We're looking to decrease the size of the conduits overall.", "In terms of the portfolio, I'd say it's probably going to be in line with where it is now, in the $75\u00a0billion range or so at year end. We don't anticipate many changes there.", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "And then, when unrealized losses come up, whether they be produced by higher Treasuries or wider spreads, how do the rating agencies and the regulators view the impact on capital ratios? In other words, is it the same as if it was produced by lower earnings in the quarter? Do they test - the impairment test? What are they looking at when they see the same numbers we look at?", "Ed Resch", "Well, they're looking at the entire picture. You know, I don't think that an unrealized loss is viewed the same as a lesser level of core earnings, certainly. But the fact that the unrealized loss increases or decreases is certainly taken into account by both the regulators and the rating agencies when they look at our capital position. We have ongoing dialogue with both of them.", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "A couple of quickies. Other expense is up big. I saw some comments in the text; part of it related to the integration, part of it was related to securities processing. Was that a little bit of a jump up this quarter and you should see some moderation in the second half? ", " ", "Ron Logue", "I think, as we said in the past, when we get opportunities to invest in some places, we usually take that. You'll find professional fees up, for example. So I think this is another example of us taking advantage of spending some money when we can.", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "And maybe, last one, any word - back to the conduit - any latest word in terms of FASB's comments on potential consolidation, you know, comments around FAS 140 and FIN 46 and removing the QSP rule in terms of timing and potential construct of changes there?", "Ed Resch", "Our understanding, Glenn, is really just from public sources, which is that the FASB is expected to issue an exposure draft around the end of this month. And the contents of that are still, I guess, up in the air as far as I know. ", "The issue of the FAS 140 affects the QSPEs, which does not affect us. The issue of the FIN 46 revision is the thing that does potentially affect the consolidation requirements or the rules under which conduit consolidation would be required.", "But end of the month I think is something to target for from a release standpoint.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nancy Bush - NAB Research.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "", "A couple of questions here. You know, everybody I think is sort of having a hard time getting their head wrapped around where net interest revenues go from here because it has been such a bigger piece of the earnings equation I think this year than anybody expected. I mean, how should we think about net interest revenue going forward. If the Fed does nothing or for some insane reason decides to tighten, how do you look at NIR going into 2009?", "Ed Resch", "Well, I really don't want to get too far ahead of things and talk about 2009 yet, Nancy, given the uncertainty, but I'll tell you our thinking in terms of the second half of this year. ", "As I said, we expect the full year to be, from a margin standpoint, in the range of 215 or maybe a little bit above, and that obviously implies a little bit of a weaker second half than what we had in the first half. The first half, we think, was extraordinarily strong, mainly driven by the pace and the depth to which the U.S. Fed cut rates. So we're expecting to see less of a benefit there in the second half as that kind of works through. ", "We're anticipating the U.S. Fed to stay the same, at about 2%. To your question if the Fed were to decide to increase rates, that would have a depressing effect on our second half expectation for net interest margin. So that's a possible downside to our forecast.", "We're expecting, though, strong transaction deposit flows to continue, which we've had for awhile. Obviously if the opposite were to be the case, we could have a slightly negative effect on the margin. ", "We're expecting the yield curve at the short end to remain fairly steep, as it was in the first quarter - in the first half of this year, excuse me. We think the ECB and the Bank of England will stay about where they are, and we're expecting an average balance sheet size in the $140 billion range. ", "So you could take the opposite of a lot of those factors that I just said and construct a scenario where perhaps our margin compresses in the second half. And we are, as I said, expecting a less-robust net interest revenue, net interest margin second half of the year, but overall in the range of 215 or so for the full year from a margin standpoint.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Secondly, losses in the investment portfolio since quarter end, has there been any material change?", "Ed Resch", "Since quarter end the losses actually widened out a little bit. From June 30, it was just about $2 billion on the nose after tax. It's a little shy of $2.2 billion as of the close of last Friday - $2.185 billion is the exact number as of last Friday.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "And Ron, just a question for you. Given the environment, can you just kind of give us - I think we're all sitting here stunned. Can you give us sort of your take on how this - and you've been around the banking industry for awhile\u00a0 stacks up to sort of the '89-'91 period? And I would assume that you are going to be one of the beneficiaries of flight quality here, and whether indeed you're seeing that. ", "Ron Logue", "Well, I think '89 and '91 was a very difficult time, probably the most difficult that I've ever experienced. This may be approaching that. I'm not too sure it's there yet. But I think were are a lot of lessons learned during that period of time, and I think we've got a number of people in the company that have experienced that. So my sense is that we have been and we'll continue to prepare well for any extended period of time like that.", "We have seen I guess you could call it a flight to quality. We have seen cash balances increase somewhat. I would expect that would continue over time, and I think we're going to be in a position to deal with that, though. That would be an expectation of ours, as history has proven. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "", "Two follow ups - you said the unrealized securities losses - what are the unrealized losses in the conduits since quarter end, and have you moved any of those assets on balance sheet since quarter end? ", "Ed Resch", "In terms of the conduits, same thing but to a lesser degree. From June 30th through last Friday, the 11th, the loss on an after-tax basis increased by about $60 million. ", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "So not much, okay.", "Ed Resch", "A little bit shy of $1.7 after tax. In terms of any assets from the conduits coming on the balance sheet, the answer is no.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "And how much again of the assets from the conduit came on balance sheet this quarter?", "Ed Resch", "This quarter?", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "In the second quarter.", "Ed Resch", "Second quarter was $850 million of triple A rated securities under [ALAPA]. ", "Ron Logue", "No, that was first quarter.", "Ed Resch", "That was first quarter. None this quarter, Mike.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "So you moved zero additional assets from the conduit on balance sheet in the second quarter?", "Ed Resch", "Correct.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "All right, so you've moved no additional assets on balance sheet, and if the FIN 46 decision comes out in your favor, what do you do with all the capital you raised recently? I mean, I saw that as an insurance policy in case you needed to use it. Do you want to keep that insurance policy around for longer or might you put some of that capital to work?", "Ed Resch", "Well, in a perfect world, Mike, we would hope that over time the markets would come in and that opportunities would present themselves to us. I mean, that's how we'd like to see that play out, but who knows. ", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then separately, your pipeline, the backlog, kind of tone of the market?", "Ron Logue", "Yes, very strong. Very strong. Again, this quarter, some real good wins. And I think the other thing that I probably didn't spend some time on, but I talked about a lot of re-bids, one, just about all of the re-bids that we had we won, you know, six huge re-bids. I think if you add Texas Teachers plus the other five, it's close to $300 billion of assets won. We've been extremely successful in retaining our business in the last couple of quarters.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "Can you give some kind of context as to what is really strong pipeline mean as a percentage of, say, current revenues or assets under custody?", "Ron Logue", "Well, I don't know if I could give it to you as a percentage, but probably more in absolute. I think we've been winning somewhere between $400 and $600 billion of assets for the last two or three quarters, which traditionally has been more than we have done, if you go back and look in recent years. That's been a lot more.", "I think some of it has to do with flight to quality. I think some of it has to do with dislocation of others in the marketplace or preoccupation.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "And so would that be some of the other kind of Big Five players, Big Four or Big Five players, or the tier below that?", "Ron Logue", "No, it'd be the Big Five. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ken Usdin - Banc of America Securities.", "Ken Usdin - Banc of America Securities", "", "A couple of quick clean up ones. Can you just confirm again that the CitiStreet gain is not included in your operating guidance?", "Ed Resch", "It is not.", "Ron Logue", "It is not. ", "Ken Usdin - Banc of America Securities", "And what again is the [TC] expected impact from the gain in the third quarter, the benefit? ", "Ed Resch", "It would be about 14 basis points, Ken.", "Ken Usdin - Banc of America Securities", "Are there any other potential calls on capital out there, you know, whether it's SSgA reserve or SILO/LILO exposure, etc., you know, that we may not have seen yet?", "Ed Resch", "Ken, in terms of the second quarter results, the issue of SSgA reserve was evaluated as was our reserve for our SILO exposure, and both were considered to be adequate. So the answer to your question is no. ", "Ken Usdin - Banc of America Securities", "And then as far as the investment portfolio, obviously the incremental downgrades that there were this quarter were mostly related to the monolines. As you look at the portfolio vis-\u00e0-vis the rating agencies, how do you generally continue to feel about forward-looking, I guess, waves of downgrades as far as the overall credit environment is concerned? Taking your points about money good quality of the portfolio, but just any change as far as the potential to have to even potentially impair investments even if they are, quote-unquote, money good, or is it just status quo? ", "Ed Resch", "I think it's more or less status quo. I think that we've been doing a lot of work obviously for the last number of quarters that we've been talking about, and our work supports what we believe and what we think the rating agencies believe in terms of the asset quality. So at this point, I'm not anticipating that we'd have significant downgrades or significant impairment charges. That could obviously always change if circumstances change, but we feel pretty comfortable with where the portfolio is and where the rating agencies are and where our stress tests come out. ", "Ken Usdin - Banc of America Securities", "And the last question is just as far as your forward thinking as far as the guidance and the kind of implied raising of the second half guidance even though you're talking about making sure we don't run rate second quarter results, I'm just wondering if you can kind of give us a thought process on what's better, what's worse versus your prior own budgeting expectations rather than consensus expectations? So as you look forward, just wondering where those kind of implicit hedges are in the business model, if any.", "Ron Logue", "I'd say that probably in a couple of areas, first of all, the core revenue strength is very strong. You know, we've won a lot of new business. We continue to install a lot of new business. We've also been very successful in cross selling, especially into the Investors Financial book of business. And that seems to continue, so we feel good about that.", "But we also have quite a focus on expense control, which I talked about in the past. If in fact you believe we're going into a slower growth environment, we have to deal with expenses today not next quarter or the quarter after that or next year. And we're doing that, and we're doing it carefully.", "And when we get an opportunity to invest a little money, we do that.", "So I think core revenue strength, expense control, and I think net interest revenue, at least for the rest of the year, will be pretty much beneficial to us.", "Ken Usdin - Banc of America Securities", "And one quick last one, just on the conduit question, Ed, to your point before about issuing of some more sub\u00a0debt, can you just speak about how comfortably above the trigger thresholds for automatic consolidation as opposed to on your own doing, you know, that the conduits remain? Like, I don't know, how much cushion there just is on both the profitability test and the credit test?", "Ed Resch", "Sure. There is no automatic trigger, if you will. I mean, it's governed by our FIN 46 model, but to put it in the context of how much sub debt we need versus how much we have and therefore the cushion, Ken, on our two big conduits, you know, the ones that are over $10 billion each, one has an 84% cushion - that's excess sub debt versus required sub debt - and the other one has a 50% cushion, so we've significantly increased our cushions relative to our FIN\u00a046 model requirements.", "Ken Usdin - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, and it's a non-issue with the smaller ones?", "Ed Resch", "Yes. Smaller cushions, but much smaller conduits. I was just giving you the big ones that would have the most balance sheet impact if they were to come on.", "Ken Usdin - Banc of America Securities", "So you feel that there's a lot of room that you aren't anywhere close? Would the only reason you brought the conduits on be because FIN 46 changes?", "Ed Resch", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "", "Just a few quick questions. First, on the foreign deposit costs, what's your flexibility to bring them down further? We've already seen them come down from 2.24% in the second quarter - I'm sorry, in the first quarter - down to, you know, 153 here in the second quarter.", "Kelley MacDonald", "Brian, can you talk more into your telephone? It's a little hard - ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Sorry about that. Sorry. Can you hear me now?", "Kelley MacDonald", "Yes, much better.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Sorry about that, yes. Foreign deposit rates, what's your flexibility to bring that down more? We've seen that come down from 224 down to 153 in the second quarter here. That's almost, you know, about a 70 basis point drop despite the ECB, well, I guess, in the third quarter, raising rates here. I'm just trying to gauge how much more flexibility you have to take that down further, or do you think, you know, that could move up a little bit in the second half?", "Ed Resch", "I don't think you should be thinking about a lot of flexibility there, Brian. I mean, one of the main drivers of that decline was due to the dollar component of that which is Eurodollar, okay? So those deposits benefited from the decline in the U.S. rate environment, which is manifesting itself in the numbers that you just quoted. We're not anticipating the Fed, as we said, to decline any further, so I don't think there's a lot more downside there in terms of decreasing those deposit costs.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "And you still see inflows, I mean, despite being, you know, paying rates that are lower than your peers, you still saw about $5 billion of inflows of custody deposits. Do you expect to be able to retain that, or do you think we'll see some switching out in the second half?", "Ed Resch", "Well, we've been retaining it pretty steadily and actually growing it a little bit so far so, yes, we do expect to retain it. Although, you know, coming into the year we said we didn't think that those deposits would exhibit the growth in '08 that they exhibited in '07, and that's really not been the case. ", "But yes, I mean, we expect to retain it. I mean, one potential upside there is that if for some reason rates were to go up in Europe, the ability to lag pricing could present itself again. But we're really not expecting that, as I said, in our rate forecast. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "So actually that brings me to the next question. In terms of reinvesting the $7 billion of sub debts running off the balance sheet, what do you expect to invest that in? Is that mostly going to be invested in Europe?", "Ed Resch", "No, not necessarily. I mean, some of it may be, but overall we're expecting to continue to invest it, you know, very conservatively, very short, given the disruptions that we've talked so much about.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "So you're going to stay away from credit risk, I assume.", "Ed Resch", "Yes.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "And then so if the ECB and Bank of England do raise, you might invest a little more in Europe and then try to lag the deposit rates on the foreign side?", "Ed Resch", "Perhaps. I mean, you know, certainly the deposit rate lagging is a potential if they were to raise.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "And then just on client conversions, Ron, you talked about $400 billion of new business being won in the second quarter. I assume all of that will be converted in the second half, and then if you can talk about what's also left to be converted in the second half from prior wins.", "Ron Logue", "There's some left to be converted from prior wins. Most of what we talked about today will be converted in the second half of the year. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Any [magnitude] of what's left to be converted in the second half?", "Ron Logue", "I'm sorry, Brian, I couldn't hear that. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Any magnitude of what's left to be converted in the second half? Is it relatively small compared to the -- ", "Ron Logue", "Oh, I don't know. Maybe a half. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Half of that. Okay. And then what's your assumption for the average S&P 500 level with the new guidance?", "Ed Resch", "1350 for the full year average.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "You're staying at 1350, okay.", "Ed Resch", "Yes.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "And [BGI] re-pricing, when does that occur exactly?", "Ed Resch", "Well, I mean, there is no - that's all - we don't talk about that.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "That's in the run rate essentially? ", "Ed Resch", "Yes.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "The renewal date has already passed is what you're saying?", "Ed Resch", "Yes.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "And it's in the run rate? ", "Ed Resch", "Yes.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And then just the processing fees, up to $77 million from - I think I may have missed that in your comments - from $54 million in the first quarter. What was that due to?", "Ron Logue", "I didn't hear the question, Brian.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "I'm sorry. The processing fees, going from $54 million in the first quarter to $77 million in the second quarter. Just trying to get a - ", "Ed Resch", "I mean, that's really due to the absence of the charges that we took in the first quarter to move the conduit assets onto the balance sheet, so the absence of the charge. So other than that, it's kind of status quo for the quarter.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, so your run rate is in the 70s there basically.", "Ed Resch", "Right. Exactly. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "And then just one last question. What's your flexibility to reduce expenses in the second half if we are in a tougher just revenue environment for whatever reason?", "Ed Resch", "Well, we're doing that right - we're looking at that right now, Brian. Obviously, as you know, we're in a high fixed-cost business, so we take a look at what we can do. Obviously, we need to make sure we hire the people we need to do the processing, but we don't necessarily have to hire as many senior people. So, you know, that's one of the people issues. And then we obviously look at - one of the variables is the professional fees and the contract expenses that we do have some flexibility in increasing or decreasing over time.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "So should we think of the other expense line as being a little flexible and, I guess, on the comp line as well. You can basically take down the [inaudible].", "Ed Resch", "Yes, on both lines.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "", "I just want to understand how you guys are approaching unrealized losses for both the conduit and the investment portfolio? Should we go under the assumption that the methodology you're using to value the securities for both conduits is the same?", "Ed Resch", "Yes. Yes, it is. It's the same for the asset classes that are the same. The conduits have more broker quoted prices than the portfolio does. The portfolio is virtually all service driven. But for the asset classes that are common to both, it's the same methodology.", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "It seems, and maybe you can add some clarification there, it seems like your -  the methodology seems a little more conservative on the conduits, and here's why I'm coming to that conclusion. ", "Kelley MacDonald", "Tom, you're breaking up. Can you try to speak a little more slowly?", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Is this better?", "Ron Logue", "Yes.", "Kelley MacDonald", "Yes, much better.", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. It seems like the conduit assets, the valuation methodology seems to be a little bit more conservative versus the securities portfolio. And the way I'm arriving at that conclusion is if you look at, say, Page 8 of your PowerPoint presentation for the conduits, you have, you know, $15 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities, $3.8\u00a0billion of which are U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities, and as you said in your prepared remarks, there's no subprime in that bucket of $3.8 billion of U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities. And the mark on that portfolio's about 19%, so if you take the unrealized loss as compared to the face value, you know, you're carrying those at about $0.80 on the dollar. ", "Conversely, if you look at the securities portfolio, you have $5.7 billion of subprime assets which are marked at $0.90 on the dollar, assuming the unrealized loss is [inaudible] $92 million as of the quarter is correct, you know, which I'm sure it is. So you have assets in the conduit that don't include subprime that are related to mortgages that you're marking at $0.80 on the dollar, you have $5.7 billion of subprime assets on your balance sheet that you're marking at $0.90 on the dollar. So either I'm just looking at it the wrong way or - I just want to get some insight on that.", "Ed Resch", "Well, I mean, I think you have to look at a level below the aggregates. The methodology and the service that we use for both of those asset classes is the same, so while I don't dispute your math in terms of average dollar price, the build up to the aggregates is what's most important at a [QSP] level. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "The subprime assets, 62% are rated triple A.", "Ed Resch", "Right. ", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "The U.S. residential mortgage backeds, which don't include subprime, 72% are rated triple A.", "Ed Resch", "Correct.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "So just on the surface on your numbers, you know, it looks like it's a much more, you know, [inaudible] risky, but you're marking it down more than the securities portfolio.", "Ed Resch", "Relative to the subprime specifically, Tom, you have to look at the 62% triple A being actually a positive factor because of the paydowns that we're receiving on those securities. If you look back at the triple A component over time you'll see that it's declined from a much higher level down to the current level, and that's because of the structure of those securities, where the payments that we get come down from the top and the losses that are incurred come up from the bottom. Since we're at the top of the stack from a credit perspective, we're receiving paydowns and that's why we say none of those securities are in arrears as to principal or interest.", "So it's simply the mathematical calculation of triple A and double A bucketing relative to the paydowns that's driving the 62% number that you quoted. That's actually a good thing.", "Brian Bedell - Merrill Lynch", "What's the average FICO for that subprime exposure? Do you have that?", "Ed Resch", "I can find it. Do you see it?", "Kelley MacDonald", "No, I don't have it.", "Ed Resch", "I'm sorry. I don't have it at hand. We'll have to find out.", "Kelley MacDonald", "I can get it for you. I'll get it for you, Tom.", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Thanks, Kelley.", "Kelley MacDonald", "Oh, wait a minute. It's 626.", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "626, okay. ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of allotted time for questions and answers.

(Operator Instructions) Now I would like to introduce Kelly McDonald, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations at State Street. ", "Kelly McDonald", "Before Ron Logue our Chairman and Chief Cxecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Ed Resch begin their remarks I would like to remind you that during this call we may be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those filed on a Form 8-K this morning as well as State Street\u2019s 2007 annual report on Form 10-K and its subsequent filings with the SEC.  We encourage you to review those filings, including the sections on risk factors concerning any forward-looking statements we may make today.  Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of today October 15, 2008 and the corporation does not undertake to revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after today.", "I would also like to remind you that you can find slide presentations regarding the corporations investment portfolio and asset-backed commercial paper conduits as well as a separate presentation regarding the AMLS and the CPFF program and our third quarter 2008 earnings press release, which includes reconciliations of non-GAAP measures referred to on this web cast, in the investor relations section of our web site as referenced in our press release this morning.", "Ronald Logue", "Given the events of the last couple of days we thought it best to move our earnings call ahead and provide as much information as quickly as possible.  Now I can\u2019t recall a time when the need for clarity and understanding of issues is more important.  So, I want to do something a little different today.  I want to spend the time talking about the challenges we have faced in the current market and how we have managed them.  I want to spend only a short time discussing the results of the third quarter, which were very good and continue to show momentum.  I will let Ed, as he usually does, discuss the details of the third quarter.  ", "Let me focus on the actions we have taken as a result of the extraordinary events taking place each day in our industry.  Our purpose, obviously, is to emerge from these difficult times a stronger company.  Not just from a capital adequacy perspective, but from a risk control perspective and importantly from a customer perspective protecting not only our franchise, but also the interests of our customers.", "First let me bring you up to date with some of the current activities we have been involved with.  We are pleased to be included as one of the nine institutions chosen by the US treasury to take a leadership role in the recently announced Capital Purchase Program that forms part of the TARP.  Our selection demonstrates our role as a firm integral to the health and stability of the infrastructure of the financial markets and we are confident that the plan helps to restore stability and confidence to the financial markets.  ", "We are also participating as a service provider in a number of Federal Reserve and Treasury programs to address the financial crisis.  Acting on behalf of money market funds we have been one of the leading participants in the asset-backed commercial paper money market facility known as AMLF.  ", "We have also, just yesterday, been selected as the custody provider for the recently announced commercial paper funding facility, or CPFF as it is known.  State Street Global Advisors is also pleased to be one of the two managers selected by the US Treasury to manage the assets of the mortgage backed securities program.", "Let me begin with a summary of our participation in the Capital Purchase Program.  We have agreed to sell to the US Treasury department $2 billion of preferred shares as well as warrants to purchase common stock, which we anticipate will be minimally dilutive to our shareholders.  We have a strong track record.  A business model focused on continuing the success and strong prospects of continuous earnings and whatever advantage of strength we gain from this program will benefit us in the future.", "That does not mean, however, that we will not consider raising additional capital to further strengthen our capital position under the right conditions.  The CPFF in particular will help the market for asset-backed commercial paper in these distressed markets.  The intent of the CPFF is to support the market for commercial paper which is vital to the capital markets.  We believe that together with the AMLF this program should restore confidence to the commercial paper markets.  Specifically, until the market becomes more liquid, the program will also provide an alternative source of liquidity to our conduits reducing the need to hold commercial paper on our balance sheet during these disruptive markets.", "Also this morning, I would like to discuss the following issues that I know are on your mind:  our securities lending program; our investment portfolio and the asset-backed commercial paper program; other issues that we addressed in the press release, including the Lehman reserve and the possibility of an additional fourth quarter non-operating charge to protect our customers in certain managed accounts.  ", "There has clearly been a flight to quality and safety, particularly near the end of the quarter and our deposit base and our custody trading and asset management businesses have benefited from our reputation for stability.", "We received a number of questions about our Securities Lending Program. Details about how it works as well as our view as to the future of this business, given the decision by several lenders to suspend participation.  ", "First let me say that Securities Lending provides a vital source of liquidity to equity, bond, and money markets, as well as reduces the cost of trading and settlement, thereby benefiting all market participants.  Our Securities Lending registered and non-registered funds are operating as we expected.  Our program remains strong and these funds are invested conservatively.  None of our funds that support State Street Securities lending business has lost money for our customers. Due primarily to declines in the market, but also suspension or reductions in securities lending by some customers, we have seen assets in our lending program decline by approximately 20%.  As a result, we have seen increased withdrawal activity from the collateral pools, but we have been able to manage these outflows in a manner that protects our customers from loss [ph].  The current spreads and volatility are expected to at least partially offset the impact of lower volumes.  ", "Let\u2019s talk about the asset-backed commercial paper program and the investment portfolio.  As we have said in the past and Ed will discuss in a minute, the assets in our investment portfolio and asset-backed commercial paper program are of high quality.  Very few have been downgraded and none are in default.  We continue to believe that the prices are not reflective of the underlying value of these securities if held to term, but reflect a continuing lack of liquidity in the market.", "Next the Lehman related reserve.  As we have stated publicly, we have no unsecured exposure to Lehman Brothers.  We do have a secured exposure to Lehman which is now part of the bankruptcy proceeding.  We have indemnified certain of our customers with respect to repurchase agreements with Lehman Brothers Commercial Paper Inc.  These repurchase agreements of $1 billion were collateralized by $1.25 billion of mortgages.  Following the Lehman bankruptcy, in light of current market conditions, we valued this collateral less than the repurchase obligations, so recorded a $200 million reserve.  We believe this reserve will be adequate, although we will not know the ultimate outcome until the collateral is sold or matures.", "We manage accounts that have the benefit of contractual arrangements with other financial institutions that allow the accounts to issue and redeem units at book value rather than at market value.  The difference between market and book value on these accounts has increased to levels that may result in these financial institutions requiring that we sell the fixed income securities held in these accounts to limit any further risk to these other financial institutions.  Such an action could negatively affect our customers and our reputation.  Although we are not contractually obligated to do so we are evaluating whether we should provide support to these accounts.  Although we have not currently committed to any course of action, a decision to support these accounts could result in a non-operating pre-tax charge of between $400 and $450 million in the fourth quarter.  While we are still considering our options, we want to disclose the possibility of a charge of this magnitude to you.  ", "Now before I turn the discussion over to Ed, let me remind you our third quarter performance, especially in light of the environment in which we are operating, was excellent.  On an operating basis, earnings per share in the third quarter were $1.24, up 8% from $1.15 per share last year and down 11% from $1.40 in the second quarter.  ", "Operating revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled $2.5 billion for the quarter, an increase of 12.4% from last years third quarter compared with a 9.5% increase in expenses to $1.7 billion on an operating basis.  Compared to the second quarter of 2008 operating revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was down 6.1% and expenses on an operating basis increased 6.3%.  ", "Return on equity on an operating basis was 15.4% in the third quarter, down from 15.8% in the third quarter of 2007, and down from 19.3% in the second quarter of 2008.  ", "Our operating expenses in the third quarter declined 6% from the second quarter, due to our successful expense controls and we will continue to exercise this expense discipline as we have in the past.  ", "Also, excluding the non-operating items in the quarter, we achieved 290 basis points of positive operating leverage when measured on a year-over-year basis, our 16th sequential quarter and 20 basis points when measured on a quarter-over-quarter comparison. ", "In addition to the government mandates we won $280 billion of asset servicing new business, including names such as Lovard [ph] asset management, the UK operations of Sun Life of Canada, the State of Georgia Pension Fund, and the London Borough of Enfield superannuation fund.  SSGA won mandates from the Cabershire [ph] County Consult Pension Fund, the Bank Pension of Denmark, the Massachusetts State Pension Fund, and the Teachers Retirement System the State of Illinois.  These new wins as well as the continuing installations of previous wins are expected to help offset some of the revenue loss due to reduced market valuations over our existing book of business.", "Edward Resch", "This morning all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results, excluding the CitiStreet gain the Lehman related reserve, the SILO related charge, the impact of the asset backed commercial paper liquidity facility offered through the Federal Reserve and the merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of Investors Financial. ", "Ron provided an overview of the various issues in the quarter.  Let me just briefly explain the additional SILO reserve.", "In the third quarter we recorded a $98 million pre-tax charge against net interest revenue and a $39 million increase on the tax line.  We believe that a majority of the pre-tax charge will come back into income over time.  The company previously settled with the IRS on our LILO leases and over previous quarters has increased our reserve against the SILO exposure.  During the third quarter, as the IRS began to become more successful in increasing its rate of settlement, particularly in light of recent court decisions, we decided that the more prudent course of action was to increase our Silo reserve again.  ", "Let me now highlight certain components of our income statement.  ", "Servicing and management fees both performed well, particularly in light of the significant declines in market valuations on both the S&P and the EFA. The continuing volatility in the market benefited our trading revenue growth particularly foreign exchange.  Performance in securities finance was also strong on a year-over-year basis and was down about 30% from the second quarter due to the impact of the dividend season in Europe in the second quarter.", "The decline in processing and other fees on both a year-over-year and a sequential quarter basis was due to lower fees.  Of particular note on the lower fees from the asset backed commercial paper program were fees from this program declined from $13.2 million in the second quarter to $5.7 million in the third quarter.", "Regarding the investors financial acquisition all of our metrics are on track and we continue to expect the transaction to be about $0.04 to $0.05 accretive to our 2008 results, significantly ahead of our original plan at the time of the acquisition.  ", "Regarding expenses we had a $0.06 decline in third quarter expenses compared to the second quarter.  I will comment on only two areas.  First, salaries and benefits expenses declined 4% from the second quarter due primarily to a lower level of incentive compensation.  Other expenses were down 19% compared to the second quarter primarily due to reductions in professional fees, lower costs in bank operations and lower securities processing costs as we controlled expenses in anticipation of a lower revenue environment.", "As we anticipated on last quarter\u2019s conference call, net interest revenue was down from the second quarter due to lower asset yields.  In addition, net interest margin of 222 basis points was down 9 basis points from the second quarter of 2008.  ", "Now let me turn to the investment portfolio.  ", "The investment portfolio has not changed significantly in credit quality or size since the second quarter, however the unrealized mark-to-market losses have widened as of quarter end as a result of illiquidity in the market and the general global market stress.  I will refer you to our investment portfolio slide presentation for the particulars of our portfolio composition.  ", "During the quarter, particularly following the Lehman bankruptcy in mid-September, we saw spreads further widen in an incredibly illiquid market: the unrealized after tax mark widened by $1.3 billion from $2.0 billion at June 30, 2008, to $3.3 billion at September 30, 2008.  To give you some idea of the impact of the Lehman bankruptcy, the mark as of September 12, 2008, before the Lehman bankruptcy, was $2.98 billion after tax.  We continue to believe that these prices are not reflective of the underlying value of the securities if held to term, but indicate a continuing lack of liquidity in the fixed income market.  ", "You will note that our entire portfolio remains rated as it was in June, 84.4% AAA rated and 8.7% AA rated.  We have had only minimal down grades, no defaults, and all securities are current as to principle and interest.", "As in past quarters, on our web site you will find the investor portfolio detail about the third quarter compared to the data we have presented for previous quarters.  I strongly urge you to review those slides.", "Our portfolio was well diversified with over 9,300 Q SIPs and if you look at the slides you notice that only 49 new securities, of which 13 were municipal bonds, were downgraded in the third quarter.  These additional downgrades represent about $1.4 billion in asset value or less than 2% of the total portfolio: all are current and none are in default.   In the context of a difficult market, more than 60% of these down grades were one letter grade or less.", "The slides also contain data indicating the stresses we applied in testing our analysis of the portfolio.  Rather than go through them all this morning I will point out two examples which represent asset classes we are often asked about. ", "We have about $2.3 billion, or $4,269 securities wrapped by an insurance provider.  Of this number more than 99% or 4,242 are municipal bonds.  Excluding these the remaining wrapped securities, 16 HELOCs and 10 sub-prime asset backed securities, equal about $300 million or 26 securities.  With the exception of the insurer FSA we removed all of the wraps and stressed the bonds.  As you can see on the slides the total HELOC loss would be about $29 million after tax. ", "The sub-prime assets which have declined more than $1 billion since last years third quarter now have 45% credit enhancement which comes from the structure itself and means that even if every mortgage in the security were to default we would not lose $1.00 until the recovery rate for those assets fell below 55%.", "Now as to our outlook for non-interest revenue for the remainder of 2008:  Last quarter we increased our outlook for net interest margin for 2008.  I said that we expected the margin to be around 215 basis points or slightly higher.  In the current environment, excluding the impact of the AMLF, we know expect our margin on average for the full year to be around 220 basis points.  ", "As you can see our balance sheet grew considerably during the quarter, especially following the Lehman bankruptcy and the commencement of the AMLF.  Increased liquidity from our customer deposits in the recent market environment and our participation in the AMLF have caused our balance sheet to grow temporarily.  As of September 30, 2008 we had deposited an additional $54 billion in excess balances with Central Banks plus an additional $77 billion related to the AMLF program.  I remind you that we bear no credit or capital risk for holding the AMLF assets.", "On the subject of the AMLF I direct you to the AMLF slide presentation to give you some idea of the non-operating revenue we will earn as a facilitator of this program, for the last two weeks of September we earned about $8 million and for the fourth quarter, assuming an average balance of around $30 billion, we anticipate earning between $50 and $60 million in the quarter.", "Let me review our capital ratios now.  ", "The principle capital ratio that we manage to is the tier 1 leverage ratio.  We have historically targeted between 5 \u00bc and 5 \u00be %, but given the market environment we expect our leverage ration to continue to grow through a level above the top of this range in order to preserve flexibility in what appears to be a continuingly volatile market.  ", "Had the capital purchase program been in place at September 30, 2008, the pro forma tier 1 ratio for the corporation would have been 18.84% and the pro forma leverage ratio would have been 9.76%.  As of September 30, 2008 our tier 1 leverage ratio stands at 8.36%, up from 8.25% as of June 30, 2008. At September 30, 2008 our adjusted tangible common equity ratio is 4.80% down from 5.40% at June 30, 2008, primarily due to an increase in the unrealized loss on the investment portfolio.", "We have adjusted the TCE ratio for the impact of the AMLF, the excess balances left with the Federal Reserve Banks and other Central Banks and the deferred tax liability.  I refer you to the slides entitled Asset Backed Commercial Paper Conduits for a description of the methodology used to calculate the adjusted TCE ratio.", "Next a discussion of the asset-backed commercial paper program:  ", "As in the past, you can find a detailed quarterly review of the assets displayed by type, country of origin, and ratings in the asset-backed commercial slide presentation.  Also there you will find the unrealized after tax mark-to-market losses for each asset type and the stresses we applied to them.  In the interest of time I will not discuss them in detail today.  ", "At September 30, 2008 the conduits held assets of $25.5 billion, down from $28.4 billion on June 30, 2008 due to asset amortization and the strengthening US dollar.  As in the investment portfolio, the illiquidity in the market resulted in an increase in the unrealized after tax mark-to-market loss to $2.1 billion, an increase of about $500 million from June 30, 2008 due primarily to higher credit spreads on US mortgages.  As I have stated many times, we created this program in 1992 primarily to address customer requests for high quality, highly rated commercial paper.  The conduits have never suffered a credit loss on any asset they purchased, evidence of our strong credit discipline.  80% of the assets are rated AAA, AA or A; none of the assets in our conduit are sub-prime, nor are there any SIVs in the conduit program.", "As of September 30, 2008 the assets continue to have an average weighted maturity of about four years and the paper has a weighted average maturity of 15 days, down from 20 days at June 30.  All securities in the conduits are current as to principle and interest.  ", "As I am sure you are aware, the commercial paper market has been considerably strained, particularly near the end of the third quarter.  Following the Lehman bankruptcy and with several prominent money market funds having NAV less than $1.00 many investors withdrew from or limited their exposure to the ABCP market.  As of September 30, 2008 excluding our own commercial paper pledge by money market funds to the federal reserve, we held $6.2 billion of our asset backed commercial paper on our balance sheet; however to give you some idea of the impact of the Lehman bankruptcy, as of September 12, the day before the Lehman bankruptcy was declared, we held $1.5 billion on our balance sheet.", "If the disrupted markets continue and we are unable to sell the asset-backed commercial paper to customers we expect that a substantial amount of the commercial paper issued by our conduits will be eligible for sale to the Federal Reserve under the Commercial \\Paper Funding Facility.  If the Commercial Paper Funding Facility had been available at September 30, 2008 we believe that the amount of commercial paper we held on the balance sheet would have been materially lower.  This program is described further in the slides we\u2019ve provided.", "Due to the high quality assets and their performance we do not currently believe we need to consolidate the conduits; however we are well prepared for consolidation if required by FASB as of January 1, 2010.  From a funding standpoint the risk of a more immediate consolidation continues to be included in our contingency funding plan.  As of September 30, 2008, given the market environment, we carried about $68 billion in liquid assets on our balance sheet, $54 billion of which was the excess reserve held at the Central Banks.", "On a pro forma basis as of September 30 the consolidation of the [inaudible] assets onto our balance sheet would reduce our leverage ratio by about 151 basis points from 8.36% to 6.85% and the tangible common equity ratio about 175 basis points from 4.80% to 3.05%.  I should also remind you that we have been generating 40 to 50 basis points of organic capital per quarter.

We are just trying to figure out how we draw the boundaries of clients having any risk at all.  ", "Ronald Logue", "That is going to be a grey area, obviously Glen.  I think the factor there is going to be the, I guess, the attitude and the condition of the financial guarantors there.

Ed you mentioned that you don\u2019t have any current plans to consolidate it and would be prepared, assuming that the FASB did make the changes.  Can you just talk through outside of the FASB changes?  What would cause the triggers for consolidation in any interim period?  Meaning where are you relative to the tests and how much flexibility do you still have right now?", "Edward Resch", "Well the things that could cause a conduit consolidation are the same ones that we\u2019ve always talked about, which are that if we would for some reason to not be on the right side of the FIN 46 model, which I\u2019ll talk about in a minute in terms of our cushions, but it is basically that as well as any issues that were of a protracted nature that could cause the conduits funding costs to greatly exceed the asset yield.  That\u2019s kind of a going concern concept under the accounting rules.  We are not in that position, we don\u2019t have any expectation to be in that position, but that could cause a consolidation.", "In terms of our cushions, they are very strong.  Actually a little bit stronger than on one of the conduits, one of those big ones, then they were last quarter.  I define cushion, again, as the available sub debt versus the requirement.  On one of the large conduits it is well above 100% cushion and on the other larger conduit it is just over 40% cushion.  On the two smaller conduits, one is at 40% and the other is about 30% cushion, so we are in a very strong position in terms of our subordinated debt, first loss notes versus our requirement.", "Kenneth Usdin - Bank of America Securities", "", "Ed as you gave some color relative to pre-Lehman, post-Lehman; can you give us any color as far as that profitability or ongoing concern test?

I mean have there been some days or weeks in the last couple weeks of the quarter where that test got tougher on a day-to-day basis I guess?   I know it is measured over a longer period as far as the consolidation test is concerned, but can you just give us some color there?", "Edward Resch", "Yes, absolutely.  Post the Lehman bankruptcy we saw the amount on our balance sheet go up, as I said.  Investors pulled back, cash was kept, they were hoarding cash, and not investing in our asset backed commercial paper or others we believe, as the market kind of froze up.  In terms of placing the paper that we did place it was all over night and it was at a much higher rate for that over night period, because of the market conditions. So given that the assets did not re-price overnight we were in for that increment of paper that we priced over night at a high rate we were in a negative position.  Overall that was for a shorter period of time and not of concern from the standpoint of the going concern test.

", "Brian Bedell \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "The pipeline for custody mandates, are you seeing people sort of slow down their decision-making and then also in conjunction with that do you see pension plans curtailing their securities lending activity, at least in the near term?", "Ronald Logue", "We are seeing some curtailment in the securities lending programs.  I think I said we had about 20% reduction in volume; that\u2019s happening in a very orderly fashion.  I would expect over time they would come back.  I think we reported a very robust new business wins; I think it was $280 billion, some big wins.  If we are seeing anything in reduction it is in new fund openings from existing customers there has probably been a slow down there, but the new business wins continue to be strong as evidenced by the $280 billion.  If there is one thing we are seeing, it is this flight to quality.  ", "One thing I can say is that the customers are not only concerned about their securities; they are concerned about the cash that goes along with the securities.  Evidence the $54 billion in excess deposits.   We have seen this, I remember 15 years ago having the same issue and where there was a flight to quality, so I think that is playing some role in some of the new business, which has been helpful for us, it is showing up in some of the names.  The $280 billion in net new business is good and the pipeline for new business continues to be strong, so if there is a slow down it is probably in new funds being opened. ", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Rob Rotschow from Deutsche Bank.", "Rob Rotschow - Deutsche Bank", "", "Is it your understanding that all of the assets that are in the conduits are available in these various Fed programs to be pledged?", "Edward Resch", "Our understanding right now is that most of them, but to have them actually put into the tarp would require us to bring them on the company\u2019s balance sheet.  I don\u2019t believe they could go, as we know right now, directly from the conduit into the tarp.", "Rob Rotschow - Deutsche Bank", "", "Which of the assets are available for the CPF program?", "Edward Resch", "It is not the actual conduits, it is the commercial paper that the conduits issue and it is all of our dollar denominated paper for less than 90-days maturity issued by US issuers.  We have two conduits that are non-US issuers and those are the ones that would be excluded, but those are the smaller ones.  ", "Ronald Logue", "We said about 22 out of 25.", "Edward Resch", "Right, those are the two big conduits in the US.", "Rob Rotschow - Deutsche Bank", "", "My second question is on the interest income.  It seems like there are several moving parts there.  You have the $50 to $60 million from the Fed program.  Can you tell us what sort of spread you are earning on those Central Bank assets or excess reserves and then separately what the outlook is sort of excluding those two factors?", "Edward Resch", "What we\u2019re earning on the Central Bank reserves is zero, which is why we are highlighting it, separating it out from the various calculations given the unique nature of the quarter and the liquidity position that we have.  ", "In terms of the other side of the balance sheet we have demand deposits on which we pay nothing of $70 billion, so it\u2019s a little bit of a unique situation where we have zero earning assets in the central banks and we have a lot of liquidity, as we described, on the liability side.", "In terms of going forward we are going to be excluding the AMLF from our operating results.  We think that that\u2019s the right way to look at it as the program may be rather short-term in nature.  In terms of the Central Bank balances we will break them out if in fact they continue to be of a significant size.  ", "I would just point out that the normal excess liquidity that we have has been in the range of $15 to $20 billion.  We have been carrying that since the stress started in the summer of \u201907 and obviously that\u2019s much lower than $54.  ", "In terms of the earnings we earned 75 basis points going forward on the excess Fed balances as they pay on reserves.", "Rob Rotschow - Deutsche Bank", "", "I have a question on the securities lending.  I think you have said you had maybe 400 clients.  How many of those have sort of ceased operations at this point?", "Ronald Logue", "About 5%.", "Rob Rotschow - Deutsche Bank", "", "It seems like your assets under management were down a little bit more than the market.  I am curious as to whether there are any area\u2019s in particular where you have seen weakness or outflows and also if you could comment on what\u2019s happening with your client funds, which I guess is probably not [interposing].", "Ronald Logue", "No there is not one particular area where we have seen a big decrease.   What we are beginning to see is an increase, however, in passive funds and I think you are going to continue to see that trend over the coming months.  I would expect that there will be some inflows on the passive side probably more than they had been in the past, but there is no one area that I can point to that has had a significant outflow.  ", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research LLC", "", "Ron if you could just speak to the implications for your participation in whatever they are calling the thing that came out yesterday, you being one of the nine banks.  I think you said there was a $2 billion investment versus the $3 that has been reported, is that correct?", "Ronald Logue", "$2 billion yes.  ", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research LLC", "", "What does this mean in terms of payment of dividends?  I mean what are the constraints that are put upon you by participation in this program, because there is a tremendous amount of information and disinformation out there.", "Ronald Logue", "Well there is a 5% coupon on it.  You can\u2019t raise the dividend, can\u2019t buy back stock without are probably the biggest ones. ", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research LLC", "", "At what point do you buy this back?  Are you able to buy this back, are you compelled to buy this back?  If you could just, how do you get out of this?", "Ronald Logue", "We can buy it back probably any time in the next three years.  The intent here I think, to put it in my words, is to jump start capital formation.  Obviously as we go forward the way we look at this is an opportunity during a difficult time to get some more strength, but we need to continue to look at how we are going to strengthen our balance sheet and we also believe that we will pay this back within that period of time.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research LLC", "", "I don\u2019t know how else to ask this, but were you compelled to receive this investment as sort of a quid pro quo for being involved in these programs?", "Ronald Logue", "No.  There was general consensus in that room that this is the right thing to do and I don\u2019t feel that at all.  This was important.  This was important for all of us to do this. ", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research LLC", "", "Secondly, on the TCE ratio at 4.8%, I mean obviously that is still quite high.  Is there a level at which you would feel that you would need to raise common equity again?", "Ronald Logue", "I think in the past we have always targeted around 3%, anything lower than 3%.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research LLC", "", "Okay so there is quite a ways to go there.  Thirdly, just finally if I could get your and Ed\u2019s observations on the credit market environment.  Are we seeing any loosening of the credit markets etc\u2026?", "Ronald Logue", "I think we saw some shreds come in yesterday a little bit.  It is a little too early to tell, but we did see some effect yesterday and we will closely watch it.", "Edward Resch", "I think that is right.  I mean we saw a very good day yesterday overall, but it is just one day.", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Brian Foran with Goldman Sachs.  ", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "", "On that 3% target, you have talked about it in the past.  Should we think of that including or excluding conduit consolidation and should we think of it including or excluding the government preferred?", "Edward Resch", "The government preferred has no effect on it, but in terms of conduit consolidation we present the pro forma ration for that very purpose.  Our lower boundary as we think about TC is 3% and we include the pro forma consolidation on a pro forma basis there.", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay so to be clear, the 3.05% right now is the number we should be focused on relative to your 3% minimum?", "Edward Resch", "Yes.", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "", "Then secondly, if I go through the transcript here there have been about ten questions on the conduit for every one question on the core business.  Is there any point where you would consider pro actively consolidating the conduit and just try to put it behind you and get people refocused on what seemed like some pretty good results in a difficult environment?", "Ronald Logue", "No, because that is not the way to spend the shareholders money. We think this is money good.  I can think of a lot of better ways to spend the shareholders money.", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "", "At what point does positive operating leverage become impossible to maintain, if ever, if the market continues to be flat to down from here?  Is there a point where the reinvestment needs of the business just become so big that you can\u2019t cut costs?", "Ronald Logue", "No, I think we are doing a pretty good job cutting the costs, obviously, depending on how disrupted things could potentially get in the future that would have an effect, but I think we are getting a lot better at creating that lever. As we have said many times, in this business you can\u2019t completely stop reinvesting, because is you do you fall behind and that is going to have long-term effects, as we have seen in the past; so it is really more of a question of how you spend the money as opposed to not spending the money.  It is an art and I think we are beginning to learn how to do that pretty well, again, evidence this quarter.  And if you think that we are going to be in a slower growth environment we are going to have to continue to do that.", "We are not going to change our view or our objectives of trying to generate positive operating leverage.  The way we will look at it is if it is going to be a slower growth environment next year fine, but we are going to have to grow faster than our competitors.  If it is not 10,12, 15% whatever it is we have to target it to grow what we think is going to be faster than our competitors and that is kind of the mind set that we go into the is with and positive operating leverage plays a big role in that.  ", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan", "", "Ed the chance of common equity reversal, you changed your methodology this quarter.  I guess apples-to-apples versus where you were last quarter you were probably around the 2.75% range, I want to confirm that.  Then given that change in methodology did you change your thinking on your target?", "Edward Resch", "You are correct in highlighting the fact that we added the deferred tax liability.  In this quarter we felt that that was more appropriate to do given the rating agency treatment of the deferred tax liability as well as what some of our peers do.", "Relative to changing the target, that is something that we have under consideration.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan", "", "Ron, you mentioned that you are seeing more of an influent of passive assets in the management.  Is that a shift from the enhanced or is that just a shift from active?  Can you talk a little bit more about that?  I think people move out of those categories where they took on a little more risk for supposedly higher yields over time?", "Ronald Logue", "Yes I think it is just some new money coming in being parked for a while.  That is what I really think is going on.  I guess you could say it is from both, but we are also seeing new money coming in and it actually being parked for a while.  I think then the opportunity for us is once we have it, as things get better, can we convert it.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan", "", "Ed, going back to the AMLF, the initial fees as you are buying this paper you are benefiting from where the paper has been trading at, but when you look at it on an ongoing business, what are the fees that you are doing on this?", "Edward Resch", "Assuming a certain level of the AMLF on average for the quarter we think we could get in the range of $40 to $50 million of fees on this for the\u2026", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan", "", "That is over 10 basis points?", "Edward Resch", "Excuse me, about 50 to 60 in the fourth quarter.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan", "", "So is that a fee that you get for actually for just buying this paper and selling it to the Fed and just charging a 10, 15 basis point fee?", "Edward Resch", "Yes, that is the program.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan", "", "Where are your unrealized losses post the quarter currently and where are assets under custody and asset under management levels currently given what\u2019s happened thus far in the fourth quarter?", "Edward Resch", "The unrealized after tax losses on the portfolio as of last night are $3.8 billion, so they have increased a bit since quarter end.  On the conduits it has increased slightly to $2.2 billion.  Overall conduit size though has decreased to $24.7 billion from the quarter end balances.  AUC and AUM I do not have for you as of the close of last night.", "Kelly McDonald", "", "Vivek, we don\u2019t usually disclose quarter end interim month.", "Edward Resch", "My sense is it is not a whole lot different than quarter end. ", "Operator", "", "Your last question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "", "In SSGA the strategies that you are taking in the liquidity space, the fixed income space, I mean clearly we\u2019ve moved from enhanced more towards passive.  I am wondering going forward as you kind of look at this business is there anything you would do structurally differently to either capture more client assets in a world where enhanced index might not be what the flavor of the day is over the next several years?", "Ronald Logue", "I think generally what the opportunity for us here is is to capture new relationships, because I think you are going to see this flight to passive.  The opportunity is that once you capture a new relationship that you had not had in any way shape or form, how you can increase that relationship.  In SSGA it is about moving up the spectrum, if you will, into more active products, and this is where the synergy takes place.  No matter how you capture a new relationship if you don\u2019t have it on the servicing site as well there is an opportunity for you.", "I think the strategy for us is to capture new relationships and find ways to cross sell into that new relationship that we would not normally have had if it weren\u2019t for the situation. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "", "Can you give us a sense as to the number of new clients that you have been able to capture over the past couple of quarters here?", "Ronald Logue", "I can\u2019t other than the ones that, if you go back and look at the last two quarters I have probably identified maybe 15 or 20 pretty significant names.  I would say at least half of those are brand new relationships, if not more.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "", "In the past you have spoken about the opportunities in Europe.  Clearly Europe is having similar kinds of dislocations that we are seeing here. How does that impact the opportunities for you?", "Ronald Logue", "I think, this is my opinion and something that we need to prepare for, as soon as we begin to see ore normalized markets there are going to be significant opportunities because I think organizations are going to focus on how do we trim ourselves down and how are we going to be able to deal with maybe not this level of disruption but continued disruptions?  So, we are planning to see, I think, some significant opportunities.   When is that going to happen?  I don\u2019t know, first, second, third quarter of next year assuming some more normalized markets, but history does repeat itself and usually after some level of disruption there is this introspection that goes on and a willingness to find ways to turn fixed costs into variable costs in the asset management business.  I think that we are going to see some opportunities, especially in Europe actually.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "", "I just wonder because of the degree of government involvement does that push off, potentially, some of these strategic changes in the industry?", "Ronald Logue", "No, I think just the opposite.  I think to the extent that asset managers would want to off load operations that are, I guess, not government controlled, but where the government is involved they would want to do that and get back to what they do best which is investing money.  I think that will probably add to that.

", "Ronald E. Logue ", "All of us trust banks, commercial banks, investment banks have been through and continue to go through the most challenging times we\u2019ve seen in decades.  Financial institutions have all dealt with similar problems and we all have our unique issues to address.  At State Street we look at the issues we face from two perspectives: how we manage through this current crisis with the most favorable financial results given the market environment; and just as important how do the decisions we make now position the company to take advantage of the emerging opportunities as the economy turns around realizing that we will be operating in a more regulated deleveraged world.", "We think we have an advantage over some of our competition because our business is focused upon servicing institutional investors rather than on traditional banking activities such as making loans, commercial or consumer.  Having said that we do have issues to deal with and we are taking steps to do so.  I want to talk about how we are reshaping the company to operate more efficiently in the future and how we are playing close attention to building the type of balance sheet that will be necessary to support our business in this new environment.", "Amid this uncertain environment, this morning we announced results that are favorable in light of the challenges we in the industry will continue to face this year.  At the same time we continue to maintain positive earnings throughout the market crisis our regulatory capital ratios also remain strong.  Our Tier-1 Capital stands at 19.13% and our Tier-1 leverage ratio stands at 10.44%, each at March 31, 2009.  ", "We are implementing our tangible common equity improvement plan that we announced on February 5th at our Investor and Analyst day and increased our pro forma TCE ratio which assumes the consolidation of our asset backed commercial paper conduits that we sponsor.  As of March 31, 2009 the TCE ratio is 5.87% and the pro forma TCE ratio is 2.22%.  An improvement in the pro forma ratio of 103 basis points compared to December 31, 2008.", "Our TCE ratio when calculated on risk weighted assets is 8.15% and on a pro forma risk weighted basis is 3.34% each at March 31, 2009.  Ed will discuss the details of this plan and our assumptions in a minute.  We\u2019re also making progress reducing the size of our asset backed commercial paper program which stood at $29 billion as of December 31, 2007 and was about $23.9 billion as of December 31, 2008 and at March 31, 2009 was $22.5 billion.", "As I said, we\u2019re making progress on our TCE improvement plan.  The unrealized after tax loss in the investment portfolio has improved about $465 million since December 31, 2008 from approximately $6.3 billion to approximately $5.9 billion as of March 31, 2009.  The unrealized after tax loss in the conduit assets has remained about flat with December 31, 2008.  As of last Friday, April 17th the unrealized after tax loss has improved another $91 million to about $5.8 billion in the investment portfolio compared to March 31, 2008.  ", "Some of the highlights of the recent quarter include achieving positive operating leverage of 440 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2008, significantly reducing expenses in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2008 most notably in salaries and benefits as well as in other expenses.  $1.8 billion of assets in our investment portfolio either matured or paid down at par in the first quarter despite an average price of $0.91 per dollar at December 31, 2008.", "Through March 31, 2009 all of the assets in both our investment portfolio and our conduits continue to be current for principal and interest and we have had no defaults.  Although hedge fund markets continue to deleverage we continue to win mandates in servicing alternative funds as funds are beginning to move from prime brokers to independent third party administrators or custodians.  Since the beginning of 2008 only one of our hedge fund clients has closed its business.  ", "Our private equity business has added five new clients and has reached $138 billion in assets under administration.  In total our alternative business has added 14 new clients, eight new hedge funds, five new private equity funds and one new client using our global risk services.  Our core business continues to perform well as overall declines in asset based fees are partially offset as we integrate the wins from the fourth quarter and first quarters for both servicing and management.", "As investor managers are faced with weak markets and increase expenses, they are looking to us to turn some of their fixed cost into variable costs.  We won mandates for about $111 billion of assets to be serviced in the first quarter.  We believe our middle office offering which is now built out and operating at scale is a key differentiator for State Street and will be a competitive advantage as large investment managers seek to control fixed costs throughout outsourcing arrangements.  We\u2019ve been in this business for nine years and have carefully built out this platform that is adaptable to markets worldwide.  ", "Let me briefly be a little more specific about some of our recent wins.  Among the 14 wins in alternative investments in the first quarter we\u2019ve been appointed to provide fund administrative services for [See Change Investments].  We\u2019re also now providing custody and foreign exchange services for the corporate and group services division of Canadian Western Trust, a wholly owned subsidiary of Canadian Western Bank.  Orlando Healthcare awarded a custody and accounting mandate to us for $500 million in assets.  Canadian Broadcast Incorporation Pension Board of Trustees awarded us a $1 billion mandate to provide custody, accounting and securities lending.  ", "[M&G] a UK investment manager awarded us a $5.8 billion pounds mandate to provide unit trust pricing and funds accounting.  At State Street Global Advisors we are seeing demand for our passive index strategies as well as our ETS with net new business in the first quarter 2009 of about $37 billion.  State Street Global Advisors has been appointed as a portfolio strategist firm by [GEM] Financial Wealth Management a [GEM] Financial Company to manage a series of six tactical asset allocation portfolios.  The portfolios will be implemented using State Street\u2019s industry leading Spider exchange traded funds.  ", "SGA also won a $160 million fund management mandate from [Fontaine] Funds, an Italian fund that represents about 168,000 workers in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.  The king fish of pension scheme and retirement trust London, added an incremental $40 million pounds to a passive global fixed income portfolio.  In the first quarter we launched four new exchange traded funds and also announced that Spider gold shares surpassed $30 billion in assets making it the second largest ETF by assets in the world.", "While we believe the company remains positioned to achieve its long term goals of annual performance, those being 8% to 12% growth in operating revenue, 10% to 15% growth in operating earnings per share and achieving a 14% to 17% operating churn on common equity, we have taken steps to align our expenses to a weaker market environment so we believe we are well positioned for an economic recovery.  ", "Given the continued unsettled economic environment and more weakness in the first quarter than we expected, we now believe that in 2009 we will achieve nearer the weaker end of the ranges we established at our investor and analyst forum in February.  Operating revenues to decline between 8% and 12% versus 2008, operating earnings per share to decline between 12% and 16% versus 2008 and operating return on equity to be between 14% and 17%.", "Given the more than 40% declines in the S&P 500 and the MSCI EAFE for indexes in the past year, our servicing and management fee revenue performed well in these market conditions.  Servicing fee revenue was down 20% versus the decline in the daily average valuations in the S&P 500 of more than 40% compared to the first quarter of 2008 and compared to the fourth quarter was down 9% versus an 11% decline in average daily equity valuations.  ", "Management fee revenue was down 35% compared to the first quarter of 2008 versus a decline of 40% in average month end equity valuations compared to the previous year\u2019s first quarter and was down 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 where average month end equity valuations were down 15% compared to that quarter.  Although trading services and securities lending in the first quarter of 2009 declined sharply from the fourth quarter of 2008, we gained new business from clients who have left their former providers or have decided to distribute their risk a bit more.", "Until markets begin to repair and resume some degree of normalcy we expect softer revenue to continue particularly in foreign exchange and in securities finance.  What is important to understand is that we have used this crisis as the basis for realigning our infrastructure to operate more efficiently and to be able to accommodate volume without adding significant expense.  The reduction in force was not a flat 8% cut in staff.  It was a structured exercise realigning units, combining positions, transferring work and thinning management levels.  We are well positioned to add more efficiently and more profitably the business we continue to win.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ed.  ", "Edward J. Resch ", "I\u2019m sure our approach to a number of issues is of interest to you so I\u2019ll touch on them before beginning my review of the quarter.  First, our progress on our tangible common equity improvement plan that we announced at our investor and analyst day on February 5th.  Two, our view of FAS B\u2019s announcements regarding FAS 157 and FAS 115 as well as changes to the after tax on unrealized loss in our investment portfolio and asset backed commercial paper conduits.  Three, the potential impact of the newly announced government program called PPIP for Public Private Investment Partnership on the industry and on State Street in particular.  ", "Four, the $84 million loan loss provision which we recorded in the first quarter.  Five, finally the tax accounting associated with restructuring of certain of our international operations and the resulting change in our tax rate in the first quarter and in subsequent quarters of 2009.  ", "First, the progress on our tangible common equity improvement plan; in the first quarter we improved on our pro forma TCE ratio which assumes consolidation of our asset backed commercial paper conduits from 1.19% at December 31, 2008 to 2.22% at March 31, 2009.  29 basis points of this improvement came from our organic capital generation, 15 basis points came from reduction in the size of our balance sheet, especially the size of earning assets, 30 basis points came from price improvement in the investment portfolio and asset backed commercial paper conduits, 14 basis points net came from securities paying down or maturing in the investment portfolio and another seven basis points came from assets paying down or maturing in the asset backed commercial paper conduits.  Lastly, eight basis points came from our dividend reduction.", "We are moderately behind the improvement to our TCE ratio that we projected in our investor and analyst forum presentation primarily due to less improvement in pricing during the first quarter on our portfolio and conduits than was reflected in our plan.  We have revised our plan slightly for the remainder of the year such that by the end of the second quarter we expected our pro forma TCE ratio to be about 3.16%, by the end of the third quarter to be about 3.94% and to be about 4.57% by year end.  The details behind each of these quarterly goals are listed on Slide Five in the capital package which you can find on our website.", "Next, the changes in recording unrealized losses and the impact on State Street; given the timing of the FSPs we elected to evaluate the impact during the second quarter and implemented the FSPs on the effective date which is as of June 30, 2009.  We do not anticipate there will be significant impact on our earnings or our capital as a result of the adoption of the FSPs.  This is because we believe that the FAS B and its announcement on FAS 157 defined the price at which the value which securities must be marked as the exit price which is exactly the requirement of the current rule.  So, in our view nothing changed.", "So, as Ron indicated the unrealized after tax mark up on the investment portfolio improved by about $465 million from approximately $6.3 billion at December 31, 2008 to approximately $5.9 billion at March 31, 2009 and by another $91 million as of April 17th, last Friday.  The unrealized after tax mark-to-market loss in the conduits as of March 31, 2009 was $3.6 billion, about flat with December 31, 2008 and also flat with April 17th, last Friday.  ", "The after tax unrealized loss on the mortgage backed securities increased while it declined a like amount on the asset back securities.  Regarding the PPIP, until further details of the program are known such as the amount of leverage that will be available to investors, we will not be able to predict the impact that the program will have on valuations for different classes of assets.  We remain hopeful that the program will have a positive impact on the valuation of securities in our investment portfolio and conduits.  ", "Right now we are focused on our TCE improvement plan which appears to be working as anticipated.  We noted in our press release this morning we recorded a provision for loan losses of $84 million to provide for the company\u2019s revised estimate of future cash flows expected from certain commercial mortgage loans versus those expected at the time of acquisition of the loans which was in the fourth quarter of last year.  The provision reflects our view of the impact of deteriorating economic conditions on the commercial real estate market.  ", "As has been widely publicized the losses in the commercial real estate market have been significant and the loans we hold have been adversely impacted.  Our expectations of cash flows may change in the future depending on conditions in the commercial real estate markets.  We have received net pay downs of $113 million and now carry these loans with the remaining net book value of $603 million or with a dollar price of about $0.50 on the dollar.  ", "We recorded income tax expense of $138 million for the first quarter 2009 compared with $273 million for the first quarter of 2008 with a decrease due to a lower level of pre-tax earnings and a lower effective tax rate.  The effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2009 is 22.5%,down from 345 in 2008 and is expected to be about 31.5% for the full year 2009.  Consistent with our business  strategy our intent to reinvest the earnings in certain of our non-US subsidiaries overseas allowed us to reduce taxes accrued with respect to 2009 earnings as well as certain taxes occurred in prior periods by $63 million.", "This morning all of my comments will based on our operating basis results as defined in today\u2019s press release.  As Ron mentioned servicing and management fees actually performed well particularly in light of the more than 40% decline on average in market valuations on both the S&P and the EAFE comparing the first quarter of 2009 with the first quarter of 2008.  Clearly securities finance and trading services revenue were weaker especially when compared with the very strong 2008 where both businesses exhibited unusual growth.", "Compared to the first quarter of 2008 securities finance revenue declined 40% and compared to the fourth quarter it declined 45%.  This was due to lower demand offset by slightly improved spreads as well as our conservative investment management including shorter dated assets to increase liquidity in our funds.  At quarter end we had $363 billion of securities on loan up from $347 billion at December 31, 2008.  The balance of securities on loan had improved from March 31, 2009 to about $415 billion as of last Friday, April 17th.", "About 10 additional customers have suspended participation in our program since our last disclosure and about eight have returned to our program.  In addition, we have added several new customers so all in the number of customers in our program is about flat with our disclosure in the fourth quarter.  Average lendable assets for the first quarter of 2009 were $1.7 trillion dollars, down about 40% from $2.8 trillion in the first quarter of 2008 in line with market declines as measured by the S&P 500 or the MSCI EAFE fund.  ", "The duration of the securities finance book is approximately 21 days.  Foreign exchange was weaker due to a slowing cross border investing as well as the result of financial weakness globally.  Trading slowed as well due partly to declines in equity valuations.  During the quarter however, we added new customers that are just beginning to affect revenue.  Our brokerage and other fee revenue was also impacted by losses in the trading account due to the performance of several of the bonds that we acquired in 2008 as well as a decrease in revenue management.", "I should note that we did not manage a proprietary trading desk.  These bonds were one offs that we acquired and we intend to sell as soon as practical.  Now, for the remaining items in the income statement.  The decline in processing and other fees on a sequential quarter basis was primarily due to decreases in product related revenue.  Of particular note, are the lower fees from the asset backed commercial paper program where fees from this program decreased from $28.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 to $23.8 million in the first quarter of 2009 due primarily to higher commercial paper funding costs.", "Net interest revenue on an operating basis declined about 9% in the first quarter of 2008 and about 27% from the fourth quarter of 2008.  The decline from the first quarter of 2008 was primarily due to a decline in customer deposit volume and spreads partially offset by lower interest rates worldwide.  The decline compared to the fourth quarter 2008 was due primarily to the decline in LIBOR rates after year end and narrower spreads in both the investment portfolio and on customer deposits.", "Net interest margin of 203 was down 25 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2008 on an operating basis.  Regarding operating basis expenses, a 26% decrease in first quarter expenses compared to the first quarter of 2008 and a 16% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2008.  I will comment on only two areas, first salaries and benefit expenses declined 31% from the first quarter of 2008 due primarily to a reduction in incentive compensation in the first quarter of 2009 as well as our reduction in force which is now completed.  ", "Salaries and benefits increased 5% compared to the fourth quarter which included a significant reduction in 2008 incentive compensation all of which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008.  This change relative to the fourth quarter was partially offset by the impact of the headcount reduction which we just completed.  ", "Other expenses also declined significantly in the first quarter of 2009 down about 45% from the first quarter of last year and down 64% from the fourth quarter of 2008.  These declines were due primarily to reduced securities processing costs and a reduction in professional fees.  We plan on continuing to be vigilant in managing these expenses.  ", "Now, let me turn to the investment portfolio.  The size of the average investment portfolio at March 31, 2009 has declined about $3 billion since the first quarter of 2008.  As you may recall as of November 7, 2008 we transferred most of our non-agency mortgage backed securities and our commercial mortgage backed securities portfolio to our hold to maturity portfolio so neither has negatively impacted our OCI any further this quarter.  The unrealized losses on each of these reflect the declining housing and commercial real estate valuations.  ", "So, while the unrealized after tax losses on our available for sale and our hold to maturity portfolio improved about $465 million, the improvement in the other comprehensive income was about $665 million.  In our investment portfolio slide presentation we have updated the data through quarter end for you to review.  As of March 31, 2009 our portfolio is 84.3% rated AAA or AA, 73.1% AAA and 11.2% AA rated.  We have had no defaults in these assets and all are current as to principal and interest.", "The duration of the investment portfolio is very low at 1.3 years, the result of our conservative reinvestment plan.  At the same time we are not in the corporate or consumer lending business. The majority of the loans on our balance sheet are customer overdrafts, mostly overnight and are not subject to the types of credit risks associated with commercial or mortgage lending.  ", "In the second half of 2008, our balance sheet has been much larger than normal due to increased liquidity from our customer deposits in the recent market environment and our participation in the Fed\u2019s AMLF facility.  However, in the first quarter customer deposits reverted back to pre Lehman bankruptcy levels and are excess liquidity was $3.7 billion at March 31st down $18.6 billion from year end.  As of March 31, 2009 we left about $30 billion in excess balances with central banks down from $52 billion at the end of 2008.", "Next, a further discussion on the asset backed commercial paper program.  As in the past, you can find a detail quarterly review of the assets displayed by type, country of origin and rating in the asset backed commercial paper slide presentation which you will find on our website.  Also there, you will find the unrealized after tax mark-to-market losses for each asset type and the stresses we applied to them.  In the interest of time I will not discuss them in detail today.  ", "As of March 31, 2009 the conduits held assets of $22.5 billion, down from $23.9 billion on December 31, 2008 due to asset amortization and the strengthening of the US dollar.  65% of the assets are rated AAA, AA or A compared to an average computed by Moody\u2019s of 53 banks of 29% as of December 31, 2008.  None of the assets in our conduits are subprime, nor are there any structured investment vehicles in the conduit program.", "However, during the first quarter of 2009 the conduits continued to experience more downgrades principally affecting about 66 securities in the US, RMBS and HELOC asset classes.  These securities are downgraded in some cases from AAA, to below investment grade.  As of March 31, 2009 the assets continue to have a weighted average maturity of about four years and all securities in the conduits are current as to principal and interest.  The commercial paper market continues to be considerably strained particularly since the end of the third quarter 2008.", "As a result, we utilized the CPFF program to prudently manage our liquidity position.  As of march 31, 2009 our conduit sold an additional $3 billion in commercial paper to the CPFF program for a total of $8.5 billion sold to that program as of March 31, 2009.  Since those assets are sold through a period of 90 days our weighted maturity on the commercial paper extended to 31 days.  As of March 31, 2009 we held $4.7 billion of our commercial paper on our balance sheet.  As of last Friday, April 17th, several large customers have returned to our program and that amount had declined by $3.2 billion to $1.5 billion as markets became more active in early April after quarter end.", "You might ask why the conduits didn\u2019t sell additional paper to the CPFF.  A number of factors determine whether the conduits will utilize the CPFF including our management of liquidity, the cost associated with each funding source as well as the conduits desire to maintain sufficient paper to sell to customers.  Remember, any paper sold to the CPFF must be sold for 90 days.", "Let me now make a few brief remarks on our outlook for net interest margin for 2009.  First of all, 2008 was an anomalish year with unusual strong growth in net interest revenue and A typical net interest margin expansion.  In 2009 we assume that we will continue to delay investments in the investment portfolio in order to meet the goals of our TCE improvement plan.  As of March 31, 2009 we have about $13 billion in assets maturing or paying down in the remaining three quarters of 2009 which are currently priced at a dollar price of about $0.84 on average.", "In the second quarter we expect to continue to limit reinvestments and deposit most of the cash for maturing or paying down assets with central banks.  Later in the year we will proceed cautiously with a conservative reinvestment strategy consistent with the goals of our plan.  We expect interest earning assets to decline relatively modestly over the remainder of 2009.  We continue to expect the net interest margin to be between 170 and 180 basis points on average for the year excluding the impact of the AMLF in 2008 and 2009 and in 2008 also excluding the SILO adjustments to the net interest revenue.", "The Bank of England recently reduced its overnight rate to 50 basis points and we expect it to remain there for the rest of the year the ECB recently cut its overnight rate to 1.25% and we expect it to remain there throughout the rest of the year and finally, we expect the Fed to keep the overnight fed funds rate at 25 basis points for all of 2009.  So, in conclusion, despite a decline in revenue due primarily to the weakness in the equity and fixed interest markets we performed well in the first quarter.  ", "The conduits remain unconsolidated, their assets continue to decline and the unrealized loss has stabilized compared to year end.  Although we have not suffered any losses from the conduit program, that program continues to experience heightened stress due to the downgrades in US RMBS assets and several of the WRAP providers.  We essentially expect to gain little benefit from the FAS 157 announcement this quarter.  However, we did see some improvement at March 31, 2009 and again at April 17th in the unrealized losses of the investment portfolio.", "As we\u2019ve noted previously we expect our net interest margin for 2009 to be between 170 and 180 basis points.  But, we maintained good expense control this quarter and expect that to continue throughout the year.  We made progress on our TCE improvement plan and expected to return to our pro forma TCE ratio to be in line with our 4.25% to 4.75% target range by year end.  ", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Ron.", "Ronald E. Logue ", "So, where do we stand?  While signs of improvement are beginning to appear, we\u2019re still being cautious about the outlook for this year as many uncertainties remain as reflected in our updated outlook.  To address the uncertainties we\u2019re focused on the factors we can control.  The steps we announced in the fourth quarter to reduce expenses have positioned us more favorably for 2009 and for a return to more normalized markets.  ", "At the same time we\u2019ve maintained our capacity to add new business being positioned to benefit from increased business as markets improve and we execute upon our marketing goals.  In addition, in the first quarter we controlled expenses and achieved significant positive operating leverage compared to the first quarter of 2008.  Our servicing and management fee revenue while down from the previous years\u2019 first quarter and record fourth quarter compared favorably to the declines in the S&P 500 and the MSCI EAFE index.  We continue to believe that this period is one in which we have opportunities to build market share.", "Our TCE improvement plan is progressing and has resulted in demonstrable improvement in our ratio.  Prepayments were a little lower than our assumptions but overall we improved our adjusted pro form TCE by 103 basis points and have set a target of over 4.5% for yearend within our long range target for TCE ratio of 4.25% to 4.75%.  While we, like others in our industry expect operating results in 2009 to decline from 2008 in our case from record levels in 2008, I want to emphasize that our core business is strong and that we are well positioned for continued growth in our long term growth ranges upon market recovery.", "We\u2019re beginning to see brightening signs but we have a way to go before government programs and other market forces take full effect and investors step back in to the markets in a significant way.  Until then we\u2019ll continue to be vigilant in calibrating our expenses to align with the market environment while insuring we continue to invest in solutions for our customers who are increasingly looking to us for a broader range of services.", "With that, Ed and I are very happy to take any of your questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from [Brian Born \u2013 Goldman Sachs].", "[Brian Born \u2013 Goldman Sachs]", "I guess first to start and I apologize if you said this earlier, I joined late, but JP Morgan for their TSS business, assuming a flat equity market was actually guiding to the rest of the year run rate revenue being higher than it was in the first quarter.  Given what you\u2019re seeing, do you share that view?", "Ronald E. Logue ", "I can\u2019t compare to what JP Morgan Chase is doing.  If my memory serves me well they have other sources of income in that, things like corporate cash management things, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good comparison.", "[Brian Born \u2013 Goldman Sachs]", "", "I guess maybe asked a little bit differently relative to Bank of New York they were also making comments that some of the deleveraging in the securities lending business was probably behind us at this point, when we look at your securities lending business, do you feel like we\u2019re fully through the deleveraging process and what we\u2019re seeing now, is kind of base line revenue run rate we can forecast out? Or, do you think there\u2019s still some deleveraging in that book to go?", "Ronald E. Logue ", "You saw the volume numbers we gave pretty much flattened out and actually increased from the end of the quarter to recently.  So, from a volume point of view I\u2019d say things have pretty much bottomed out.", "[Brian Born \u2013 Goldman Sachs]", "", "Then lastly if I could, other banks that seem at high level to have somewhat similar levels of risk in securities book are taking pretty big OTTI charges the past couple of quarters, including this one.  When you look out over the rest of the year and kind of embedded within your guidance is there any OTTI assumption included in the guidance?  And, as we think about just kind of reported earnings rather than operating earnings should we expect any meaningful OTTIs as we look out to the rest of the year?", "Edward J. Resch ", "We don\u2019t include any expected OTTI in any of the guidance that we give.  If we have any, we consider it operating as we have in the past, as we did in 2008 and we can\u2019t predict the future obviously but OTTI and the determination we\u2019ve made under the newly issued FSP in the second quarter, OTTI is something we evaluate every quarter.  We go through a process, we identify candidates that are possible candidates and then we do a detailed cash flow analysis on each of the securities and make a determination.  ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "I just wanted to understand more of the expense levers that you have and to make sure I\u2019m reading you correctly, so you\u2019re shrinking the balance sheet, you expect the margin to go down, soft revenues continue, that shouldn\u2019t be surprise.  So, I guess my question is what percent of your expenses are fixed versus variable and how much more in levers do you have now that the investor financial savings are far along?", "Ronald E. Logue ", "I think as Ed said we finished our reduction in force, about 2,200 people but I think importantly as I said we realigned our infrastructure so I think we\u2019re at a point where we have a pretty efficient operating infrastructure.  I don\u2019t anticipate any more reductions there but we seem to have quite a bit of room anyways.  When you think about the significant reduction in revenue and the ability to generate positive operating leverage, I think we have some capacity there for the future.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "With regard to the revenues, the non-US story has been a bright spot and I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s now more a relative negative to the extent that you might be a few months behind the US.  What are you seeing the US versus non-US in terms of revenues?", "Ronald E. Logue ", "Actually, US is picking up.  We\u2019ve got I think as we said on the investor day a lot of discussion in the US in terms of outsourcing the complete operations of US fund managers and hedge managers as well.  That\u2019s continuing and there\u2019s also when you look at that kind of business, US and non-US component to it and I think we\u2019re somewhat uniquely positioned to be able to satisfy those kind of requirements in different jurisdictions.  So, the pipeline continues to be full.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "I guess, is the change in the pipeline better, worse or the same non-US versus US?", "Ronald E. Logue ", "I\u2019d say US has picked up, non-US has always been pretty strong.  The one thing I would say is the decision making takes a lot longer in some of these deals because they\u2019re bigger deals.  So, there\u2019s a lot of activity.  In the first quarter we sold a lot of business but the decision making takes some time so the realization of that revenue is slower right now. ", "Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "Is that slower decision making kind of what you saw back in 2000?  Are we going through that kind of cycle again?", "Ronald E.

And, if so, what do you think drives that or am I just missing something, another offset?", "Edward J.

I think I\u2019ve said in the past we want to make it at least half of what it once was but I think the important metric is to look at the conduits with respect to how much capital we have and I think we have to look at it that way so we\u2019re going to be doing that going forward.  We\u2019re going to be continually look to bring those conduits down.", "With the investment portfolio we don\u2019t make loans.

But, it\u2019s clear to us that we\u2019re going to live in a much more highly regulated deleveraged world and we\u2019re going to have to look at that.  But, that\u2019s the nature of our business.

Generally speaking what I would say is that traditionally what you see in a lot of banks is where you find the risks are in some of the smaller businesses that you may not put a lot of focus on.  We\u2019ve done that.

Morgan", "The next one is probably appropriate for Ed, other expenses what\u2019s a good run rate for that as we look out given that was down so sharply this quarter, how should we think about it for the rest of the year?", "Edward J. Resch ", "Well, I think you should think about it as being up a bit from this quarter where we enjoyed a pretty significant benefit certainly sequentially.  In terms of the full year, I think the exact line you should be thinking about probably in terms of about a 15% or so decline over last year\u2019s full year number.", "Vivek Juneja \u2013 J. P. Morgan", "Lastly, one little thing, with the CP conduits, I noticed that there was a lot more of the CP back on the balance sheet as of March 31st.  Any reason why that\u2019s come back on balance sheet as opposed to tapping the treasury?", "Ronald E. Logue ", "Well, we saw some customers back away a little bit from the asset class, not just necessarily our program but we believe the asset class more broadly in the first quarter.  So we saw some more come on the balance sheet in general.  The decision whether or not to put any CP that we get on our balance sheet in to the CPFF as a function of our own liquidity and the cost associated with putting them in the CPFF for the 90 day term.  In addition, we\u2019ve seen some customers subsequent to the end of the quarter come back in to the asset class and we\u2019ve seen some improvement there to the first couple of weeks of the second quarter.  So, we try to strike a balance between the liquidity needs, cost and the amount of paper we want to have available to sell to customers and that\u2019s the decision we made at the end of the quarter.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from [Greg Ketchum] \u2013 Citigroup.", "[Greg Ketchum] \u2013 Citigroup", "A question on the conduits, you had it looks like about $1.4 billion reduction in size, can you comment on how much of that was cash flow or if there were any conduit assets that were added to the balance sheet?", "Edward J. Resch ", "It was all cash flow and the strengthening of the US dollar.  There were no conduit assets added to the balance sheet.", "[Greg Ketchum] \u2013 Citigroup", "Would it be fair that in the past you\u2019ve mentioned $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion reduction in size expectation for the conduits, does that continue to be a reasonable assumption going forward?", "Ronald E. Logue ", "It\u2019s about a billion a quarter Greg.", "[Greg Ketchum] \u2013 Citigroup", "Then on the credit, you had mentioned the provision that you took was related to the commercial real estate portfolio was I believe was around $800 million?", "Ronald E. Logue ", "That is correct.", "[Greg Ketchum] \u2013 Citigroup", "Is there anything else, I know most of your blending is related to securities activities, is there anything else in the credit portfolio that we should look for or that concerns you going orward?", "Ronald E. Logue ", "No.  I mean the commercial real estate loans are an isolated position that we have that we took on in the fourth quarter of last year.  As we said, as a matter of course lend per say in that marketplace.  So, clearly those loans are things that we\u2019re focused on and looking at but nothing else.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Thomas McCrohan \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Thomas McCrohan \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Could you give us an idea of how much of your earning assets are in highly liquid securities?  BK this morning disclosed that they shifted a lot of their assets and balance sheet to really save securities so I\u2019m just trying to really make comparisons?", "Ronald E. Logue ", "We have been putting a lot of excess liquidity as we noted Tom in to our central bank accounts over the last several quarters and that\u2019s probably been the main structural shift if I can call it that that we\u2019ve made over the last several quarters.  We have not, and that balance was obviously decreased from December to now as I noted in my comments, I think from $52 billion down about $30 billion and that\u2019s a function of customer deposits being put back to work by our customers which we think is a good thing.", "We have not made any conscious structural shift to move any elements of the portfolio in to some safer securities whether it\u2019s treasuries or agency mortgage backed so I would say from our standpoint it\u2019s central bank balances that would be the thing you should focus on to do the comparison you want to try and draw.", "Thomas McCrohan \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Shifting to the outsourcing trends, it sounds like there\u2019s a pickup in activity surrounding outsourcing which is something we haven\u2019t heard about for some time.  It was a big kind of discussion item a few years ago and now it sounds like something is changing in the market.  Maybe you can talk some more about what\u2019s going on in the hedge fund space, I think you pointed to that in particular as being more right for kind of outsourcing activities.", "Ronald E. Logue ", "Tom, in the hedge fund space there is a keener desire for hedge funds to outsource the administrative functions for a number of reasons, obviously the cost pressures to the fact that you have an independent third party doing these things, I think last time we called it the made off effect and that\u2019s pretty intense and that\u2019s continuing and we have a pretty robust platform to do that through our purchase of [inaudible], three or four years ago.  So, that\u2019s enjoying a lot of discussion.", "Then, the traditional outsourcing of investment management back offices it has I think enjoyed a resurgence and when I say that a resurgence in terms of discussion, not necessarily sold deal but with a lot of discussion about the outsourcing of much larger investment management organizations.  People are looking at it, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of closed deals I think as I said in an answer to a previous discussion the sales cycle is a lot longer because these are big decisions.  ", "But, there\u2019s a lot more discussion about doing that for the obvious reasons of trying to turn a fixed cost in to a variable cost, reduce the cost of future expense and reduce the cost of future expense and the allocation of capital is becoming so dear now and investment management companies need to allocate that towards investment performance and distribution.  So, there\u2019s a much greater desire to reduce the percentage of capital directed towards administration and I think over the longer period of time we would become the beneficiary of that.", "Thomas McCrohan \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Do you see anything like on the regulatory side that would kind of accelerate that process?  ", "Ronald E. Logue ", "Oh yes, we see it every day and it\u2019s clear to us it\u2019s going to be a much higher regulatory burden on any type of investment management organization.  We haven\u2019t necessarily seen that translated yet in to rules and regulations which then we\u2019ll translate in to products but it\u2019s beginning to happen. So, you\u2019ll see that in the intermediate and longer term and those that have fairly robust accounting and administrative capabilities I think will take advantage of that but that\u2019s going to come and I think it\u2019s going to come when it does very quickly with a lot of regulatory burden and again another reason why these organizations want to eliminate that expense.  So, if they can avoid that they\u2019re going to.", "Operator", "", "At this time there are no further listener questions.  I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.", "Ronald E. Logue ", "I don\u2019t have a lot of closing remarks, I just want to remind you that I think what we have done is position the company to take advantage of growth opportunities that will emerge.  We\u2019ve built I think a very efficient processing platform given what we\u2019ve done in the last two quarters and we\u2019re going to take advantage of it and I think you\u2019ll see that going forward.  With that I\u2019d just say thank you and we\u2019ll talk again soon.", "Operator", "", "Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today\u2019s State Street Corporation first quarter call webcast.

Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in State Street's 2008 annual report on Form 10-K and it's subsequent filings with the SEC, including its current report on Form 8-K dated May 18, 2009.", "We encourage you to review those filings including the sections on risk factors concerning any forward-looking statements we make today. Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of today, July 21, 2009 and the corporation does not undertake to revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after today.", "I'd also like to remind you that you can find slide presentations regarding the corporation's investment portfolio as well as our second quarter earnings press release which includes reconciliations of non-GAAP measures referred to on this webcast in the investor relations portion of our website as referenced in our press release this morning.", "Ronald Logue", "Good morning everybody. The story of the second quarter can be told in two parts. First, the events that occurred and the decisions we made to put behind us the capital issues that we and the industry faced, and the attendant government involvement in those issues. And second, the hard work being done every day by thousands of State Streeters building their businesses, deepening their relationships with their customers and strengthening their control environments.", "First of the story received all the headlines, but it's the second part of the story that is quietly building the strong post TARP State Street. Let me quickly review the significant capital related milestones of the quarter which have positioned us to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves.", "First, we passed the stress test administered by the Federal Reserve Bank, finishing with one of the highest Tier One capital and Tier One common ratios among the banks tested. Importantly, the stress test assumed consolidation of the conduits and applied what the Fed defined as a more adverse scenario to the assets. Even under the more adverse scenario, we finished with more that twice the required minimum for Tier One capital and Tier One common ratios at the end of the tested scenarios. ", "Given our strong results in passing the stress test, we elected to take action that resulted in consolidation of the conduits onto our balance sheet effective May 15, 2009. Under the new accounting rules, we would have been required to do so like everyone else on January 1, 2010.", "At the same time, we saw an opportunity to raise capital and raised $2.3 billion of common equity, up from our original target of $1.5 billion due to increased investor demand. We also issued $500 million of non-government guaranteed long term senior debt, demonstrating our ability to access the capital markets.", "Actually, we are the only bank of the original nine TARP banks to raise more capital than we were asked to take by the Treasury back in October, 2008. The strong stress test results and a highly successful capital raise completed which resulted in strong capital ratios, even after consolidation of the conduits, we applied to the Treasury to redeem the preferred stock issued to the Treasury in October of 2008.", "We returned the money in June, and in the first week of July, we were the first of the original nine TARP banks to repurchase the related warrant issued to the Treasury when we were asked to take the money in October of 2008. ", "As you know, in February of this year, we announced a tangible common equity improvement plan that we continue to execute against. As of June 30, 2009 our tangible common equity ratio stands at 4.96%, up from 1.9% adjusted for consolidation of the conduits at the end of 2008. And now, above the original year end target of 4.91%, we set for ourselves back in February. ", "As Ed will discuss, we're now targeting the tangible common equity ratio to be about 6.5% by the end of the year, all else being equal.", "So we've come a long way in a very short time, but we cannot be satisfied with where we are. The economy is still fragile. Our markets are still repairing. Unemployment is still high and housing is still a problem.", "The strong capital position we've created must not only be protected, but it must continue to grow this year if we are to be successful in this new emerging environment, and the best way to do that is with consistently strong earnings.", "So let me focus now on the second part of the story. Given what we have all been through and what awaits us on the other side of this crisis, coupled with the record results in 2008, it's hard to define strong earnings on a year over year basis. So what I'm looking for is quarterly progress and I'm defining that quarterly progress as new sales, strong expense control and improving risk management.", "Let's talk about new sales first. As investment managers are faced with weak markets and increasing expenses, they're looking to us to turn some of their fixed cost into variable costs. In the second quarter, we won mandates of $347 billion of assets to be serviced. State Street global advisors added net inflows an increase of $45 billion in the second quarter, especially into passive and ETF strategies.", "We continue to win hedge fund service and mandates like Caxton and Associates which we announced recently. As alternative funds are beginning to move away from prime brokers to independent third party administrators and custodians, we are seeing substantial new business.  Caxton is a hedge fund manager for whom we will provide fund accounting, fund administration and tax services for five months totaling $6 billion in assets.", "As of the second quarter of 2009, we now service $263 billion in hedge fund assets, up from $252 billion in the first quarter. In addition, we have successfully converted from a competitor, 38 John Hancock retail funds with approximately $15 billion in assets.", "Vanguard Investments U.K. awarded us and our joint venture partner, International Financial Data Services, a mandate to provide an extensive range of service solutions for its launch of U.S. domiciled funds.", "State Street has been retained by Goldman Sachs for services in Luxembourg, providing custody, fund administration and other services for $13 billion in assets. Goldman Sachs has been a client of State Street since 1992 in Luxembourg.", "We're also providing custody, accounting and securities lending for the City of Edmonton, Canada of $2.2 billion. Wells Fargo awarded us an additional $170 billion in assets as part of their acquisition of Wachovia. We will provide custody and accounting services for them.", "We've also been appointed by Pensplan, a pension fund service provider in Italy to provide a range of investment services for 100 million Euro. Our private equity servicing business has added 10 new clients in the second quarter and now has $136 billion in assets under administration, up from $101 billion in the second quarter of 2008.", "In addition to winning the service business for the City of Edmonton, SSGA also won an equity mandate. The Arizona Public Safety Retirement System has selected SSGA to run a $2 billion impassive equity. ", "Our securities finance business is stabilizing, growing 11% from the first quarter primarily due to seasonal demand. Since the third quarter of 2008, of the customers who suspended their participation in our program, more than half have returned to the market. Spreads however, have continued to compress from all time highs in 2008.", "It has become increasing important to us as we operate in a low growth environment to continue to build a core competency and expense control, which I think we've been demonstrating during this difficult period. Again this quarter, we achieve positive operating leverage compared to last year's second quarter and also this quarter on a sequential quarter basis, each on an operating basis.", "The investments we made during the higher revenue growth periods over the past several years are paying off in efficiencies without the sacrifice of quality. Our reduction in force is substantially complete. Our realigned fund groups are efficiently installing our new business, expenses are well monitored and we are making additional investments in our IT and risk management infrastructures.", "Notwithstanding our positive achievements in cost control, we have continued to invest in risk management personnel and infrastructure. I believe one of the strengths that has enabled us to navigate through this economic crisis these last two years is our ability to balance our well-known capability to generate revenue with an increased competency to efficiently install it and consistently generate positive operating leverage.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Ed.", "Edward Resch", "Ron has covered many of our significant accomplishments in the second quarter and I'll explain in detail how some of those affect our company.", "First, progress on our tangible common equity improvement plan that we announced at our investor and analyst day on February 5. Second the impact of consolidation of the asset backed commercial paper conduits onto the balance sheet. Third, the improvement in the unrealized losses of our investment portfolio and finally, I will review the results of the second quarter. ", "First the progress on our TC improvement plan. In the second quarter we improved our TC ratio from 2.2% at March 31, 2009 which assumed consolidation of the conduits, to 4.96% at June 30, 2009 ahead of our original target of 3.62% when we introduced the plan in February.", "180 basis points came from the equity issuance in May. 51 basis points of this improvement came from our organic capital generation. 51 basis points also came from price improvement in the investment portfolio. 26 basis points came from securities paying down or maturing the investment portfolio and 8 basis points from our dividend reduction.", "These contributors to improvement were offset partially by a negative 41 basis points due to an increase in the size of the balance sheet following consolidation of the conduits, and another 9 negative 9 basis points following the repayment of the TARP CPP investment.", "By the end of the year we are targeting our TC ratio to be about 6.5% with the effects of the fixed income markets on our investment portfolio and our actual financial results being the primary affective influence this result. The details behind this target displayed on a quarterly basis, are listed on Slide 15 in the slides detailing the investment portfolio which you can find on our website.", "Second, the consolidation of the asset backed commercial paper conduits onto our balance sheet. On May 15, 2009 we consolidated the conduits onto our balance sheet adding $16.1 billion of assets and recognizing a $3.7 billion after tax loss as an extraordinary charge in our income statement.", "Consistent with our estimates of the credit quality of the assets described in the slides, we expect the vast majority of this loss to creep back into earnings over the next eight years, with about two-thirds of it occurring from the first five years.", "In the second quarter the discount accretion on the investment securities recorded in net interest revenue was about $112 million. For the remainder of 2009, we expect about an additional $365 million to accrete into net interest revenue with about $900 million in 2010 and about $800 million in 2011.", "This outlook is based on the same assumptions that we disclosed on May 15 that the CPR is in the range of 8 to 12 and that our credit analysis on the securities is correct.", "Third, the improvement in our realized loss in our investment portfolio, the unrealized after tax loss improved again this quarter due principally to spread compression following an improvement last quarter. it has improved by about $1.6 billion after tax since December 31, 2008 to approximately $4.7 billion unrealized after tax loss at June 30, 2009, an improvement from the $5.9 billion after tax unrealized loss at March 31, 2009.", "Now let me move on to a discussion of our second quarter results. This morning all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today's press release. Comparing the second quarter of 2009 with the first quarter, servicing fee revenue increase 4% and management fee revenue was up 7%.", "Clearly securities, finance and trading services revenue were weaker when compared with the very strong second quarter in 2008 which represented an unusual growth for both businesses. Both improved however, compared to the first quarter. Securities finance revenue increased 11%, primarily due to seasonality and trading was up 27%, particularly due to strengthened brokerage and other.", "Compared to the first quarter, foreign exchange was down slightly due to lower spreads, offset partially by higher volumes, but brokerage and other fee income was up significantly, over 100%. Transition management was particularly strong as pension plans began to re-allocate assets as markets start to repair.", "We had $359 billion of securities on loan on average in the second quarter of 2009 compared with $660 billion in the second quarter of 2008 and down from $399 billion on average in the first quarter of 2009.", "About 16 customers who temporarily suspended participation in our program, have re-entered our program in the second quarter and about five new customers have joined our program. So in addition to the eight customers who returned in the first quarter, we believe participation in our program is firming.", "Our program has also attracted customers from competitors who have confidence in the management and quality of our program. However, with spreads continuing to contract, we expect revenue in the second half of the year to continue to trend down from last year's record.", "Average lendable assets for the second quarter of 2009 were $1.9 trillion, down about 32% from $2.8 trillion in the second quarter of 2008 in line with market declines as measured by the S&P 500 or the EFA. The duration of the securities finance book is approximately 25 days.", "The decline in processing and other fees on a sequential quarter basis was primarily due to decreases in product related revenue. Of particular note, is the effect of the consolidation of the asset backed commercial paper conduits onto the balance sheet. Fees from those products are now reported as net interest revenue.", "Net interest revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined about 11% from the second quarter of 2008 and was up 4% from the first quarter of 2009. The decline from the second quarter of 2008 was primarily due to a customer deposit volumes and spreads, partially offset by the $112 million of discount accretion following the consolidation of the conduits on May 15, as well as wider spreads on the fixed rate securities in the investment portfolio.", "The increase compared to the first quarter of 2009 was due primarily to the discount accretion. Otherwise, net interest revenue would have declined due to narrower spreads in both the investment portfolio and on customer deposits. Net interest margin of 193 basis points was down 10 basis points from the first quarter of 2009 on a fully taxable equivalent basis. Excluding the accretion, the net interest margin would have been 157 basis points which is in line with our prior outlook.", "We recorded $26 million of net securities gains in the quarter. This is comprised of about $90 million in gains and about $64 in OTTI. The OTTI was primarily due to anticipated credit losses in Alt A and R&BS securities. In addition, we added $14 million to the allowance for loan losses in order to provide for expected losses on $580 million of commercial mortgage loans held on our balance sheet that were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2008.", "Regarding operating basis expenses, a 25% decrease in second quarter expenses compared to the second quarter of 2008 and a 5% increase from the first quarter of 2009, I will comment on two areas. First, salaries and benefits declined 34% from the second quarter of 2008 due primarily to a reduction in incentive compensation in the second quarter of 2009 as well as the effect of our reduction in force which was substantially compete by the end of the first quarter. ", "Salaries and benefits decreased 5% compared to the first quarter primarily due to a lower level of accrual for incentive compensation in the second quarter of 2009. We substantially reduced incentive compensation in the first half of 2009 as part of our TC improvement plan. In the second half of 2009, we expect to accrue incentive compensation at a more normal rate of course based on our overall performance.", "Other expenses also declined significantly in the second quarter of 2009, down about 26% from the second quarter of last year, but up 55% from the first quarter of 2009 which was at an unusually low level. This increase was due primarily to the special assessment of $26 million from the FDIC in the second quarter and unusually low securities processing costs in the first quarter. ", "We will continue to be vigilant in managing these expenses. As I indicated last quarter, we expect these expenses on an annual basis to be down about 15% from last year. While they are running lower than this percentage reflects in the first half of the year, we continue to carefully monitor these so as to be sure we align our revenues with our expenses.", "Now let me turn to the investment portfolio. The size of the average investment portfolio in the second quarter has increased about $4 billion since the second quarter of 2008 due primarily to the consolidation of the conduit assets offset partially by run off and sales from the portfolio.", "The unrealized after tax losses in our investment portfolio improved about $1.1 billion from March 31, 2009. In our investment portfolio slide presentation, we have updated the data through quarter end for you to review. As of  June 30, 2009 our portfolio is 79.6% rated, triple or double A. 67.3% triple A and 12.3% double A.", "While overall performance of the investment portfolio continues to be good, during the quarter, we experienced 164 down grades excluding the municipal bonds and seven defaults. Compared to the first quarter the pace of down grades in the second quarter slowed significantly by almost half. Most of the second quarter down grades were in non agency mortgages, corporate bonds and HELOC's. ", "Our excess liquidity returned to more normalized levels and stood at about $15 billion at June 30, down $9 billion from March 31, 2009 as investors began to deploy their cash. As of June 30, 2009, we deposited about $20 billion in excess balances with central banks, down from $52 billion at the end of 2008 and down from $30 billion at March 31, 2009.", "Let me make a few brief comments about our outlook for net interest margin in 2009. First of all, 2008 was an anomalous year with unusually strong growth in net interest revenue and atypical net interest margin expansion. ", "Our assumptions for the rest of 2009 include that we will begin to reinvest those assets that have matured or are paying down given our strong capital ratios in order to better position us for the future. We plan to keep our investments very conservative, investing mostly in triple A asset backed and mortgage backed securities as well as agency securities. ", "As of June 30, 2009 we have about $13 billion in assets which we expect to mature or pay down in the remaining two quarters of 2009 which are currently priced at a dollar price of about $86.00 on average. ", "We expect interest earning assets to decrease between 5% and 10% over the remainder of 2009. This decline is dependent on the continual, gradual improvement in the markets and our ability to carry lower levels of excess liquidity.", "We continue to expect the net interest margin to be between 210 and 220 basis points on average for the year, excluding the impact of the AML in the first quartet of this year. ", "In the first quarter the Bank of England reduced to 50 basis points. We expect it to remain there for the rest of the year. In the second quarter the ECB cut us overnight rates of 100 basis points and we also expect it to remain there for the rest of the year, and we expect the Fed to keep the overnight Fed funds rate at 0 basis points for the rest of the year.", "So in conclusion, markets appear to us to be recovering slowly, and if that trend continues we expect revenues in the second half to strengthen slightly as compared to the first half. Servicing and management fees are recovering somewhat and our pipeline is strong, although decision making is slower than we expected coming into the year.", "Participation in our securities lending program is firming, but we expect securities lending to be negatively impacted by contracting spreads in the second half of the year compared to the second half of 2008.", "Unrealized losses appear to be improving as well, decreasing significantly from year end as I just covered.", "We maintained good expense control this quarter and intend to continue this vigilance throughout the year. We remain committed to achieving positive operating leverage on an annual basis although not necessarily every quarter.", "We are maintaining the full year outlook we announced on May 18. Operating earnings per share we expect to be between $4.25 and $4.50 per share. We expect a decline in operating revenue of approximately 12% compared to operating revenue in 2009 with the record year of 2008, and operating return on equity of approximately 17%.", "Now I'll turn the call back to Ron.", "Ronald Logue", "So in conclusion, where do we stand? While signs of improvement continue to give us more confidence, we are still cautious about the outlook for the economy and the recovery. To address the uncertainties, we're focused on the factors we can control like servicing our customers, managing our expenses and investing for the future.", "In doing so, we are well positioned for a return to more normalized markets. Our pipeline continues to be strong, but as Ed pointed out, decision making is slow as our customers are distracted by the many challenges of the unprecedented economic climate.", "The 7% increase in our total fee revenue in the second quarter from the first quarter represents a trend which we hope to build upon in the second half of 2009. As a result of the capital raise and the conduit consolidation, we believe we have put the capital issues behind us and we can now spend more time talking to you about business trends. We believe we are well positioned for a market recovery, even if that recovery reflects a period of slower growth and to increase our market share, both in the U.S. and abroad. ", "So with that, Ed and I will be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "Your assets under custody were up more than the fees, at least the way I'm looking at it and I'm just wondering why that might be the case. It raises questions are you, is it a timing issue or are you cutting price or am I missing something?", "Ronald Logue", "No, we're not necessarily cutting price. It could just be the conversion process itself as the assets come on and the lag in the recognition of the income as we go through phases of installation. That's probably the only thing I could give you. But there's been no change.", "", "Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "", "The new business as a percentage of assets under custody, it's an impressive list you led off with. Wells Fargo, everybody else, all this business you're getting, but can you give us some context for what that new business represents as a percentage of assets under custody?", "Edward Resch", "I don't know if I could give you the percentage under custody. There are a couple of variables there. First of all, they're coming in bigger chunks, $170 billion is a big piece. I think one of the things we said in the past is we're usually the beneficiary of merger and acquisition activity and the Wells situation is a good example, Wells buying Wachovia where we were servicing most of the Wachovia assets.", "The other thing that's a variable is we win a lot of business but don't necessarily get the assets right away or may not at all, assets under administration. We've been basically just showing you assets under custody. So we've been getting service fee revenue without necessarily getting some of the asset administration as a good example. Investment manger outsourcing is a second example. So there are a couple of variables there that skew those. ", "Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "Personnel expenses were down for the second quarter in a row. Are there any new initiatives and is that sustainable?", "Ronald Logue", "No, there aren't any initiatives. We're still watching very carefully. As you know when we had the reduction in the fourth, we focused on the higher levels and kept the service units basically intact. I think we're just going to continue to watch that very, very closely.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "The core margin just based on what you said is down almost 50 basis points. Are they from 2.03 on a core basis down to 1.57, and that's kind of like a wow sort of change and I guess the difference there is the accretion back to earnings after your charge. How should we think about that margin change and how should we think about the accretion back into earnings? Do you get compensated based on the benefits from that accretion to earnings? Just some context and how we should think about that as investors.", "Ronald Logue", "Let me take the first one and I'll turn it over to Ed as well. There's nothing different in terms of the margin of the basis service business. If anything, those fees and margins have been firming. ", "Edward Resch", "I think part of the reason, excluding the discounted accretion, the fact that we have not aggressively as part of the TC improvement plan is part of the decline excluding the effect of the discount accretion. That's one of the reasons why we want to start in the second half of the year going back at the triple A level and investing some more in order to bolster that margin going forward.", "In terms of the question on are we compensated based on the discount accretion, the answer is no. Our comp plans exclude the discount accretion coming back in this year and in future years.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kenneth Usdin \u2013 Bank of America Securities.", "Kenneth Usdin \u2013 Bank of America Securities", "Just one quick follow up on margins. Are you still expecting a 210 to 220 full year margin? That assumes a meaningful jump from the 193 and I'm just wondering, have you already started putting money back to work so you get that snap back in the second quarter or does it really kind of power up as you get through the year and move into next?", "Ronald Logue", "We've not started yet. We are planning on starting shortly. It will be more back loaded to the fourth quarter just given the timing of things, but there will be some affect in the third quarter as we see it.", "Kenneth Usdin \u2013 Bank of America Securities", "I guess the bigger question on that margin also is just as far as understanding. So that should carry then into next year as a positive because if I'm assuming that you're going to be continuously reinvesting and seeing the benefits of moving a lot of amounts of low spread names and roll off into higher yielding, should we presume also that that should carry into next year as a trend?", "Edward Resch", "Well yes. One of the reasons why we want to start doing it now is we have a lot of the issues that Ron talked about in terms of the capital raise, consolidation etc. behind us. Ratios are real strong. We want to make sure that we capture at least some of the value that we see out there. Spreads have come in a lot on a lot of the securities that we've invested in and we've benefited from that in terms of the mark clearly. We definitely want to start positioning us for the second half of this year and into 2010.", "Kenneth Usdin \u2013 Bank of America Securities", "With regards to the OTTI that you took in the portfolio this quarter and the rest of the book, can you give us an understanding again of how much of the conduit, what are the implied credit losses that you have built into your conduit re-accretion? $900 million  this year and $800 million the following year, what proportion of the recapture is that of the total write down?", "Edward Resch", "Let's start with the total charge which was about $6.1 billion pre tax, and based on our credit analysis, we would expect all but let's say $500 million of that to come back in over time. I'm just using a round number for illustration. But that's in the range that we actually expect.", "So we would make a judgment that we have $500 million of credit losses coming our way in the future which we will not accrete back, so that leaves $5.6 billion pre tax to come back in over the next eight years as I said, with the majority of it being front loaded into the remainder of this year and 2010 and 2011.", "So those are the high level assumptions. Relative to OTTI, there were no conduit related assets or former conduit related assets that were part of the OTTI this quarter. They were all the legacy portfolio before the consolidation of conduits.", "Kenneth Usdin \u2013 Bank of America Securities", "Can you give us the same kind of math from the rest of the portfolios? Since its $500 million on a $6.1 billion number, can you give us the relative similarity on the investment portfolio.", "", "Edward Resch", "There isn't similarity in terms of us having to make a judgment about expected credit losses relative to the portfolio. We do that every quarter and that's the basis for OTTI. We do still firmly believe, and this was validated by the results of the stress test, that the mark on the portfolio is reflective of very significant still ill liquidity and not fundamental economic weakness, not fundamental credit losses underlying those securities in the vast majority.", "So I don't have an analogous number for you on the portfolio as I just described for the conduits.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I'm sorry if I missed it but in terms of the EPS guidance, historically you've given guidance. Where do we stand relative to that historical guidance and if you are not actually giving guidance, any rational on the decision to why not to do so anymore?", "Edward Resch", "I gave guidance, and it's basically the same as we gave on I think it was May. 18. No change to the previously announced guidance.", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And the impact of the Wells notice you announced during the quarter?", "Ronald Logue", "I've nothing to say about that. Don't know any impact.", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Your TC improvement plan, you're obviously tracking ahead of schedule here. Should we still expect in the February schedule you gave 100 to 150 basis points of back half TC improvement or is it more in line with the core earnings generation, more like 35 a quarter or 70 over the back half of the year?", "Ronald Logue", "We're targeting 6.5% by the end of the year and we're going to continue to achieve against that plan. The TC improvement plan is laid out quarter by quarter in the investment portfolio deck, Slide 15 gives you the quarterly breakdown.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS.", "Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS", "If you look at the consolidated report, you see the breakdown of the $90 million, the $167 million OTTI and the $103 million losses not related to credit. Can you just give a little detail on, you just mentioned on Ken's question that the $167 million was OTTI but not related to the conduit. The consolidated assets is from the legacy securities portfolio. Can you give a little bit more color on where the gains were taken, where the OTTI, what kind of assets produced the OTTI $167 million and then a little bit more detail on the $103 million because that's the piece I'm not quite sure on.", "Ronald Logue", "Can I just clarify before I start answering. What page are you referring to?", "Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS", "The first page of the trends, quarterly financial trends. You have gains and losses related to investment securities. You've got the $90 million, the $167 million, the $103 million.", "Ronald Logue", "Let me tell you where we took gains which is the $90 million or so and the impairments that we took. First of all, in terms of the gains we saw in the portfolio, a fair amount of agency mortgage backed securities get what we call pretty rich, and that's the entire asset class that we generated the gains from.", "A lot of the securities saw significant price appreciation and significantly over par, some of them in the range of 105 or so, and we took our gains there based on what we thought was an appropriate timing given the valuations that we saw in the market.", "The net of the $167 million and the $103 million and the $64 million which is what we took net, that is in two asset classes. It is Altay and non agency mortgage backed securities. The securities that have been on a watch list for awhile, we do as you know, a stress test every quarter on those securities and we saw that as time has passed, the year in which the securities first broke under the stress had moved in by a couple of years.", "And again, this is measured over a couple quarters of time and based on that, we made the judgment that it was appropriate to impair these securities. It was a relatively small amount. I think it was in the range of five to 10 securities that we actually impaired, but it was based on our stress analysis and we did it under the new FAS 115 rule that came into effect this quarter.", "Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS", "Is the separation in this display, the 167 million, the 103 million, just semantics? In other words, when we think of securities that's impaired, it just one less period and the net is the $164 million. You're just breaking out credit versus non credit?", "Ronald Logue", "No. This is just a presentation. Its 167 million is the old rule for the OTTI. 103 is the non credit element which is based on the new rule, the new 115. And 64 is the present value of the loss that we take. Remember the old rule required us if we decided to impair securities to bring it all the way down from book to market. The new rule requires us to take it from book down to just the credit loss, not all the way down to market if that happens to be lower. So this is just presentation.", "Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS", "Can we talk about how often is the test and what would produce a change to the accretion. I know that you had lower amount of down grades as you mentioned, but the general portfolio, the credit quality still continues to move in that wrong direction. What produces a change in the accretion formula and is it all back loaded? In other words, how does the trigger work such that if down grades and OTTI are produced such that the $365 million, $900 million and $800 million remaining guidance on the accretion get impacted?", "Ronald Logue", "The fundamental thing that could change our expectation there is that we have a change in view of credit. So using the numbers I used before when I answered Ken's question, if the $500 million number became something other than $500 million, that would obviously affect the amount left to accrete and we have to make that judgment on the remaining former conduit securities every quarter, as to what our credit view is.", "So that's something that could change the accretion.", "Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS", "I just want to make sure. It's viewed as a total portfolio and accretion works from there as opposed to if certain securities start actually realizing losses earlier, it actually flows through OTTI.", "Ronald Logue", "No, it's viewed on a security by security basis. The credit view is one thing that could change our future accretion. The other thing that could significantly change our future accretion is the level of prepayments that actually occur. We have an assumption built into our expectation for the rest of this year and the numbers for next year and the year after that assume prepays. ", "So if those prepayments accelerate from what we're assuming, accretion will be higher. If they decelerate, accretion will be lower in future period. So credit assumptions and speed of prepayments are the two main drivers of that accretion coming back in.", "Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS", "The lower tax rate, you gave some guidance in the text of your release. What's producing the lower tax rate for the rest of this year, because it's pretty low. Is it the loss taken on the conduit consolidation?", "Edward Resch", "That's part of it but the driver certainly this quarter and for the full  year is that we're seeing more non foreign income than U.S. which is driving it a bit lower. And then we're seeing the affect in this quarter, and we'll see a bit of an affect in the next two quarters of the election we made in the first quarter under APB23 to permanently reinvest overseas earnings. So those are the two things that are driving the tax rate.", "Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS", "When I listened to the discussion on the first couple of question on net interest margin, I'm sitting here thinking it's a little d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and the way you and others have gotten into the situation we're in with having these huge unrealized losses and having the capital tested was reaching for yield a little bit. I feel like there's been lots of lessons learned, but I can't help but think, is it a bit too early to start reaching for yield because the guidance on the second half implied, has implicitly a pretty big boost in the second half.", "Ronald Logue", "The question as to when we started reinvesting is one that we've talked a lot about. We made a judgment to start soon so basically for the second half of this year. We're of a view that the securities that we have invested in and we expect to in the future invest in, are going to be high quality securities that we will subject to our normal credit processes and surveillance processes and everything that we've talked about.", "We don't think we're acting inappropriately in reaching for yield too early. We think there's a judgment to be made obviously between staying out and continuing to basically invest in cash versus going back in and investing and starting to reinvest in order to position us for the second half of this year and into next year.", "Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS", "I hear you and to be fair, you did say you reinvest in triple A mortgage agency. What type of duration securities are we talking so I can keep it in perspective.", "Ronald Logue", "Two to three year duration.", "Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS", "So five year type maturities.", "Ronald Logue", "Yes. We're not going out there.", "Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS", "You're going to take the gap, the asset liability gap, the rates you get?", "Ronald Logue", "Right now the gap is probably the narrowest it's ever been. It's about 10 basis points overall, so we feel like we can widen it out a little bit notwithstanding the fact that rates are probably at some point going to go up and not down further.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Could we talk a little bit about just the size of the balance sheet, just interested in understanding on the deposit side where you feel deposits are relative to stabilized to excess deposits over the last couple of quarters? How do you feel that's trending? Where do you think it goes to from here? Do you feel you still have excess deposits that are not and then talk a little bit about the assets?", "Ronald Logue", "The level of deposits to a great extent are consistent with the level of new business. With the new business, comes the deposits and it's either DDA here in the U.S. or transaction accounts outside the U.S. My sense is deposits will continue to, the volume of deposits will continue to increase as we bring on new business and that's been proven out in the past and I would expect that's going to continue. I see no change there.", "Edward Resch", "I think we're seeing customers put money back to work which we think overall is a positive thing. The markets are getting better. I hope our comments have reflected that kind of overall. We're seeing some movement in deposits back to what we call more normalized levels as that phenomenon occurs, but it's hard to say when normal will be reached, whatever that is.", "But as Ron said, as we've seen in the past, as the business grows, especially non U.S. the deposits go with that. So we would expect to see that occur over the next couple of years, but right now I'd say we're coming back into more normalized deposit levels. I think if you just look at the amount of cash that we have on deposit from year end to June 30, you see a decline from roughly $50 billion down to $20 billion over that period of time, and that's a reflection of things getting back to normal and deposit levels getting back to more normal levels.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "A question on the capital, you indicated TC going to 6.5% based on your current forecast by year end. How do you think about what your new normal is coming out of this environment?", "Edward Resch", "We haven't defined what a new normal is at this point. We continue to be as we said, cautious. We continue to want to grow capital. We're staying with at this point our previous guidelines in terms of 4.25% to 4.75% on the TC ratio. We have to revisit that to define what a new normal is. ", "But at this point we're comfortable with the TC growing from where it is now to where we project it to be at year end and we'll assess as we get farther into the year and into 2010.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Obviously there's the other side of that impact is ROE and in anticipating ROE at what point do you start to think about either dividends or buy backs? Can you give us some color as to how you're thinking through capital management and what you would use first and why?", "Ronald Logue", "I think one of the first things we want to take a look at is to see if there are opportunities to put some of that capital to work in terms of accretive deals. Our sense is that we're going to begin to see some of those things and I think there are going to be some attractive opportunities, the first place I would go to utilize some of this capital, because I think there's going to be an opportunity.", "I think we're going to be able to execute because I think one of our core competencies is to integrate books of business. I think you're going to see some of that probably starting outside the United States before it starts inside the United States. So that's the first place we'd go.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "And if those are not available?", "Ronald Logue", "Obviously what we'll take a look at instead, is take a look at the dividend some time in the future and I think it's just going to depend on the situation at the time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Howard Chen \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Howard Chen \u2013 Credit Suisse", "In your prepared remarks you spoke about the firming of the transition management revenues driving the brokerage fees this quarter. Can you just remind me how lumpy or not the revenues typically are in that business? I'm just trying to gauge how to think about the resilience of those stronger brokerage fees.", "Ronald Logue", "I think what we've seen is as Ed said, money being back to work by the pension funds. I think we're going to continue to see that over time. I don't know if you have a comment about lumpiness Ed.", "Edward Resch", "It is a bit episodic. If you look at our volumes as in transition management, from the first quarter up to the second quarter they tripled resulting in the doubling of the results and non U.S. went up about 50%. But to put that in some context, the second quarter this year was about flat with the second quarter of last year in terms of volume. So it can move around. It's dependent on what customers are thinking about in terms of moving from asset manager to another.", "Howard Chen \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Just a follow up on other fee revenue items within the FX and sec lending businesses. In the past you've been really helpful in providing color on the movement and the balance of volumes and spreads. I was hoping you could do the same again this quarter with those two businesses.", "Edward Resch", "Sec lending for the second quarter we had assets on loan of about $400 billion to $415 billion. That compares to the second quarter of a year ago $670 billion. The spread was actually flat driven by the international equities program and the split was just down slightly from last year to this year.", "If you want to look at sequential quarter, actually volume was up from about $400 billion to the $415 billion as I mentions since spread was up about 5 basis points with those fees actually being about flat. So t hose are high level metrics on securities finance.", "In terms of FX total revenue was just about flat as we noted from Q1 to Q2 in the $190 million range. Volume was up about 9% and the customer weighted volatility was actually down from about 1.82% to 1.42% from Q1 to Q2. Those are the high level metrics on FX.", "Howard Chen \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Ron, in your prepared remarks you alluded to expense containment becoming increasing more important for the firm's strategy. I was curious, are the work force reductions announced in December now fully realized and second, can you speak to some of the other potential levels that you have to maintain that operating leverage that you and Ed were speaking about?", "Ronald Logue", "", "What we announced in January is complete. I've got 2,000 people less right now than we had. We do have some other levers. Obviously IT is one. I think in the past we've talked about modulating that somewhere between 21%, 22% and 25% of our operating expense, and we do do that. The good news I think is that in the past, we have significantly invested in IT and we're in pretty good shape in terms of capacity and in terms of product depth.", "So there's not a whole lot of new significant IT expense so we're able to take a little bit. Obviously we've done a good job in moving work around and realigning the way we do things. When we did the reduction force it wasn't just 2,000 people across the board. It was a realignment of work which is also bringing efficiencies to us and I would expect some of that to continue.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Steven Wharton \u2013 J.P. Morgan]", "[Steven Wharton \u2013 J.P. Morgan]", "Betsy actually asked my question, but maybe I'll just follow up a little bit. One of the things I'm curious about is you mentioned acquisitions, accretive acquisitions and it seems like you've de-emphasized active asset management. I know you had taken some actions there and yet I know there are a number of properties on the market or rumored to be on the market. Is that an area that you're thinking that would interest you from an acquisition standpoint or are you thinking more on the custody side?", "Ronald Logue", "I was speaking more on the servicing side because I think there's going to be some opportunities there as well. Obviously there are some other types of opportunities but there's been some inflows in passive ETS so that seems to be working pretty well, but I was speaking mostly on the servicing side.", "[Steven Wharton \u2013 J.P. Morgan]", "6.5% tangible common is pretty high especially in light of the TC risk rated asset and Tier One common ratio that you already have and we're not even at the year end. I don't want to get ahead of ourselves but if you had to prioritize would your preference be share buy back or a dividend increase or vice versa?", "Ronald Logue", "My preference would be accretive acquisitions. I think we have to take a look at the dividend obviously and we probably will sometime next year, and then we'll take a look at share buy backs. But I think there are a lot of lessons that have been learned here and I think we can't lose sight of those lessons. ", "The preservation of capital is something that's also very important. I don't know what the new normal is going to be or even what the new metric is going to be. I think we have to be a little careful and not be premature in doing things. So there's a balance here I think that will evolve over two, three quarters, and I think we'll get to that point. But we have to attain that balance and not be too premature.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC.", "Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC", "You talked about the customers coming back into the securities lending program. I think you mentioned in the first half you had about 24 of them come back. How many did you lose and what's the potential for more customers coming back in the second half of this year?", "Edward Resch", "The number that we talked about as having temporarily we hope, departed from the program was in the fourth quarter where we said about 10% of our customers in securities lending which is about 45 so based on the numbers that you just quoted, 24 is about half of them. We obviously don't know when and if the remaining customers are going to come back in or begin participating in the program.", "They clearly have not left State Street as customers. They've just withdrawn from the securities lending program we hope temporarily. So there's another 24 or 25 of those customers that went on the sidelines in the fourth quarter that could potentially come back in.", "Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC", "Can you touch on the commercial mortgage backed securities that you have from the Lehman collateral. What's the status of that? I know you've marked it down. How comfortable are you with the mark and when do you think you could sell it or get rid of it?", "Edward Resch", "We have about $580 million on the books. It's marked at less than a 15 cent dollar price at this point. We're trying to manage it to realize the appropriate value. Clearly if we had an opportunity to sell it at what we thought was in a reasonable price, we would clearly do so. It's not a core competency or business or asset class that we particularly know or like, but we have it.", "It's something that we evaluate every quarter. It's obviously in a sector that's experiencing some stress. If you look at what we've done the last two quarters, we've taken just about $100 million, $84 million last quarter, $14 this quarter against those loans to write them down based on our evaluation of expected cash flows. We'll do it every quarter and it's something that we're monitoring very closely.", "Ronald Logue", "Thank you very much.

We continue to navigate successfully through these slowly improving times seeking to build our base revenue represented by servicing fee and management fee revenue while at the same time focusing heavily on expense control.", "The solid improvement in servicing and management fees being generated here is being somewhat obscured by the compressed spreads affecting both securities finance and net interest revenue and the volatility being experienced in trading services, all of which is being compared to the outsize results in 2008.", "Now as I stressed last quarter what I'm looking for is sustainable progress over time. Growth in total revenue against continued expense control. Let's talk about revenue growth first.", "As markets improve and as we add a new business our third quarter servicing and management revenue increased compared to the second quarter. In the third quarter we added $168 billion in assets to be serviced and we had $65 billion in net new assets at State Street Global Advisors particularly into passive and ETF strategies.", "As the customers of hedge fund managers require an independent third party administrator we have seen solid growth in those assets. We added 29 customers year to date in that business, for which we will provide hedge fund servicing. This quarter as of September 30, 2009 our assets have grown 5% offering 263 billion as of June 30, 2009 to 276 billion.", "In addition our private equity servicing business has added five new clients during the third quarter. And as of September 30, 2009, has $145 billion in assets under administration, up from $136 billion as of June 30th 2009.", "Some of our investment servicing wins in the third quarter included building on an existing relationship. Calamos investments, appointed us to provide custody, fund administration and securities lending services to it\u2019s several collective fund structures, including open and closed and mutual funds, double- end (inaudible) and private funds worth approximately $24 billion in assets.", "Morgan Stanley Adviser Fund has appointed State Street to provide fund administration, including financial reporting and securities lending compliance for $36 billion held in its 89 mutual funds.", "ING Bank of Canada recently chose State Street to provide custody and valuations for their corporate treasury assets of $6.9 billion Canadian as well as additional assets from ING Direct Asset Management.", "Australian fund manager QIC, appointed us to provide a full range of investment services for their new Irish Domiciled Qualified Investment Fund. State Street will provide custody, fund administration and performance and analytic serviced for the fund.", "State Street Global Advisors also added significant new clients during the quarter including Neuberger and Berman Group, which selected SSGA to provide taxable money market funds to Neuberger Berman fund share holders and clients.", "AP Fonden- 1 Stockholm selected SSGA to manage $140 million in passive alternative investments. The London Borough of Harrow has named State Street Global Advisors to manage $163 million in UK passive equity mandate.", "Also this quarter, we added five new customers in our securities finance business and the participation in the program has stabilized. Despite these positive wins, our revenue from our securities finance business declined from the second quarter primarily due to significant compression in spreads.", "The level of revenue from trading services last year was primarily driven by significant volatility in the highly disrupted markets. Normalizing markets coupled with some seasonal slowness in the third quarter of this year negatively impacted trading revenue in the third quarter.", "Net interest income increased 23% from the second quarter due primarily to discount accretion attributable to the consolidation of the conduits in the second quarter. Our net interest margin excluding discount accretion is lower but has stabilized helped by our reinvestment program which we began this quarter.", "In early July, we began investing in highly rated securities mostly AAA rated agency mortgage backed securities and Ed will provide more detail shortly.", "Spreads on fixed income securities have compressed significantly improving State Street's mark to market valuations in our investment portfolio. As liquidity return to the market, the unrealized losses are more than cut in half from the December level from $6.33 billion to $2.98 billion.", "As we have consistently stated we believe the vast majority of our assets will mature at par. It has also become increasingly important to us as we operate in a lower growth environment to extend our core competency in expense control, which I think we\u2019ve been demonstrating during this difficult period.", "Again this quarter, we achieved positive operating leverage compared to last years third quarter. The investments we made during past high revenue growth periods are paying off in efficiencies without the sacrifice of quality. You will notice that other than the sequential quarter increase in salaries and benefits, due to accruing performance based incentive compensation beginning this quarter, compared to the second quarter, all other expense lines remain flat.", "Growth in the second half of 2009, particularly in securities finance and trading revenue, does not appear to be quite as strong as we originally forecast on May 18, 2009 and confirmed on July 21. As a result, we are updating our outlook for operating revenue in 2009. We now expect our operating revenue to decline about 16% from the record level of 2008 and our operating earnings per share for the year to be between $4.13 and $4.17.", "We expect operating return on equity to be within our long- term outlook of 14% to 17%. I also remind you that we are using approximately 475 million shares as the average shares available to support the calculation of fully diluted earnings per share on an annual basis compared to 416 million shares on average in 2008.", "We are still working on our budget for 2010 and we will provide our outlook for 2010 at our meeting of investors and analysts next year. Now I will turn the call over to Ed.", "Edward Resch", "Thank you Ron. Good morning everybody. This morning I will review three areas. First the results of the third quarter, second the improvement in the unrealized losses as well as the overall performance of our investment portfolio and finally a review of our capital ratios and the execution of our tangible common equity improvement plan. ", "First the results of the third quarter. This morning all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today's press release. Comparing the third quarter of 2009 with the second quarter, servicing fee revenue increased 5% and management fee revenue was up 13%, primarily due to market increases as well as new business wins. Both items were down compared to the third quarter of 2008 due primarily to market declines. ", "Clearly revenue from securities, finance and trading services was weaker when compared to either the very strong third quarter in 2008 or with the second quarter of 2009 while Foreign exchange revenue declined on both year- over- year in a sequential quarter basis, brokerage and other revenue which is reported as part of trading services was up 11% compared to the third quarter of 2008 due primarily to strength in electronic trading.", "We had $396 billion of securities on loan on average in the third quarter of 2009 compared with $617 billion in the third quarter of 2008 and down from $418 billion on average for the second quarter of this year.", "With spreads continuing to contract and assuming flat volume we expect securities finance revenue in the fourth quarter to continue to trend down from this year's third quarter.", "Average lendable assets for the third quarter of 2009 were about $2.1 trillion, up 12% from $1.9 trillion in the second quarter of 2009, but down about 23% from $2.7 trillion in the third quarter of 2008, in line with market declines as measured by S&P 500 or the MSCI EFA.", "The duration of the securities finance book is approximately 29 days. Compared to the third quarter of 2008, processing and other fee revenue declined 29% due primarily to the effect of the consolidation of the conduits onto the balance sheet. ", "Net interest revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased about 18% from the third quarter of 2008 due primarily to the impact of the discount accretion. ", "", "Net interest driven on a fully taxable equivalent basis was up 23% from the second quarter of 2009 also due to the impact of discount accretion. Net interest revenue excluding discount accretion would have declined due to narrower spreads both in the investment portfolio and on customer deposits.", "Net interest margin of 247 basis points, was up 54 basis point from the second quarter of 2009 on a fully taxable equivalent basis. Excluding discount accretion, the net interest margin would have been 156 basis points which, based on our fourth quarter expectation brings us to the lower end of our prior outlook for the average net interest margin of 170 to 180 basis points for the year.", "We recorded $42 million of net securities gains and other than temporary impairment adjustments, about $141 million in gains and about $99 million in OTTI. The OTTI was primarily due to increases in expected future credit losses in US non- agency mortgage backed securities.", "Regarding operating basis expenses; third quarter expenses declined 13% compared to the third quarter of 2008 and increased 9% from the second quarter of 2009. As you may recall we eliminated performance based incentive compensation in the first half of 2009 to support our tangible common equity improvement plan.", "Note that compared to the second quarter of 2009 salaries and benefits expenses increased 18% primarily due to the $100 million accrual of performance based incentive compensation. However all other expenses line analysis remained essentially flat.", "Salaries and benefits declined 20% in the third quarter of 2008 due primarily to the effect of our reduction in force, which was substantially completed in the first quarter of 2009 as well as a lower level of incentive compensation", "Other expenses declined in third quarter of 2009, down about 8% from the third quarter of last year and were flat compared with the second quarter of 2009.", "We will continue to be vigilant in managing our expenses. I indicated last quarter that we expect other expense on an annual basis to be down about 15% from last year. However given the slow and fragile economic recovery and a revised revenue outlook for 2009, we continue to remain discipline regarding any discretionary items and now expect other expenses to be down closer to 25 to 30% compared to other expenses in 2008.", "Now let me turn to the investment portfolio. The average size of the investment portfolio in the third quarter has increased about $13 billion since the third quarter of 2008 excluding about $4.5 billion in assets held on deposit as of September 30th 2008 as a result of State Street's role as a intermediary in the Federal Reserve Bank's asset backed commercial paper money market liquidity facility, the AMLF.", "This increase is due primarily to the consolidations of conduit assets as well as the execution of the investment strategy we announced last quarter offset partially by maturities and sales from the investment portfolio.", "During the third quarter we invested about $14 billion in highly rated securities at an average price of 101.5 and an average yield of about 3.33% and a duration of about 2.25 years.", "This $14 billion are primarily comprised of $11 billion in agency mortgage backed securities, the vast majority of which are rated AAA and $2.4 billion in asset- backed securities, the vast majority of which are also rated AAA.", "The aggregate unrealized after tax losses in our available for sale and held- to- maturity portfolios were $2.98 billion, an improvement of about $1.77 billion from June 30th 2009 and up $3.34 billion or 53% from December 31, 2008. In our investment portfolio slide presentation we have updated the data through quarter end for you to review. As of September 30, 2009, our portfolio was 80.4% rated AAA or AA compared with 79.6% as of June 30, 2009.", "Our aggregate credit distribution as of September 30, 2009 remains relatively unchanged from June 30, 2009 despite about $8.2 billion in downgrades. The primary reasons for this are our new purchases, which are primarily AAA rated and our conservative reporting of downgrades.", "We report our credit distribution based on the lower of Moody\u2019s or SNP. However we report all downgrades to you from either agency each quarter, even if security was previously downgraded by another agency. Approximately $3 billion of the $8 billion was previously reported as downgraded. Thus the new downgrades for the third quarter total about $5 billion.", "There was also a positive impact on credit distribution due to our new purchases, which are primarily AAA- rated and due to the prepayment of securities rated below AAA. Most of these downgrades occurred in non- agency mortgages and most of these downgrades were due to rising foreclosures due to higher unemployment rates and the end of the moratorium on foreclosures at many banks.", "However, we are seeing positive signs of stabilization in the U.S residential market from the Case Schiller index as well as the index of leading economic indicators. The former conduit assets now consolidated into the investment portfolio continue to improve in price during the quarter as general capital market conditions improve. Despite this improvement, projected credit fundamentals for certain securities have deteriorated in our view.", "Compared to our previous estimate of $600 million, we now expect about $850 million or about 14% of the $6.1 billion pre tax charge we took in the second quarter upon consolidation of the conduits to not accrete back into net interest revenue over the remaining lives of the conduits assets.", "The amount accreted back into net interest revenue in the third quarter was $279 million making a total of $391 million through September 30th 2009. We now expect about $600 million of discount accretion in 2009 up from our earlier estimate primarily due to faster pre payments on certain securities.", "We still expect about $900 million to accrete back into net interest revenue in 2010, but we are adjusting our outlook for discount accretion in 2011 to about $700 million or $100 million lower than what we estimated at the time of consolidation of the conduits.", "We continue to expect about 2/3rd of the total discount accretion to occur in the first five years after consolidation. As you are undoubtedly aware a great many assumptions going to such a calculation, including pre- payments speeds and credit assumptions across various asset classes.", "Let me make a few brief remarks on our outlook for net interest margin for 2009. First of all 2008 was as you know was an anomalous year with unusually strong growth of net interest revenue and atypical net interest margin expansion. Our assumptions for net interest margin for the rest of 2009 are that we continue to execute on our second half investment plan.", "We reinvest fourth quarter maturing assets of approximately $3 billion in highly rated agency mortgage backed securities and AAA rated asset- backed securities. We intend to maintain the duration of the investment portfolio and GAAP on our balance sheet approximately in line with where it is as of September 30th 2009.", "At that time the duration stood at 1.07 years and the GAAP on the balance sheet was 0.15 years. We expect interest earnings assets to decrease between 3% and 4% during the fourth quarter of 2009 and this decline is dependent on the continued gradual improvement in the capital markets and our view as to the prudence of carrying lower levels of excess liquidity. We continue to expect the net interest margin to be between 210 and 220 basis points including discount accretion, on average for the year, excluding the impact of the AMLF in th4 first quarter of this year.", "From a rate stand point we expect the Bank of England to remain at 50 basis points for the rest of the year, the ECB to remain at 100 basis points for the rest of the year and the Fed to keep over night Fed funds at about 25 basis points.", "Lastly, I\u2019ll briefly update our capital ratios and the progress against our TCE improvement plan. ", "In the third quarter our capital ratios continued to improve such that, as of September 30th 2009, compared to June 30th 2009, our tier one leverage ratio stood at 8.16%, up from 7.26%. Out tier one capital ratio stood at 15.55%, up from 14.53% and our tier one common ratio stood at 13.58%, up from 12.57%.", "In the third quarter we improved our TCE ratio from 4.96% at June 30th 2009 to 5.73% at September 30th 2009, ahead of our original target of 4.29% when we introduced the plan in February. The majority of this improvement came from price improvement in the investment portfolio and organic capital generation offset partially by a larger balance sheet.", "At the end of the year we are targeting our TCE ratio to be about 6.24 % with the effects of the fixed income markets on our investment portfolio and our actual financial results being the primary factors that could influence this result.", "The details behind this target, displayed on a quarterly basis are listed on slide 15 of the slides detailing the investment portfolio which you can find on our website.", "In summary, for the fourth quarter, we expect servicing and management fees will continue to modestly improve from third quarter levels, assuming equity and fixed income markets continue to be stable. That participation of our securities finance program will continue to firm but the reduce spreads will continue to restrain Securities finance revenue.", "We expect net interest margin to be near the lower end of the 170 to 180 basis point range in 2009 excluding discount accretion and including discount accretion we expect net interest margin to be near the higher end of the 210 to 220 basis point range.", "We expect to continue to maintain good expense control remaining committed to achieving positive operating leverage on annual basis and lastly we will continue to be cautious and grow our capital.", "Now I will turn the call back to Ron.", "Ronald Louge", "", "So, while markets are beginning to normalize we are still seeing pockets of uncertainty especially in a consumer segment in which improvement is dependant on lower unemployment rates and as a result we are going to continue to be cautious. ", "On the plus side our pipeline continues to be strong although decision making continues to be slow as our customers are distracted by the many challenges of the unprecedented economic climate.", "The sequential quarterly increases we have achieved in servicing the management fees in 2009 are building some momentum but the deep decline in spreads in the securities lending business are restraining growth.", "The actions we took earlier this year resulted in our strong capital position and the momentum in our core business plus expense control; continue to position us well for a recovery.", "Now Ed and I are happy to take your questions.", "Question \u2013 and - Answer Session ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Glenn Schorr - UBS.", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "So we had some acceleration of some of the accretion this quarter on as you mentioned some of the prepayments picking up. So 2009 accelerates, 2010 stays the same, but 2011 moves forward. How come that\u2019s not shared across the years? I don\u2019t know if I am harping on something irrelevant, but it just seems weird to me that 2010 would stay the same, that some of that wouldn\u2019t be pulled forward.", "Edward Resch", "Glen, it depends on our security specific analysis and we go through that for the quarterly determination, it really depends on what we see, security by security for those securities that we are targeting for future discount accretion. So, it's not a linear type of thing at all. ", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "Okay. I don\u2019t know if I missed this in the prepared remarks, but what drove the processing fees jump up, I guess it's 45 from 17 last quarter?", "Edward Resch", "Nothing in particular. Just a combination of a lot of relatively immaterial items that resulted in the $28 million sequential quarter gain. So there is nothing specific to point to there.", "Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS", "Okay. We\u2019re starting to see a bunch of consolidation in asset management land, you have Ameriprise Columbia, yesterday you had Morgan Stanley Invesco. Just thoughts on some of the recent transactions on how you are impacted specifically and then just maybe just the more general view on consolidation asset management, how you are impacted?", "Ronald Logue", "I think we are continue to see more of that if past performance or any indication of future success there I think it will be positive for us and I can cite a number of cases the most recent one last I think last quarter we talked about when Wells and Wachovia merged we were doing the majority of the work for Wachovia, had done actually nothing for Wells Fargo and then won that significant piece of business. I forgot what the assets were I think there were about $230 billion. So we were major beneficiary there. ", "So we had two other situations. We got Columbia for whom we do most of the work purchased by Ameriprise for whom we do nothing and we have (inaudible) for whom we do everything, which is the deal that was announced I guess late last night, and Invesco in that situation we do a lot for Invesco as well.", "So my sense is that we will be a beneficiary of that kind of consolidation going forward and that trend has been a long time trend actually going back five, ten years. We have seen that in many cases and usually we're on one side or the other lately we haven't been on the buying side, but because we have been doing so much for the seller it just an easier thing for the buyer to do and so we have been the beneficiary. I expect that will continue.", "Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS", "", "The last one is just a theoretical question back on the securities portfolio. On the reinvest side, and my thoughts have changed over time as per the cycles we've just looked through. I get that you are buying high quality and reasonable duration MBS and ABS. But I guess the question I have is why, after everything we have lived through, I know capital ratios are much better, how come, go down that path? In other words they could wind up, they might say (inaudible) but they might rise a lot. Why take on the duration risk even if you feel good about the credit risk on the reinvest? Why not stay close to home and just deal with a little bit lower earnings in the near term but have a squeaky- clean securities portfolio?", "Edward Resch", "We\u2019re trying to strike the right balance there Glen, to the question you\u2019re asking and we\u2019re not going down the path that you alluded to in your question about some of the other asset classes that blew out from a spread perspective. It\u2019s a question of whether or not we want to really stay on the sidelines and give up the current earnings as well as positioning the portfolio for the future and we have made the decision and we think the risk award there makes sense. Recognizing that the rates are probably not going to go down. They are going to go up. But investing the 14 billion in the asset classes that we did, we think, makes sense for both the short term and the longer term.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Howard Chen - Credit Suisse.", "Howard Chen - Credit Suisse", "I think you previously noted that pre- payment speech relating to the Condo would be in 8% to 12 % range, I was curious what that was during the quarter and generally where those are trending right now?", "Edward Resch", "", "No it\u2019s slightly higher and trending towards slightly higher but not materially so.", "Howard Chen - Credit Suisse", "", "In the past you've given some helpful detail on lending spreads, Ron you made the comment in the prepared remarks we saw compression in the spreads there so just hoping for, a bit more detail.", "Ronald Logue", "In terms of Q3 versus Q2, if we can use that, the volume is down a bit from 417 last quarter to 395 this quarter, so that\u2019s down about 5%, the spread went down from 88 basis points to about 50 basis point and virtually all of the revenue variants is due to the change in spread, I mean just a small percentage due to the 5% decline in the volume.", "Howard Chen - Credit Suisse", "", "Okay, and then I know part of this is a bit of a catch up with the return of the incentive compensation but if I look at some of this quarters fee revenue trends in particular, foreign exchange, we just touched in sec lending, some of the servicing fees. They look a bit lower when you are catching up with some of the incentive compensation.", "So, I'm just curious, as we go forward how do we think about the pacing of the core revenues with incentive compensation accruals?", "Ronald Logue", "", "I think that in a more normalized environment Howard, I think that the way to look at the pacing of revenues against incentive compensation is based on where we\u2019ve been historically which is approximately in the 40% of revenue range and that\u2019s kind of long- term measure. It could be 38%, it could be 41% but in the range of 40% of revenues is probably the best way to think about incentive comp over a more normal time frame.", "Howard Chen - Credit Suisse", "And then my final on Ed, could you just touch on the current position of your balance sheet and sensitivity higher rates, I know, typically your balance sheets are normally viability sensitive, but my case, my sense is that\u2019s not the case now, so, what's the composition again and what are the thresholds between, it could be in like a little asset- sensitive to becoming normally liability- sensitive? Thanks.", "Edward Resch", "Yes, I mean we are pretty flat. The duration gap is the smallest, it's I think been in a long time certainly in recent memory at about one to five years. So, we are pretty flat, we are comfortable with that, we think that given the investment objectives that we have, as I said, we will continue to be around that coming into year end, both from a GAAP stand point end, from the duration of the portfolio. But you are right, in a more normal, interest rate environment we would normally be in a liability- sensitive position and we would expect that to be the case over time, once things get back to normal.", "Howard Chen - Credit Suisse", "Okay, and just a clarification, I guess what's normal from an interest rate perspective in your mind?", "Edward Resch", "Hard to say, I mean we are - I think everybody agrees that where we are right now is not normal, but I don\u2019t know, what's a normal Fed funds rate? 3%, 4% and it's hard to say, but clearly it's not 25- basis points. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike Mayo - CLSA.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA", "Just to replay your guidance to the fourth quarter, is why is it with a $1.00 to $1.4, is that correct?", "Edward Resch", "Yes, that\u2019s what it would work out to, yes.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA", "Okay and FX was down, and you guys buy a lot and it was not the banking your work is there anything going on there?", "Edward Resch", "", "No not that I can tell.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA", "As far as an outlook for that do you expect to stay down here?", "Edward Resch", "", "I think that I think we'll see the same level. Yeah I don't think we're go see necessarily a big jump there.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA", "", "And just be clear you're guiding lower for the fourth quarter or I guess you are guiding down to consensus. Is that solely due to less than expected security funding and a lower quarter margin or there is anything else going on?", "Edward Resch", "", "No it's mostly due to securities lending and foreign exchange.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA", "", "Okay, and your asset under custody were up 9%, your custody fees were up 5% so why, are you cutting margin or what's going on there?", "Edward Resch", "", "No, I think we talked about this in the past it's just the function of as you starting to add the asset and as the revenue starts coming in, nothing unusual there at all.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA", "So why wouldn't you expect an acceleration of those fees then?", "Edward Resch", "", "Well you may overtime as the assets begin to come on you start seeing that there has been a delay there, but there is nothing there is nothing unusual there at all.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA", "And you mentioned several new wins would that all be reflected? I guess it wouldn't be reflected yet. But your wins and I have asked this before, how much of new custody assets to the wins provide say a percentage of your existing asset under custody at ballpark even?", "Edward Resch", "", "That's the tough one you know small.", "Kelly McDonald", "", "I'll get back to with that Mike.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "", "One cleanup question, you indicated 600 million fiscal year for the accretion, for the accredible yield and you had 279 this quarter. So I know that implies 321 but I can\u2019t recall how much Q2 was.", "Edward Resch", "Q2 was 112 million. So we have reported about close to 400 million through the end of September Betsy.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "So little over 200 for 4Q. And looking at your capital ratios with the TCE ratio expected to get to 6.25% and your target really is 5%, how do you think about capital management over the course of the next year and what are the trigger points for either a dividend increase or a buy back on the stock?", "Ronald Logue", "I think one of the big trigger points is going to be what the new Fed regulations for capital ratios are going to be. I think we have to take a look at that first and then make some decisions based on what\u2019s there. But I think that probably will be the first trigger point right there, looking at what the capital ratios are and then making some determination in terms of dividend and then looking at what kind of opportunities, if there are any out there in the market place to take advantage of. So it will be some what situational but I think the first big trigger point is going to be what the regulators come out with in terms of new capital ratios.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "I would think you are fairly close to the regulators. So do you have a sense as to where that dialogue is going at this stage?", "Ronald Logue", "", "No, actually we don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m assuming this is going to happen sometime soon.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "", "Right. I think the G20 was looking for by the end of the year.", "Ronald Logue", "", "I would think so. Yes.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "", "Once you feel like you have sufficient capital, how are you thinking about the dividend policy just generally?", "Ronald Logue", "All things being equal, obviously we want to get back to the point where we are paying a dividend similar to what we were paying in the past but I think we just need to see what the landscapes is going to look like. But generally speaking we'd want to get back to paying a dividend similar what we\u2019ve done in the past.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Which was roughly 20, 25% range, is that fair?", "Ronald Logue", "Yes.", "Operator", "", "Next question comes from Marty Mosby - FTN Equity Capital.", "Marty Mosby - FTN Equity Capital", "", "I had a question concerning the net interest income. We are looking at the kind of the accretion that we are getting all for the investments that we put on board which is a positive. On the flip side we are getting this, now kind of negative in a sense of we are in the lower end. So we are one side on the upper end of the range and another in the lower.", "So we kind of think about, how those two things would net out and where we are versus your long- term projections of where you think the margin would end up?", "Edward Resch", "The reason for one being on the lower end and one being on the upper end is the swing factor of discount accretion. If you exclude discount accretion from the calculation given the rate environment and given our conservative reinvestments, we are saying that we think we'll be closer to 170 basis points for the margin.", "If you include discount accretion which is performing higher than what we expected when we consolidated the conduit, that\u2019s the reason for the other range being at the upper end 220 basis point being the upper end.", "Marty Mosby - FTN Equity Capital", "All I was trying to get at is, if you kind of take the accretion and say well, really that\u2019s not going to be there permanently. On the flip side, the negative that we are getting from the interest rate environment, also is it going to be there permanently.", "So somewhere between 170 and 220, they kind of maybe normalize out on the next couple of years, because, we have enough of the accretion to keep us through as we wait for hedge rates to go up. Once hedge rates go up, then we get that benefit and that will help all sets on the loss of accretion in the out years. ", "Edward Resch", "Exactly right.", "Marty Mosby - FTN Equity Capital", "I am just thinking of those two things as, you wouldn\u2019t go in and just pull out that 50- basis points and say, that\u2019s really an abnormal number. That really is a benefit that we are getting today that\u2019s helping us offset and really just kind of accelerate our return to what would be a more normal long- term net interest margin once interest rates do go up.", "Edward Resch", "That's correct. ", "Operator", "You next question comes from Gerard Cassidy - RBC.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC", "The question I had, you mentioned the adjusted outlook for the full year of 2009 regarding revenue, the decline in revenue year- over- year from \u201908 and then your expectations on operating EPS numbers. Can you give us some thoughts on what you are looking at for 2010?", "Ronald Logue", "I really can't. I think it's too early for that right now Gerard. Obviously we are working through that now, we will talk about that, early in the year as we normally do, but it's really too premature to get a sense of that right now.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC", "Okay, and then the second question was in the securities lending business, you indicated in the past that as a result of the disruption in the marketplace, some of your customers have pulled out of that business and you have been slowly but surely getting them back. Can you give us an update on that business, how many customers that we are actively involved and securities lending have come back and what's the potential?", "Ronald Logue", "Yes, I think we said, we\u2019ve got five more came back this time, but \u2013.", "", "Kelly McDonald", "26 came back.", "Ronald Logue", "26 came back.

(inaudible).", "Ronald Logue", "Maybe a little bit back..", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC", "Customers are back.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja - J.P Morgan.", "Vivek Juneja - J.P Morgan.", "", "Couple of questions Ronald. Firstly on the update for other expense, you talked about it going down 25% to 30% versus (inaudible) so obviously that's something that you've increased given that turning at a lower run rate. Any color onto the one the kinds of items and how should we think about what scenario or what drivers would cause that to go back up?", "Ronald Logue", "", "Let me start I think one of the things we tried to do over the years is to create as much variable expenses we can so to the extent that we can do things with contract is in terms of IT as an example or other type of professional services where we can decrease that rather quickly as suppose to adding staff. I think we have a done a good job in doing that so we had more freedom in our ability to do those kind of things. And I think we beginning to see that reflected in the other expenses. I don't know if you had\u2026", "Edward Resch", "Yeah, that's the largest element, or the largest lever we have is professional services contractors to address certain short- term or very specific technical needs, but we have other areas of that line which are sales promotion and travel and entertainment and a whole series of miscellaneous items that we can clamp down on and frankly we have this year given what we have seen on the top line.", "The opposite was true obviously as Ron alluded to in prior years where we had the ability to calibrate some of those expenses up and get ahead of some various IT projects and things like that by using contractors and various consultants.", "Vivek Juneja - J.P Morgan.", "Great. That\u2019s helpful, so that as business comes back that\u2019s what will drive expenses. ", "The discount accretion went up for the near term but you have reduced it for \u2018011. As you think about that, how much would, because of your expectation for pre- payment speeds going up. How much would long term risk need to go back up for that to reverse back to where you were three months ago because long term rates move but not that much? So if they move back another 50 basis point or so, would that mean that you go back to where you were in terms of your discount accretion or can you talk on that?", "Edward Resch", "Our change in outlook for discount accretion Vivek, is more actually centered on out assessment of future credit expectations. It does not have much to do on a go- forward basis with the change in prepayment assumptions. We\u2019re still thinking about the range of 8 to 12 on the CPR. So when we brought it down, it\u2019s more a question of specific credit analysis on specific securities that caused us to change our view. That is the opposite of what we have seen so far this year where we have actually generated more discount accretion since the consolidation because of slightly higher prepayment speeds.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Brian Bedell - ISI Group.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "Did you say that you expect about 850 million of the 6.1 billion shortage to not accrete ultimately? Did I get that right?", "", "Edward Resch", "", "Yes", "", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "If the decline in the 800 million to 700 million of discount accretion in 2011, is that due more to your modeling, sort of higher default rates, or is it more due to the advancement of from the prepayments fees, the advancements that you are seeing in the currents periods here.", "Edward Resch", "It's the former. It's based on our change of view on certain securities from a credit perspective.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "On the tax rate outlook, what's your outlook for the fourth quarter?", "Edward Resch", "We said that, we thought would be for the full year between 29 and 30% and I think that\u2019s the number in the press release.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "A little bit moreof the picture, first on the asset servicing side. Looks like you've won so far, just in keeping track of this, year- to- date about 620 billion of new business and coming into this year, I think you said you had 317 billion, sort of that was yet to be installed.", "How much of you have installed in the third quarter and then what sort of you might be installing in the fourth quarter, just to get sort of the trajection of your new business into the revenue stream?", "Ronald Logue", "I can't give you an exact figure but I would say a good portion of what we talked about last time has or continues to be installed between now and near end and I would assume what we've announcing today will, some of it will being to be installed in the fourth quarter but normally it would flow over into the first and second quarter of next year.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "So some of the wins that you had in the first half were still being installed in the third quarter?", "Ronald Logue", "Yes, because they are longer, Wells is a good example, that\u2019s going to take some time, that\u2019s a big chunk.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "Has Wells been installed yet?", "Ronald Logue", "", "No that\u2019s in process.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "Okay, it's in the process, okay. So that\u2019s not really in the revenue run rate at this stage.", "Ronald Logue", "No.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "Okay. And then, just a couple of other ones, like brokerage fees, was that helped by more transits in management revenue this quarter?", "Edward Resch", "It was helped by the electronic trading platform, we have specifically the Currenex.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "Currenex. Okay, so that was doing well. Okay. I guess because retail APEX trading is out right now. Then securities lending, spreads down to 50 bips, you expect further spread compression in the fourth quarter in that book?", "Edward Resch", "No, I think about the same, maybe a little.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "About the same. Okay. And then just looking at I guess the longer- term, I know you are going to update your guidance with your February meeting. But should we still think of the company as a basic 10% to 15% EPS growth and that\u2019s been you said a long- term target for a while. From the reduced guidance base that we have this year, if we go into 2010 and revenues are still sluggish from sort of a weak macro backdrop, do you have enough expense flexibility to at least have the 10% type of EPS near the bottom of your long- term range?", "Edward Resch", "First of all, we are not going to retreat from our long- term goals, those are going to continue to be our goals for us going forward. I can't tell you what's going to happen next year. Do we have some flexibility in the expense ID, I think we have some flexibility. But what I feel good about is that the basic core fundamental revenue streams that attract customers, service fee revenue, management fee revenue continues to grow sequentially quarter. And from that, as markets change, will come the other revenue from those new customers. ", "So what I am focusing on right now was those acquisitions of new customers and the fundamental core business represented by servicing fee revenue and management fee revenue, because history has shown that once you have that core revenue, the rest of that that, whatever you want to call it, market driven revenues, securities lending, foreign exchange, transition management, all that, follows pretty closely.", "So what's happening right now is we are, I think successfully building that core revenue from which the additional revenues, including NII, which creates the basic inventory for NI comes along. So that what's been going on in 2009 which I think and will continue in 2010 and so I would hope as markets normalize you begin to see those other revenue streams growing on the backs of these new wins.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "", "Right and you will be able to lag your deposit pricing I would assume, when the Fed raises rates or if there is a global coordination of", "Ronald Logue", "", "We have done that in the past lagging rights on the liability side yes.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "", "Right. And then just lastly on the expenses, any major investment projects in the last year you did, you did some international stuff with Canary Wharf\u2026", "Ronald Logue", "", "Yeah, we have got lot of that behind us, and one of the decisions we've made in the high revenue growth period is we made a lot of investment. The outsourcing business, the middle office outsourcing is a good example of what we have done, moving into Canary Wharf taking care of a new building in Ireland and a lot of that stuff passed us so I feel pretty good about that.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group ", "", "Right great thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from John Stilmar - SunTrust", "John Stilmar - SunTrust", "Really quickly can you differentiate for me specifically going back to Sec lending, with the drop, it seems like most of it is basis point related and not necessarily absolute balance outstanding. Typically we see in the third quarter that there is some seasonal decline in demand for securities lending and we see that demand pick up in the fourth quarter.", "But if we just look at the balances themselves they need not exhibit some of that traditional seasonal decline whereas it was more of a pricing decline. So can you help characterize my expectations for the fourth quarter vis- \u00e0- vis what is traditionally seasonal versus what the margin guidance or the margins you have set for this business which might me a bit more cyclical.", "Edward Resch", "No, the typical cycle has been high second quarter, lower quarter and about the same I\u2019d say in the fourth quarter. So it maybe a little up- tick but traditionally what the cycle has been, I don\u2019t anticipate anything different this year.", "Ronald Logue", "", "Our guidance for the remainder of the year assumes a flat level of securities on loan. We think that\u2019s a prudent thing to do given what we\u2019re seeing in the securities lending business right now.", "John Stilmar - SunTrust", "Can you talk about, just given the lower margins in securities lending and the fact that it\u2019s an integrated product a lot of times with custodial and other types of services that you provide, especially as you are expanding into hedge funds, can you talk about the pricing of some of your custodial businesses and should we be expecting, back to Mike\u2019s question earlier about the revenue in basis points for assets under custody, can you help me think about what the trajectory might be of that growing in the future to the extent that Sec lending is not as profitable maybe on a go- forward basis as we reset to new valuation paradigms?", "Edward Resch", "I think the first thing I have to do is repeat what we\u2019ve said a number of times. And that is the discipline that we apply here in terms of not subsidizing the core businesses based on the anticipation of gaining either securities lending or foreign exchange or something that we've had a very strong discipline about. So that, if things like this happen the core revenue streams are not dramatically affected.", "So we have been pretty good about that for years and continue to be and I think that will play well for us going forward.", "Ronald Logue", "Thank you, I don\u2019t have any other closing remarks and we look forward to seeing you again some time soon. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "This concludes today\u2019s State Street Corporation\u2019s Third Quarter Call and Webcast.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Today\u2019s discussion is being broadcast live on State Street\u2019s website at www.statestreet.com/stockholder. This call is also being recorded for replay. State Street\u2019s call is copyrighted, all rights are reserved.", "The call may not be recorded for rebroadcast or distribution in whole or in part without expressed written authorization from State Street and the only authorized broadcast for this call is host on State Street\u2019s website. At the end of today\u2019s presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)", "Now I\u2019d like to introduce Kelley MacDonald, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations at State Street. Ms. MacDonald, you may begin.", "Kelley MacDonald ", "", "Thank you. Before Ron Logue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jay Hooley, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Chief Financial Officer, Ed Resch begin their remarks, I\u2019d like to remind you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements.", "Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in State Street\u2019s 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K and its subsequent filings with the SEC including its Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 18, 2009.", "We encouraged you to review those filings, including the sections on risk factors, concerning any forward-looking statements we make today.

Ron?", "Ron Logue", "Kelley, thank you. Good morning, everybody. Now let me start the call with some reflections on 2009 and the fourth quarter, and then I\u2019ll hand over to Ed who will provide a financial perspective. Jay Hooley, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will succeed me as CEO on March 1 of this year, will then provide some detail about our outlook for 2010. Then the three of us will be happy to take your questions.", "Due to actions we took in 2009 we are now well positioned for the future. Let me briefly describe some of those actions. In 2009 we grew our core servicing fee and management fee revenues on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We reduced the run rate of expenses on a year-over-year basis. We consolidated the asset-backed commercial paper conduits we administered.", "We were among the first to repay TARP and buyback the warrants. We strengthened our capital position and we announced two proposed acquisitions that of the security services business of Intesa Sanpaolo, a premier provider of investment services in Italy and Luxembourg, and Mourant International Finance Administration, a leading servicer of alternative investments.", "New business continues to be strong. In 2009 we added $1.13 trillion in assets to be serviced and $248 billion in net new business in asset management. These wins support the momentum we have seen this year in our core business. Let\u2019s take a look at revenue growth. In the fourth quarter alone in our investor services operations we added more than $500 billion in assets to be serviced, including a mandate to provide investment manager operations outsourcing for approximately $300 billion for Morgan Stanley Investment Management.", "We continue to see growth in servicing for alternative asset management. This quarter we added 14 customers and 65 in total in 2009. In the fourth quarter our assets to be serviced in alternative investments have grown 5%, up from $421 billion as of September 30, 2009 to $443 billion. When we complete the acquisition of Mourant we expect State Street to be the largest servicer of alternative investments in the world.", "In addition to Morgan Stanley Investment Management, some of our investment servicing wins in the fourth quarter included Intermountain Equity Group, which awarded us a mandate to support its new $400 million private equity real estate fund with a full range of administration services. Saskatchewan Teachers\u2019 Federation selected State Street to provide custody, fund accounting, and securities lending services for CAD 2.2 billion in pension and group benefit fund assets.", "Also in Canada, State Street was appointed by the McCain Foods, pension plan to provide custody, accounting, benefit payments, and investment analytics for more than CAD 300 million in assets and Caldwell Investment Management Limited appointed us, along with our joint venture partner IFDS Canada, to provide custody, fund accounting, fund administration, registered trustee services, foreign exchange, transfer agency, and unit holder recordkeeping services for its fund complex.", "Again in Canada, State Street was appointed by M.D. Physician Services to provide a range of investment services for CAD 15.6 billion in assets including custody, fund accounting, and fund valuation services. State Street now provides full back office services for all of Calamos Investments collective fund structures, recently adding custody and fund administration services for its more than $21 billion in collective fund structures including open and closed end mutual funds, Dublin UCITS and private funds.", "In the United States we won a mandate from Ford Motor Company for servicing and $8 billion defined contribution plan and issuing benefits payments. We also won a mandate to provide a range of servicing, including custody, accounting, performance and analytics, and securities lending, for Intel\u2019s defined contribution plan of $7.5 billion.", "State Street Global Advisors during the quarter added $142 billion, including a $1.5 billion mandate for implementing a passive strategy for Massachusetts pension reserves which builds on our existing relationship with this customer. SSgA successfully won a renewal by the Illinois State Board of Investment Chicago to run a $513 million MSCI all country Ex-US equity index fund.", "Moving on to our other business lines, we like many others, face declines in trading services and securities finance revenues. As we said in the third quarter call, as spreads compressed further securities finance revenue declined in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. With respect to securities finance revenue, we believe we are at or near the trough.", "In the fourth quarter we added several new customers in our securities finance business. As we said last quarter, our participation in the program has stabilized and now it\u2019s beginning to grow again. Net interest revenue on a fully tax equivalent basis decreased 3% from the third quarter due primarily to lower conduit discount accretion as a result of the absence of onetime pay downs and a slowing in prepayments fees.", "Ed will provide some more detail shortly. Spreads on fixed income securities have compressed significantly improving State Street\u2019s unrealized securities losses in our investment portfolio. As liquidity began a return to the market, the after tax unrealized losses were cut by about 65% from the December 2008 level from $6.32 billion to $2.29 billion.", "It\u2019s also important to us as we operate in a lower growth environment to execute our core competency and expense control, which I think we have been demonstrating during this difficult period. You will notice that our salaries and benefits expenses declined from the third quarter by about $28 million due to lower cash incentive compensation accruals.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ed who will provide further detail about our financial performance in 2009 and provide several comments affecting our business in 2010.", "Ed Resch", "Thank you, Ron. Good morning everyone. This morning I\u2019ll review three areas. First the results of the fourth quarter and the year, second the improvement in the unrealized losses in the investment portfolio, the overall performance of the portfolio, as well as our outlook for net interest margin in 2010, and third a review of our capital ratios and the execution of our tangible common equity improvement plan.", "This morning, all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today\u2019s press release. Comparing the fourth quarter of 2009 with the third quarter, servicing fee revenue increased 6% and management fee revenue was up 5%, primarily due to new business wins, as well as market increases. Both items were up compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 due primarily to market improvement.", "Clearly revenue from securities finance was weaker, when compared either with the very strong fourth quarter of 2008 or with the third quarter of 2009. In each case this weakness was primarily due to further compression in spreads. Foreign exchange revenue declined on a year-over-year basis due to lower volatility and lower volumes.", "On a quarter-over-quarter basis, foreign exchange revenue declined due to lower volumes offset partially by slightly higher volatility. The mix of foreign exchange business between custody, foreign exchange and third-party foreign exchange remained fairly constant.", "Brokerage and other revenue, which is reported as part of trading services was up 47% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 and was up 8% compared to the third quarter of 2009 due primarily to strength in transition management and electronic trading. We had $405 billion of average securities on loan in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $440 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008, and up from $399 billion for the third quarter. We saw significant compression in spreads in 2009.", "The fed funds to three month LIBOR spread began the year at about 135 basis points and ended the end of the year at approximately 13 basis points. We believe that spread compression is near or at a trough and we are hopeful that securities finance revenue is at or near the bottom, assuming volumes remain relatively flat. While we believe that the securities finance market will continue to be an important source of revenue for State Street, it will take some time for this market to return to historical levels.", "Average lendable assets for the fourth quarter of 2009 were about $2.3 trillion, up 10% from $2.1 trillion for the third quarter of 2009 and up about 21% from $1.9 trillion for the fourth quarter of 2008. As of December 31, 2009, the duration of the securities finance book was approximately 25 days.", "Now for the remaining items in the income statement, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, processing and other fee revenue declined 28%, but were up 33% in the third quarter. The change in revenue were due to a number of factors, none of which was individually material.", "Net interest revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined about 10% from the fourth quarter of 2008 due primarily to the impact of the continuing low interest rate environment, compressed spreads and the decline in customer balances from the abnormally high levels in the fourth quarter of 2008, offset partially by the impact of discount accretion from the consolidated conduit assets.", "Compared to the third quarter of 2009 net interest revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined 3% due to a lower level of discount accretion as a result of the absence of onetime pay downs and slower prepayment rates, offset partially by the positive impact of the investment strategy, which we began to execute in the third quarter.", "Net interest margin of 235 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2009 was down 12 basis points from the third quarter of 2009 on a fully taxable equivalent basis. Excluding discount accretion of $230 million, net interest margin in the fourth quarter would have been 161 basis points. The net interest margin for the full year is 220 basis points including discount accretion of $621 million and its 169 basis points excluding discount accretion.", "In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded about $108 million of net gains and separately about $51 million of credit related OTTI resulting in a $57 million net gain related to investment securities. The OTTI was primarily due to increases in expected future credit losses in U.S. non-agency mortgage-backed securities.", "In the fourth quarter, we also recorded a loan loss provision of $35 million primarily related to a commercial real estate exposure. Regarding operating basis expenses, fourth quarter expenses increased 1.8%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 and increased 5.7% from the third quarter of 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2008 we reduced our full year cash incentive compensation accrual by about 50%, given our tangible common equity improvement plan and the financial market disruption.", "As previously disclosed, no performance based cash incentive compensation was accrued in the first half of 2009 in support of our TCE improvement plan. Following the repayment of TARP, conduit consolidation, our successful equity raise and the progress in achieving our TCE improvement plan, we began to accrue discretionary cash incentive compensation in the third quarter of this year.", "Note that compared to the third quarter of 2009 salaries and benefits expenses declined 3% in the fourth quarter primarily due to a lower level of accrual of performance based cash incentive compensation. We accrued approximately $50 million for this item in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to the $100 million we estimated we would accrue in the fourth quarter on the third quarter call.", "Other expenses declined 17% in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, but increased 48% from the third quarter of 2009 due primarily to an adverse judgment of $60 million rendered by a Netherlands court in a matter related to the Lehman bankruptcy, as well as other securities processing costs. On a year-over-year basis, comparing 2009 with 2008 on an operating basis, other expenses declined 23%. We will continue to be vigilant in managing these expenses.", "Now let me turn to the investment portfolio. The average size of the investment portfolio in the fourth quarter has increased about $22 billion to $94 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase is due primarily to the consolidation of the conduit assets with a fair value of approximately $16.6 billion, as well as the execution of our reinvestment strategy in the second half of 2009, offset partially by maturities and sales from the investment portfolio.", "Excluding treasury bills, during the fourth quarter we invested about $4.4 billion in highly rated securities at an average price of $99.81 with an average yield of 2.37% and duration of approximately 2.08 years. Those $4.4 billion are primarily comprised of the following securities, 99.7% of which are rated AAA.", "$1.3 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities, $2.4 billion in asset-backed securities including about $1 billion of foreign RMBS and about $0.5 billion of credit card receivables, $0.2 billion in non-agency mortgage-backed securities and $0.5 billion in corporate and municipal bonds.", "The aggregate unrealized after tax losses in our available for sale and held to maturity portfolios as of December 31, 2009 were $2.3 billion, an improvement of about $700 million from September 30, 2009 and about $4.0 billion or about 65% from December 31, 2008, in each case after giving effect to conduit consolidation.", "As of last Friday, January 15, 2010 the comparable unrealized after tax loss had improved from year end by nearly $500 million to about $1.8 billion. In our investment portfolio slide presentation we have updated the data through quarter end for you to review. As of December 31, 2009, our portfolio is 80.2% AAA or AA rated, similar to September 30, 2009.", "The amount of downgrades diminished significantly from the prior quarter as well. The former conduit assets, now included in the investment portfolio, continue to improve in price during the quarter as general capital market conditions improve. We continue to estimate that we will not accrete back into net interest revenue of about $850 million of the charge we took upon consolidation. This is expected to occur over the remaining lives of the conduit assets and is consistent with the level we estimated on our third quarter conference call.", "The accretion into net interest revenue in the fourth quarter was $230 million for a total of $621 million in 2009. We continue to expect about $900 million of discount accretion in 2010 and about $700 million in 2011 to accrete back into net interest revenue, further bolstering our already very strong capital position.", "We also continue to expect about two thirds of the total expected discount accretion to occur in the first five years after consolidation, assuming we continue to hold the securities. As you are undoubtedly aware, a significant number of assumptions go into the estimate of future discount accretion including estimated prepayment speeds and expected future credit losses across the various asset classes.", "I will now provide some of the assumptions we used in creating our 2010 outlook for net interest revenue and net interest margin. First, we continue to execute on the portfolio reinvestment plan that we adopted in the second half of 2009. We intend to reinvest about 80% of the approximately $15 billion in assets due to mature or pay down in 2010.", "We intend to continue to invest in highly rated agency mortgage-backed securities and highly rated asset backed securities. As we stated, when we announced the proposed acquisition of Intesa\u2019s securities services business, we expect to invest approximately $16 billion of customer deposits in euro-denominated government bonds and bank placements.", "We expect our net interest margin, including the impact of the Intesa acquisition, but excluding the conduit discount accretion, to be between 150 and 160 basis points on average for the year. Excluding discount accretion, we expect the net interest margin to be down from 169 basis points on average in 2009 due to an anticipated significantly tighter spread environment for all of 2010 as compared to the first half of 2009.", "We expect the Bank of England rate to remain at 50 basis points for the rest of the year, we expect the ECB rate to remain at 100 basis points for the rest of the year, and we expect the fed to keep the overnight fed funds rate at 25 basis points for all of 2010. We further expect earning assets to increase between 6% and 8% from the average in 2009, primarily due to the expected acquisition of Intesa\u2019s securities services business.", "We expect the S&P 500 to average about $11.25 in 2010, up about 19% from 948, which was its average in 2009. Lastly, I\u2019ll briefly update our capital ratios and the successful execution of our TCE improvement plan that we announced last February.", "In the fourth quarter, State Street Corporation\u2019s capital ratios continued to improve such that as of December 31, 2009, compared to September 30, 2009, our Tier 1 leverage ratio stood at 8.5%, up from 8.0%. Our Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 17.5%, up from 15.3%. In the fourth quarter, we improved our tangible common equity ratio from 5.6% at September 30, 2009, to 6.6% at December 31, 2009, ahead of our original target of 4.91% when we introduced the plan in February 2009.", "The majority of this quarterly improvement came from price improvement in the investment portfolio and organic capital generation. The details behind the TCE ratio displayed on a quarterly basis are listed on our website on slide 15 in the investment portfolio presentation.", "We expect all of our capital ratios to continue to be strong, including following the acquisition of Intesa\u2019s securities services business expected to close in the second quarter of 2010. In conclusion, we strengthen the company through our actions in 2009 to prepare us for the future. We believe the economy is recovering, but that it will be slow and our approach will continue to be cautious.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jay, who\u2019ll provide our view of our financial goals and the operating environment.", "Jay Hooley", "Thank you, Ed and good morning. I\u2019m excited about leading State Street into the second decade of this century and believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of growth trends in the global financial markets. We have emerged as a stronger company after two very disruptive years 2008 and 2009, when financial markets nearly collapsed and our revenue soared in one year due to strength in market driven revenue, and then fell in the next as volume and volatility in market driven revenue fell below historical norms.", "Continued weakness in market driven revenue is expected to be a headwind in 2010. In 2009, growth in our core businesses securities, servicing, and investment management were the two consistent bright lights and we are optimistic that this trend will continue into 2010. We continue to win new business and our pipeline is promising. We see growth opportunities across all geographies and in particular in investment manager operations outsourcing, quantitative asset management, and alternative investment servicing.", "We expect to close two acquisitions in the first half of the year, as Ron mentioned, Intesa Sanpaolo\u2019s securities servicing business and Mourant. Both acquisitions will provide additional capabilities for our customers in Europe and both are expected to be modestly accretive in 2010. First, Intesa Sanpaolo\u2019s securities services business. This acquisition brings us about $500 billion in custody assets to be serviced, a significant majority of which is Intesa Sanpaolo\u2019s own investment management affiliates.", "In addition, we will provide accounting services for about $250 billion and depo bank services for about $200 billion, with 80% of the assets in Italy and the other 20% in Luxembourg as the business becomes integrated into our business model we see opportunities for additional crossover revenue, which was not included in the valuation models for the transaction.", "As we said when announcing the transaction, we\u2019ll assume about $16 billion in deposits which we intend to invest in euro-denominated government debt as well as bank placements. Then Mourant; this acquisition will solidify our position as the leader in servicing alternative investments, and as the number one servicer of private equity investments in the world.", "We gained expertise in servicing private equity following the acquisition of Investors Financial in Palmeri in 2007 and Mourant adds to that capability. So our own organic growth plus the long term growth of these two acquisitions position us very well for the future. With this as an introduction, let me remind you that we believe that our long term financial goals remain in place.", "Last spring, I led a strategic view of our company. Our senior most staff reviewed the markets, both geographic and product related for all of our businesses and compared the outlook of those to our long term financial goals. We assessed our market position and our existing solutions and services, as well as those in development. The result, those goals are still appropriate and I expect them to be achieved over economic and market cycles.", "They are growth and operating basis revenue of between 8% and 12%; growth and operating basis earnings per share of between 10% and 15%; an achievement of operating basis return on equity of between 14% and 17%. Given our volatility of the past two years, we expect that 2010 is going to be a transition year. We expect our core businesses, servicing fees and management fees to continue to grow and become a larger percentage of the total revenue.", "If we include discount accretion associated with the conduit consolidation into our calculations, we expect our operating basis earnings per share in 2010 to be approaching the lower end of the 10% to 15% range. However, to achieve greater transparency into the performance of our core business going forward we\u2019ll report our operating basis financial results, excluding merger and integration cost, as well as the impact of discount accretion associated with the conduit assets.", "So to level set, let me remind you that our operating basis revenue, excluding discount accretion in 2009, was $8.138 billion and our operating earnings per share would have been $3.32. We expect our 2010 operating earnings per share, excluding the merger and integration cost and discount accretion, to be only slightly above 2009, reflecting in part a higher average outstanding share count.", "To achieve success going forward, I have several targets I intend to drive through the organization, let me give those to you. Number one: double our non-U.S. revenue over the next five years. Two: drive industry innovation by maintaining technology investment at 20% to 25% of operating expenses.", "Three: accelerate global market share growth in core businesses organically and through acquisition. Four, refine our industry leading operating model so as to achieve positive operating leverage annually in more normal markets, finally, to enhance our risk management capabilities across the organization.", "So 2010 is expected to be a year of transition, one in which our core businesses continue to grow, but sources of market driven revenue represent a headwind. We look forward to closing the two transactions we announced in the fourth quarter in integrating them into our business. I look forward to meeting with many of you in the future, especially at our Investor and Analyst Forum, which is scheduled for May 5 in New York.", "Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Ron.", "Ron Logue", "Thank you, Jay. I feel very confident about State Street\u2019s future as I turn over CEO responsibilities to Jay. We\u2019re completing the very successful management succession that will allow State Street, without interruption, to continue to execute its strategy. Jay has been critical to our past success and our present strategy, and with the board has laid out a plan to continue that success in the future.", "As a company, we have persevered through what is arguably the most difficult financial period since the great depression and because of that we have forged a management team that\u2019s expert in their respective disciplines, collaborative and customer sensitive, and shaped by successfully dealing with the difficulties of the last two years.", "Jay and I have worked together for almost 20 years. We\u2019ve marketed to and serviced our customers together, integrated our acquisitions together, and built our management team together. We sit here today with a strong capital position, a strong track record in acquiring and integrating global investor services businesses and a core competency of managing our expenses against our revenue.", "Since the late 1970s, regardless of who was the CEO, we followed the principle of making sure we delivered value to the four constituencies we serve, our shareholders, our customers, our employees, and the communities in which we work. We may execute differently given the times and circumstances, but for what now begins a fifth decade we remain true to the values that emerged as a result of a different financial crisis in the 70s, focus on the constituencies you serve and serve them well.", "Now Jay, Ed, and I are happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Ken Usdin - Bank of America.", "Ken Usdin - Bank of America", "Just trying to understand the guidance a little bit in more detail, I\u2019d back out some of the one-time things like the CRE charge and the Lehman related charge and go to the kind of tax rate you are going to go for next year. I can see the company making somewhere around call it $0.80 this quarter. Then the guidance that you\u2019re saying on a core basis, ex the accretion, and so the guidance is some, is said to be up off of the 3.32 core for the full year.", "So if you could just kind of qualitatively help us understand, what is going to actually be the growth drivers, given that you have kind of said the core margin will be 150 to 160? So can you just maybe from a business line to business line perspective just help us understand, what areas of the company are going to truly lead the growth? What area would be the more specific headline challenges as you look forward? ", "Jay Hooley", "Yes, Ken. This is Jay. Let me start that one out. As we end 2009, I think you saw and we know particular strength in the investor services and investment management lines. We think those businesses continue to be positioned against good growth trends, whether it\u2019s passive asset management or continued outsourcing both domestically and globally. So we think those core revenue engines are set up well for good growth in 2010.", "As mentioned, the market-driven revenues, beginning with the securities lending business, is still in a constrained environment. We think it\u2019s at a trough, but recovery will be slow and in net interest revenue, as Ed mentioned, we see that as flattish throughout the year. So I think the core drivers have always been the core drivers, which is the core investor services and investment management fees, which we\u2019re pretty optimistic about as we sit here today. ", "Ken Usdin - Bank of America", "So the core businesses just have that much more of an overpowering effect versus the kind of the flatness of those other business lines kind of market related and NII?", "Jay Hooley", "Yes. Ken, the other thing to note is and you probably know this, but included are the two acquisitions as well. So you have Intesa and Mourant, which are expected to close in late first and during the second quarter. ", "Ken Usdin - Bank of America", "Then the second question just on expenses. Ed, maybe you can just help us understand, with the kind of the reversal back out of some of that cash based incentive comp. How will it work going forward as far as you\u2019re planning and incentive compensation plans as far as resetting that accrual? How we should be thinking about those relative changes?", "Ed Resch", "Just to clarify, there was no reversal. There was just less accrual in the fourth quarter than what we had signaled in our third quarter call. So we accrued cash based incentive comp in the second half of the year in a total amount of $150 million, $100 million in the third quarter, and $50 million in the fourth quarter.", "I think going forward our expectation and again, this is all performance dependent is that we\u2019ll accrue a more normal level on a full year basis of incentive compensation in 2010 with the mix between cash and stock still to be determined and obviously this is all a function of what our, the comp committee of our Board, ultimately settles on in their evaluation of the market and our performance and how much incentive comp will be set at.", "Ken Usdin - Bank of America", "Last small question on expenses also XTM that the Lehman-related charge, the other expenses area was still I guess meaningfully higher third to fourth quarter was there anything else specific in that line item and how much more discretion do you have as far as control in that other expense line? Thanks.", "Ed Resch", "", "In the other expense line there is nothing of particular note that I would mention to you other than the Lehman charges, as you said. That is a line that we have an amount of flexibility on in terms of pacing various levels of expense. We\u2019ve ramp it up in the past and used consultants and professional services to get ahead of some IT projects, for example and the converse was true this year where we brought it back down given the revenue outlook. So, there is some level of leverage there going forward. It\u2019s not huge, I mean it\u2019s in the tens of millions of dollars, not hundreds of millions of dollars, Ken, but it\u2019s a line that we have a lot of focus on.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Howard Chen - Credit Suisse.", "Howard Chen - Credit Suisse", "", "A follow up on the core operating guidance; thanks for all the detail on the major assumptions. Could you just provide us with some of the refreshed sensitivities some of the bigger ticket items like fed funds and the S&P levels?", "Ed Resch", "The S&P level I think you should think of in terms of the historical guidance, which we have given is 10% up on that metric or 10% down is in total revenue, 2% up or 2% down, that still holds. We think that that is a level from a planning standpoint that\u2019s reasonably conservative given where the S&P is now. In terms of fed funds, we expect rates as I said to be basically flat at the short end for most of the year.", "We expect the economy to improve, but as I said, slowly with an expectation that as we end 2010 the environment will be getting better and rates will start to slowly rise. That\u2019s still a good thing for us, it always has been slowly rising rates are a positive to us and that continues to be the case and if that series of assumptions holds true, it should position us in reasonably good shape in terms of the portfolio moving into 2011.", "Howard Chen - Credit Suisse", "Then second, I think you\u2019ve been speaking to expectations for further balance sheet contraction before we saw growth again and deposits grew nicely this quarter. What do you think has changed? Is it an inflection point and what\u2019s driving you\u2019re thinking that you won\u2019t grow the balance sheet much Ex-Intesa in 2010?", "Ed Resch", "We\u2019re just being I think conservative in our thinking I mean we expect us, I\u2019d say, a historically based level of customer deposit expansion, but we want to reduce some of our overall liquidity position, which we carry coming into year end, Howard. We again this quarter were conservative in our thinking given that our view is, again, to be cautious and moving into 2010, if we are right in our planning assumptions, we should find ourselves in a position to carry less excess liquidity because the environment will not be quite as potentially disruptive as it was coming into 2009\u2019s year end.", "Howard Chen - Credit Suisse", "Then apologies if I missed this in the prepared remarks, but what are you selling in the securities portfolio and what is driving that decision?", "Ed Resch", "", "Yes, we sold some securities a little over $1 billion of agency mortgage-backed this quarter and I think the same approach that we had in the third quarter which was given the quantitative easing that has been going on, we felt that some of the securities were trading at what we thought were prices that were above fair value. So, on the agency mortgage-backed it\u2019s $1.1 billion to be specific.", "We had an average price on that of a little over $104 price, and we thought that those were rich and we sold them, and we reinvested at an average dollar price coming back into the market at about $102. We thought that made sense given the richness and we thought it took some potential prepayment risk off the table. Then as a secondary item, some minor sales really in the scheme of things, in the range of $300 million in total of former conduit assets that we thought were good de-risking trades.", "Howard Chen - Credit Suisse", "Then just one final housekeeping question for me, ED just could you provide us with the sec lending spreads as you\u2019ve done in the past for the quarter?", "Ed Resch", "Sure. Year-over-year, Q4-to-Q4, Howard, the average spread last year was a 137 basis points. This year end, it was up 41 basis points and sequential quarter, third quarter of 2009, 50 basis points; down to the 41 basis point level Q4 2009. Those spreads were the main drivers, as I said, of the decline in securities lending revenue.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nancy Bush - NAB Research.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "A couple of questions, I guess I am a little confused on the whole issue of core earnings, because your contention has been that the accretion is cash, it can be used as cash is used to pay dividends, do acquisitions, etc. So why the decision to change your reporting?", "Jay Hooley", "Over those past several months, after it was announced that I would succeed Ron, I spent a fair amount of time with many of you and it appeared to me that we\u2019re creating confusion in your world by continuing to explain our core earnings with discount accretion. So in order to create more clarity and transparency, I thought it was important to separate those concepts.", "You\u2019re absolutely right; discount accretion does build capital was available for acquisitions, dividends, and other capital management activities, but it is important to focus on the core as we think about the core and how it grows in the out years. So it was really a decision I made based on what I thought was a lack of clarity in the analyst community and a better reflection on what the core is and how it\u2019s likely to grow going forward.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Will there be a report of earnings with accretion as well so we\u2019ll know both numbers and can pick and choose?", "Jay Hooley", "Absolutely, yes, we have no intent not to continue to disclose discount accretion, but I think it\u2019s important that we view the core as court ex-discount accretion.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "If you could just remind us, the discount accretion at what point do core earnings and, quote, what is now non-core become the same? I mean, we\u2019re still several years away from that, right?", "Jay Hooley", "Yes, I think we said five years the majority of the discount accretion would have run through.", "Ed Resch", "Two-thirds.", "Jay Hooley", "Two-thirds of it in five years.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Secondly, could you just give us a little more color on this, the loan loss provision, the necessity for the loan loss provision? I think you said it was related to a CRE exposure. Whether that exposure is now on non-performing and etc.?", "Ed Resch", "It was one mortgage exposure that we took on a year or so ago. It\u2019s marked down now to a carrying value, which we think is reflective of the expected future cash flows that we\u2019re going to get off that property. The remaining balance is around $50 million after we\u2019ve taken the allowance against it.", "As I\u2019ve said before, analyzed the commercial real estate exposures we have, which are right now in total about $560 million quarterly, and provide if we feel the need is there. On the rest of them, we did that analysis and concluded that no incremental provision was necessary.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Alright, but is this non-performing? You have not had a non-performing total I think prior to this. Do you now have non-performing assets?", "Ed Resch", "No, it\u2019s not non-performing. Remember, there\u2019s different accounting for loans that you originate versus loans that you acquire. We acquired these; we have to do a cash flow based analysis and conclude that the cash flows you expect to receive will cover the balance that\u2019s on your books. So that\u2019s what we did. It\u2019s not considered non-performing, but we thought that looking forward that the expectation of future cash flows on this on this one loan did not justify our carrying value so, we took a provision.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Bedell - ISI Group.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "Can you just talk about within your 2010 outlook to what degree you have further other than temporary impairment factored into that along with securities gains?", "Ed Resch", "The 2010 outlook does not include any securities gains, nor does it include any expected impairments.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "As you sit right now, do we see a risk of I guess further OTTI? Can you talk little bit about the strategy of selling more securities and downsizing the securities portfolio in 2010?", "Ed Resch", "Well, there\u2019s always a risk of further OTTI. Again, it\u2019s very fact and circumstances dependent. At every quarter end, I\u2019ve described the process we go through. I couldn\u2019t sit here and tell you that I expect anymore given that what we\u2019ve done is what we think are appropriate as of 12/31/09. We don\u2019t have an explicit strategy, Brian, of taking securities gains to offset OTTI. I mean, we\u2019ve been in a situation where we think, as I have said on third and fourth quarter calls the market has been a bit rich in terms of some of the mortgage backed securities specifically and we\u2019ve availed ourselves of that.", "If the market continues to be rich as we move into 2010, then we\u2019ll look at them on a case-by-case basis, but there\u2019s no explicit strategy to take securities gains moving into this year.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "So much more opportunistic?", "Ed Resch", "Yes.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "Then on the NIM outlook, just to reiterate, you said 150 to 160 basis points on a core basis for\u2026", "Kelley MacDonald", "Brian, we can\u2019t hear you. Could you take off your headset, please?", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "Can you hear me now?", "Kelley MacDonald", "Yes.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "The NIM of 150 to 160 basis points on a core basis for full year 2010, did I have that right?", "Ed Resch", "Yes.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "If you can also talk about the $1.13 trillion of custody assets that you won in 2009, what proportion of that has been already converted during the full year?", "Jay Hooley", "I think, Brian, maybe a little bit more precise to your question, I think in the fourth quarter we booked $500 billion. So I think that the difference between the one, three and the five is largely implemented. Of the $500 billion in the quarter, you can assume that most of that is not implemented and it will be implemented in the first half of 2010.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "So the Morgan Stanley deal is mostly converted already?", "Jay Hooley", "No, it\u2019s not. That would be a first to second quarter of 2010 installation.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "Then, Jay, can you just talk a little bit about you did mention your five long term goals. Can you talk about the risk mitigation strategy longer term reflecting back on what\u2019s happened over the last couple of years? What are some of the key things you plan to do over the next two to three years to reduce risk in the franchise, particularly on the balance sheet side?", "Jay Hooley", "I think that we\u2019ve all learned something over the course of the last couple of years and I\u2019m not just the world but State Street. I feel like we need to redouble our efforts across the spectrum. So some of the things that we\u2019ve done structurally are we continue to build up our internal control functions, not just risk management, but audit, legal, as well as compliance.", "We\u2019ve applied additional resources to build technology and reporting. So from a standpoint of enhancing and building up the function, that\u2019s well under way, but there\u2019s always more to do. I guess maybe more broadly and perhaps more importantly, I think that we\u2019re in a transition where risk management has become a broader part of the culture of how we view business opportunities going forward.", "So I think across the company, whether it\u2019s running a line business or a support staff group, there\u2019s much more attention at my level, at Ron\u2019s level, at Ed\u2019s level to managing risk in a prudent way. That doesn\u2019t mean not taking risk, but being aware of when you\u2019re taking risk, what the risk return looks like.", "So I would characterize it, Brian, as strengthening the functions and embedding risk management into the core fabric of State Street in a more meaningful way going forward so that hopefully we avoid some of the issues that we had in the past.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "I just think about a couple areas where we might actually see that; I guess one is in the other expense line in terms of operational areas. Of course, all the custodial banks have them from quarter-to-quarter. It looks like they were a little bit elevated in the fourth quarter, I guess relative to a couple of prior quarters. Is that fair?", "Jay Hooley", "I don\u2019t think, in fact, I think we\u2019re making good headway there and just to pick on that and expand on what I was mentioning earlier. We now have a process and have had it in play through the last half of 2009, where every loss is examined, evaluated, look for root cause.", "We\u2019re looking across multiple instances of issues to try to find what areas need the application of an improved process, technology, training, so I think we\u2019re doing a much better job of fundamentally getting at root cause in some of the operating areas. I would expect through that overtime, we\u2019ll continue to manage down operating losses.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "Then just lastly, I guess also with this question on the balance sheet, say three years from now. Obviously, the conduit assets and some of the legacy portfolios are maturing, but on a go-forward basis do you expect to run a securities portfolio that is of much lower risk component and you have potentially lower yield?", "Jay Hooley", "I think we\u2019re always evaluating, as you would expect, the risk return equation in our portfolio investment management strategy. As Ed went through, going into 2010, we\u2019re not anticipating any material shift, but, again, we\u2019re always evaluating market conditions and are willing to adjust if it feels like the return doesn\u2019t warrant the risk that we\u2019re taking.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr - UBS.", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "Can you give a little color further on the rising interest rate thing? We get it if they go up slowly it\u2019s a good thing for everybody. If they go up a little fast just because we\u2019re coming off of such a low bottom, how does the sensitivity around that work in the short term? I know long term it\u2019s a good thing, but in the short term how sensitive is the P&L?", "Ed Resch", "Well, it obviously depends on the pace with which the increase occurs and when it occurs, Glenn. I would say that, if you look at 25 basis point increases and it were to occur sort of in the second half of this year, probably not much of an effect on us for 2010\u2019s results.", "If it were to be let\u2019s say, steeper than that and faster than that, the effect would be, obviously, more pronounced. I don\u2019t want to put a specific percentage on it, but I think if you look at the shock and the ramp test that we disclosed that should give you an idea of what it would mean. Obviously, we\u2019re not expecting a huge shock up in rates, but if that happens, the effect would be more negative to us than a slower ramp.", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "One other thing, and to your credit I haven\u2019t heard much on this, but I\u2019m curious. I\u2019m not asking you to try this online, but the California Attorney General FX suit, that\u2019s ongoing, correct?", "Jay Hooley", "That is ongoing and we wouldn\u2019t comment on it but\u2026", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "I\u2019m with you. I just wanted to make sure that nothing happened that we didn\u2019t know about.", "Jay Hooley", "No, nothing has happened.", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "Anything to comment on, or have there been follow-on audits by other clients or other AGs?", "Jay Hooley", "Yes, I think that as a result of the publicity gained by the California AG, we\u2019ve talk to many of our customers and made sure they fully understood the custody FX service and what I would tell you today are that, following that situation we\u2019ve seen really no change in customer relationships, any change in volume around custody FX. Yet as you would expect, we\u2019ve talked to a lot of people to make sure that they\u2019re comfortable with how the service works.", "Glenn Schorr - UBS", "Then it\u2019s been there always down still ongoing clients?", "Jay Hooley", "Yes, they are, absolutely. Have been trading and servicing with us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Lee - KBW.", "Robert Lee - KBW", "A couple quick questions on asset management, and I apologize if you mentioned this on the call. I came a little late. First, could we get some color on where within asset management you\u2019re seeing kind of the strongest flows? Is it all coming from the ETF business, or the Index business? If there\u2019s any one or two particular product lines or strategies, if you\u2019ll that are driving a lot of your net new business?", "Jay Hooley", "You hit on within asset management; both the quantitative and the passive business towards excellent flows in 2009 and into 2010 as I think more managers allocated more of their portfolio to passive or beta-driven strategies. So we saw that; we think that\u2019s a trend that\u2019s probably sustainable. The other place is ETFs and you\u2019ve seen a lot of press recently about the growth of ETFs.", "I think they just crested $1 trillion in total. So we are, as a major provider of ETF products and services, we\u2019re seeing great growth there. Just to single out a few products, the one I would just may be obvious, but the gold ETF had great growth. Not surprising given the attractiveness of gold through 2009, but those are really broadly the two product categories that the quantitative in ETFs where we\u2019ve seen growth and we anticipate we\u2019ll continue to see growth.", "Robert Lee - KBW", "Maybe as a follow-up, you\u2019ve had this pretty strong year-over-year growth in AUM, I think it\u2019s up 35% or something like that, and pretty good organic growth. Yet certainly management fee revenues, while up, is kind of lagging behind suggesting there is kind of a mix shift taking place. Can you maybe expand on that a little bit and any prospects do you think for that kind of reverse in course as you head into 2010?", "Jay Hooley", "I think you again hit on the point, which is there\u2019s a mix shift between a little bit of reallocation from active to passive, which drives AUM, but has less revenues associated with it. I think that, I would expect that beta will continue to be a major source of allocation for institutions, but I also would expect that you\u2019ll see more risk taking as we get into 2010.", "We\u2019ve seen some early indications of that which would support may be more growth prospects on the active side as well. So I think it\u2019s hard to say whether we\u2019re at that inflection point, but it feels like some confidence is returning and the active side will get more attention as we move into 2010, which would obviously support more growth in our active product, that as well.", "Kelley MacDonald", "We have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Gerard Cassidy - RBC.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC", "You guys mentioned when you announced the acquisition in December that raising the dividend is something that you\u2019re very interested in doing in 2010. Can you share with us your thoughts on the prospects of possibly a dividend increase sometime this year?", "Ron Logue", "I think we said on the last call that, obviously, raising the dividend is a priority. There are guidelines that are being continued to come out of the Fed. We\u2019ll continue to discuss that. I think a lot of it is going to depend on opportunities that present themselves as well in terms of the Intesa-like kind of opportunities and timing, but dividend restoration is definitely one of our priorities.", "We\u2019ll continue to discuss that with the fed. If we see some other opportunities, I think one of the things this company has is a capacity to integrate multiple acquisitions. It\u2019s proven that before. I don\u2019t know whether there\u2019ll be any. So it\u2019s really going to be a question of timing, but we\u2019ll definitely look at restoring the dividend as a priority.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC", "Would the capital ratios that you folks have built up, whether it\u2019s the TCE ratio or the Tier One common, is there one that will take priority over the other in terms of determining, if there aren\u2019t alternatives to maybe make an acquisition, to increase the dividend? Are you focusing on the TCE possibly over the Tier One common or vice versa?", "Ron Logue", "To answer that question directly, we\u2019d focus on the TCE ratio.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time.", "Ron Logue", "Well, thank you very much. We appreciate I know it\u2019s a busy day for all of you, so I appreciate your time and attention on the call. We\u2019ll talk to you again soon. Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

", "(Operator Instructions) I\u2019d like to introduce Kelley MacDonald \u2013 Senior Vice President for Investor Relations at State Street.", "Kelley MacDonald", "Good morning. Before Joe Hooley our President and Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer Ed Resch, begin their remarks, I\u2019d like to remind you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated y these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including those discussed in State Street\u2019s 2009 annual report on Form 10-K and its subsequent filings with the SEC. We encourage you to review those filings including the section on risk factors concerning any forward-looking statements we make today. Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of today, April 20, 2010 and the Corporation does not undertake to revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after today.", "I\u2019d also like to remind you that you can find a slide presentation regarding the Corporation\u2019s investment portfolio as well as our first quarter earnings press release, which includes reconciliations of non-GAAP measures referred to on this webcast in the investor relations portion of our website as referenced in our press release this morning.", "Joseph Hooley", "Thank you Kelly and good morning. I\u2019ll begin with some general comments about our financial results and the operating environment as we begin 2010. Then I\u2019ll hand it over to Ed who will provide a more detailed financial perspective. I\u2019ll make some concluding remarks and then both of us will be happy to take your questions.", "The first quarter of 2010 represents a continuation of what we saw at the end of 2009 with the economy showing steady signs of recovery, the equity markets showing signs of life and a continuation of low levels of interest rates around the world.", "This environment provides good opportunity for our core fee based businesses, but has continued to constrain our market driven revenues; most notably, net interest revenue, securities, finance and foreign exchange.", "During the quarter, we continued to build on a very strong capital position as evidenced by the capital ratios at quarter end with tier one risk based capital at 18.1%, our leverage ratio at 9% and our tangible common equity at 7.5%.", "Let me now walk through our results. I\u2019ll describe our operating basis results, which exclude discount accretion resulting from the consolidation of the conduits in the second quarter of 2009 as well as merger and integration costs.", "Our Service Fee and Asset Management Fee revenue, or core revenue, increased in double digits compared to a year ago and over fee revenue increased 8%. These results were driven by the impact of rising equity market valuations as well as business installations.", "Comparing the first quarter of 2010 with the fourth quarter of 2009, Servicing Fee revenue was nearly flat due to a stronger U.S. dollar and lower volumes offset partially by new business and the impact of higher average equity valuations. Asset Management Fee revenue declined about 2% due primarily to lower performance fees in the first quarter of 2010. ", "We\u2019re still installing a backlog of business we won in the second half of 2009 as well as new business won to date in 2010. These conversions will take several quarters to install due to their size and complexity.", "Our operating basis earnings per share increased from $0.71 in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $0.75 in the first quarter of 2010. Revenue growth of about 1.6% was balanced with tight cost discipline, resulting in expense growth of about .6%, resulting in 100 basis points of positive operating leverage.", "The credit markets continue to stabilize, contributing to the improvement in the unrealized after tax losses in our investment portfolio, now at about $1.4 billion, down from $5.4 billion a year ago. We closed the Mourant acquisition in early April, a transaction which will, we believe, make us number one in the world in servicing alternative investment assets. We expect this acquisition to be slightly accretive to earnings this year, excluding merger and integration costs. ", "We expect to close the acquisition of Intesa Sanpaolo Security Services business later this quarter. Upon completion, this acquisition will firmly establish us as the leading servicer in Italy and enhances our already strong position in the offshore market of Luxembourg. We expect this acquisition to be modestly accretive to earnings this year excluding merger and integration costs.", "As we expected, and noted on our fourth quarter call, we continue to experience weakness in market driven revenues. The Trading Service revenue continues to be constrained as foreign exchange volatility has not improved, nor have volumes compared with the fourth quarter. Cross border trading is weak; in particular, cross border equities have lagged the market recovery.", "Our Securities Finance business experienced slightly increased volumes compared with the previous quarter with average loans outstanding of about $412 billion in the first quarter of 2010. However, we saw further compression in spread between Fed funds ad three month LIBOR from the end of the quarter from 14 basis points to about 12 basis points as of March 31, 2010, which put additional pressure on Securities Finance revenues.", "The continued worldwide interest rate environment is also impacting our net interest revenue. On a fully tax equivalent basis and excluding discount accretion, net interest revenue in the first quarter declined 18% from the first quarter of 2009 and was down 4% from the fourth quarter of 2009.", "These declines were primarily due to the effect of high yielding securities maturing, or paying down and being replaced with lower yielding assets.", "Turning to new business, in the first quarter of 2010 we added $164 billion in assets to be serviced and in April this month to date, we won an additional $155 billion in assets, including a large investment manger operations outsourcing mandate from Pinebridge Investments as well as a very large win from a state pension fund.", "Within Asset Management, net customer cash flows including customer wins and losses were modestly negative. This decline however, was more than offset by appreciation of assets under management with total assets under management remaining in excess of $1.9 trillion at March 31, 2010.", "Taken together, these wins combined with the installation backlog from prior period sales, as well as continued pipeline strength, give us confidence in the ongoing growth of our core business in 2010. ", "We continue to see growth in servicing for alternative asset management. This quarter, prior to our acquisition of Mourant, we added 12 new customers. As of March 31, 2010 our asset service and alternative investments have grown to $474 billion. With the only April acquisition of Mourant, they are now approximately $613 billion.", "Some of our investment servicing wins in the first quarter included the State of Ohio, who had awarded State Street three mandates to provide services for $23 billion in international assets in the Ohio Public Employees Retirement system, the Ohio Police and Fire pension system and the State Teachers retirement system.", "Charles Schwab, a customer of State Street since 2005 has appointed State Street to service its newly launched family of exchange-traded funds with custody fund accounting, fund administration and transfer agent services.", "Wellington West Asset Management of Canada, appointed State Street to provide a range of investment services including fund accounting, fund administration, custody and trustee services, for a group of new funds being launched by Wellington West.", "Legg Mason Global Asset Management expanded its relationship with State Street with the award of fund administration and custody services for its U.K. domiciled assets. In addition, State Street has been retained by British Airways Pension Trustee\u2019s, a client since 1997 to continue to service its $14 billion pound U.K.  pension fund.", "State Street Global Advisors during the quarter added new mandates including the Colorado Fire and Police Pension Association who has hired State Street Global Advisors to handle a $450 million global equity mandate.", "An Australian State Government Pension Fund awarded us a $3.9 billion Aussie mandate across three index strategies manage a tax aware basis. And, State Street was reconfirmed as one of AP7\u2019s passive managers, increasing assets managed from $1.7 billion to $3.5 billion.", "Now turning to expenses, we continue to control head count only adding employees for new business and product development initiatives. In the current environment, we\u2019re highly focused on keeping a tight control over expenses. The increase in salaries and benefits expense reflect a level of incentive compensation consistent with our outlook for the year.", "In the first quarter of 2009, as part of our PCE improvement plan, we did not accrue for discretionary cash incentive compensation. As always, incentive compensation is subject to company performance.", "Before I hand the call to Ed, let me make a few comments now on the broader economic environment. The U.S. economy does appear to be working its way through a slow, or as some have termed, saucer shaped recovery.", "Consumer confidence appears to be returning to the market. Unemployment has declined slightly during the past two quarters. Housing prices are beginning to stabilize, but the headwinds are still there.", "The absolute level of unemployment still remains at a high level and central banks around the world continue to maintain interest rates at low levels. The early indications of recovery, as evidenced by the rising markets, give us some confidence that the trend in market driven revenue will begin to improve to more normalized levels later this year or early next year.", "Let me now turn the call over to Ed who will provide further detail about our financial performance in the first quarter and provide comments reflecting our outlook for the remainder of 2010.", "Edward Resch", "Thank you Jay, and good morning everyone. This morning I\u2019ll review three areas; first, the results of the first quarter, second, the improvement in the unrealized losses in the investment portfolio and the overall performance of the portfolio as well as our outlook for net interest margin in 2010, and third, a review of our strong capital position.", "This morning all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today\u2019s earnings news release. Comparing the first quarter of 2010 with the first quarter of 2009, Servicing revenue increased 15% and Management Fee revenue was up 25% primarily due to an increase in average equity market valuations as well as new business wins.", "Servicing Fees declined slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 due to a stronger U.S. dollar and lower volumes, offset partially by new business and  higher daily average equity market valuations.", "Management Fees declined compared to the fourth quarter due to lower performance fees in the first quarter of 2010. Market driven revenue continues to be weak. Foreign exchange revenue declined compared to the first quarter of 2009 due to lower volatility, offset partially by higher volumes. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, foreign exchange revenue declined due to both lower volumes and lower volatility.", "Brokerage and other revenue which is reported as part of Trading Services doubled when compared to the first quarter of 2009 due to higher revenue from electronic trading. Also in the first quarter of 2009, a lower valuation on several securities held in the trading account impacted revenue in that quarter negatively. It was down about 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 due primarily to lower revenue from transition management.", "We had $412 billion of average securities on loan in the first quarter of 2010, compared with $398 billion of securities in this first quarter of 2009 and $409 billion of securities in the fourth quarter.", "Securities finance revenue declined from the relatively strong first quarter of 2009 by 60%. We continue to experience compression in spreads in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the first quarter of 2009. The Fed funds to three month LIBOR spread at the end of the first quarter of 2009 was about 105 basis points, but it ended the first quarter of 2010 at approximately 12 basis points. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, we saw continued compression of about two basis points from the 14 basis points at the end of the fourth quarter.", "Average lendable assets for the first quarter of 2010 were about $2.3 trillion flat with the fourth quarter of 2009 and up about 34% from $1.7 trillion in the first quarter of 2009. As of March 31, 2010, the duration of the securities finance book was approximately 21 days, down from 25 days in the fourth quarter of 2009, reflecting continued conservatism in the lenders investment guidelines.", "While the quarter\u2019s results in foreign exchange and securities finance were not as strong as we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter, our expectation is that volumes and volatilities in foreign exchange and spreads and securities lending will modestly improve through the remainder of 2010.", "Now for the remaining items in the income statement. Compared to the first quarter of 2009, processing and other fee revenue of $120 million increased 145% and doubled from the fourth quarter of 2009, both increases due primarily to a gain from an early buy out of a legacy leasing transaction and improved revenue from structured products.", "Operating basis net interest revenue declined about 18% from the first quarter of 2009 due primarily to the continuing impact of low interest rates worldwide and compressed spreads on our normalized balance sheet.", "Due to the strain caused by the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, our balance sheet continues to have abnormally high levels of customer deposits at the end of the first quarter of 2009. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, operating basis net interest revenue declined 4% due to lower yields on newly purchased securities that were replacing securities with higher yields that were maturing or paying down.", "Operating basis net interest margin of 162 basis points, which excludes discount accretion, was up one basis point from the fourth quarter of 2009 on the same basis. Including discount accretion of $212 million, and $230 million respectively, net interest margin in the first quarter of 2010 was 234 basis points compared to 235 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2009.", "In the first quarter of 2010, we recorded about $192 million in net gains from sales of securities, and separately, about $97 million OTTI, resulting in $95 million of net gains related to investments and securities. The OTTI was primarily due to increases in expected future credit losses in U.S. non-agency mortgage backed securities.", "We sold securities during the quarter in order to take advantage of what we viewed as favorable valuations. The net gains from securities sold were approximately half from sales of about $2.9 billion in securities from the legacy investment portfolio. The other half of the gains were from sales of about $657 million from former conduit securities. The sales of the former conduit securities were executed due to both favorable valuations as well as to de-risk the balance sheet.", "I\u2019d like to recap where we are relative to future discount accretion. As of December 31, 2009, we expected about $4.6 billion to accrete in interest income over the remaining lives of the assets. We continue to believe that $850 million will not accrete into net interest revenue due to credit. There has been no change in our view relative to credit.", "We earned $212 million of discount accretion in the first quarter. The discount accretion that we will forego from the sales of conduit securities in the first quarter on which we had a gain of approximately $100 million is $140 million.", "And lastly, future discount accretion is expected to decline by approximately $100 million due to the dollar\u2019s strength in the first quarter. So as of March 31, 2010, we now have about $4.1 billion left to accrete through the income statement over the remaining lives of the assets.", "Also, we now expect about $800 million to accrete in 2010 and $600 million to accrete in 2011, down from our earlier expectations due to slower pre-payments which account for about 50% of the declines, and foregone accretion on sales which account for the other 50% of the decline.", "As you are undoubtedly aware, a significant number of assumptions go into the estimate of future discount accretion, including estimate pre-payments, expected future credit losses across various asset classes, sales and assumption that securities are held to maturity.", "Regarding operating basis expenses, first quarter expenses increased 22% compared to the first quarter of 2009 and increased .6% from the fourth quarter of 2009. The primary reason for the increase compared to the first quarter of 2009 was the 21% increase in salaries and benefits expenses due to primarily to the accrual of incentive compensation in the first quarter of 2010 as well as increased benefit costs. Of course the accrual of incentive compensation is subject to company performance.", "There was no discretionary cash incentive compensation accrued in the first quarter of 2009 in order to support our TCE improvement plan.", "Salaries and benefits expense increased 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. In the first quarter of 2010, the primary reason for the significant increase was the impact of prior year\u2019s equity awards.", "Another item affecting the increase in expenses in the first quarter comparison was the 71% increase in other expenses from a very low level in the first quarter of 2009. In that quarter, securities processing costs were abnormally low. ", "Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, other expenses declines 26% due to lower expenses following the cost of a legal settlement in the f fourth quarter of 2009. Also included in other expenses in the first quarter of 2010, was a $25 million benefit for insurance recovery that we received. ", "Transaction processing increased $22 million or 17% compared to the first quarter of 2009 due to higher volumes in asset servicing. No other item in operating expenses increased or declined meaningfully either on a sequential quarter or year over year basis.", "Now let me turn to the investment portfolio. The size of the average investment portfolio in the first quarter increased about $25 billion to $94.8 billion compared to the first quarter of 2009. This increase is due primarily to the consolidation of the conduit assets in May 2009 with a fair value then of approximately $16.6 billion as well as the continuing execution of our reinvestment strategy, offset partially by maturities and the sales of selected securities.", "During the first quarter we invested about $7.3 billion in highly rated securities at an average price of 101.05 and with an average yield of 2.72% and a duration of approximately 2.34 years. Those $7.3 billion are primarily comprised of the following securities, 93% of which are rated AAA; $3.4 billion in agency mortgage backed securities, $2.9 billion in asset backed securities including about $1.3 billion of foreign RNBS, and about $.5 billion backed by credit card receivables, $700 million in student loans and $300 million in auto, $100 million in commercial mortgage backed securities and $900 million in corporate and municipal bonds.", "The aggregate unrealized after tax losses and our available for sale and held to maturity portfolios as of March 31, 2010 were $1.4 billion, an improvement of about $4.4 billion or 75% from March 31, 2009 and an improvement of about $851 million or about 37% from December 31, 2009. These unrealized losses after tax have further improved through last Friday to approximately $1.1 billion.", "In our investment portfolio slide presentation, we have updated the data through quarter end for you to review. As of March 31, 2010, our portfolio was 80.2% AAA or AA rated, similar to December 31, 2009. The duration of the investment portfolio is about 1.27 years, down slightly from the fourth quarter as well as from the first quarter of 2009.", "The increase in the number of downgrades from the fourth quarter resulted primarily from a continuing trend for downgrades in non-U.S. RBS securities as well as further reductions in rating subsequently to those already noted in earlier quarters.", "The amount of discount accretion included in net interest revenue in the first quarter was $212 million. Given the improved financial environment in the first quarter, we reduced our excess liquidity by about $3.9 billion. At period end, our excess liquidity totaled about $19 billion due principally to customer behaviour.", "I will now provide some of the assumptions we used in confirming our 2010 outlook for net interest revenue and net interest margin. We continue to execute on the portfolio reinvestment plan that we adopted in the second half of 2009. We intend to reinvest about 80% to 85% of the approximately $15 billion in assets due to mature or pay down in 2010.", "Of the $7.3 billion that we purchased, $2.3 billion was due to replacing securities that we sold and $5 billion was due to securities maturing or paying down. We intend to continue to invest in highly rated  agency mortgage backed securities and highly rated asset backed securities.", "We expect to invest the acquired customer deposits from the proposed acquisition of Intesa Sanpaolo Securities Services business in Euro denominated sovereign government bonds and bank placements.", "We expect our net interest margin, including the impact of the Intesa acquisition, but excluding conduit discount accretion to be between 150 and 160 basis points on average for the year. We continue to expect the Bank of England rate to remain at 50 basis points for the year and we continue to expect the ECB rate to remain at 100 basis points throughout the rest of the year, and we continue to expect the Fed to keep the overnight Fed funds rate at 25 basis points for all of 2010.", "We further expect earning assets to increase between 6% to 8% from the average in 2009, primarily due to the expected acquisition of Intesa\u2019s Security Services business. We expect the S&P 500 to average about 1125 in 2010, up about 19% from 948 which was the average in 2009.", "Lastly, I\u2019ll review our capital ratios. In the first quarter, State Street Corporation\u2019s capital ratios continued to improve such that as of March 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009, our tier one leverage ratio stood at 9.0%, up from 8.5% and our tier one capital ratio stood at 18.1% up from 17.7%.", "In the first quarter we improved our TCE ratio from 6.6% at December 31, 2009, to 7.5% at March 31, 2010. The majority of this quarterly improvement came from price improvement in the investment portfolio and organic capital generation, and the resulting return on equity on an operating basis, was 10%.", "We expect all of our capital ratios to continue to be strong, including following the anticipated acquisition of Intesa Sanpaolo Securities Services business expected to close later this quarter pending regulatory approval and other closing conditions.", "So in conclusion, we believe we strengthened the company through our actions in 2009. This year we expect to derive benefits from those actions, and we remain highly focuses on executing our plan.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jay to conclude our remarks.", "Joseph Hooley", "Thanks, Ed. So while we remain committed to our long term financial goals, we continue to believe 2010 will be a transition year, a year in which we transition to a more normalized environment. We continue to expect our 2010 operating basis earnings per share to be slightly above the $3.32 operating basis earnings per share in 2009. ", "As I outlined for you in the fourth quarter call in January, I have established a series of objectives that support the achievement of our long term financial goals of 8% to 12% growth in operating revenue, 10% to 15% growth in operating earnings per share, and the achievement of 14% to 17% operating return on equity.", "Fueling the achievement of these objectives which include doubling our non-U.S. revenue over the next five years and expanding our market share is a number of macro trends such as globalization, outsourcing and consolidation.", "We\u2019re well positioned to take advantage of these trends and they are already driving our business today. The organic growth in our core business, combined with the impact of the two acquisitions, Intesa Sanpaolo Security Services business and Mourant International Finance Administration, are expected to fuel our growth in 2010.", "As you may remember from our December announcements of these two transactions, we expected about $100 million in annualized revenues from Mourant and about $425 million in annualized revenue from Intesa Sanpalo. ", "In addition, we expect organic growth in the servicing side to continue from high growth areas such as alternative investments servicing and international markets. Our pipeline is strong with the larger mandates expected to convert over the second half of 2010.", "As I outlined earlier, our core business growth is also supported by our large wins announced last year that are still in the process of conversion. In asset management, State Street Global Advisors continues to position itself to benefit from the increased demand from DC plans and ETF products.", "So while we face some challenges in the short term, I believe we are calibrating the business within a slowly improving environment in order to address these challenges, while positioning State Street for continued growth in the future.", "I look forward to meeting with many of you at our investor and analyst forum which is scheduled for May 5 in New York. ", "And now, Ed and I are happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Ken Usdin \u2013 Bank of America.", "Ken Usdin \u2013 Bank of America", "I\u2019m just wondering if you could help us understand with the onetime leasing gain and then I think you said there was another $25 million benefit this quarter that helped the bottom line earnings. Could you just talk us through how you exactly get from this quarter\u2019s run rate up through the guidance and as part of that, can you help us quantify how much the acquisitions might help on a penny\u2019s basis?", "Edward Resch", "First, in terms of the acquisitions, we said modestly. So that\u2019s probably less than $0.05 for the full year. In terms of the onetime gains, and the benefit that you referred to in the insurance line, we\u2019re including both of those in our comments about the full year guidance.", "However, given what Jay said about the anticipated strengthening in the rest of the year, certainly on the asset servicing side given the pipeline and the installations that are in process, those are significant drivers to our underlying confidence in being able to achieve the full year EPS guidance that we\u2019ve talked about.", "Ken Usdin \u2013 Bank of America", "Would that also include the securities gains as well, like as a likelihood in the future?", "Edward Resch", "Well our comment today are basically reiterating what we said on the fourth quarter call, include the securities gains that we\u2019ve taken through the first quarter yes. It\u2019s really hard to predict and in fact, we don\u2019t budget or forecast securities gains going forward. They\u2019re episodic. They\u2019re based on what the market presents and  how we think about particular securities at a given point in time. So our going forward comments do not include any incremental securities gains in our thinking.", "Ken Usdin \u2013 Bank of America", "My second question is just regarding the net interest margin. You talked to a 150, 160 range with Intesa for the full year. Can you talk about how you exit the year once that\u2019s run rated and also can you just remind us of the impact of rising rates and how that works through?", "Edward Resch", "We actually anticipate the margin to decline a bit as we work through the year based on our assumption that administered rates stay low for most of the year, so I\u2019d expect we\u2019d be toward the lower end of the 150 to 160 range as we exit the year. But the full year we expect to be in that 150 to160 range.", "In terms of the effect of rising rates, we\u2019re still in the same position that we\u2019ve been in for a long time which is that slowly rising rates benefit us, and by slowly rising again, we define that as 25 basis points a quarter on the Fed funds rate.", "Obviously the pace with which the rates increase, the shape of the curve and the path to get from where we are to where we end up is a huge determinate of what the ultimate NIR and NIM performance is, but our expectation is that if in fact rates slowly rise, once the Fed stops increasing rates, we\u2019d see a benefit to both NIR and NIM all else equal.", "Operator", "You're next question comes from Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I know it\u2019s difficult to talk about a normal sec lending revenue line item given how much its moved but are there any bounds you can put around it and maybe within that, when we look at the historical ratio, sec lending revenues to collateral, I think its averaged about 14 basis points over the past decade. Is that still a reasonable ball park to think about has client risk appetites changed sufficiently that somehow structurally different going forward?", "Joseph Hooley", "I think the factors in securities lending, we\u2019ve talked about before but it\u2019s important to repeat them. One is the on loan balances. You\u2019ve seen the customers continue to support securities lending as a means to increase yield for their portfolios. We saw some pick up quarter to quarter in that.", "The second factor is the Fed fund, the three month LIBOR rate, and while in the fourth quarter we thought we had troughed, we down a little bit lower although recently that ratio has come up close to 30 basis points, so we\u2019ve seen some improvement in that.", "I would say on the customers risk profile, we haven\u2019t see a lot of desire to go out and get more riskier in the collateral investments and I assume, just an assumption that over time as people get comfortable with some of the income generated from securities lending based on spreads widening out a bit that you\u2019ll see over time some more risk taking. ", "But it\u2019s hard to know where that\u2019s going to get to, although it does feel like we\u2019re once again at a trough.", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "If I could follow up on the comments about the strong dollar impact, you have as we look at Page 14 in your supplement just what the headwind was from the dollar on AUC or AUM or both?", "Edward Resch", "A good proxy for that would be to look at the impact on the servicing fee line of the strong dollar which was about 1%, so in the range of a little less than $10 million for the quarter.", "Operator", "You're next question comes from Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I have a question on the securities formerly known as conduit. Could you give us a sense of the time for these to roll off as the portfolio is currently composed and then could you also give us some color on how you decided what you were going to sell and just so we can get a sense as to whether or not you\u2019re going to continue to do that going forward.", "Edward Resch", "In terms of the conduit, we still are of the view that about two-thirds of the discount accretion will come back in the first five years subsequent to consolidation, so we\u2019re almost a year post consolidation. So that\u2019s still valid, and that\u2019s a proxy obviously for the maturity or the expected maturities of those conduit securities.", "The remaining one-third though will take a fair amount of time. I think you should be thinking about it in terms of seven, eight, nine years out depending on the ultimate performance of the securities.", "How we think about the sales of conduit securities is really two-fold. One, it\u2019s a question of market prices, and we\u2019ve obviously had a pretty strong rally over the last couple of quarters in the fixed income markets and we\u2019ve seen some securities that we think have been traded above what our view of fair value for them is, so they\u2019re a potential candidate.", "Secondly, we look at the securities in the conduit that are in that favorable position and decide whether or not the gain that we could generate is appropriate given the amount of foregone discount accretion that such a sale would generated. And in the first quarter in total as I said, we gave up undiscounted $140 million of future discount accretion, and we booked $100 million roughly of gains on those securities, and we thought that on a net present value basis, that made a lot of sense for us to do.", "And lastly, we look at it from the standpoint of risk reduction. The conduit securities as you may recall in general were of lower credit quality than the investment portfolio \u2013 still pretty high quality but not up the level of the investment portfolio. Some of those securities on a risk reduction basis, we decided to sell in the first quarter.", "So you put all three of those things together, and that\u2019s how we think about it. Going forward, it\u2019s hard to say. We don\u2019t have any plan as I said in response to an earlier question, to necessarily sell any legacy portfolio securities or conduit securities. It\u2019s episodic. It\u2019s based on the market events and our view of those credits and those securities at that time.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "So you did what you though \u2013 so based on the market you do what you wanted to do for first quarter. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re parsing this out over time.", "Edward Resch", "No. It\u2019s really opportunistic and again, as I said, based on the discount accretion give up and our view of potential risk reduction to the overall portfolio.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Separately on expense ratio, I think you touched on this in your prepared comments, but maybe just give us a little bit of color as to how much of the expense ratio hike this quarter is pre-investing for some of the flows you\u2019re anticipating coming in and if there\u2019s any kind of guidance or color as to what you are expecting to manage your expense ratio to going forward.", "Edward Resch", "I would say that the expense level that we ran at in the first quarter were generally in line with the overall business levels that we\u2019ve seen. I can\u2019t point to anything that is getting ahead of something or make an investment in anticipation of something. I\u2019d say it\u2019s kind of a steady state level of investment. ", "We\u2019re running our technology budget in line with what we expected which was in the range of 20% to 25% of operating expenses for the full year in the quarter. The big driver in terms of expenses in the first quarter was the incentive comp accrual which we talked about again, year over year and sequentially.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "So that should normalize as you go into the second quarter.", "Edward Resch", "Yes.", "Operator", "You're next question comes from Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS.", "Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS", "On FX was down a little bit but I thought the active trader segment was reasonably active and I\u2019m just curious how current X performed versus whatever you\u2019d call the core business.", "Joseph Hooley", "Ed can give you the specifics but you\u2019re right. The electronic trading volumes continue to be pretty robust. ", "Edward Resch", "On a volume basis, which is a good indication, sequential quarter current X showed volume increase of 11%, year over year about 64%. So pretty robust.", "Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS", "I guess the answer is it\u2019s not a big enough piece of the pie to fully offset.", "Edward Resch", "That\u2019s true.", "Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS", "I apologize if you disclosed earlier, but did you say anything about flows in asset management?", "Joseph Hooley", "We said flows sequentially were slightly down Q4 to Q1, and year over year we\u2019re up 15%.", "Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS", "Weighted on EPS side?", "Joseph Hooley", "Really a mix. I\u2019d say what we\u2019ve seen in the first quarter is a little bit of a slow down on the passive side which ran at pretty high levels last year. A little slow down passive. ETF continues to grow nicely. Cash has slowed down a little bit.", "What we\u2019ve started to see, one of the asset classes that has been slow or underperforming for the last couple of years for the whole industry is active quant and we\u2019ve started to see some early signs of improvement in that asset class which is encouraging, but more or less it\u2019s the passive, still but slow down ETF continuing, cash slow down a little bit and started to see signs of life in some of the active strategies.", "Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS", "There\u2019s obviously a lot of tension in CVLM these days. I\u2019m curious if you can just give us a reminder of what role you play as collateral manager, how big, how many deals and how, what level of involvement you\u2019ve had with the ongoing sweeping investigations for CVLM.", "Joseph Hooley", "As far as CVO\u2019s, we\u2019re not a sponsor. We don\u2019t structure CVO\u2019s, nor  do we sell CVO\u2019s to investors so might surmise that that\u2019s where most of the interest is. We do act as a collateral manager with respect to CVO\u2019s. We do that only unaffiliated sponsors, and if you were to look at that, I think it\u2019s about $2 billion that we act as a collateral manager for, but again, we don\u2019t sponsor, structure or sell CVO\u2019s.", "Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS", "Are any of those that you\u2019re a collateral manager going through any high level investigation with the regulators?", "", "Joseph Hooley", "No.", "Glenn Schorr \u2013 UBS", "FX lawsuit \u2013 is there an update? Have there been others, and I\u2019m specifically asking is there an update on the California one, the one in Washington and have there been others brought since?", "Joseph Hooley", "No real update. California we consider as ongoing litigation. As we pointed out I think previously as well as in the regulatory filings we\u2019ve had a handful of inquiries from other Attorneys General that have just been increased. Haven\u2019t turned anything that\u2019s worth of reporting, so I would say kind of no change from prior quarter.", "Operator", "You're next question comes from Howard Chen \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Howard Chen \u2013 Credit Suisse", "A follow up on securities funding. Where are we in the discussion of sec lending gates being lowered and how do you think about that with respect to the broader asset servicing competitive landscape?", "Joseph Hooley", "I would say that as you\u2019d expect, the net asset values of the underlying collateral pools have improved substantially. I think in aggregate north of $0.99 right now, so good improvement. We\u2019ve always maintained a practice of allowing people to exit for normal course events, paying dividends, things like that, and we\u2019re working through, as is I think the industry, how we lower those gates in a way that gives customers more liquidity and does it in a measured way.", "Howard Chen \u2013 Credit Suisse", "On the conduit, can you speak to how much capital that business is tying up today and your expectations more long term for staying or not staying within that business? Just trying to get a feel for whether that capital comes back to the shareholders etc.", "Edward Resch", "We\u2019re really not in the conduit business post consolidation. We do in fact have securities issued, asset backed commercial paper issued which is a very attractive source of funding for us, and as long as it continues to be that, we\u2019ll continue to do it. But that\u2019s more of a just a legal mechanic where we are issuing through the conduit. So we don\u2019t consider that as a business akin to what we had before we consolidated.", "In terms of the capital, I would say a good way to think about it is probably to think about it in TCE and apply 5% against the consolidated assets, so round terms, probably $750 million to $800 million, but that\u2019s more a function of just the capital supporting that element of the conduit securities that are now in the portfolio.", "So I think the overall capital question is really a function of how our balance sheet grows and what we do on the asset side in terms of investing those customer deposits ultimately.", "Howard Chen \u2013 Credit Suisse", "To follow up on capital, clearly it continues to build very nicely. Just hoping to get your latest thoughts on  how you hope to manage that over time and maybe one thing that you have started to do again is start to look at acquisitions, so maybe outlook for further acquisitions.", "Joseph Hooley", "You\u2019re right, we do continue to build capital and anticipate we\u2019ll continue to. We said, and I continue to believe that a priority is to reinstate the dividend. Now we\u2019re I think all in a place where we\u2019re looking for a little more guidance from regulators. We would hope to get some further clarity on that by the end of the year, but that\u2019s pending.", "So that aside, I guess the use of capital, I\u2019ve said before and I continue to believe that particularly in the asset servicing business that we\u2019ll see further consolidation and you continue to see evidence of that, not just in our acquisitions but in other acquisitions made within the industry.", "I think if you play out the capital story, particularly in places like Europe as capital levels are clarified with regard to the banking industry, I think you\u2019re likely to see more non core custody businesses come up for sale. So I continue to believe that one good deployment of future capital will be acting on consolidation in the asset servicing industry.", "We always look at that assuming post insight from regulators that we  have excess capital vis a vis share buy backs. So those are the three dimensions, and I think given as a priority, I think acquisition is still an active part of our strategy which I think will play out over the next several years and share buyback is obviously the other alternative.", "Operator", "You're next question comes from Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "Can you clarify the unrealized securities losses are where now and where were they at the end of the quarter and how it improved so much? Have I got the numbers right?", "Edward Resch", "As of last Friday, they were at $1.1 billion after tax and as of the end of the quarter, March, it was $1.4 billion after tax.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "Why are you still comfortable earning $3.32 core for this year or more because if you take your number and you stripped out securities gains, you could be instead of $0.75 you could be $0.65 and you have to get $0.85 for the last three quarters so how do we get from $0.65 excluding securities gains up to an $0.85 number for the last three quarters. You said acquisitions could add a few cents, but you said the incentive comp accruals, that goes down so that\u2019s two factors. Could you just outline the other reasons. And if you\u2019re not comfortable you could always lower your guidance now.", "Joseph Hooley", "I think the confidence largely is anchored around the core business story. The core business, servicing asset management, I think between the backlog of installation, the current period sales which I referenced $155 billion in assets that we have closed just this month, combined with prospective view of pipeline, gives us good confidence in the momentum of the core business.", "Added to the that the acquisitions both Mourant which is closed and Intesa which we anticipate closing this quarter, give us good confidence and good sense that core revenues will run well through the course of the year.", "So that\u2019s really the anchor for confidence in the revenue line. We also \u2013 Ed pointed out, it\u2019s worth mentioning again, that in the market driven revenues securities finance and foreign exchange, we would expect some improvement in those lines toward the back end of the year based on in the case of foreign exchange, I think you could look to segments like mutual funds.", "As mutual fund investors move more towards equities and cross border equities, we would expect to see some positive reflection in foreign exchange. In securities lending, we\u2019ve seen some recent improvements and spreads.", "So it\u2019s really anchored around the core with some anticipated improvement toward the back end of the year and market revenues, and good control on expenses.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "You\u2019re confident you\u2019ll exceed the $3.32 for this year. We shouldn\u2019t look for revision downward at your investor day in a couple of months?", "Joseph Hooley", "Based on what we know today and the things that I just mentioned we are confident and at the investor day in May, we\u2019ll push that out a little further not only in multiple years but also give you a little more sense of current year.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "What\u2019s your confidence that this quarter marks the low point for the year? I mean first quarter is kind of the low point if we strip out securities gains, are you super confident that it only gets better from here?", "Joseph Hooley", "I think the only thing I would say is that when you look at some of the core revenues the quarter to quarter flatness, I would expect, I think that\u2019s more of a timing issue, so if you look at that as timing, that\u2019s one way to project forward.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "Foreign exchange, are you losing market there or what\u2019s going on?", "Joseph Hooley", "We don\u2019t believe we are. That\u2019s a hard metric to follow given the breadth of the market, but we continue not to see an effect of a lawsuit, if that is where your question is going. It\u2019s more a matter of volumes and volatility and cross border asset flows.", "Operator", "You're next question comes from Brian Bedell \u2013 ISI Group.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 ISI Group", "Just to zone in on the servicing fees a little bit more granularly. Flat this quarter. I understand you\u2019ve been installing business and I think you do expect that to take longer. Are you referring mostly to the Morgan Stanley piece?", "Joseph Hooley", "I think in the fourth quarter we reported $500 billion, in that range of new business on the servicing side. There tends to be some lumpy deals, some big deals that have characteristics that require multi-quarter installations, Morgan Stanley being among those.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 ISI Group", "Should we in layering that in, in the model for 2010 where I think before we were thinking about a first half installation, basically complete by the second quarter, would you say this is now coming in more during, over the course of the entire year?", "Joseph Hooley", "I would look at the \u201909 sales as coming in more in the second and third quarter. We talked about the deals closed in the first quarter and then those in April which are more than $300 billion, so those should layer in through the remaining quarters of the year.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 ISI Group", "The $155 billion that you just mentioned about this month, is that in addition to the $164 billion?", "", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes it is. I just figured I\u2019d give the significance even though it\u2019s after quarter end, but in the month it\u2019s worth mentioning.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 ISI Group", "That\u2019s new, asset servicing business won, is that correct?", "", "Joseph Hooley", "Correct.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 ISI Group", "On the management fee line I would have expected that to go up a little bit given your big passive fixed income win in the fourth quarter, but were there more performance fees, I\u2019m sorry less performance fees in the first quarter versus fourth quarter?", "Joseph Hooley", "That was the big factor there, the performance fees, less in the first quarter.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 ISI Group", "I guess if we could talk about obviously securities lending will pick up in the second quarter from a seasonal aspect. Do you expect seasonal tax albatross season to help the second quarter, is that correct?", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes we do.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 ISI Group", "Going on to the expenses, on the comp line, if we could just talk a little bit more about how we see that going forward. I calculate about a 44% comp to revenue ratio and the denominator of that is stripping out the securities gain and stripping out discount accretion with which I assume you\u2019re not paying compensation on. So we\u2019re at a 44% level and I know you had said in the past you kind of target around a 40% level. Should we expect it to revert back to that starting in the second quarter or are we operating at a higher level for awhile?", "Edward Resch", "Our expectation for the year is in that 40% range, and that\u2019s full year comp to revenue, a little bit higher. We included the securities gains, I included the securities gains in the calculation for the first quarter, but I would say for the full year our expectation is to be in that 40% range as we have been in prior years.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 ISI Group", "So we should see a sequential decline in comp absent the acquisition of course.", "Edward Resch", "Yes.", "Brian Bedell \u2013 ISI Group", "In thinking about the full  year $3.32 plus guidance, sounds like obviously the Intesa business is much higher operating profit margin than your core business. That should help. Should we think about Mourant as similar on the operating margin equation? I know it\u2019s much smaller.", "Edward Resch", "I gave an answer to an earlier question in the call which was that in terms of EPS, I said both of those should be thought of as being in the range of 5% or so, $0.05 or so excuse me, for the year. That\u2019s what we meant by modestly accretive.", "Operator", "You're next question comes from Greg Ketron \u2013 Citigroup.", "Greg Ketron \u2013 Citigroup", "I know you\u2019ve been talking about this in bits and pieces through the call, but when you look back at 2009 you had about $1.1 trillion in assets under custody and as you look at this year, it sounds like you\u2019ve got some good early successes this year plus installations that come online. Any sense for what that number could be? Are your expectations similar to that, more or less for 2010?", "Joseph Hooley", "The $1.1 trillion just to be clear was business won versus business installed and then again, the $168 billion and $165 billion year to date would be business won not installed, so there\u2019s some difference between that.", "One thing I can point to is that I think we continue to be well placed to look to outsourcing more middle office, more back office that we continue to see investment management firms in particular, consolidating with single providers, so given our position, I think we\u2019ve evidence, we\u2019ve talked about Legg Mason for instance moving their U.K. business to us.", "So I think between consolidating positions with customers, a deeper level of outsourcing, combined with continued robust activity outside of the U.S., and alternatives, which the alternative story is one of growth, but it\u2019s also one of I think some regulatory and client pressure pushing more alternative mangers to outsource to a third party, all give us pretty good confidence that we\u2019re in a zone where there\u2019s quite a bit of activity going on, and I think competitively we\u2019re pretty well positioned and we do a good job when a piece of business is up for bid and succeeding with it.", "So I can\u2019t give you a number but I can give you a sense that I think that the trends that have brought us the $1.1 trillion last year and the $300 billion this year continue in place.", "Greg Ketron \u2013 Citigroup", "On the Intesa deal, when you look at future revenue enhancement opportunities and I know you\u2019ve talked about your existing client base, maybe having 16 or 17 different products that they buy from State Street, do you look at Intesa in the same way and if you do does it look like there\u2019s potential opportunity to increase the number of products substantially as you work through that deal?", "Joseph Hooley", "Absolutely. It\u2019s a trend whether it was IBT or Deutsche Bank or IFS, once we go in and start to deal with the customers, in this case the Intesa acquisition, we\u2019re likely to find multiple ways we can cross sell or expand those relationships, so we do view that as one of the values in the acquisition.", "Greg Ketron \u2013 Citigroup", "Is there any number that you put on the potential revenue enhancement over the $425 million revenue base?", "Joseph Hooley", "I think it\u2019s early. We\u2019ve got some exposure to the customers, but it will take some time to mention that. I would expect it to be not unlike the Deutsche acquisition or IDT though.", "Kelley MacDonald", "Phyllis, we need to conclude.", "Operator", "Thank you.

(Operator instructions). Now, I\u2019d like to introduce Kelly McDonald, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations at State Street.", "Kelly McDonald", "Thank you. Before Jay Hooley, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Ed Resch, our Chief Financial Officer begin their remarks, I\u2019d like to remind you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in State Street's 2009 annual report on Form 10-K and its subsequent filings with the SEC.", "We encourage you to review those filings including the sections on risk factors concerning any forward-looking statements we make today. Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of today, October 19, 2010 and the corporation does not undertake to revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after today.", "I'd also like to remind you that you can find slide presentation regarding the corporation's investment portfolio as well as our third quarter earnings press release which includes reconciliations of non-GAAP measures referred to on this webcast in the investor relations portion of our website.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jay.", "Jay Hooley", "Thanks Kelly and good morning. Strength and servicing fee and good cost controls drove results of the third quarter. We achieved operating basis earnings per share of $0.86, which was an increase of 21% compared with $0.71 in the third quarter of last year, and down modestly from the very strong second quarter of this year. Based on our new wins and strong pipeline, we expect the momentum in service fee revenue to continue.", "In asset management, we continue to experience growth and passes in income oriented ETF products as investors continue to remain conservative. Additionally, the impact of the Intesa and Mourant acquisitions, which closed last quarter, supported our strong revenue growth. I\u2019ll make a few comments about our performance and I\u2019ll ask Ed to provide a more detailed financial perspective and after that we\u2019ll open the call to your questions.", "From an operating basis, comparing the results of the third quarter with the third quarter of 2009, total revenue increased 8.4% and total expenses increased 3.1%. As a result, we achieved 530 basis points of positive operating leverage. Total revenue in the quarter declined less than 1% from the second quarter of 2010, which I think is a good achievement given the cyclical strength of the second quarter results and the weakness in the worldwide trading markets.", "Our servicing fee revenue increased 19% from the third quarter of last year and was up 3% from the second quarter of this year, reflecting the impact of the acquisitions and the installations of last year\u2019s large wins as well as new business wins of January.", "As I said in the second quarter conference call, the large Morgan Stanley mandate is now fully included in the run rate for the third quarter. We converted the state of New Jersey in the third quarter and are just now converting the state of Ohio.", "Year-to-date, as of September 3, 2010, we added 1.1 trillion of new servicing mandates. We\u2019ve already installed about 286 billion of those and expect to install about 800 billion in the fourth quarter and into 2011. This pace of wins and installs gives us confidence in the strength of our servicing fee revenue. We\u2019ve added new business pipelines. We have active business pipelines with particular strength outside of the US in our alternative investment servicing business. The acquisition of Intesa Sanpaolo Securities Services business and Mourant International Finance Administration are on track to meet our expectations for the year and contributed modestly to our financial results for the quarter, excluding the merger and acquisition integration costs.", "We\u2019re optimistic that our market-leading position in Italy will lead to cross-sell opportunities and new mandates from Italian clients. The revenue from our asset management business declined slightly both from last year\u2019s third quarter and this year\u2019s second quarter. This decline was due primarily to a continuous movement out of active strategies and into passive and ETF strategies. Although net new business at SSgA was slightly negative in the quarter, down 3 billion, flows into passive and ETFs were positive, offset by negative flows from cash, largely from our securities lending business. As expected, trading services revenue declined from a year ago quarter due to weak volumes in worldwide trading markets. The sequential quarterly decline in trading services revenue was principally due to the servicing strength in the second quarter. Demand has not returned to the securities finance markets.", "In addition this quarter, the spread between Fed fund and 3 month LIBOR declined from both a year ago third quarter and the second quarter of 2010, negatively affecting revenue.

Compared to the third quarter of 2009, salaries and benefits expenses increased at a slower rate than a growth of an operating basis revenue. And compared to the second quarter, salaries and benefits were essentially flat excluding the $41million dollar reduction in incentive compensation related to securities finance required in the second quarter.", "Let me share our view on the current economic environment and the outlook for our business. Although we continue to believe the economy in the United States will improve, recovery appears to be somewhat anemic and is affected by the uncertainly in Europe. Market economists are forecasting real annual GDP growth in United States of about 2.3% for the fourth quarter of 2010, a slight decline from the earlier outlook.

This morning I\u2019ll review three areas \u2013 first, the results of the third quarter, second the investment portfolio as well as our outlook for management\u2019s margin in 2010, and third a review of a string capital position. This morning, all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today\u2019s earnings news release.", "Comparing the third quarter of 2010 with the third quarter of 2009, servicing free revenue increased 19% primarily due to impact of the two acquisitions, new business and increases in daily average equity market valuations. Management fee revenue declined 3% primarily due to the mixed of business as investors increasingly chose passive or ETF investment strategies. Compared to the second quarter, our servicing free revenue increased by 3% and operating basis management revenue was up to 10%. Asset management revenue declined slightly by 2% due to the continuing shift in business mix to favor passive investing strategies.", "Providing further details on the trading services and securities finance lines, foreign exchange revenue declined 30% compared to the third quarter of 2009 and 42% compared to the second quarter of 2010 with both declines due to lower volatilities and slightly lower volumes. Trading markets were significantly weaker than we expected. Brokerage and other revenue, which was reported as part of trading services revenue, increased about 3% compared to the third quarter of 2009 primarily due to increases in electronic trading and transition management, but was down 14% compared to the second quarter of 2010 due principally to lower revenue from both of these areas.", "Securities on loan average $382 billion for the third quarter of 2010 down $17 billion compared with $399 billion for the third quarter of 2009, and down $39 billion compared with $421 billion for the second quarter. Compared to the second quarter, securities finance revenue declined from $109 million to $68 million primarily due to seasonality on the second quarter, a lower low of demand and the compression in the average spread between Fed funds and three-month LIBOR. This average spread decline to 19 basis points in the third quarter compared to 24 basis points in the second quarter of 2010. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, revenue also declined from $105 million due primarily to compression of six basis points in the average spread between Fed fund and three-month LIBOR.", "Average lendable assets to the third quarter of 2010 were about $2.2 trillion flat with the second quarter of 2010 and up about 5% from $2.1 trillion in the third quarter of 2009.

Compared to the second quarter 2010, processing and other fee revenue of 71 million dollars decreased 18% due to primarily to lower revenue from tax advantage investment and was up 58% in the third quarter of 2009 due to the impact of higher fees from structured products. Operating basis management revenues increased about 20% from the third quarter of 2009 to the higher yield investment portfolio following the adjustment of the composition of our US treasury securities position in the second quarter as well as the full quarter impact of the Intesa acquisition.

In the third quarter of 2010, we recorded about $91million in net gains from sales of available for sales securities and separately about $74 million of other then temporary impairments resulting in $17 million of net gains related to investment securities. The OTTI was primarily due to the increase as expected future credit losses from US non agency mortgage back securities.", "To recap where we are relative to future this kind of creation, we recorded $189 million of this kind of creation on the third quarter of 2010, so we now expect about $3.6 billion in this kind of creation to accrue into interest revenue although the remaining lines of the former conduit assets.

Other expenses declined 15% from the third quarter of 2009 primarily due to the impact of a $50 million insurance recovery. Expenses in the third quarter of 2010 increased 35 from the second quarter of 2010, primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits. Salaries and benefits expense increased 55 compared to the second quarter of 2010 due primarily to the impact of the $41 million reduction in incentive compensation in the second quarter of 2010 related to the securities finance charge as well as the full quarter impact of the cost associated with the Intesa employees. Of course the accrual for compensation is subject to company performances.", "Information systems and communication expense increased $16 million or 10% compared to the third quarter of 2009 and was up $7milion or 4% from the second quarter of 2010 both to the full quarter impact of the Intesa acquisition. Transaction processing increased 11% from the third quarter of 2009 due to the impact of the two acquisitions and increased about 1% compared to the second quarter of 2010 due to higher transaction volumes. Other expenses increased 2% from the second quarter of 2010 due to primarily to increases in securities processing cost, offset partially by a higher level of recoveries. Our operating basis tax rates for the third quarter is 28.1% in line with our previous outlook and down from 29.1% in the second quarter of 2010 due to changes in the geographic mix of our earnings.", "Now, I\u2019ll return to the investment portfolio. Our average investment portfolio in the third quarter increased about 16% to $98.2 billion dollars compared to the third quarter of 2009. This increase is due primarily to the continuing execution of our reinvestment strategy, offset partially by maturity and sales of selective securities. During the third quarter, we invested about $4.7 billion in highly rated securities at an average price of 99.73 with an average yield of 2.07% and a duration of approximately 1.28 years. Those $4.7 billion are primarily composed of the following securities \u2013 89% of which are rated AAA, $1 billion on agency mortgage back securities, $200 million in non-agency mortgage back securities, $3 billion in assets back securities including about $800 million of foreign RMB which are mostly UK and Dutch issues, and about $1.2 billion in student loans.

The duration gap of the entire balance sheet as of September 30, 2010 is 0.32 years down slightly from 0.34 years at June 30 of 2010. The number of downgrades from major rating agencies slowed from the level experienced in the second quarter. The majority of the downgrades was in non agency asset back and mortgage aback asset classes.", "I will now provide some of the assumptions we used in determining or turning an outlook for net interest revenue from net interest margin. We continue to believe we should invest through the cycle and to invest in highly rated agency, mortgage back securities and highly rated assets back securities. Following the acquisition of the Intesa business , given the uncertainly in Europe, we decided to leave the majority of the acquired customer deposits primarily in the ECB as we continue monitor market conditions in the Euro zone.", "As a result of this investigation to invest in certain US treasuries during the second quarter as well as reflecting the strength of the first three quarters of 2010, we now expect a net interest margin in 2010 for the full year excluding conduit excluding discount accretion to be slightly above the higher end range of 155 to 165 basis points that we disclosed last quarter. We expect this outlook to be supported by the higher yields that we earn on the recent treasury security purchases, slower pre-payment speeds, and a slightly smaller average balance sheet.", "We continue to expect the Bank of England rate to remain at 55 basis points for the rest of the year, the ECB rate to remain at 100 basis points for the rest of the year, and the Fed to keep your overnight Fed funds rate at 25 basis points for all 2010. We expect the SMP 500 to average about 1125 in 2010 up about 19% from 948 which was the average in 2009.", "Finally, I\u2019ll review our capital ratios. In the third quarter State Street Corporation\u2019s capital ratios remain string. As of September 30 of 2010, our TIER 1 leverage ratio stood at 8.3%, our TIER 1 capital ratio stood at 15.8% and our tangible common equity ratio was 6.9%.", "So in conclusion, we\u2019re pleased with our operating basis results for the third quarter. Despite continued weakness in our trading results, and given the strength of our core business and the slight increase in net average margin, continue to expect our operating basis earnings per share for the year to be slightly above with the adjusted operating basis, $3.32 per share recorded in 2009.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jay to conclude our remarks.", "Jay Hooley", "Thanks, Ed. In the face of weak trading markets, the achievement of revenue growth compared to last year\u2019s third quarter confirmed to the strength of our strategy. In addition of performance of the third quarter compared to second demonstrates our ability to calibrate expenses against revenue. Very importantly, our service team momentum continue reflecting the client management of first three quarters of 2010.", "As I mentioned the acquisitions are preceding in line with expectations, together they modestly created an equally important, both are contributing new clients to State Street to whom we can sell additional services. In asset management, State Street Global advisors continues to position itself to benefit from the increase to man from past strategies, ETF investment and defying contribution plans.", "Looking to the future, if the economic recovery remains anemic and the trading markets continue to be weak, our industry will face continued challenges in market sensitive business. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with our performances in the third quarter particularly given a week in this trading market. The growth of our core servicing business, the contribution of our two acquisitions as well as improvement in the net interest revenue, we enforced our confidence in achieving operating basis earnings per share slightly above the adjusted operating basis level of $3.32 in 2009.", "Now, Ed and I are happy to take your question.", "Question-and-Answer session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions). Your first question is from the line of Howard Chen of Credit Suisse.", "Howard Chen - Credit Suisse", "Good morning Jay, good morning Ed.", "Jay Hooley", "Good morning, Howard.", "Howard Chen - Credit Suisse", "Jay, just a longer-term question to begin with. You have alluded to the opportunity that the current financial services reform may bring to asset servicing, maybe akin to what we have seen in the past with middle office outsourcing. Could you just give us a flavor for what \u2013 as we get more clarity here, what maybe fits in that bucket? Where are we in that conversation with potential customers? And maybe how you've framed that opportunity longer term?", "Jay Hooley", "Sure, Howard. How they do that. As you know, the regulatory reform led by Dodd-Frank is far by finalized review as a framework, although it is pointing to few things. I would say, the most tangible thing that we\u2019re focused on right now that could result for an opportunity would be some of the movement to immobilize certain securities most notably their evidence. Do if you look at some of the derivative regulation and the expectation at some large percent of over the counter derivatives will be forced to be cleared to central count of parties.", "We view that as something that\u2019s interesting. We think somebody like stage three that the processing oriented bank might be able to play a role there. So I would say that\u2019s the narrowest thing that we\u2019re focused on right now. I would say, the other thing that worth paying attention to is I think some of this regulation depending on how it gets ultimately needed out could result to become meaningful shift in non-trust bank sectors and whether or not that provided opportunities for the trust and custody side of the business, is yet to be determined.", "Howard Chen - Credit Suisse", "Okay, thanks. And then switching gears, I appreciate all the comments on Basel III and you know your view of being compliant. Risk-adjusted capital seems really, really strong. Do you see longer term having to change anything to your liquidity and leverage profile for what the Basel committee has suggested so far?", "Jay Hooley", "You know, I just repeat what I said before and maybe Ed come way in here. I think it is very positive that the BASEL committee has started to clarify and I think we all expect that in Korea next month, we\u2019ll see the global standards for BASEL III be finalized, and then I hoped and expect that the US regulators will move swiftly to interpret what that means in this country. I don\u2019t know if Ed would add anything with regards I think the question more on liquidity.", "Ed Resch", "Yeah, I just tackle which he said basically which is that I think so far we\u2019ve received a lot of clarity which was good. But we haven\u2019t received certainty in terms of some of the rules. Really, until we can work through all those part of requirements, I think it\u2019s a little premature to give specific comment on aspects of BASEL III. But, I broadly agree with what Jay said. We\u2019ll obviously have to work through the effects on us as we get more clarity in terms to the final rules.", "Howard Chen - Credit Suisse", "Okay, understood. Then Ed, on the NIM, appreciate the guidance for 2010, but just qualitatively how do you think about the opportunity to put more of that liquidity to work on the asset side and any further flexibility on the funding side as to what you showed this quarter?", "Ed Resch", "Well, you know we\u2019re still over view that we should continue investing through the cycle. We think of ourselves as being opportunistic in terms of taking some games which we\u2019ve done this year as well as selling out some securities that we feel are possibly a little weaker. So, we\u2019ve been a little more aggressive there this year as the market as presented certain opportunities. Generally, I\u2019d say that we\u2019re still in a pretty conservative mindset only investing at the top of this back, investing in some US treasuries as I mentioned in the second quarter and I talked about it today. We\u2019re comfortable with all liquidity position. I think overall, there\u2019s a possibility that the balance sheet could move a little bit to a smaller size that\u2019s customer reinvent conservatively in the market. We see in a little bit moving out in the customer deposits and that money being put back to work which relinquish overall a good thing. I think we\u2019re comfortable of where we are Howard, and I don\u2019t really don\u2019t really see us changing much on the way of philosophy. There are on the liability studies to move forward.", "Howard Chen - Credit Suisse", "Okay, thanks. Then just a quick numbers one, Ed -- and apologies if I missed this in the release. Could you just quantify the size of the insurance recovery within this quarter's results, and any further outlook there that you have on that?", "Ed Resch", "Five-zero. That was 5-0 in the quarter Howard. And as far as outlook goes, it\u2019s significantly premature to say, I mean we are pursuing various claims that we feel are valid claims coming out of some fo the things of the last couple of years. But no comments are worth mentioning right now because I don\u2019t have anything concrete.", "Howard Chen - Credit Suisse", "Okay, thanks so much for taking the questions.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr  of Nomura Securities.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities", "Hi, thanks very much. Numbers question on the average balance sheet. So I appreciate the detail you gave us on the purchases that you've made with the yield of I think you said in the range of 2.07%. How does the -- in the investment securities portfolio -- the average yield for treasury and agency securities go up by almost 30 basis points when your purchases are made below that? Is there a lot of stuff running off? ", "Ed Resch", "No Glenn, it\u2019s mainly due to repositioning of the treasury element of the portfolio that we did in the second quarter.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities", "How do you mind reminding us of how big that was?", "Ed Resch", "Yeah, that was $8 billion where we move from bills which were yielding about 17 basis points into a laddered structure of T-notes with average duration of less than five years, about four and three quarter years. So we picked up from 17 basis points up to about 200 basis points by doing that in the second quarter. That the driver of the increase.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities", "Okay, cool, I get it. And then did you -- I apologize if I missed it. Did you give us any color on flows inside SSgA, both the active and passive side?", "Jay Hooley", "We did and if I can give you a little bit of color, Glenn. I mentioned broadly the borader trends are we still see close out of that in past. Cash is down in the quarter largely because of the securities lending collateral pool investments. But I think the number to use for the quarter with 25 billion in net inflows into passed of ETF products to give you some color. So, cash down quantitative through passive an ETF up with generally the trends in the market place ad active down.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities", "Active was an outflow?", "Jay Hooley", "Active passive.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities", "Understood. And on the passive and ETF side, there was -- I guess that was actually building momentum over the last couple of quarters. You seeing it. $25 billion is a nice number. Do you still see that pipeline and those forward conversations building? And is there -- is it picking up outside the US, as I see it?", "Jay Hooley", "I would say steady that is the move into passive has come off a bit last year and early this year. But I\u2019d say pretty steady and I don\u2019t think I distinguish you as non-US. I think that market place is looking for some departure point of confidence, but right now I\u2019d say there\u2019s still a fair amount of money going to obey the strategies and where the recipient or what the beneficiary of that.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities", "Thanks very much.", "Jay Hooley", "Welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Robert Lee of KBW.", "Robert Lee - KBW", "First I'd like to start maybe with some of the new -- the $477 billion of new business wins. Maybe get a little bit more color on the components of that. For example, you know, how much of that was cross-sell existing clients versus new clients? Maybe US versus global? Just trying to get a better feel for some of the places that's coming from.", "Jay Hooley", "Let me, I think it\u2019s consistent with the past. You can look at 7030 mix as far as the existing customer expansion versus new customer acquisition is generally in line with what the make up for the 477 would be. And well diversified. Now, US \u2013 non-US but you know cut for the vertical segment. If I would appoint to distinguishing traits of that pipeline, it would be the fall in one and I mentioned that in my remarks, one is we can clearly see, this proportion opportunities broadly in the alternative sector. And that\u2019s not only coming from new funds, new assets but it\u2019s coming from as you hedges on as one example, hedge funds determining that they would outsource previously in towards activities. The other distinguishing traits or trend within the pipeline and this is the point where I think we continue to be differentiated in the market place is the bigger deals almost all have middle office component. So we continue to see significant demand in the integrated solution which include the middle office, I think a place where we continue to look different than other competitors in the market. So those two things aside geographically pretty well diversified, also pretty diversified across large and small customer segments.", "Robert Lee - KBW", "Okay. And one of the things I think a lot of investors sometimes struggle with, you have these positive -- these good new business trends, but in trying to get a feel for what that translates -- could potentially translate into for kind of net new revenues, means which -- maybe to venture a number out there, if we're looking at $477 billion of net new wins, should we be thinking that, all else equal, that's $50 million in annualized revenue? Or how should we be thinking of that?", "Jay Hooley", "Given that the diversity of the mix, we tried to put a number. What I tried to do is to try to give you a little sense of implementation progress as a means to try to give you a some sense of how these assets translate to revenues. So, I think we\u2019ve got 287 of 1.1 trillion that has been installed, a good part of that in that in the third quarter, later in the third quarter. And the other is another 800 still in which we\u2019ll ladder in fourth quarter, first quarter which kind of big implementation quarters in the beginning of 2011. So, probably the closest that I can do give you some sense of how new commitments become revenues.", "Robert Lee - KBW", "Appreciate it. Then one last question, going back capital and Basel III. I understand the -- until things are completely finalized, the reluctance to kind of talk about what you are new targets may be for capital ratios and whatnot. But best guess at this point, if we're thinking of capital deployment, I mean, are you thinking that first part of next year, first quarter, you hope as things move along, you think you could be in a position to begin announcing or talking about some specific capital action, whether its dividends or share repurchase?", "Jay Hooley", "I only point to I think it\u2019s very positive that some of these over hangs like BASEL III is starting get clarified, and I think the more quickly they get clarify, my expectation \u2013 just my expectation, the sooner  we would be in the position to take capital actions. So, if you presumed that in November we\u2019ll get global standards and the US regulated moves swiftly to clarify those on a domestic basis, I would hope and it\u2019s just hopeful that in the first half of 2011 that we\u2019d be in a position to look at, you know capital actions other than acquisitions which I think a fair game today.", "Robert Lee - KBW", "Great, thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Good morning.", "Jay Hooley", "Good morning Mike.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Can you comment on the client retention for the Intesa acquisition?", "Jay Hooley", "Sure Mike, we had set an internal target which is pretty consistent with past acquisitions and performance of in excess of 90%. We\u2019re on our way to achieving if not exceeding that and to my knowledge there isn\u2019t any material customer that\u2019s considering not moving ahead with us.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Separately, you mentioned a stronger net interest margin. Can you just give the simple reason why the margin might increase despite the lower interest rate?", "Ed Resch", "Yeah, Mike some couple of reasons. One is that we have the US treasury trades that I talked about that we put on the second quarter. Secondly, we have in third quarter release, the full quarter Intesa which we did not have in Q2. And in the third quarter versus the second quarter, we have some live off floaters we priced when live order spiked up. So we were fortunate in that regard. Off-setting each other, we\u2019ve had some slower pre-payments speeds which have an effect on keeping some of the high yielding assets on the balance sheet longer that what we originally thought. And against that you have a slight decline in earning asset as some of the asset sales that we took in the quarter obviously that we made. So you have a couple of competing factors there, but overall we think that we\u2019re going to be for the full year of slightly above the top end in the 165 range that I talked about.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Then separately, Jay, I think you mentioned it, that low rates create challenges. Are you suggesting challenges above and beyond what we saw this quarter? Should we expect some incremental weakness ahead?", "Ed Resch", "Yeah, a little bit. If this constrained environment continues, I think it depends on what the factors. My commentary was pointed at obviously the trading market. The lack of risk taking in the world right now impinges on our cross boarder trading, on our securities lending business. I think on the portfolio on the asset portfolio, you might make a comment or two on the assets on the portfolio.", "Jay Hooley", "Yeah, Mike I mean if this environment continues, there\u2019ll be a slight negative effect. We slowed over the short term. Certainly, that\u2019s the comment that applies to the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. It also applies frankly as you move for around at the time. The longer rates they low, then the more challenge we are on the portfolio to generate earnings.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "And with that pressure, why do you feel okay about the four year operating EPS target, if that is the fourth quarter?", "Ed Resch", "Well, again I think if you look at what we said about the margin, it\u2019s going to be slightly above the 165 top end of the range. So we feel reasonably comfortable at the margins not going to fall off a cliff from Q3 to Q4. And then couple with that overall, we can see about we believe have good servicing fee results as we\u2019ve had all year as we anticipated. And we\u2019re going to keep a real close line of expenses as we have all year. So, we put it all up together and that\u2019s we feel comfortable with being slight above the 332.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "All right thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Nancy Bush of NAB Research LLC.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research ", "Good Morning, guys.", "Ed Resch ", "Good morning, Nancy.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "I\u2019m sorry if I missed this if you addressed this on the first 15 minutes you served in another call. But, I\u2019m sure you saw a very long article on securities lending on the New York Times yesterday morning. And a few things for to jump on me, number one, the reporter not much the clue what securities lending actually was. But the second part was that many or some of the institutional accounts that are supposedly sophisticated investors are not all that sophisticated.", "I\u2019m wondering if you sort of interactions with securities lending prior particularly on the public fund side in the future is going to be different just to protect yourself from litigation because some of these people seemed to want a risk-free return but with a greater yield in treasury bill. So, would you just address the whole stock lending, the litigation and protecting yourself issue?", "Jay Hooler", "True, Nancy. I did see the article. I think physically had been pretty good throughout this period. And being very transparent what our customers about \u2013 what risks they\u2019re taking on based on their reinvestment choices. As you might imagine through the stress period, some people have short memories and so we had to reinforce that choice that they made. I think going forward and I would say this is not just about securities lending.", "We\u2019re doing everything in our power to make sure whenever we have an arrangement with the customer with regards to what it is that\u2019s for transparency that\u2019s repeated conversation and reminds as to know what risks they\u2019re taking. I think that in the second quarter, we discussed some of the actions we take in our securities lending program in order to provide liquidity to customers that was received very well by customers that we were thinking putting ourselves in their shoes and working to the issues that they\u2019re working through. I think the tone of dialogue with our customers around securities lending is good, open and transparent, and I think we all need to do more that going forward.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "It was just a thought that I\u2019m assuming that we\u2019re going to continue to have volatility in this market and when rates begin to rise, we may have more volatility than we want. Do you guys feel that you\u2019ll have to sort of build extraordinary litigation reserves for those can\u2019t claim or do you feel okay with restrictions such that.", "Jay Hooley", "I feel okay with the education process. Having said that, we\u2019re all subject to if somebody has a different recollection or see things differently. We\u2019re probably going faced more of that. I feel very good about to contain my comments to securities lending but it\u2019s across the whole business that we\u2019ve been very upfront with portfolio choices one has to reinvest. They can pick and choose whether they want a separate account where they have full control, whether they want a comingled account, what they\u2019re risk appetite.", "I expect that when markets normalize that we\u2019ll see customers wanting to take more risk in order to gain more return on their securities lending. I think this is the statement broader that State Street customers. The industry has educated itself significantly through this period. I expect that once we get to something that\u2019s more normal, customers will be better informed, providers will be even more transparent and I would hope it doesn\u2019t turn frequently to litigation.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Would you just remind us from where you are, if there\u2019s any outstanding litigation remaining in that area at this point?", "Jay Hooley", "We have a couple of situations, which are not new but have been tracking for quarters of not years. Most of them around just characterizations or clarifications of what reinvestment for they rent. But nothing new, Nancy, nothing material or nothing \u2013 no change from prior outlooks.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Okay, all right. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next questions is from the line of Brian Bedell of ISI Group.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "Hi, good morning folks. A quick question on the net interest revenue strategy or basically the investment portfolio strategies \u2013 we\u2019re going to 2011 if we did get more pressure on longer term yield. I think you had mentioned quite a while ago better broad range if I\u2019d say on hold for a very long time. We\u2019d have in the end that could be a 140 to 150 basis points range. Can you just talk to if that still hold and then what type of strategies would you employ on the balance sheet to mitigate? Also, if you\u2019re willing to say, how much do you expect to re-price in 2011?", "Ed Resch ", "Let\u2019s suppose back up and put back those numbers in contexts. So those are the once that we put for in our investor day. We were trying to give a couple of scenarios for how 2010 could shape up and almost predicated on the March 31st balance sheet, and what we tried to finance a normalized environment, okay. And the purpose was to try to give you a sense of what we thought given a whole list of assumptions was a normalized member in company.", "As I recall, we\u2019re talking about our fund rates being around 3% in amore normalized environment. We gave you some spread relationships all for that. Today\u2019s world is materially different from what we assume in that presentation. Just to give you a couple of facts relative to where we were in the third quarter versus investor day \u2013 for example, we did not assume any of the treasury repositioning that we\u2019ve done in the second quarter. We\u2019ve actually experienced slower prepayments overall and what we had experienced \u2013 what we expected experienced when we out up that normalized picture of them in.", "As I mentioned earlier, the balance sheet is slightly smaller that we assumed was a normalized balance sheet. So, the world is different. We feel pretty comfortable about the guidance for the year being slightly being above the 165. But I really don\u2019t want to get too far out there and go in 2011 at this point other than to say that if rates continue to stay low, that would put down more pressure on them. That\u2019s maybe obvious. Our philosophy is not to reach for yield, not to try to figure out how in a lower environment with a 10 year going below 250 for example, that we could maintain them.", "At some point, there\u2019ll be more of compressing effects on them as rates stayed low for a longer period of time. But, overall we\u2019re looking at continuing to overdoing within the context than not reaching for yield.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "Yeah, I think the big debate is how much of the pressure on and now before you\u2019re starting now at 177, that\u2019s pretty good and keep a very good running start into this. I think some people are concerned that the name would compressed in sub-140 or worst. I just try to see if there\u2019s some things you can do on both the liability side of the balance sheet as well in terms of reducing deposit cost.", "Ed Resch", "Well, we always look in both sides of the balance sheet. We have a group in our treasury function, which is charged with looking at our liability cost and making sure they fit within the pricing construct of overall customer relationships. We don\u2019t talk about that a lot because we seem to focus a lot on the investment portfolio, but we do look at both sides of the balance sheet from a cost and return perspective.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "All right, and had a 56-basis point deposit cost in the US deposits, which is upfront 28 second to third quarter. So, it seems like there\u2019s a lot of room to take that down. I guess can you juts a quick comment why it went up to Q every Q.", "Ed Resch", "I think that was just on a very small balance. I wouldn\u2019t read anything into that in terms of the trend, Brian. I don\u2019t have the exact number but it was an increase of rate on a very small amount of principal.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "Okay, so that should normalized back to the State?", "Ed Resch", "Yes.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "Okay, that\u2019s\u2019 good. Just on maybe you can talk about a little about the makeup of the new ends. You talk quite about it. I guess my question really is, are there any large mandates within that 477 billion. It\u2019s really a lot of small new business that on from existing clients. For example, perhaps in prime region in New Jersey and Ohio are not in that number, correct?", "Jay Hooley", "That\u2019s correct. I would say it\u2019s a mix. There\u2019s a large number of mandates within there. There are some more sizable mandates in there. Some of whom have to remain confidential. As suppose to prior quarters, we\u2019re able to give you a few more meaningful names. We\u2019re not able to do these this quarter. So, it\u2019s a mix. There are some sizable transactions and there are that have to remain confidential for various reasons. As I said, the most encouraging thing to me not as most standpoint of the number, so it\u2019s not just a couple of big deals \u2013 the volume and all that diversity.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "Yeah, that\u2019s what I mean of the billion that you plan to install over the next couple of quarters. So, I would think the overall theories of those assets are higher that your existing quarter base given they\u2019re more oriented to alternatives in that office. From becoming in that, is that fair statement?", "Jay Hooley", "That\u2019s probably too bog at least given that the mix is very diverse. I think you can look at gross number and interpret something from that. But, I don\u2019t think you can really take the lead at being higher yielding assets based on being alternatives oriented or being middle office.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "Right, okay, and then maybe just down on in terms what difference second to third quarter. If you can talk about the impact from the additional six weeks of in terms of and then also foreign currency appreciation in terms of the actual service you feel on.", "Jay Hooley", "Yeah, Brian. In terms of the servicing free line, a weaker dollar contributed in the range of about a quarter of the increase on a sequential quarter basis, so $32 million increase sequentially \u2013 so 8 million bucks of that box. Overall on test, it was significant. Our growth just to put in contrast, our growth without the acquisitions would have been about flat on the servicing free line for the quarter sequentially at overall test, as well on track as Jay said to reach our objectives both from standpoint of revenue of customer attention and our EPS guidance for the year.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "Okay. Just for last, the expense line of 50 million insurance recovery \u2013 you know it\u2019s hard to predict what recovers will be in the future. But, I guess is it fair to look at the core one way or another expense line as to 189 plus the 50, or do you think you\u2019re operating a little better that in future quarters in order will in terms of expenses improve that line.", "Jay Hooley", "I said last quarter that I thought, we could average around to I think was around 250 and so for the third and fourth quarters of this year. I think we\u2019re probably around there, maybe a little higher. Add the $50 million then a haircut a little bit for the fourth quarter number.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group", "Got it, okay. Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of John Stilmar of SunTrust.", "John Stilmar - SunTrust", "Good morning, gentlemen. I just have one question for you. As you\u2019re looking and you think about the next year of your business especially with the emphasis on alternatives and the trends that you\u2019ve certainly highlighted with alternate sources of revenue and macro variable suppose the financial reform, do you think that we can start seeing a little bit more of operating expense improvement on a dollar basis? Or are we just start looking at a little bit more on operating margin basis, or is it that we think that we\u2019re in potentially an investment cycle commensurate with the degree of change in order to have revenue sustainability beyond sort of 2011?", "Jay Hooley", "Let me try that one, John. I think that underlying even to this stressful period over the last couple of years, we continue to invest. We continued to build new products, create new capabilities which I think is sustained of ability to win new customers and drive business forward. I would say, the longer term if you look at the assets for you to managing or assets that we\u2019re servicing what we are on board, I think that\u2019s done in period of depressed market based rather as well that interest revenue foreign exchange driven by cross-border and securities lending which we talked about so I think over time we\u2019re continuing to try to drive market share and the core businesses that we know we are good at and doing that broadly across the globe and we think that as we come through this troth, this headwind that we speak about the market base revenues, we should be able to generate our operating leverage to the bottom line.", "John Stilmar \u2013 SunTrust Group", "Okay, so it\u2019s more of a return from market normalcy to give the expense leverage more so than looking for actual dollars of expense improvement next year. I just want to make sure I don\u2019t get too optimistic.", "Jay Hooley", "I read your question a bit differently so my commentary there was more the long term and the short term if we continue to face constraints as I think Ed picked up earlier, we\u2019re looking at every aspect of the expense line, not sacrificing investments for our new product development and other things that would make a long term healthy for the business, and as you\u2019d expect, we\u2019re anticipating that we could be in a period of sustained or longer term market headwinds, we\u2019re looking at where we need to work, we\u2019re looking at different process improvements so we\u2019re working the expense lines pretty hard back here for the short and long term.", "John Stilmar \u2013 SunTrust Group", "Wonderful. Thank you gentlemen.", "Kelly McDonald", "Tiffany, we\u2019ll take one more question.", "Operator", "Your final question is from the line of Andrew Marquardt of Evercore Partners.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ", "Thanks. Good morning guys.", "Jay Hooley", "Good morning.", "Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Just want to circle back on the margin discussion. Just to be clear, should we now kind of not consider your prior comments from the analysts\u2019 day about normalized margin of 175 to 185, is that out of the window now or how do we think about that?", "Ed Resch", "I think that given the assumptions that we laid out on the investor day presentation Andrew, that still a valid presentation where -- with all the caveats in terms of a normalized fed funds level and a normalized balance sheet, I think that that\u2019s still an appropriate analysis.", "Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Okay, but the near term pressure part of it in terms of Brian\u2019s earlier question may not be valid in terms of 140 to 150 kind of near term if rates are different.", "Ed Resch", "The world is a lot different now, at least as we see it, evolving in the fourth quarter than the assumptions we made out on investor day so we\u2019re very comfortable, as I said, with what we set for the full year then, which is slightly above the 165, and that\u2019s obviously materially above what we\u2019ve said was the low case for 2010 given those assumptions as at yesterday.", "Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners", "And then did you mention -- so the guidance implies kind of fourth quarter maybe 165ish, how to think about the degree of pressure going into next year if rates are where they are today?", "Ed Resch", "No, other than -- acknowledge that there will be pressure if rates continue to stay low. We haven\u2019t given any 2011 name guidance at this point.", "Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners", "And then the last question is just on the capital levels. Can you just remind us where you\u2019re targeting for internal purposes, what metrics and what level?", "Ed Resch", "Publicly, we\u2019ve stuck with the goals that we\u2019ve had, which have been out there for a long time. The world has overtaken those; our high end of TC, for example, is 4.75%. We\u2019re obviously well above that and continuing to build capital as we drive toward more certainty relative to the regulatory landscape so we haven\u2019t updated them. Once we get more certainty in terms of the Bassel III, Dodd-Frank, etc, we will do that.", "Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners", "And then last question, I think I saw on your release your reconfirmation of your long term financial goals, are those still valid or are you still reaffirming those?", "Jay Hooley", "Yeah, we still stand behind those. With the caveats that Ed mentioned, which is further clarification on capital will help refine that hopefully over the course of 2011.", "Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Great. Thanks guys.", "Jay Hooley", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Kelly McDonald", "Okay Tiffany, I think we are finished.", "Jay Hooley", "Thanks everybody, look forward to talking to you in January after the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call, you may now disconnect.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

I'm pleased to report that 2011 is off to a strong start. This morning, I'll review some of our recent accomplishments, as well, as provide more detail behind the strength we're seeing in our core businesses. This strength is enabled by our vast global reach and is being driven by our industry and product leadership in key areas, such as alternative asset servicing, investment manager operations outsourcing and exchange traded funds. ", "During 2010, we established a strong foundation by putting some issues behind us, while continuing to drive growth in our core businesses. Some of our recent accomplishments that support this point include: in our Core Asset Servicing and Asset Management business, our new business wins continue and the pipeline remains robust reflecting significant business opportunity. We completed the Federal Reserve's capital plan review and have increased our quarterly common share dividend to $0.18 per share and announced the Board's authorization for us to purchase up to $675 million of our common stock in 2011.", "We continue to maintain our strong capital position and believe we now meet or exceed the 2019 Basel III capital ratios as we understand them and also are in position to respond to acquisition opportunities that are consistent with our overall strategy.", "Our Investment Servicing business that we acquired from Intesa Sanpaolo and the acquired Mourant International Financial Administration businesses are exceeding the goals we've set with opportunities for cross-selling. As a result of our expanded capabilities, we have added new clients in both of these businesses. We acquired Bank of Ireland's Asset Management business in January, and that team has began to work with SSgA to leverage our extensive Global Distribution network.", "We started to implement the operations in IT transformation program we announced last quarter and expect to see modest net savings this year. We expect this program to enhance service to our clients and accelerate our ability to bring new products to market. Just looking at the quarter briefly, we achieved positive operating leverage comparing the first quarter of 2011 with the first quarter of 2010 on an operating basis.", "During the first quarter of 2011, we added about $300 billion of new servicing mandates. We have already installed about $115 billion and expect to install a remaining $185 billion in 2011. Of the $390 billion left to be installed as of December 31, 2010, we still have about $275 billion remaining to be installed in 2011. So a total of about $460 billion yet to be installed in 2011. ", "These wins are diverse in terms of product, service and geography. Of the $300 billion we won in the first quarter, $87 billion or 29% were from U.S. and $213 billion or 71% were from non-U.S. mandates. $170 billion from European clients, $36 billion from Asian clients and $7 billion from non-U.S. North American clients. Significant new wins include servicing for mutual funds, wealth management, hedged funds, as well as investment manager operations outsourcing, in particular Deutsche asset management just renewed its long-term contract with us as did Lufthansa. First Data of Australia signed a new servicing agreement with us and Martin Currie just signed a new investment manager corporations outsourcing agreement with us. ", "In Europe, we're seeing considerable request for potential clients for hedge fund servicing, usage for funded administration and investment manager operations outsourcing. From the Middle East and Africa, we've seen $17 billion in new wins this quarter. ", "Among the many encouraging themes I see in the new business pipeline, the demand for servicing alternative assets remains a highlight. In this quarter, we added 46 new clients in our Alternative Investment Servicing business and our assets under administration increased from $660 billion as of December 31, 2010 to $772 billion as of March 31, 2011.", "According to the ICFA annual fund survey, we're the largest provider of alternative investment servicing in the world. Hedge funds asset for which we provide administration grew to $459 billion as of March 31, 2011. Kenneth Heinz, President of Hedge Fund Research, predicts that hedge funds and hedge fund to funds will easily exceed $2 trillion by the end of 2011. ", "Asset owners are increasingly allocating to this asset class and a record number of new funds are being created. In addition to hedge funds, private equity assets for which we provide administration totaled $243 billion and real estate assets administrated totaled $60 billion as of March 31, 2011. ", "In the first quarter, SSgA won net new business of $29 billion, which excludes the acquisition of Bank of Ireland's Asset Management business. Closed new mandates totaled $107 billion in the first quarter, of which $17 billion are to be installed later this year. The wins are globally diverse and represent a variety of investment strategies: $109 billion from the U.S., $45 billion from Europe and $14 billion from Asia, as well, as $2 billion from Canada. Most of the new business continues to be in passive equity strategies. ", "Overall, I continue to be encouraged by the volume and diversity of new business prospects, as well, as the impressive records of wins in competitive situations. I want to take a minute and comment on our Foreign Exchange business.", "We have a very comprehensive range of foreign exchange services that we offer to our clients. First, we execute foreign exchange transactions with clients and investment managers that contact our trading desk directly. These are executed at individually negotiated rates and we term them direct foreign exchange. Next, clients choose to execute foreign exchange transactions through one of our electronic trading platforms, like Currenex. And thirdly, clients, where their investment managers may elect to route foreign exchange transaction through our Asset Servicing business. We term this type of transaction indirect foreign exchange. The revenues from our Indirect Foreign Exchange business have been relatively stable throughout 2010 and through the first quarter. We enhanced the manner in which we have been disclosing our execution trade details to clients in the fourth quarter of 2009.", "In our view, clients select indirect foreign exchange because it provides considerable benefits to them and their investment managers, including mitigation of operational and settlement risk and operational efficiency, particularly with respect to smaller size transactions. Ed will provide additional detail about the sizing of our Indirect Foreign Exchange business shortly.", "Let me now share our view of the current economic environment. The recovery of the United States appears to be strengthening, but is partially overshadowed by the continuing weakness in housing prices, as well, as increases for the consumer in food and gasoline prices. Market economists are now forecasting real annualized GDP growth in the United States of about 3% for 2011. In addition, Europe and the Middle East continue to present financial and political uncertainties. The ongoing weaknesses in Portugal, Ireland and Spain are of global concern and the tragic earthquake and tsunami in Japan are adding to the uncertainty.", "Addressing the devastation to Japan, I want to take a minute and recognize the exceptional performance of our employees in Japan, who worked under extraordinary circumstances to meet the needs of our Asia-Pacific clients, who themselves were coping with an incredibly difficult situation. They worked for their clients benefit whether from home or from the office, without consideration for their discomfort. I specifically want to commend them for their efforts and their dedication to our clients. ", "I'll now turn the call over to Ed, who will provide further detail about our financial performance in the first quarter. And then I'll return to provide comments affecting our outlook for 2011. Then we'll open up the call for questions. Ed?", "Edward Resch", "Thank you, Jay. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll review three areas. First, the results for the first quarter. Second, the investment portfolio, investment decisions we made in the first quarter, as well, as our outlook for worldwide interest rates and the impact on our net interest margin; and finally, I'll review our strong capital position. ", "First, the results for the first quarter of 2011 compared with the first and fourth quarters of 2010. This morning, all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today's earnings news release. First, the general overview of the first quarter of 2011 compared with the first quarter of 2010.", "The growth in core revenue was due primarily to the three recent acquisitions, the growth in new business and improved equity markets, as well, as an increase in trading services revenue. The improvement in net interest revenue was primarily due to deposits associated with the Servicing business we acquired from Intesa Sanpaolo and stronger deposit flows from other clients. ", "Trading services revenue improved from the prior year's first quarter, primarily based on stronger foreign exchange revenue, as well as strength in both electronic trading and transition management. Securities finance revenue continued to be weak, primarily due to lower volumes offset partially by higher spreads. ", "Turning to expenses. Expenses increased from the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to the impact of the three acquisitions. We earned $0.88 per share on an operating basis, a 17% increase from $0.75 in the first quarter of 2010 on a revenue increase of more than 10%.", "Now for a detailed look at the results of the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Our Servicing Fee revenue increased by 3% due to a higher average equity valuations and new business installed. Asset management revenue increased 7% due to favorable average month-end equity valuations and the impact of the acquisition of the Bank of Ireland's Asset Management business in January 2011, providing further details on trading services and securities finance. ", "Foreign Exchange revenue declined 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 primarily due to lower volatilities, offset partially by higher volumes. Brokerage in other revenue increased 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 primarily due to an increase in electronic trading. Let me amplify Jay's remarks on our foreign exchange services.", "I'll review the three principal ways in which we execute foreign exchange transactions with our clients. First, we enter into foreign exchange transactions with clients and investment managers that contact our trading desk directly. These trades are all at individually negotiated rates. We refer to this as direct foreign exchange. ", "The second way clients may choose to execute foreign exchange transactions is through one of our electronic trading platforms. Our compensation is based on a transaction fee for this service. And finally, clients, where their investment managers may elect to route foreign exchange transactions to our dealer or sub-custodians through our asset servicing operation, which we refer to as indirect foreign exchange. We enter into those trades as a dealer and set rates based upon a published formula. We believe our clients value our indirect foreign exchange service offering because indirect foreign exchange is primarily used by clients and investment managers for smaller value transactions so they can take advantage of a highly efficient trading execution, which mitigates settlement and operational risk and offers potential pricing advantages by determining execution prices for each investment manager on a net basis.", "Among other things, for indirect trades, we aggregate multiple orders or lots, determine how much of each currency is needed, set net rates and take care of execution and settlement. As a result, the customer obtains a net rate and avoids the cost of managing the process of executing what generally would be a series of smaller value transactions, and we take responsibility for the risk of errors and settlement failure that otherwise would remain with the customer. ", "Let me size the portion of the total foreign exchange revenue derived from indirect foreign exchange. Total revenue at State Street in 2010 for all types of foreign exchange transactions was approximately $825 million, about $335 million or 41% of the total foreign exchange revenue was due to indirect transactions. Approximately $215 million or 64% of the revenue from indirect transactions was from U.S. clients. And of that U.S. indirect revenue, about $22.5 million or 10% was sourced from U.S. pension clients. I hope this information helps you better evaluate our Foreign Exchange business.", "Compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, securities finance revenue in the first quarter of 2011 declined 4% to $66 million due primarily to lower volumes, offset partially by higher spreads.

The increase is primarily due to revenue from various sources, none of which is individually material. Net interest revenue declined slightly, about 1% in the first quarter of 2011 compared with the fourth quarter of 2010 despite a slight increase in earning assets. The decline was primarily due to lower yields on fixed rate assets following the repositioning of the investment portfolio in the fourth quarter, as well as two fewer days in the first quarter, offset partially by lower funding costs. ", "The net interest margin in the first quarter of 2011 was 166 basis points, up 1 basis point from 165 basis points in the fourth quarter.

In the first quarter of 2011, we recorded about $4 million in net gains from sales of available-for-sale securities and separately about $11 million OTTI resulting in $7 million of net losses related to investment securities. ", "The OTTI was primarily due to changes in the timing of expected cash flows. We maintain tight controls on expenses due to continuing uncertainty in the global markets. However, our salaries and benefit expenses increased 4% or $39 million from the fourth quarter of 2010 to $974 million due primarily to the timing of benefits expenses which included higher payroll taxes. ", "Our other expenses line increased about 10% to $231 million due primarily to the impact of $40 million of insurance recoveries in the fourth quarter of 2010. Our operating basis effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28%, down from 29.5% in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to a favorable geographic mix of earnings.

", "Compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, the duration of the investment portfolio is about 1.59 years down from 1.70 years due to the sale of longer dated fixed rate securities and the purchase of floating rate securities. The duration gap of the entire balance sheet is 0.4 years, down from 0.53 years at December 31, 2010, due to both the shorter portfolio duration and the issuance of long-term senior debts to prefund next year's maturities.

", "As of March 31, 2011, 57% of our investment portfolio was invested in floating rate securities and 43% in fixed rate securities. We now expect the net interest margin in 2011, to be in the upper half of the 155 to 165 basis point range, down from the level of 168 basis points achieved in 2010. Our assumptions include that the Bank of England rate remains at 50 basis points; that the ECB incrementally increases rates a total of 75 basis points in 2011; the first 25 basis points of which occurred on April 7, 2011; that the Federal Reserve keeps the overnight Fed funds rate at 25 basis points for all of 2011; and that the yield curve retains its current steepness.

Based on our understanding of the Basel III proposed regulations and the information published by the Basel Committee, we estimate our capital ratios under Basel III as of March 31, 2011, to be our total capital ratio, 12.6%; our Tier 1 leverage ratio to be 6.3%; our Tier 1 Capital Ratio to be 11.4%; and our TCE ratio to be 7.4%.

Now I'll turn the call over to Jay to conclude our remarks.", "Joseph Hooley", "Thanks, Ed. I believe that we took steps over the past two years to improve our risk position and the results of the first quarter testified to the strength of our core business and the expense controls we put in place.

", "We continue to deepen our relationships with existing clients and to add new clients globally, as you can see by our results in the first quarter. I'm also very proud of the gains we've made from a corporate social responsibility standpoint.

Now Ed and I are happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies.", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Ed, I was wondering if you could just run through again the amount of, in the servicing side, especially the conversions that happened this quarter versus the amount won and then kind of just your forward pipeline on conversion activity.", "Joseph Hooley", "Ken, let me start that one. I think the -- what we try to do in the script was to build from the commitments in the fourth quarter of last year that are yet to be installed which would be installed in 2011 combined with the uninstalled portion of the first quarter. And we get to I think it's $460 billion in assets that will -- that are to be installed. And I'd say you could probably use the next couple of quarters as the likely timeframe when they'd be installed. Is that -- that's your question?", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Yes. I just want to try to get a kind of a timeframe pace as far as how that layers in over the course of the year and versus how much was actually installed in the first quarter.", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes, the -- of the $300 billion that was committed in the first quarter, $115 billion was installed. And we expect to install another $185 billion. I don't have that for the fourth quarter. And as you know, the nature of these commitments are pretty varied, which is why I think you can generally look at a one to two quarter lag from commitment to implementation.", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Right. Okay. My second question just for Ed. Ed, the core margin was obviously just up a tick, I think most had expected it to be slightly down. And you're talking to the upper half of the range now. So do we now get the slippage or I guess what would cause any slippage of the margin from here and what factors are in your control to even maintain it from the current 166 level?", "Edward Resch", "Yes. Let me take you through the reasons for the over-performance on the margin in the first quarter, certainly what -- against what we expected. And the flip side of a lot of these will be risks to the margin for the rest of the year. But the 166 in the quarter was driven by a couple of things. One, we invested well ahead of what we had planned. We invested $15 billion out of the $26 billion that we had to invest coming in to the year. We saw good opportunities, both in the U.S. and Europe, to put some trades on, and we did that, so that contributed. We saw a stronger than anticipated client deposit flows and obviously, if those continue for the rest of the year, that underpins our assertion that we'll be in the upper half of the range for the year. And we also saw, related to that, obviously, earning assets being higher than what we thought coming in. And the last factor is that we saw a steepening at the short end of the euro curve. And that's pretty important to the performance for this quarter and the rest of the year given that most of the European assets are floaters. So we got some pickup there.", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "To follow up, so then, I would presume that the euro hike from this quarter, that's not really fully run rated. And I guess then, one of the factors that would lead to the margin dripping it all from the current 166? What do we still need to consider, if anything, as far as either reinvestment roll over or what -- any other factors you want to point out to?", "Edward Resch", "Well, I mean, I think it's, again, the -- if stronger client deposit flows which we're assuming will continue, do not assume that -- do not continue, that will be a drag on the margin. If for some reason, the ECB doesn't increase 75 basis points, as we have assumed, that will be a drag on the margin. If for some other reason, supply is less than we anticipated in terms of getting the remaining $11 billion invested, that could also pull it down. But our assumption now is that, those things will play out and that's the basis for the upper half guidance on the margin.", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. I guess I'm just struggling then to see why it wouldn't even just stay above the high end. Like why would it even reach, broaching the low end if you're starting above the high end?", "Edward Resch", "Well, I mean, we fought coming into the year, 155 to 165 was a good peg for the margin based on what we did in terms of the portfolio repositioning and the effect of that coming in. We assume the pace of reinvestment that we've exceeded because opportunities have presented themselves. And we assume that the ECB would stay flat all year and they've -- that's not been the case for the first 25 certainly. And based on recent comments, we think it's going up. So our view has changed. But we're still cautious relative to the rest of the year.", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay, I understand. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Jay, in your earlier comments, you alluded to the fact that expense savings might start coming through in the net basis, I guess in 2011. I guess our understanding was that we're not going to see much of that until 2012 and beyond. Can you just give us an update of how much, I guess, of net savings you could see from your restructuring plans this year and beyond?", "Joseph Hooley", "Sure. The ops and IT initiative which we announced in the fourth quarter, 2011 is a year where in the early part of the year, we're doing some investing and then we're starting to generate some of the improvements towards the back end of the year, so on a net basis, it's slightly positive, I think is what we'd say, with the greater gains coming in the out years. The only thing I'd add to that is since we announced the plan, we announced the plan with some previous activity leading up to it, we're really tracking to that. I think we'll the slight improvement in '11. And we feel very confident about the long-term plan as well.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Got you. And then just a question on capital, clearly, continues to build quite naturally here in Tier 1 Common over 10% at the Basel III. I understand you're doing a little bit of a buyback this year. What are the plans, I guess, longer term? And what steps do, I guess, you need to take to buy back more stock even potentially this year?", "Joseph Hooley", "I think the way we look at capital and the way we look at it through the capital plan review was more at a total return to shareholder which combines the dividend and the buyback. And I think if you looked at the banks that went through the capital plan review, we're in line with the return to capital of those banks. I guess the way we look at it prospectively is, we look at acquisition opportunities versus share buybacks. And I continue to think that we'll see some acquisition opportunities particularly as you think about the core custody franchise and some of the subscale players that largely are in Europe. So we're trying to stay nimble delivering returns, delivering capital to shareholders to the vehicles I mentioned. And yet, also be well-capitalized should acquisitions come about.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Got you. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from CLSA.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "So just to clarify, 3% of your FX revenues relate to U.S. hedging clients, is that correct?", "Joseph Hooley", "I believe, that's right.", "Edward Resch", "Here, 22 and 8 25.", "Joseph Hooley", "Correct. That's of the indirect, as we described.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "So would that mean you don't see a decline in FX margins as structural?", "Joseph Hooley", "Keep going.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "In other words, I mean, FX, the decline, this simply -- it's down 6% link with you guys. Is this just a seasonal blip, volatility is not as strong? Or is there something more permanent taking place here?", "Joseph Hooley", "No, no. I think it's just, to me, it's volatility. I think we've seen volumes were reasonable during the quarter. And I think you've seen volatility was slightly off in the fourth quarter. So I don't see anything structural there.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "And the pretax margin, do you see that coming down? Just in FX.", "Joseph Hooley", "The pretax margin in FX. No, I think that the -- I commented it over the preceding five quarters. The revenues around and again, indirect FX has been relatively stable.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "And your acquisition of Currenex, does that differentiate you versus other -- is that helping or is that not much of a factor?", "Joseph Hooley", "It's absolutely helping in that I think, we've tended to focus on a pretty narrow aspect of the foreign exchange marketplace. I think we're differentiated in that we have a comprehensive range of foreign exchange capabilities. Currenex being just one but FX Connect also being a market leader in the aggregation and netting of trades. So we've seen those electronic trading businesses grow at double-digit rates, close to 20% for years.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "And a separate question. You have $460 billion of business yet to be installed, divided by $22 trillion of assets under custody. So should we expect a 2% boost in your assets under custody in the first quarter -- in your second quarter? Sorry.", "Joseph Hooley", "I think -- as I mentioned earlier, it's difficult because you've got -- tends to be the longer the duration of the implementation cycle, the meatier the revenues just because the nature of middle office and the likes of -- it's hard to make it that linear.", "S. Kelley MacDonald", "And, Mike, remember, some of the wins are cross sell so we already have the custody. We've sold them an additional service like Investment Management or Operational Outsourcing, for example. If they didn't have it before, then we're just adding that service. We're going to get more revenue for it. But you won't see it impact the assets under custody.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "And then last question is a big picture conceptual question. Looking back a number of years, if in the past, State Street had, had a 1% ROA with leverage of 17x and that allowed you to have a 17% ROE, how do you get a 15% of ROE, if you still have a 1% ROA, with say 10x leverage? That would imply an ROE of under 15%. Should we expect ROAs to improve from the 1% historical level?", "Edward Resch", "Well, Mike, I think that, that still is an answer that's to be determined based on what the regulators do relative to capital. Too early to tell. And as we've said previously, once we get certainty in terms of what the new rules are for capital, we'll update our ROE guidance.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "How about just the ROA trends? I mean, is there any reason to think your return assets would be better in the future than it's been in the past?", "Edward Resch", "I mean, that depends a lot on the environment, right? If you look in it, it depends how far you back in the past too, I guess. But I don't think I really want to go down the path of ROA prospectively versus ROA historically until we get the total picture laid out for us.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from ISI Group.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc.", "Speaking on FX, just looking to ask two quarters, for example, your FX sequential growth rates have outperformed basically all the peers. Can you talk about things that you're doing organically to improve that? Or is there something else that's driven the line in the revenue capture rate?", "Joseph Hooley", "I think, Brian, it's probably a follow-on to the prior comment, which is foreign exchange can be executed many different ways depending on the customer, the circumstance and the people trade to think [ph] contemplated. And I think having the full suite of capabilities allows us a greater opportunity to capture foreign exchange in whatever form it's being traded in. So that's probably where I'd leave that.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay. And I guess, my question too -- are you effectively or have you effectively cross sold FX in the last two quarters to new clients that came on during 2010? And also Intesa Sanpaolo, if you effectively increased your cross over?", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes, I get the question. Yes, I think so. I mean, I think -- I don't think anything has changed. But one of the consequences of the pipeline and the new business and the new customers is the ancillary activity that connects with that. So I would say in a more traditional add-a-customer or add-a-service, I think we're doing a pretty good job of penetrating the cross sell. I think in the case of, probably more in case of Intesa Sanpaolo's customers, again, it's probably still early days. But we're doing a pretty good job of getting in and understanding what other capabilities we could sell. And we have a pretty good track record of past roll ups or acquisitions to do a pretty good job cross-selling. So it's early days, but we're making some headway.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc.", "Great. And then on the pricing in the Asset Servicing business for the new wins that you're bringing on, are they coming on generally higher fee realization rates versus the Legacy business?", "Joseph Hooley", "I would say, Brian, it's hard to say broadly they're any different than -- I would say though that more of the deals these days, we just, in fact, we just announced a deal today that's representative of this with Martin Currie, represent this middle office componentry which, where we have an excess of 60% market share across the globe, more and more investment managers are looking to their suppliers for a deeper level of outsourcing. We're well positioned there. And as I said before, the more involved and integrated the sale is, the greater opportunity we have for margins. So I would say the more complex, the better the margins, the more simple, the tighter the pricing.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay, okay. And then just lastly, on the expense side, Ed, the other expenses were lower than I expected this quarter. Was that totally due -- I know we had the $40 million insurance recovery. But was the remainder totally due to lower processing errors? And is that 230 run rate a realistic run rate for the remainder...", "Edward Resch", "So, I mean, the main driver was both the lack of insurance recovery, as you noted, Brian. But we did have a very good quarter from a processing standpoint so there's a little bit of contribution there. And as far as that line going forward, you know, it can move around and it's a line that we focus on a lot. And I don't want to go too far out and start making predictions about that line on a quarterly basis for the rest of the year. But it is a line that has performed pretty well, and we put a lot of emphasis on it.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc.", "And then, just one last one. Just on the comp side, we should expect comps to go down in the second quarter I would assume given your retirement eligible options expense in the first? Is that...", "Edward Resch", "Yes. Yes, again, assuming consistent performance, I mean, I think that the way to think about the comp line relative to revenue over the entirety of the year is in that 40% range that we talked about.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc.", "Great. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Stilmar from SunTrust.", "John Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Just a quick question with regards to your balance sheet. We've obviously seen a pretty big growth in securities, and that obviously flows through to the net interest margins. Can you talk to how that happened over the quarter? And whether that still is persistent and whether that's just a general flight to quality or something else that we should be thinking about in terms of the longer term for the business?", "Edward Resch", "Well, I mean, we look at the balance sheet as being a customer-driven balance sheet. So we get the customer deposits mainly out of our Asset Servicing business and have to invest in the portfolios, the vehicle by which we do that. We had a very busy quarter on the investment portfolio front. I'd say, a very productive quarter. We got ahead of what we thought of our plan called for in the quarter coming into the year because of opportunities presenting themselves. We had a big challenge given that we did the portfolio repositioning in the fourth quarter. That, as you may recall, was an incremental $11 billion that we needed to redeploy. We've invested about $15 billion of the total that we had facing us this year. That's $26 billion in total, $11 billion on the redeployment and $15 billion of regular portfolio runoff. And we've been following the same strategy we've historically followed, which is AAA, AA asset-backed, mortgage-backed in U.S. Treasuries. So portfolio has been performing pretty well. As you know, in the quarter, the OTTI levels were fairly, fairly small. And we are obviously dependent on what market opportunities presents as to what we invest in going forward. But our plan is to follow the same strategy.", "Joseph Hooley", "John, I would just add that the -- one of the reasons that we highlight so frequently the new business flows and new activities is that, if there's custody involved, deposits flow. So I think there's some correlation between the new business, the growth, the new custody assets and the deposit volumes that flow in.", "John Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay, thank you. And then with regards to servicing fees and -- can you give us some context in terms of new business wins, whether you're winning them from existing clients, whether the wins are coming from relationships that the new clients had with previous custodial banks? Or whether it's just really providing ancillary services. On a prior call, we're given a statistic about new business wins being kind of 2/3 from where we're stealing market share. I was wondering if you could share some context about that and whether it's just really -- and if there's any sort of geographic footprint that also influences your answer. Thank you.", "Joseph Hooley", "Let me just try to give you a little color on that, John. I'm not sure we can be precise with the percentages. But a couple of points, one, I referenced the alternatives, I think hedge fund and private equity. That's been a big growth area for us. And I think if you look at, in fact, just recent as this week there, the forecast about the growth of hedge funds, we see our asset owner customers increase in the allocated the hedge funds. In the hedge fund world, I would say that sales there tend to be -- take away from the competitors or more often it's an internal hedge fund outsourcing activity. So that would be expansion of market or new business. With regard to -- if I focused on the new business, the higher into the new business, the bigger deals, let's say. I would say, it tends to be a customer consolidating positions with a single provider. So and I would go back to because it's recent, I think we just put it out very recently, Martin Currie is a little bit of a prototype in that we had a small portion of their business. They in-sourced middle office, they took a look at their business and decided that they wanted to outsource the middle office and select a single provider. I think it was with three or four different providers. And so they elected to consolidate all of that with us. The other thing I would say is that, particularly in the upper end of the market where there's a middle office component involved, it's rare that if we really want that customer, that we won't be successful in a competitive bid situation. So I think our product set is comprehensive and we're doing quite well competitively.", "John Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Jay, a follow up on the middle market comments. When you pitch your customers, what kind of cost savings do they normally see if they decide to consolidate into one provider?", "Joseph Hooley", "That's hard to say, Gerard. And I think it happens in two ways, the -- probably the obvious way is, economies in scale, if you consolidate from four providers to one, there's probably some pricing advantage you're going to get in the marketplace. But I would say, the bigger and more subtle change here is that, even in Martin Currie, that the overhead that they have to deal with four different suppliers, four different data feeds, the cost that they achieve internally by going single supplier is pretty significant. And I would guess probably outweighs the cost of the marginal improvement in pricing they get from suppliers, which is why it's happening.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Okay. Right. In terms of the new business that you had this quarter, how much of it was middle-market related business?", "S. Kelley MacDonald", "Well, we had Martin Currie, then we renewed Deutsche. There was one other one we can't mention yet.", "Joseph Hooley", "I would say, Gerard, again, you look at the bigger deals, there's probably 70-30, a 70-30 split between the bigger deals driving more of the activity. You look at half to 2/3 of it with a middle office component in increasing.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Okay. Is there any way that we, as outsiders, can look at your numbers and figure out what percentage of the business is coming from middle market? If this is potentially the growth area maybe over the next five to 10 years?", "Joseph Hooley", "You know, we try to give you a little direction on that, of the $24 trillion in assets that we administer, there's up to $8 trillion now. Is that right, Kelley?", "S. Kelley MacDonald", "It's about $8.1 trillion.", "Joseph Hooley", "$8 trillion has the middle office component to it. If you would attract the growth in total, AUA versus growth in middle office, you'd see a stark difference, AU [ph] or the middle office growth being considerably higher from a percentage standpoint. Let us think about that as we go forward, if there's a way to give you a little bit more color on that.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Sure. And then question for Ed. With the news with Standard & Poor's yesterday putting the U.S. on a negative credit watch. If they actually downgraded the U.S. to AA from AAA, would that change your views on how you would invest putting your money to work in U.S. Treasuries? And also, does it affect the weightings on the risk weighted assets, being on the capital allocation under Basel III, if it is down -- if they are downgraded to AA?", "Edward Resch", "I mean, it wouldn't change our outlook, our approach. I mean, we have about at the end of March, about $6.4 billion in U.S. Treasuries across the maturity spectrum. Obviously, we hope that, that doesn't happen. But it would not change our view in terms of how we invest. And relative to the risk weighting, there's no effect, modest, but very small effect.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hopson from Stifel.", "J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "On the pricing environment, it seems that given the pressure that all of the competitors are seeing, there's maybe a little more religion, but can you comment on the behavior of the markets and your ability to eventually potentially offset some of the negatives that you've seen in terms of interest rates, et cetera to more appropriately price the business that you're providing?", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes. As far as the pricing environment, I think it's become more visible to our customers through our dialogues around the need to, in the case of existing customers, improve the economics and relationships given some of the fall-off in market-based revenues. We've actually had some fee increases recently as a result of that. And in addition, the discussion more likely goes to less additional services we can provide to those customers. So I think that we've been dealing with this market environment for a while. So it's more visible to customers. And I think that the way we go forward with this is, additional cross sell, additional activities to customers, pricing increases where we can get them. I haven't seen -- I think your question, Jeff, has there been any meaningful change in competitive pricing in the last quarter? I haven't really detected that.", "J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Just a couple of follow-ups, one on NIM. As you mentioned, the 155 to 165 not really changing that range and I understand that your view on European rates was improving. Is there anything that happened that is coming in lower than expected in that outlook? Or you're just being conservative?", "Edward Resch", "Well, there's nothing that's come in that has disappointed us in the first quarter relative to our going-in view of the NIMs for the year.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then on the buybacks, have you already started your buyback program?", "Edward Resch", "We don't want to comment on that.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. I was just wondering if there's anything related to understanding the siffy [ph] buffer first before you're going to start that. Or is there anything related to your timing around whether or not you end up at what level of siffy [ph] buffer.", "Edward Resch", "No, we don't think we need to have clarity on the siffy [ph] buffer before we were do anything.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Super. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Howard Chen from Suisse.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Thanks for the commentary on the ECB hike. Is there a way to more specifically frame the potential impact and timing of that benefit to the overall NIM, Ed?", "Edward Resch", "Yes. I mean, I would think it would ramp during the year. If you remember, Howard, we thought that there would be a slight degradation in terms of the ramp for the NIM over the year based on our going in assumptions for the year from the 168 in the fourth quarter slightly down on a sequential quarter basis throughout the year settling within our 155 to 165 range if it plays out the way that we are now assuming and the ECB goes up to 175, ratably over the year. Two more 25 basis point hikes, I would expect to not see that ramp down that we saw. But an improvement to settle in for the average for the year between 155 -- I'm sorry, the upper half of the range, 160 to 165.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Great. Thanks. And then just within the context of that, what's your current thinking on the deployment of that excess liquidity that you have in Europe? And what do you want to see to more aggressively deploy that?", "Edward Resch", "Well, I mean, we're still conservative in our thinking about Europe. We still have some money at the ECB at the end of the quarter. We're going to proceed with our plan. Our longer-term objective is to build out the non-dollar portfolio, we've been doing that for several years. And we'll continue to do that. But only investing in AAA and AA asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities. So it's continuing what we've been doing.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay. Thanks. And then just finally staying on the theme on Europe. Just -- I know you mentioned you thought that the deals that you've done in 2010 were going well, but can you give us a little bit more detail on just facing of client retention or versus your accretion targets at the time? That would be helpful. Thanks.", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes. I would say on that, Howard. The -- we're above expectations almost on all fronts. The bringing on the integration of the business is well underway now that we've got several quarters of experience with both of those businesses. The client retention has exceeded expectations which were high anyway. And as I commented on earlier, the cross sell is progressing well. But there's more to do there. So I think that they're well under way. They're in a position where, if something else were to come along, I don't think that finishing up those integrations are an impediment to any another activities we might pursue.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Great. Thanks a lot, Jay.", "Operator", "And your last question comes from the line of Rob Lee from KBW.", "Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Thanks for taking my question. I know you're pressed for time. I apologize if you mentioned this earlier in the call, but I jumped on a little bit late. But can you talk a bit about trends in the Asset Management business, kind of what you saw in the quarter? How you see that playing out? And if we look beyond the recent acquisition of the Bank of Ireland's business, kind of what your appetite is for acquisitions within asset management or where that could be?", "Joseph Hooley", "Sure. I'm happy to do that, Rob. We reported net new business of $29 billion and SSgA on the asset management side. And little bit more color on that, still good flows into passive, $31 billion is our passive number, $5 billion in ETFs, a little bit less on the cash side. So I think consistent with this barbell approach that many investment managers are pursuing, which is more allocation to the alternatives, more allocation to the passive. We continue to pick up mandates on the passive side. We closed the Bank of Ireland asset management acquisition in early January, that's come on as expected and we're trying to take that fundamental active strategy and deploy it through our distribution network at SSgA. With regard to acquisitions or other outlook, I think we're in a good space relative to our quantitative passive, EPS solutions orientation. But if there was something that made sense, we always consider ways to incrementally improve our product set or address a new geography. So kind of open-minded on that front.", "Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "And if I could ask maybe one follow-up question. I know you've talked about it for today and then prior calls as have some competitors that the fair amount of new business is existing clients, kind of consolidating, well, two things, consolidating business with one provider but also this trend towards middle office outsourcing, which has been going on for a while now. And, I guess, it appears to have accelerated post crash or crisis. If you look at your book of business considering how important it is to your net new business kind of mining that, if you think of middle office outsourcing in particular, do you feel that there's just still a lot of kind of pipeline out there clients who just haven't gone step point or is there any way you think that, hey, there's another year or two of this trend and then the people who are going to do it have done it and you've got to kind of look somewhere else for some incremental growth. How do you think of that kind of pipeline?", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes. It's a -- I would say anecdotally the pipeline field is strong as it's ever been. So I don't think that there's -- it feels like it's ending anytime soon. I guess -- let me just give you some high level metrics, this might help. The custody base of business that the global custodians have faced off against is in the $110 trillion kind of range. And we're north of $8 trillion in middle office. It was 60% of the market that's outsourced. So that gives you some sense of dimensioning. I do think that the middle office tends to be more appropriate for the larger, more complicated asset managers, although not exclusively. We've seen it across the spectrum. So I think it's a trend that as you rightly point out that has accelerated through the recent global financial crisis. And I think it's going to run for a while.", "Operator", "That concludes our Q&A session. Do you have any closing remarks?", "Joseph Hooley", "No. Just we look forward to talking to you at the close of the second quarter.

[Operator Instructions] Now I'd like to introduce Kelley MacDonald, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations at State Street.", "S. Kelley MacDonald", "Thank you, Wes. Before Jay Hooley, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ed Resch, our Chief Financial Officer, begin their remarks, I'd like to remind you that, during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in State Street's 2010 annual report on Form 10-K and its subsequent filings with the SEC.", "We encourage you to review those filings, including the sections on Risk Factors concerning any forward-looking statements we make today. Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of today, July 19, 2011, and the corporation does not undertake to revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after today.", "I'd also like to remind you that you can find the slide presentation regarding the corporation's investment portfolio as well as our second quarter 2011 earnings press release, which include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures referred to on this webcast, in the Investor Relations portion of our website. Jay?", "Joseph Hooley", "Thanks, Kelley, and good morning. I'm pleased with what we've achieved in the first half of 2011, led by continued momentum in our Core Asset Servicing and Asset Management business and supported with second quarter by seasonal strength in securities finance. This morning, we'll provide more detail behind the strength we're seeing in our core business, which is primarily driven by 3 competitive advantages.", "First, our global footprint, which is unmatched in the industry. Second, our industry leadership in important growth areas such as alternative asset servicing, investment manager operations outsourcing and exchange traded funds. And third, our relentless commitment to continue to develop new solutions for our customers.", "I also want to update you on our capital position. While we learn further details from the Basel Committee recently regarding the requirement for a capital buffer for global Systemically Important Financial Institution, which appears to be in a range of 0% to 2.5%, we still await requirements from the Federal Reserve may place on Systemically Important Financial Institutions in this country and to what extent State Street may be affected.", "Our capital position remains strong in the second quarter, and we continue to believe we need to exceed the 2019 Basel III capital ratios today, as we understand the proposed rules.", "We initiated our share purchase program in the second quarter, buying about 4.9 million shares. We also raised our regular dividend -- quarterly dividend to $0.18 per share. Due to the strength of our capital position, we were able to take these measures while retaining the flexibility to respond to appropriate acquisition opportunities, should they become available.", "Regarding our recent acquisitions, the Investment Services business that we acquired from Intesa Sanpaolo in the Mourant International Finance Administration business continue to exceed the goals we've set. In addition, the acquisition of Bank of Ireland's Asset Management business continues to perform in line with our expectations.", "Just this morning, in a press release, we updated our progress in executing our multiyear business operations in IT transformation program. We assigned expanded agreements with 2 long-standing service providers, IBM and Wipro, to provide maintenance support for our IT infrastructure. As a result of these expanded relationships, approximately 320 non-client facing State Street IT employees will transition to become employees of either IBM or Wipro. Another 530 non-client facing IT employees will be provided with severance and outplacement service as their roles are eliminated over the course of the next 12 months. By expanding our relationships with IBM and Wipro, we can strengthen the focus of our IT organization on research and development, while lowering the cost of IT maintenance support. This focus on research and development will extend our leading position in developing new products, especially those that focus on data and analytics.", "We continue to meet all the financial parameters that we announced when we first launched the business operations in IT transformation program. In the second half of the year, we expect to record between $110 million and $130 million associated with the announcement made today. As of June 30, 2011, we've recorded, in total, about $165 million due to headcount reductions and real estate consolidations associated with this program.", "We continue to expect to achieve modest savings from this program this year in pretax run rate savings of between $575 million and $625 million by the end of 2014, excluding the expected restructuring charges of between $400 million and $450 million. We expect these savings to be approximately ratable over the next 3 years.", "Let me turn now to provide some highlights of the second quarter. We achieved positive operating leverage, comparing the second and first quarters of 2011 on an operating basis. During the second quarter of 2011, we are awarded about $280 billion of new servicing mandates, which represent about 105 wins. We've already installed about $130 billion of this business won in the second quarter and expect to install about $150 billion during the remainder of 2011. ", "We continue to experience a broad range of wins in terms of products, service and geography. Of the $280 billion we won in the second quarter, $185 billion or 66% were from the U.S., $95 billion or 34% were non-U.S. mandates, $41 billion from Europe and Middle Eastern customers, $49 billion from Asian clients and $5 billion from Canadian clients.", "Significant new wins included servicing from mutual funds, wealth managers and hedge funds. In particular, F&C Asset Management, a leading investment manager in Europe, awarded us a long-term contract to provide investment manager operations outsourcing as well as custody, fund accounting, trustee services and securities lending.", "In Europe, we're seeing increased demand for hedge fund servicing, investment manager operations outsource -- outsourcing and UCIT IV servicing. And in the Asia Pacific region, we've recently introduced a new hedge fund service offering in response to increased market demand. From the Middle East and Africa, we generated $10 billion in new wins this quarter, particularly fueled by our strong position servicing the sovereign wealth fund sector.", "In the alternative servicing area, demand remains strong. According to Hedge Fund Research, hedge fund assets passed the $2 trillion level in the first quarter of 2011 with the launch of nearly 300 new funds. And according to Preqin, the average hedge fund allocation from public pension plans has increased to nearly 7%, up from 3.6% in 2007.", "This quarter, we had a 38 new mandates in our Alternative Investment Servicing business, and our assets under administration increased from $772 billion as of March 31, 2011, to $789 billion as of June 30, 2011.", "In the second quarter, SSgA had negative net flows of $27 billion, but this is primarily due to the U.S. Treasury redeeming investments over the year. Without the Treasury redemptions, net flows would have been $10 billion positive this quarter. Gross new mandates totaled $141 billion in the second quarter, of which $30 billion is scheduled to be installed later this year.", "The SSgA wins are globally diversed and represent a variety of investment strategies: $53 billion from the U.S., $50 billion from Europe and the Middle East and $16 billion from Asia, as well as $22 billion from Canada.", "Continuing a theme from recent quarters, most of the new business came from passive and ETF strategies. Of note, however, is a large active equity mandate we won from AP2 in Sweden. This win was won after we acquired the Bank of Ireland's Active Management business.", "Overall, I'm encouraged by our continued success in driving new business growth and would expect this trend to continue, given a considerable new business pipeline that exist across the different business lines.", "One of the main ingredients that fuels our new business success is our ongoing investment in new product development. Some of the new products introduced in the second quarter include a collateral tracking product that monitors, aggregates and reconciles actual collateral movements and reports on all pledged and posted collateral positions and locations. It's most useful to large global asset managers and into the exposure monitor available through mystatestreet.com that provides a 360-degree view of an institutional investor's daily exposure to legal entities, that's counter parties and issuers, across a wide range of their investment activities. ", "Also we're developing a product called Springboard that extends the capability of mystatestreet.com to mobile users as an app to an iPad. We believe it's the only all-in-one information delivery platform that will be available to institutional investors shortly.", "In addition, this year we've introduced 24 ETF products, including 14 new ETFs in Europe. We also launched 2 ETFs that provide diversified access to emerging market government debt, one of which was in the U.S., the other which was in Europe.", "Let me now share our view on the current economic environment. The recovery in the United States is slower than the second quarter, affected by continued weakness in housing prices, as well as a weak labor market and lackluster demand from the consumer. Market economists are now forecasting real annualized GDP growth in the U.S. of about 2.6% for 2011 with a slight acceleration in the second half of the year.", "In addition, despite the supportive actions of the European Central Bank, the potential of default in Greece hangs over the European market and may affect the peripheral countries such as Portugal, Spain and Italy. Japanese industrial activity seems to be recovering from the tragic events of March, but the outlook is for little growth in 2011.", "And in addition, there's growing unease in the global market about the pending U.S. Government debt ceiling.", "Let me now turn the call over to Ed, who'll provide further detail about our financial performance in the second quarter, and then I'll return to provide closing comments, and then we'll open the call for questions. Ed?", "Edward Resch", "Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll review 3 areas. First, the results for the second quarter. Second, the investment portfolio, investment decisions we made in the second quarter as well as our outlook for worldwide interest rates and the impact on our net interest margin. And finally, I'll review our strong capital position.", "First, the results of the second quarter of 2011 compared with the second quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011. This morning, all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today's earnings news release.", "First, the general overview of the second quarter of 2011 compared with the second quarter of 2010. The growth in core revenue was due primarily to the 3 acquisitions as well as the growth in new business and improved equity markets. Securities finance revenue was up due to a higher spread as well as the impact of the European issuers' increasing dividends this year compared to the past few second quarters.", "The increase in net interest revenue was primarily due to the near full-quarter effect of the increase in rates from the ECB that occurred in early April and the growth of client deposits added in connection with the Intesa acquisition.", "Trading services revenue was down about 5% from the prior-year second quarter, primarily based on weaker foreign exchange revenue. Revenues from brokerage and other trading services were flat.", "Turning to expenses. They increased about 20% from the second quarter of 2010, primarily due to the impact of the reduction in incentive compensation in that quarter related to the securities lending charge. In addition, the second quarter of 2011 included merit increases, the ongoing impact of the 3 acquisitions and contract employee cost associated with the business operations and IT transformation program. We earned $0.96 per share on an operating basis, a 3% increase from $0.93 per share in the second quarter of 2010 on a revenue increase of about 14%.", "Now for a detailed look at the results of the second quarter compared to the first quarter of 2011. Our Servicing fee revenue increased by 3% due to net new business installed as well as the slightly higher average equity valuation. Asset management revenue increased 6% due to the impact of net new business as well as slightly favorable average month-end equity valuations.", "Providing further details on trading services and securities finance. Foreign exchange revenue increased 6% compared to the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to higher volumes and slightly higher volatilities. Brokerage in other revenue was flat with the first quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2011, securities finance revenue in the second quarter of 2011 increased 108% to $137 million due to seasonality. As usual, we expect these revenues to decline in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.", "Securities on loan averaged $379 billion for the second quarter of 2011, up from $359 billion for the first quarter of 2011 and down from $421 billion for the second quarter of 2010. Average lendable assets for the second quarter of 2011 were about $2.37 trillion, up slightly from $2.34 trillion in the first quarter of 2011 and from $2.2 trillion in the second quarter of 2010.", "As of June 30, 2011, the duration of the securities finance book was approximately 18 days, down from 21 days in the first quarter of 2011 and up slightly from 17 days in the second quarter of 2010.", "Processing fees and other revenue decreased 24% from the first quarter of 2011. The decline is primarily due to lower revenue from joint ventures and structured products.", "Net interest revenue increased slightly, about 1% in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to an increase in client deposits and lower funding costs.", "The net interest margin in the second quarter of 2011 was 161 basis points, down 5 basis points from 166 basis points in the first quarter. Including conduit-related discount accretion of $51 million in the second quarter of 2011, net interest margin was 176 basis points compared to 185 basis points in the first quarter of 2011. ", "As of June 30, 2011, of the approximately $1.25 billion in conduit-related discount accretion we expect to accrete into interest revenue over the remaining terms of the assets, we continue to expect about $200 million, including the $130 million in the first half of 2011, to accrete in 2011.", "Of course, a significant number of assumptions go into our estimate of future discount accretion over the remaining lives of the assets, including that we hold the securities to maturity, estimated prepayment speeds, expected future credit losses across various asset classes and sales.", "In the second quarter of 2011, we recorded about $62 million in net gains from sales of available-for-sale securities and separately about $35 million of OTTI resulting in $27 million of net gains related to investment securities. The OTTI was primarily due to continuing weakening in the housing market.", "We maintained tight control on expenses due to continuing uncertainty in the global markets. However, our salaries and benefits expenses increased 4% or $35 million from the first quarter of 2011 to approximately $1 billion due, primarily, to merit increases that went into effect on the 1st of April and increased contract employee costs associated with the business operations in IT transformation program.", "Other expenses increased about 5% to $243 million due primarily to increased regulatory costs. Our operating basis effective tax rate for the second quarter was 27.5%, down from 28.0% in the first quarter of 2011, due to a favorable geographic mix of earnings. We expect the operating basis effective tax rate in 2011 to be slightly below 28%.", "Now let me turn to the investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio as of June 30, 2011, increased about $2.5 billion to $106.4 billion compared to March 31, 2011. During the second quarter, we invested about $16.3 billion in highly rated securities at an average price of $100.35 and with an average yield of 1.01% and a duration of approximately 1.25 years.", "The $16.3 billion was primarily composed of the following securities, 95% of which are AAA rated: $8.9 billion in U.S. Treasury securities; $1.2 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities; $4.9 billion in asset-backed securities, including about $1.5 billion of foreign RMBS, which is mostly U.K. and Dutch issuances; about $1.9 billion in securities backed by credit card receivables; and about $0.6 billion in student loans. The remainder was invested in smaller amounts in various asset classes.", "The aggregate net unrealized after-tax loss in our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios as of June 30, 2011, was $94 million, an improvement of $258 million from March 31, 2011 and an improvement of about $410 million from December 31, 2010. The improvement in the net unrealized after-tax position compared to March 31, 2011, was due primarily to lower rates, partially offset by wider spreads.", "In our investment portfolio slide presentation, we have updated the data through quarter end for you to review.", "As of June 30, 2011, our portfolio was 90% AAA or AA rated. Compared to the first -- the end of the 2011 first quarter, the duration of the investment portfolio was about 1.33 years, down from 1.59 years at March 31, 2011, due to the sale of longer dated fixed rate securities and the purchase of floating rate securities. The duration gap of the entire balance sheet is 0.28 years, down from 0.40 years at March 31, 2011, due primarily to the shorter portfolio.", "Despite additional downgrades of certain of our securities from major rating agencies, the effect on our investment portfolio was not meaningful, and the securities affected are performing well. The majority of the downgrades were in a non-agency MBS asset class. ", "I'll now review some of the assumptions we used in determining our 2011 outlook for net interest revenue and net interest margin. We continue to believe we should invest through the cycle and to invest in U.S. Treasury securities and very highly rated agency mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities. As of June 30, 2011, 60% of our investment portfolio was invested in floating-rate securities, and 40% in fixed-rate securities. We continue to expect our net interest margin in 2011 to be in the 160 to 165 basis point range, down from the level of 168 basis points achieved in 2010. Should rates continue to decline, we still expect our net interest margin to be under slight pressure, so that it may average nearer to the lower end of the 160 to 165 basis point range.", "Our assumptions include that the ECB incrementally increases rates a total of 75 basis points in 2011, the first 25 of which occurred on April 7, 2011, and the second 25 of which on July 7, 2011; that the Bank of England raises rates by 25 basis points near the end of 2011; that the Federal Reserve keeps the overnight Fed funds rate at 25 basis points for all 2011; and that the yield curve retains its current steepness. Another key assumption affecting our outlook for revenue in 2011 is that we continue to expect the S&P 500 to average about 1265 in 2011, up about 11% from 1140, the average in 2010. ", "Finally, I'll briefly review our capital ratios. In the second quarter, State Street Corporation's capital ratios under Basel I remained very strong. As of June 30, 2011, our total capital ratio stood at 20.7%. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio stood at 8.6%. Our Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 18.9%. Our TCE ratio was 7.3%, and our Tier 1 common ratio was 16.8%.", "Based on our understanding of the Basel III regulations and the information published by the Basel Committee, we estimate our capital ratios under Basel III, as of June 30, 2011, to be -- our total capital ratio to be 14.6%, our Tier 1 leverage ratio to be 6.3%, our Tier 1 capital ratio to be 12.9% and our Tier 1 common ratio to be 11.8%.", "In conclusion, as we complete the first half of 2011, the economic outlook has deteriorated from the beginning of the year, and we continue to face headwinds from the low interest rate environment. However, we are pleased with our operating basis results for the first half of 2011. These results testify to the strength of our revenue in servicing and investment management as well as our success in managing net interest revenue and our ability to control expenses.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Jay to conclude our remarks.", "Joseph Hooley", "Thanks, Ed. The momentum of new business wins continued in the second quarter, as you heard. As a result, we achieved strong revenue growth. At the same time, we're very mindful of the various global economic challenges, and so we have been and will continue to be focused on expenses. As we reported to you earlier this morning, we're making progress in executing our business operations in IT transformation program. The 2 new agreements we signed recently with IBM and Wipro represent important milestones in the program's implementation. We generated a modest amount of savings in the second quarter from the program and expect to accelerate as we begin our work with these 2 partners.", "Our capital position remained strong during the quarter, positioning us well for new capital standards and maintaining flexibility with the right acquisition presents itself.", "Overall, I think we've performed well during the first half of the year. And as we have continued to execute our strategy, we're adjusting to this challenging environment.", "Now Ed and I are happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Howard Chen of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Jay, in your comments, you mentioned the concerns increase and a broader peripheral Europe. We're just hoping you could kind of weigh some of the pluses and minuses for the franchise. The plus side, I know you've done acquisitions in the region before, obviously, and on the negative side, maybe thoughts about some of the counterparty risks as you see it.", "Joseph Hooley", "Sure, Howard. Let me weigh in, and I'll ask Ed to chip in too. Well, from the standpoint of the situation in Europe peripheral countries, most notably, we don't have any direct sovereign exposure, so that's point one, I guess, on our portfolio. I can let Ed comment a little bit more on some other business exposure we might have in Europe. I'd say, generally, we're concerned and cautious and watching it closely. I think, from a counterparty credit standpoint, we have been monitoring for several quarters now the situation in Europe and tend to have counterparty credits focused in the larger, better credits in Europe. And that's not a recent change, that's been that way for the last year. We focused intensely on collateral arrangements to make sure that we're well positioned against the better credits in Europe from a bank standpoint and also that we're watching it carefully so that if something goes against us, we're able to respond. So I'd say that's the monitoring process that we have in place. I feel pretty comfortable about that. To the other side of the equation, I think, two points I'd make. One is that the question often comes up. It came up last year on Italy as we're making the Intesa acquisition: How did the events in Europe affect our core business? I think we continue to see, with some exceptions, savings rates, stable, if not improving, so that's really what drives the core of our business. So core business-wise, I don't see the events in Europe affecting servicing or management fees in a meaningful way. I think the other question, I think, you're probably indirectly asking is the whole consolidation/acquisition scenario in Europe, and I think that's still under pretty close watch. We would expect that, as the European banks recapitalize or deal with capital deficit, should they have them, that they'll look at peripheral businesses and, potentially, there'll be opportunities for us. The screen that we put on that situation is, first and foremost, it has to be strategic. So it has to be either in a market that we don't have exposure to or a product that we don't have access to at the moment. And it has to have the right economics associated with it. So we continue to impose a pretty high economic accrual rate on acquisitions that we're considering. So having said all that, I think we're optimistic that we're well covered on the downside and that there will be opportunities that will emerge out of Europe as a result of the current crisis. Ed, I don't know if I...", "Edward Resch", "Yes, let me give you a couple of additional facts relative to the investment portfolio, Howard, which may amplify some of what Jay said. And as you said, there's no sovereign exposure to the peripheral countries in the portfolio. We do have RMBS positions. They're concentrated in the U.K., Netherlands and Germany. They total about $17 billion in total. They have about 0.5 year duration on average, and they're 90% overall AAA rated, 5% AA rated. We do have some immaterial exposure to RMBS in the peripheral countries. In Greece, Portugal and Ireland, there's nothing more than $150 million in RMBS positions, and in Italy, in Spain, it's slightly higher than that. Overall, we feel very comfortable for the investment portfolio's position, given the European situation. And just one further comment now for the bank placements, non-Central Bank European deposits of a little bit over $6 billion. These are normal course-type deposits that we always place. They're with the large banks, Deutsche's, Standard Chartered, HSBC, BNP. So overall, again, to amplify what Jay said, we feel comfortable with where we are in terms of our assets relative to Europe.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And sorry if I missed this in the prepared remarks, but could you just update us on the new business pipeline and thoughts on -- just broad thoughts on timing of event installation?", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes, we didn't comment other than broadly, Howard. We did comment on the $280 billion that we booked in the second quarter, and I think half of that was installed, half of that, it's to be installed in the remainder of the year. But I would say, consistently, and I emphasize, that the makeup of the sole business is pretty diversified. We continue to see opportunities across the board. So our pipelines are, I'd say, above average. And I'd also say that our success ratio in deals that we're very interested in is quite high.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Helpful. And then, Ed, one final one on the numbers. It looks like your Basel III, RWA saw 8% during the quarter, and on a Basel I basis is up 6%. I guess I'm wondering, what's specifically driving that Basel III reduction? And what's specifically driving the delta on a B1 versus B3?", "Edward Resch", "Yes, the driver on Basel III, Howard, is that the securitization reduction positions that we have, have declined fairly dramatically. That is largely due to us getting some securities that were previously not rated and subject to the deduction actually rated. And that's the main contributing factor to that. I would also point out that, overall, would be improvement in the mark. That drove the very significant increase in the Tier 1 common ratio, up to 11.8%.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And just on that point, Ed, do you see more opportunity to get things rated and continue to drive down that RWA figure?", "Edward Resch", "Well, we're working on it. I wouldn't expect it to be of the same magnitude that we've already achieved. There's some incremental positions that we're in the process of attempting to get rated. But probably, most of that improvement is behind us from that perspective, Howard.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Nomura.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "So I appreciate all the color around Europe, I just want to see if those comments are inclusive of what the SEC lending portfolios might be exposed to?", "Edward Resch", "I'll give you some detail on the SEC lending, which -- all my comments previously, Glenn, were on the portfolio and the [indiscernible] position that we have on balance sheet. So in terms of SSgA securities lending and cash portfolios, okay, we have no exposure to sovereign debted peripheral countries in those portfolios. And we have no exposure in U.S. 2a-7 registered funds to banks in peripheral countries. We have a small amount of exposure to -- in non-U.S. registered funds to banks in peripheral countries, around $3 billion in Italy and a little over $1 billion in Spain. The maturities are short, a little bit over 2 months on average. And in terms of SSgA's fixed income exposure, we own fixed income instruments at the benchmark weighting, okay? So overall, we feel like we have a pretty well-diversified mix of assets with the most credit-worthy entities. We're comforted somewhat by the relatively positive outcome of the European stress test. And SSgA is in a, we believe, a fairly good position relative to the European situation.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "And this is a hard one, but maybe just trend-wise. For SEC lending, you obviously get a big bump up on the quarter. Any way to break out what is the seasonal normal course of business component versus some commentary on the underlying trends, new clients leverage reinvestment portfolio?", "Joseph Hooley", "It is a hard one. I think, probably, the best indicator would be backward-looking sequential quarter to see what the second quarter bump looked like in years past. I would say that the underlying metrics of the business remained stable, if not slightly improved. You saw the on-loan numbers go up a little bit, spreads move a little bit and pretty stable. So I'd say stable to slightly up as far as the core business metrics. But from a financial modeling, I think, it's probably -- the best way to do that is to look backward and look at how the second quarter peaks.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "And, Jay, maybe just one last one, a big picture question of -- so you got good new business trends, you have some revenue growth, you're controlling the expenses so you got the positive operating leverage. Put all that together, that's pretty reasonable story. I've always scratched my head on how much capital you have to run with and what that means for an ROE because decent quarter, and you put up a 10% ROE, maybe -- am I looking at the wrong metrics? How do you think about the business on want qualifies as adequate returns or good returns?", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes. I'll scratch my head, but I have -- I share your frustration on that. We're -- we still -- the question is really the equity question, which is: How much capital should a trust bank be required to hold to execute its business model? And I think that quickly gets bound up in Basel, Basel III, SIFI, G-SIFI and the most encouraging point around that is, I think, the issue seems to be clarifying. I think once we get to the point where we know what capital we'll need to hold, if we're at SIFI if there's a top-off charge, then we'll be able to zero in on what we are managing to as far as a return on equity. So I -- you probably know most of that, I wish I could be more insightful. Meanwhile, we're modeling different scenarios, recognizing that investors need a reasonable return. And so we're -- part of the effort you see around our expense reductions, not only short-term, but structural expense reductions, are aligned around making sure that once the capital question clears, we can deliver a good return on capital to shareholders.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "Do you have any idea on timing on the SIFI comments? Because I thought we would get something out for comment like soon like in the next week because the rules had to be in place by October, is that right?", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes. I don't think there's a date certain for the rules to be in place. I think the sequence has been in a little bit of global local Basel put out. When I interpret the 0% to 2.5% to be a global SIFI top-up, I think the Fed and other governments around the world need to weigh in and interpret that for their set of banks. My best guess, Glenn, would be end of year, and that's just me guessing based on talking to different regulators.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kenneth Usdin of Jefferies.", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "So understanding that you did show positive operating leverage in the quarter, but I just wanted to dig into the comp line and your outlook a little bit more. There were definitely some things in the first quarter that didn't recur, and then you mentioned the salary increase in the second quarter. But I'm wondering, can you clarify how much was the step-up in the restructuring-related costs? And is that, in fact, obviously coming in ahead of the cost saves? I'm just wondering and even related to the plan, are you spending ahead of the saves? And then how do we expect that to really to layer in over time? And it seems like expenses were still a little bit higher than many people expected.", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes, Ken, let me ask Ed to give you a little color on that, break that down.", "Edward Resch", "Yes. The spending relative to the contract employees that I referred to, Ken, for the of ops in IT transformation work is, sometimes, and this quarter is one of those times, ahead of the saves, okay? So we will have periods of time, and all of this is included in our comments on what we expect to get out of the program over the years, we will have periods of time where some expenses are increased in order to execute on the program. And to put that in term -- in dollar terms for you, in the first quarter, that was about $15 million for first to second quarter, okay? So that's a large piece of the ramp-up from Q1 to Q2. So that will happen, and when it happens, we'll obviously talk about it in the periods in which it happens.", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "So is this going to be even building from here? Can you give us just a little help in terms of -- I think you generally had said that, over the course of the year, it will be net positive, but clearly, it's net negative in the second quarter. So just -- does it become net positive in the third or in the fourth quarter incrementally?", "Edward Resch", "Overall, relative to the program for this year, it does, yes, because we're going to have net -- a slightly net savings to the company. As we get into 2012 and beyond, it will be even more so because we'll be generating more savings by the actions that we're taking in excess of any ramp we have in expenses to execute the program, okay?", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "And my second question just relates also just the comp. Comp to revenue still closer to 41 than to that longer-term goal you have of 40. I know you never have pinned it necessarily on a point-to-point. But can you just talk us through how you think about comp to revenues? And again, this $15 million delta is going to be a piece of that. But I guess, what's you're broader expectation on that if we think about a -- should we be thinking about a 40% on a full year basis? Or is it just trending above again because of these costs?", "Edward Resch", "Yes, I mean, our thinking long-term, Ken, is that it should be around that 40% level. Again, we may have periods or even a year where it's above. We've had some years where it's below. But our thinking is that it should be around that level, so this year is no exception to that. I would think we trend down. We've trended down from the first quarter, which was 41.8% down this quarter to 40.8%, so 100 basis points down on that. And our thinking really hasn't changed.", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. And then my last question, just on expenses. You mentioned the regulatory-related cost step-ups. Can you dig -- can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of what explicitly are those costs? And also if there's any litigation-related costs in other, as well, as you think about the lawsuits that are outstanding?", "Edward Resch", "Yes, nothing incremental relative to litigation. I mean, we have legal expenses that we incur every quarter, but there's nothing outstanding in this quarter versus the first. I'd say the 2 main drivers of the regulatory costs that we're talking about is, number one, the new FDIC kicked in effective April 1. And that is a modest uptick for us on a quarter-by-quarter basis over the year. If you remember, we originally thought perhaps it would be even greater than what it turned out to be, but there's still a modest uptick, and that is part of the increase sequential quarter. And then the other piece of it is professional services consulting fees that we've incurred incrementally for Dodd-Frank implementation analysis. We, like others, have a lot of work going on, trying to figure out what it precisely means for us. We're using consultants to do that. And then we have some professional services costs associated with the operations and IT transformation program. So FDIC and consulting costs are the 2 main drivers of Other.", "Joseph Hooley", "Hey, Ken, let me just go backwards for a minute on the selling and benefits, this might be helpful. We, based on your collective questions, we continue to think about how better to portray the IT and ops transformation program. And we're going to be coming back to you with some thoughts over the next few quarters. But the 1,400 headcount reduction that we announced in December, about 2/3 of those employees have left the organization, 1/3 yet to leave, largely will happen in the second half of this year. Of the 850 that we announced this morning, 320 of which moved to vendor partners and the other 500 exit the organization. The 320 will probably move over the next 3 to 6 months. The 520 will largely be laddered in throughout the 2012, concluding in 2013. That just gives you some other sense of how the costs will decline as employees leave the organization.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I just want to go back to comp, maybe ask it slightly differently. So if we look at the first quarter number, I think you guys mentioned before there was about $56 million of kind of one-offs seasonal costs in there. So if you exclude that, you're looking at $918 million or so last quarter. It's still a pretty significant step-up, I think, on a link quarter basis. So maybe can you just, within that $1 billion, can you just break down how much of that was the merit increase? And then I guess you said $15 million was the extra outsourcing folks. And then when we think about the next few quarters, is that $15 million going to start dropping off? Or is that going to be sort of the same level?", "Edward Resch", "I think that, that $15 million will probably be in the range of $10 million to $15 million over the remainder of the year per quarter, and that's an estimate at this point. So there's a certain level of run rate especially earlier on as we're ramping this year for execution on the project. But to give you the other element of the quarter-to-quarter increase, our merit increases were in the range of $20 million, in fact, for the quarter. So the $20 million plus the $15 million is for the contractors is the increase for the quarter.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Got it. Also it just feels like historically, the quarters you guys had a big securities lending gain like you did this quarter. Obviously all of that is a very high margin revenue. So I guess just a little bit surprising that more of that did not flow through to the bottom line this quarter.", "Edward Resch", "Well, again, I think we've talked about a couple of the main drivers of the expense increase, the salaries and benefits line that I just touched on and the other expenses. Those are the main elements on the expense side. We had transaction processing increase, 7% linked quarter, but that's actually a good thing. That demonstrates volume increases, and that's reflective of increased revenue in the top line. So that's a net positive to the NIBT. You have to remember too that securities finance at a $137 million for the quarter is, while it's up significantly over the first quarter, that's a relatively modest level of achievement, given what that business has historically performed.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Great. Okay, maybe shifting gears a little bit. Jay, could you talk about the momentum you guys are seeing in the asset management business. I think you gave out kind of like a net flow number of $10 billion excluding some of the Treasury run-off. But I was hoping you could maybe break it down by bucket, equity, fixed income, what you guys are seeing on a product level?", "Joseph Hooley", "Let me see if we can pull that information up. So I would say it's really not distinctive across asset classes, ETFs, fixed income, equities, pretty much contributed evenly to the increase. I would say maybe one comment would be the re-risking that we began to see in the latter half of '10 and beginning of '11 seems to have subsided. So passive, cash, passives through ETFs seems to be the trend more recently and I guess would be consistent with what feels like a declining confidence in the investors, in the investor world. And if that helps?", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "That's helpful. And then just one more for me. On the buybacks, it sounds like you guys bought back about 5 million shares in the quarter. Can you talk about the timing of that? Because obviously the average diluted share count did not really tick down, so was it really just all happened in the back, like in the back half of the quarter? And how should we think about the buyback into the second half?", "Edward Resch", "Yes. We started in mid-May, so your suspicion is correct. So we'll have obviously the full quarter effect in Q3 of what we bought back in Q2. I would also point out that one of the reasons why average shares may not have gone down as much as you would have thought was because we had to get the effect of the employee-related compensation issuances that we made in the calculation.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Brian Bedell of ISI.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc.", "Maybe if -- going back to the comp issue and then also maybe the restructuring charges, if you can talk a little bit about maybe just sort of quantifying where the $165 million of implementation expenses are hitting on the P&L, Ed. And then, the $110 million to $130 million that you announced this morning, that part of the $400 million, $450 million, is that correct?", "Edward Resch", "I'm sorry, Brian, I didn't hear the second part of that.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc.", "Yes, I'm sorry, I'm going to get off my headset. The $400 million -- the $110 million to $130 million that you announced this morning, that's part of the $400 million to $450 million, correct?", "Edward Resch", "That's correct.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc.", "Right, right. So the $165 million that you talked about in the first half so far in terms of what you spent, so...", "Edward Resch", "Brian, if I can interject, okay? The $165 million is a life-to-date number, if you will. $155 million was taken last year, and there's been $10 million taken as restructuring charges in the first half of 2011. So that's $165 million in 2011. And it's showing as a one-line item.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay. So the implementation costs, like you said, on the staff line, about $10 million to $15 million, are we going to run around about $10 million to $15 million a quarter over the next couple of quarters, is that correct?", "Edward Resch", "Yes. Yes.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay. And then you do expect net savings for the full year so just going back to, I guess, the third and the fourth quarter run rates on that, is that mostly fourth quarter loaded? Or do you think we'll start to see some net savings in the third quarter?", "Edward Resch", "Probably more towards the end of the year, more back-loaded this year. But I mean again we're talking about what we call -- we've termed and estimate to be modest savings this year overall.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc.", "Right, right. So as we move into 2012 though, I mean, that -- I mean, what you think you would see a pretty significant improvement in the comp to revenue ratio, I mean, assuming revenue trends have sort of normalized -- it shouldn't be normalized, but maybe if we have this type of a macro environment even moving into 2012, given that sort of the implementation cost versus the savings, shouldn't we see that comp to revenue ratio improve significantly from the...", "Edward Resch", "All else equal, Brian, relative to this ops in IT transformation project, yes. A lot of the benefit that we expect to see will manifest itself in the salary and benefit line.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc.", "Right, okay. So that $15 million run rate will obviously come way down significantly?", "Edward Resch", "Yes, I mean, yes, we have some costs that we're incurring that we're calling operating costs. They're included in all of our numbers, and we view them as temporary costs, okay? We're ramping up. We have some potential overlap during the period of implementation. And those costs, once the project moves along, will go away.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc.", "Right, okay. And the $110 million to $130 million is the second half that fall in the restructuring line, is that correct?", "Edward Resch", "Yes, that's correct.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc.", "Right, okay. Okay, great. And then just a couple of other things. On the new business conversions, the 280 that you've won and the 150 that's converted in the -- that is to be converted in the second half, I guess, from the F&C deal, has any of that been converted yet? Or is that all in that 150?", "Joseph Hooley", "No, that's all in the back-end loaded portion, second half of the year.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay. And do you expect to conclude the F&C integration by the end of the year or some of that in 2012?", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes, I think, substantially, Brian, it should be concluded.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay, okay. And then end-of-period share count and the comments on plans for buybacks versus what you got approved for from the Fed, I guess, in the second half.", "Joseph Hooley", "I think we're in an annual cycle based on the stress test, and so I think the buybacks that the Board has approved, what we plan to execute through the end of this year, and then I think we'll queue up again for a set of stress analysis and capital request as we exit the year and enter 2012. I think that feels like the cycle that we're in with the regulator.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc.", "Right, okay. And then just so the end-of-period share count...", "Edward Resch", "What is it?", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc.", "Yes, yes, exactly.", "Edward Resch", "Hold on. 501?", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc.", "501?", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes, that's, I think that's what we reported, Brian.", "Edward Resch", "501.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Stilmar of SunTrust.", "John Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Just a quick question for you with regards to momentum of the ability to reprice. You guys just went through a very successful win with CalPERS, and they selected you all, and if you look to the transcripts, obviously, one of the things that was talked about was pricing of that new business. And it seemed to be much better than sort of the other competitors. The question I have is simply one of the thesis that we've laid out for a long time is that we're increasing pricing to cover for lower activity fees such as FX and SEC lending. Is that trend still happening? And without getting into specifics because I'm sure you won't with CalPERS, but is the trend at least in terms of -- are such wins because of the low-cost approach to pricing more a reflection of you being -- potentially a service for being an incumbent? I'm just wondering because it seemed like some of these counterflows of information seemed a little bit different. I was wondering if you could provide a little more clarity on that.", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes, let me take a shot, John. One, we are thrilled to have CalPERS as an ongoing customer. They're a wonderful investment manager. They challenge us as evidenced by their resigning. I'm pretty pleased with what we do and where we're heading. I wouldn't put a lot of credence into a lot of the stuff you read in the press about pricing, competitive deal. We're pleased with where it came out. I think to your, I guess, to your other question, the environment has changed, the world knows that securities lending isn't driving up the economic benefit that it once was nor is NIR. So I'd say, in new deals, whether as incumbent or as a bidder, it feels like pricing is getting a little better, at least. The recognition that the traditional components of revenue have shifted. And so I see at least stability, if not, some slight improvement there. And we're firming up our position in several of these deals to make sure that we have deals that make economic sense. We've even seen more recently, largely on the back of a customer relationship that had a securities lending dependency, some fee increases. So I would say, I know don't if that's helpful to your question but I would say, if anything, it's feeling a little firmer, getting a little better both sides of the table, understand that the trough created by low interest rates, NIR and securities lending, most notably.", "John Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. And then busting on the concept of competition revenues, just a question with across your platform, is volatility in the global markets itself accelerate some of the investment outsourcing opportunities that you had? Or is it more of we'd like a more accommodating environment where asset prices move up? Which is a better environment for your platform to grow revenues at least given that you provide a lot of -- a broader array of consulting or back office support? I'm just curious as to which one of those environments is most opportune for revenue growth.", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes, I think both is the answer. We've got the 10%, 2% market-to-revenue equation, which I think still generally holds up. So market growth upwards provides the 10%, 2% equation to revenues. The volatility more specifically affects foreign exchange trading, probably most notably less so securities lending, less so the core servicing or Asset Management business. So I guess, hearing that explanation, we'd rather see asset prices go up over time. The volatility would have a more direct connect to the foreign exchange and some of the other trading-related businesses.", "John Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "And maybe volatility was a poor choice of words, but does the angst about global growth accelerate investment outsourcing in back office? It sounds that we could start to see if we are in a prolonged period of sort of low asset growth that back office and some of the middle office wins that you've have could start to accelerate, given the pressure on operating margins of the asset managers?", "Joseph Hooley", "Absolutely. And I would say it cuts several ways. It cuts against the need to, if you're an asset manager making expenditures for compliance or risk management, it cuts against -- markets, until recently, have performed pretty well. It's pretty uneven, if you look across the asset management landscape, and several folks aren't getting flows or stable if not have downward pressure on their AUMs. And so they're desperate to find ways to rationalize their cost base. So all those factors have and, I predict, will continue to drive outsourcing activity, and you've seen that over several of the recent quarters. That's what's driving the pipeline, and that's what's driving a good deal of new business activity.", "John Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. And my very last question, and I apologies for beating a dead horse, but going back to salaries and employees' benefits and relative to your revenues, I understand the idea of investing to be able for the cost initiatives. Is there a point in which when you can look out forward? Or is this the quarter in which we have that comp to revenue zenith? Is that a kind of a peak? I know you've always kind of targeted the 40% range. But it sounds like, with your cost initiatives, you're going to be potentially below that. And it seems to me that part of the momentum that you're advocating for us on the expense line item is for the actual dollar cost savings. So I'm wondering is this a zenith and really how should we start to move forward? Or when can we expect that peak, and what's sort of relative flow?", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes, let me try that one. I don't know if it's a zenith or a peak, but certainly, as we get through the second half of the year, we would expect the salary and benefit-to-revenue relationship improve. And that was a smaller increment as we exit the year. And I think that's what Ed is getting at with the first quarter, the second quarter slight improvement. We'd expect some slight improvement as we get to the end of the year. I think, importantly, the IT and ops transformation plan, roughly we would expect $200 million in savings in '12, '13 and '14. I think you can expect that, particularly in '12, that gets a little back-end loaded, and that's the result of whether it is implementing or executing the transition of staff to IBM and Wipro today, whether it's the time it takes to exit staff who are associated with that activity. And then it's also embedded in our IT and ops transformation plan and some movement of staff to a lower cost environment. When you do that, there's a redundancy of costs that you incur for a quarter as you transition staff to, let's say, Poland. You ramp up in Poland, and then it takes a quarter for you to ramp down. So some of this front-end loading of expense are things like that. So I don't know if that gives you some time sequence of second quarter, end-of-year expectations for '12, '13 and '14 and some of the underpinnings of for that.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from Mike Mayo CLSA.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets", "So expenses in the second half, are they likely to be up or down, with everything that you said or flat?", "Joseph Hooley", "My commentary was more on the salary and comp line. Ed, take a look at some numbers here.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets", "I guess what I'm asking is the IT project should be additive this year and so far it looks like it's not additive.", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes, I think that's fair.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets", "Is your confidence the same or is it a little bit less about it being additive this year?", "Joseph Hooley", "I have confidence it will be additive this year, slightly.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets", "Okay, which means we should see more significant benefit in the third and fourth quarters to offset the first half front loading of expenses.", "Edward Resch", "Yes, Mike, I think generally, second half, in the range of flat, maybe up a little bit but flat, flattish.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets", "Okay. And then my question, we've heard a lot about new business wins. You've had a lot of new business wins. You've talked about them but then we see assets under custody up only 1%. And I'm wondering if there's something unique add to that number this quarter. Or why isn't it up more? I mean, you can't have big increases every quarter but you'd thought it might have been up more after hearing your positive comments last quarter?", "Joseph Hooley", "I think it's largely mix, Mike. The investment operations outsourcing asset, for instance, wouldn't necessarily have custody associated with it, yet it's revenue-driving. So I don't think there's anything unusual in the quarter. Sometimes the mix drives higher custody growth, sometimes less so. So I think that will wrap up the second quarter call. We look forward to talking to everybody at the end of the third quarter.

Before Jay Hooley, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Ed Resch, our Chief Financial Officer begin their remarks, I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in State Street's 2010 annual report on Form 10-K and its subsequent filings with the SEC.", "We encourage you to review those filings, including the sections on Risk Factors concerning any forward-looking statements we may make today. Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of today, October 18, 2011, and the corporation does not undertake to revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after today.", "I'd also like to remind you that you can find 2 slide presentations: one regarding the corporation's investment portfolio, and the other about our progress in executing our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program, as well as our third quarter 2011 earnings news release, which includes reconciliations of non-GAAP measures referred to on this webcast in the Investor Relations portion of our website", "Now I'll turn the call over to Jay.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Thanks, Kelley, and good morning. Before reviewing our earnings results for this quarter, I'll briefly address the recent white paper released by Trian Fund Management, a shareholder of State Street's, on Sunday, October 16. Trian's white paper suggested ways we could improve shareholder value, many of which have been underway at State Street for more than a year. We continually search ways to drive  value across our operations and always listen to ideas and shareholders. In that spirit, members of State Street senior management have met with representatives of Trian on a number of occasions to discuss our business. ", "Despite the challenging operating environment over the past several years, our business has remained resilient. We have continued our track record of profitable growth and have maintained the strongest capital position among our closest peers. With the approval of the Federal Reserve and within the context of growing our business, we intend to continue to return capital to our shareholders. We believe our third quarter earnings results underscore the underlying strength of our franchise. ", "With that said, I want to emphasize that the purpose of today's conference call is to discuss these results. We will not be taking any questions on Trian. I'd like to now return the focus of today's call to our earnings results.", "I'm pleased with what we've achieved in the third quarter of 2011 in the face of volatile equity markets and continued uncertainty in Europe. Compared to the third quarter of 2010, revenue from our fee-generating businesses increased 18%, and our total operating basis revenue increased 12%. Compared to the second quarter of this year, our fee revenue declined about 3% due primarily to a decline in Securities Finance revenue from the seasonally strong second quarter. We added about $245 billion in new assets to be serviced in the asset servicing business and had negative $15 billion in net flows at State Street Global Advisors, excluding $35 billion of planned asset sales and accounts we manage for the U.S. Treasury. ", "This morning, I'll provide more detail behind the wins we achieved in the third quarter, as well as the installation timing. I'll also comment on our outlook for the global economy with an emphasis on the situation in Europe, our progress in executing against our Business Operations and IT Transformation Program, as well as our capital plans.", "Let me turn now to provide some highlights of the third quarter and recent trends we've observed. Of the $245 billion of new servicing mandates won in the third quarter, we've already installed about $65 billion of the business won and expect to install about $180 billion during the fourth quarter of 2011. We continue to enjoy a broad range of wins in terms of clients, services and geographies. Of the $245 billion we won , $42 billion or 17% were from the U.S. and $283 billion or 83% were non-US mandates, $156 billion from Europe and Middle Eastern clients, $32 billion from Asian clients and $15 billion from Canadian clients. ", "Volatile markets have made U.S. consumers nervous due to concerns about Greece, European banks and the pace of the U.S. recovery. As a result, they have continued to move out of equities over the past 5 weeks into bonds and municipal funds. Similarly, in Europe, investors are avoiding equities that have been selling out of emerging markets after having been overweight in both 2010 and 2011. In both Europe and Asia, investors are investing closer to their home countries and are limiting their cross-border investing. Cash continues to collect in bank deposits as investors stay on the sideline until the euro-zone reaches some decisions on the sovereign debt crisis, as well as the recapitalization of the banking systems. ", "Another trend we're observing is clients moving toward alternative investments, in particular, private equity and real estate funds, both of which we service through our alternative Investment Servicing business. Clients were also looking to outsource more services, so our pipelines remain strong, reflecting significant business opportunities. ", "From the Middle East and Africa, we generated $18 billion of the quarter's new wins, fueled by our strong position serving the sovereign wealth fund sector. In the alternative servicing area, demand remains strong. This quarter, we added 25 new mandates in our alternative Investment Servicing business, and our alternative assets under administration increased from $789 billion as of June 30, 2011, to $793 billion as of September 30, 2011, despite a general contraction in equity markets. ", "At State Street Global Advisors, gross new mandates totaled $88 billion in the third quarter, of which $12 billion is scheduled to be installed later this year. We continue to benefit from our concerted effort to cross-sell products between asset servicing and asset management. For example, of our top 100 Investment Servicing clients, about 75% have a portion of their assets managed by SSgA. In addition, SSgA's portfolio of solutions offering is attracting Investment Servicing clients, especially pension funds, and a significant majority of our hedge fund and mutual fund clients invest in ETFs managed by SSgA. ", "Like our Investment Servicing business, the SSgA wins were globally diverse and represent a variety of different investment strategies: $36 billion from the U.S., $43 billion from Europe and the Middle East and $9 billion from Asia. Continuing a trend from recent quarters, most of the new business came from passive and ETF strategies. ", "Let me now share our outlook for the global economy. While growth has slowed in the U.S. principally due to the continuing weakness in the housing market and the stubbornly high unemployment rate, most of the focus now is on Europe, especially the peripheral countries and the uncertainty created by the debt crisis. As investors worry about the stability and safety in the European market during the third quarter, our clients place with us, on average, an incremental $15 billion of deposits compared to the second quarter. In Europe, very recent news suggests that the leaders there are working to fashion a fiscal solution for weaker countries. But should this initiative fail, it will continue to weigh heavily on the capital markets and economies of Europe. As a result, with our investment portfolio, we continue to focus our euro-denominated investment activities in stronger northern European countries and in higher-quality asset classes.", "This outlook only underlines the slow and somewhat fragile global recovery. I continue to believe that with the slow growth rate, concern about the financial institutions in Europe should result in consolidation in the financial sector, consolidation which we are prepared to take advantage of with our strong capital position.", "Our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program is progressing well, in fact, ahead of schedule. When we first launched the program, we indicated that we expected the 2011 expense savings would be slight. We now expect those savings in 2011 to be approximately $80 million, since we were to accelerate some of the projects within the program. Through this program, we continue to expect to achieve a 400 basis point improvement in our operating basis pretax margin compared to 2010 by the end of 2015, all else equal. ", "I'm pleased with the progress we're making with this program, and I'm confident in our ability to execute against it. It is going to substantially transform State Street both in terms of service to our clients, more rapid development of new products, as well as a significant reduction in our expenses. In a few minutes, Ed will provide more specific information about the Business Operations and IT Transformation Program. I also want to update you on our capital position, which remained strong in the third quarter.", "We continue to await the capital requirements for systemically important financial institutions. At this time, we expect to know those requirements by the end of this year, enabling us to evaluate the effect on State Street and on our expectations for return on equity. In the third quarter, we purchased approximately $5.8 million of our common shares, which brought the total shares purchased in 2011 to $10.7 million, leaving about $225 million from the original plan yet to be purchased in 2011. We also announced a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share in the third quarter. Due to the strength of our capital position, we were able to take these actions while retaining the flexibility to respond to future acquisition opportunities should they become available.", "Regarding our recent acquisitions, the Investment Servicing business that we acquired from Intesa Sanpaolo and Mourant International Financial Administration (sic) [Mourant International Finance Administration] business continue to be in line with the goals we announced. In addition, the acquisition of Bank of Ireland's asset management business continues to perform well and in line with our expectations. We recently announced 2 small acquisitions: Complementa in Switzerland and Pulse Trading in the United States. Based in Switzerland, Complementa provides investment performance measurement and analytics to asset managers, banks, pension funds, family offices and insurance companies primarily in Switzerland and Germany. With this acquisition, we'll significantly strengthen and differentiate our investor service capabilities across the European continent. This transaction closed on October 3, 2011. ", "The Pulse Trading acquisition enhances our electronic trading capabilities by adding an equity crossing platform, which we plan to cross-sell to our existing client base. This transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2011, pending regulatory and other closing conditions.", "I'll now turn the call over to Ed, who will discuss our results for the third quarter, provide further details about our Business Operations and IT Transformation Program, discuss the performance of our investment portfolio and our capital position. Then I'll return to make some final remarks before we open the call to questions.", "Edward J. Resch", "Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. As Jay said this morning, I'll review 4 areas: first, the results for the third quarter; second, our progress in executing the Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program; then I'll summarize the performance of an outlook for the investment portfolio, as well as worldwide interest rates and the impact on our interest margin; and finally, I'll review our strong results comparing the third quarter to the second quarter of 2011. And this morning, all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today's earnings news release. ", "Our Servicing Fee revenue decreased by 2% due to weaker average equity markets offset partially by net new business. To put this decline in context, daily average equity markets, as measured by the S&P 500 and the MSCI EAFE index, were down about 9% compared to the second quarter. Asset management revenue declined about 8% due to the weaker average month-end equity valuations offset partially by the impact of net new business installed. For comparison, average month-end equity markets, as measured by the S&P 500 and MSCI EAFE index, declined about 11% compared to the second quarter. ", "Regarding trading services and Securities Finance, foreign exchange revenue increased 21% compared to the second quarter of 2011 due to higher volatility. Brokerage and other revenue declined 8% compared to the second quarter due primarily to weaker revenue from transition management. Securities Finance revenue in the third quarter of 2011 decreased about 38% to $85 million in comparison to the seasonally strong second quarter. Securities on loan averaged $368 billion for the third quarter of 2011, down from $379 billion for the second quarter of 2011 and from $382 billion for the third quarter of 2010. Average lendable assets for the third quarter of 2011 were about $2.28 trillion, down 4% from $2.37 trillion in the second quarter of 2011 and up 5% from $2.17 trillion in the third quarter of 2010. As of September 30, 2011, the duration of the Securities Finance book was approximately 12 days, down from 18 days in the second quarter of 2011 and from 24 days in the third quarter of 2010. ", "Processing fees and other revenue increased 29% to $90 million from the second quarter of 2011. This increase was primarily due to $22 million of gains related to real estate and leases. Net interest revenue increased slightly, about 2% in the third quarter of 2011 compared with the second quarter of 2011 primarily due to an increase in earning assets, driven by an increase in client deposits.", "Compared to the second quarter, in the third quarter, clients left an incremental $15 billion in average deposits with State Street, the impact of which contributed to slightly higher net interest revenue and a lower net interest margin. Including these incremental deposits, operating basis net interest margin in the third quarter of 2011 was 144 basis points. Excluding those deposits, net interest margin would have been about 157 basis points compared to 161 basis points in the second quarter. ", "We maintained tight controls on expenses. Our salaries and benefits expenses decreased 4% or $44 million in the second quarter of 2011 to approximately $965 million due to reductions in incentive compensation and benefits achieved from the Business Operations and IT Transformation Program. Salaries and benefits included about $13 million in nonrecurring costs related to the implementation of this program, with another $5 million recorded in several other expense lines of the income statement. ", "We continue to make progress against our annual compensation to revenue target of 40%. In the third quarter of 2011, salaries and benefits expense was approximately 40.0% of total revenue, down from 40.8% in the second quarter, which was down from 41.8% in the first quarter. As of September 30, 2011, our year-to-date ratio was 40.9%.", "Other expenses were $258 million, up about 6% compared to the second quarter due to increased securities processing costs. Included in other expenses are certain costs to meet the increased regulatory compliance requirements we face.", "In the third quarter, we recorded about $65 million in restructuring charges and have recorded $75 million year-to-date associated with the Business Operations and IT Transformation Program, as well as about $20 million of integration costs associated with Intesa, Mourant and Bank of Ireland acquisitions. We expect additional restructuring charges of between $45 million and $65 million in the fourth quarter associated with the Business Operations and IT Transformation Program. We continue to expect a total of $400 million to $450 million of restructuring charges over the life of the program. As of September 30, 2011, we have recorded aggregate restructuring charges of about $230 million, composed of severance associated with headcount reductions, information technology vendor transition costs and actions taken with respect to real estate consolidations resulting from the implementation of this program. ", "In response to your requests, now I'd like to provide additional detail about the net savings we expect to achieve through the Business Operations and IT Transformation Program. We have provided a presentation in the Investor Relations section of our website for your reference. ", "On the third page of the presentation, I list the goals of the program, positioning us for accelerated growth with the financial goal of achieving annual run rate pretax savings of between $575 million and $625 million by the end of 2014, for full effect in 2015. We continue to expect to achieve 400 basis points of improvement in our operating basis pretax margin compared to 2010, all else equal in 2015. By implementing this program, we also intend to enhance service excellence and innovation, deliver operating efficiencies, standardize and further automate processes and increase the efficient use of technology for product development. To describe this program, we have divided it into 2 components: business operations transformation, from which we expect to achieve approximately $440 million of annual pretax run rate expense savings by the end of 2014, for full effect in 2015; and information technology transformation, from which we expect about $160 million in annual pretax run rate expense savings over the same period. These estimates are based on improvement from operating basis expenses in 2010, all else equal. And again, we expect the full effect to be experienced in 2015. For convenience, we have used the midpoint of the range of expected expense savings. For your reference, on Page 4 in the presentation, I list the expected performance of the entire program, most of which we have previously disclosed.", "The next page, Page 5, describes the 3 drivers of the business operations transformation, transforming and standardizing our processes, continuing to automate our key business processes and developing additional Centers of Excellence around the globe, shown in the first 3 rows on the chart. ", "Relative to the first driver, in order to transform our business operations, we expect to standardize 14 core processes at State Street primarily by continuing to execute our successful lean methodology and then to further automate those processes. Lean is a process that we embraced about 3 years ago. It is similar to Six Sigma, which you may be more familiar with. We estimate this driver should account for about 10% of the projected $440 million pretax run rate expense savings. ", "The second driver. We intend to further automate our business processes in order to eliminate as much manual processing as possible, which is expected to reduce cost as well as operational risks to both State Street and our clients and which should account for about 30% of the projected $440 million. ", "The third driver. We've already begun a program of establishing Centers of Excellence using a globally distributed footprint to balance our workload in a more flexible global operating model. We expect this driver to account for about 60% of the projected $440 million expense savings. Approximately 95% of the projected $440 million expense savings from this component of the program are expected to be reflected as a reduction in the salaries and benefits line.", "On the next page, Page 6, we have listed the 3 drivers of transforming our information technology across State Street, as shown in the first 3 rows on the chart: one, introducing new technology architecture; two, optimizing our IT processes; and three, optimizing our workforce. ", "Regarding the first driver, in order to transform our information technology, we are planning to move hundreds of core applications to a private cloud, leveraging new technology architecture which will reduce cost and improve our ability to deliver new business products and services to our clients. We estimate that we will achieve about 20% of the projected $160 million in savings from this component of the program. ", "The second driver. We intend to deploy lean methodology to all of our IT processes across State Street and with our strategic servicers. This is consistent with what we have been doing in our business operations for the past several years. These benefits are estimated to be about 40% of the projected $160 million in expense savings expected from this component of the program. ", "Regarding the third driver, as we announced in July, we have expanded our information technology service provider relationships with IBM and Wipro in order to support components of our technology infrastructure and application maintenance, as well as support systems. ", "Finally, we intend to leverage the benefits of these relationships to more efficiently and effectively deploy our IT services globally, a driver which we estimate will save us about 40% of the projected $160 million expense savings we expect from this component of the program. Approximately 165% of the expense savings from the information technology transformation component are expected to be reflected as a reduction in salaries and benefits due primarily to the implementation of the expanded IBM and Wipro relationships. Information systems and communications expense is expected to increase by an amount equal to approximately 65% of the total IT transformation benefits, partially offsetting the expected improvement in salaries and benefits. ", "Onto Page 7, the financial benefits of these 2 programs. We have previously said we expect slight savings in 2011, originally about $30 million. However, given the difficult environment, we accelerated some of our projects and were able to migrate some job functions to lower-cost locations, and we now expect to achieve about $80 million in annual pretax run rate expense savings this year and to still achieve about $200 million pretax run rate expense savings by the end of each of the next 3 years as shown in the bottom row of this table. ", "As shown on the far right, the estimates in the table are based on a pretax run rate expense savings of about $600 million by the end of 2014, for full effect in 2015. $600 million represents the midpoint of the estimated $575 million to $625 million range we provided when we announced this transformation program. On average, we expect to get about 75% of the total annual pretax run rate savings or $440 million in 2015 from the business operations transformation component. The other 25% of the total pretax run rate savings in 2015 is expected to come from the information technology transformation component. From this component of the program, we expect to achieve annual pretax run rate savings of about $160 million in 2015. ", "So you can see that we expect to achieve $540 million in annual pretax run rate savings by the end of 2014, for a total annual run rate savings of about $600 million in 2015. 105% to 115% of the program's overall expense saves are expected to come from a reduction in salaries and benefits, partially offset by an expected increase in information systems and communications expense of between 10% and 20%, reflecting the incremental costs of the enhanced strategic service provider relationships. The Other Expense and Occupancy categories on our income statement are estimated to decrease by an amount equal to 5% of the overall pretax net operating benefits. These estimated savings only refer to the Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. Actual company expenses may increase or decrease due to other factors. We plan on updating these numbers quarterly, assuming no material changes, and we'll also report an actual savings in relation to the estimates on an annual basis.", "On Slide 8, this slide provides our expected achievements in 2012. 14 key business operations processes are to be substantially affected by hundreds of initiatives that are to be implemented through the Business Operations and Information Technology Program. We expect to establish 2 additional Centers of Excellence, so we have a total of 7 overall, achieve 20% of our targeted automation benefits and establish 2 new low-cost locations to balance our global footprint. We also expect to scale the cloud computing platform, rationalize the IT application portfolio and enable major application migrations in 2013 and 2014. We intend to realize 20% of the benefits from streamlining our IT applications in 2012. By the end of next year, we expect to have substantially completed the transition of the relevant information technology maintenance and support functions to our strategic service providers. Now let me turn to the investment portfolio.", "Our investment portfolio as of September 30, 2011, increased about $700 million to $107.1 billion compared to June 30, 2011. During the quarter, we invested about $10 billion in highly rated securities at an average price of 101.85 and with an average yield of 1.94% and a duration of approximately 2.08 years. This is a lesser amount than we have invested in the previous 2 quarters because as we have discussed with you, we invested early in 2011 to capture what we perceive to be good investment opportunities. The $10 billion of purchases was composed of the following securities: $1.6 billion in U.S. Treasury securities; $3.8 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities; a $3.2 billion in asset-backed securities, including about $1 billion of foreign RMBS, which were mostly U.K.; and the remaining $2.2 billion were invested in U.S. securities backed by credit card receivables, student loans and floating-rate auto receivables. The remainder was invested in smaller amounts in various miscellaneous asset classes. The aggregate net unrealized after-tax loss and our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios as of September 30, 2011, was $259 million, a deterioration of $165 million from June 30, 2011, and an improvement of about $245 million from December 31, 2010. The deterioration in net unrealized after-tax position compared to June 30, 2011, was due primarily to a modest widening in spreads partially offset by lower interest rates. ", "In our investment portfolio presentation, we have updated the data through the quarter-end for your review.  In this quarter's investment portfolio presentation, you will note that on Page 5, we had an additional column to capture the impact on treasury and agency securities that were downgraded by S&P in August. Excluding this column, the additional downgrades are primarily in non-US RMBS. The effect on our investment portfolio was not meaningful, and the effect with securities are performing well. ", "As of September 30, 2011, our portfolio is 89% AAA- or AA-rated. The duration of the investment portfolio was 1.09 years, down from 1.33 years at June 30, 2011, due to the sale of longer-dated fixed-rate securities, purchase of floating-rate securities and an overall lower level of interest rates. The duration gap of the entire balance sheet was 0.9 years -- I'm sorry, .09 years, down from 0.28 years at June 30, 2011, due primarily to the previously mentioned shorter portfolio duration. ", "We're often asked about the potential impact on State Street of the uncertainty in the euro-zone. We do not own any sovereign debt from the peripheral countries of Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy or Ireland in our investment portfolio. In our RMBS book, we hold about $1.1 billion in securities from those peripheral countries: about $400 million from Italy, about $400 million from Spain and about $100 million each from Ireland, Greece and Portugal. All are performing well. All are prime mortgages, and the mortgages backing the securities all have relatively low loan-to-value ratios.", "On Page 11 of the investment portfolio presentation, we list all of our holdings and show the average rating as well as the asset types we hold. Our primary non-US holdings are in British, Australian, German, Canadian and Netherland securities, totaling 91% of the non-US investment portfolio.", "I'll now review some of the assumptions we used in determining our 2011 outlook for net interest revenue and net interest margin. We continue to believe we should invest through the cycle and to invest in U.S. Treasury securities and very highly rated agency mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. As of September 30, 2011, 61% of our investment portfolio was invested in floating-rate securities and 39% in fixed-rate securities. Excluding any impact from the unusually high level of deposits placed with us as a result of the recent market disruption and given third quarter performance and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we still expect our net interest margin to average near the lower end of the 160 to 165 basis point rage in 2011. ", "Our assumptions for 2011 are based on several factors: first, the ECB did not raise rates another 25 basis points, and it also appears that the Bank of England may not raise rates another 25 basis points by the end of the year. Both assumptions have been expected last quarter. The ECB and the Bank of England holding rates at their current levels reduced net interest income by about $35 million to $40 million annually, all else equal. ", "The Federal Reserve has indicated it intends to keep the overnight fed funds rate at 25 basis points into 2013 and that the yield curve retains its current steepness. While it's a bit premature to provide an outlook for net interest margin in 2012, given the persistent low rate environment, we expect it to decline slowly, much as it is expected to do for the rest of this year. You'll recall that our operating basis net interest margin in 2010 was 168 basis points, and we are expecting it to be in the lower end of the 160 to 165 basis point range in 2011, excluding the impact of the unusually high level of client deposits in the third quarter. ", "Excluding the impact of the retention of those deposits and all else equal, we expect the 2012 net interest margin to behave similarly to that of 2011. Another key assumption affecting our outlook for revenue in 2011, we continue to expect the S&P 500 to average about 12.65 in 2011, up about 11% from 11.40, the average in 2010. ", "Finally, I'll briefly review our capital ratios. In the third quarter, State Street Corp.'s capital ratios under Basel I remained very strong. As of September 30, 2011, our total capital ratio stood at 19.6%, our Tier 1 leverage ratio stood at 7.8%, our Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 18.0%, our tangible common equity ratio was 7.1%, and our Tier 1 common ratio was 16%. Based on our understanding of the Basel III regulations and the information published by the Basel Committee and the Federal Reserve, we estimate our capital ratios under Basel III as of September 30, 2011, to be: our total capital ratio, 14.5%; our Tier 1 leverage ratio to be 6.0%; our Tier 1 capital ratio to be 12.8%; and our Tier 1 common ratio to be 11.7%. ", "So in conclusion, the economic outlook has continued to deteriorate over 2011. Pressure from economic uncertainty, coupled with the headwinds created from a low interest-rate environment and with expected increased compliance costs, has led us to focus intensely on growing revenue, executing our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program, as well as controlling expenses in general. We believe we have done a good job on all of these 3 measures in the first 9 months of 2011. ", "Now I'll turn the call back over to Jay.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Thanks, Ed. Since the global economy is recovering much more slowly than economists originally predicted, we're being increasingly vigilant about expense control. Given the difficult environment, I'm pleased that we achieved positive operating leverage compared to the second quarter of 2011, a testament to our attention to controlling expenses. The momentum of new business wins across all geographies in both servicing and asset management remains strong. As expense pressures intensify for our clients, they are increasingly looking to outsource more services to us. At the same time, clients are facing regulatory pressures and look to us for additional products and services to support them. We are continuing to invest in new products which address these client needs while continuing to differentiate us from our competitors. ", "I'm pleased with the progress we've made in executing our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. As we reported this morning, the pace of the program is ahead of forecast. ", "Our capital position remains strong, positioning us well for new capital standards while maintaining flexibility if the right acquisition present itself and enabling us to increase our returns to shareholders. Overall, I believe that it is the steady execution of our strategy that has enabled us to perform well during the first 9 months of this challenging year for the markets and for our industry. ", "Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind you once more that the purpose of today's call is to discuss our third quarter earnings, and we ask that you please limit your questions to topics involving our financial and operational results. With that, now I'd now like to open up the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "So, quickie, I heard all your comments on the new business front, which is still great, considering the backdrop. On the deposit front, can you give us a two-parter: one, where are the deposits coming from, and two, what do you do with them? In other words, what kind of duration are you thinking in your mind with these deposits, and what do you do on the asset side? It's a conundrum.", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, Glenn. It's Ed. In the third quarter, our average deposits were, in our estimation, about $15 billion over what the normal level is. They're around $33 billion as opposed to $18 billion, which is more normal. Most of this is DDA. Most of it is coming from U.S. customers. We've consistently been treating excess deposits around quarter-end for the last several years as transitory deposits, and as a result, we leave them at the Fed or the ECB or the Swiss National Bank as the case may be. In this quarter, they were left at the Fed, and we are 25 basis points on them.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Got it. So does that mean it's a quarter-end phenomenon, and they come in and out?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes. And that's been the case throughout the last couple of years. Glenn, if you recall, going back to a couple of years ago, year-end '08, I think we had $70 billion, and that's a point estimate, not an average. I gave you the average in my earlier numbers. But yes, they ebb and flow, and we treat them as though they're going to be not here for a long period of time.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "It's interesting. So given just the economic unrest in Europe, I've been under the assumption that we'd see some deposit growth there, as well as some new business flow. It looks like you got a little bit on the new business flow side, but you're not really seeing a heck of a lot of flight-to-quality on the deposits side.", "Edward J. Resch", "In this quarter, it happened to be more U.S. In prior quarters, other quarters, it's been weighted more towards Europe. It just depends on the way things go in the quarter.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "I think on the new business side, we do see a flight to quality with regard to our pretty consistent performance around acquiring new assets and new customers.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "On that front, is the pre-pipe, pipe conversations picking up given everything that's going on? I know if I was an administrator, I'd probably be looking around right now.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Is your question pipeline visibility?", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Yes.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, I'd say consistently strong, and I wouldn't say in it's way up or down. But we continue to have a broad range of conversations everywhere from traditional investment managers to, I continue to report, in the alternative asset classes. A lot of that business is previously in-sourced with a private-equity real estate firm being outsourced. So I would say that the other side of this depressed environment is that it is good for business because our customers, whether they're pension funds, investment managers or alternative managers, are looking for some relief around either expense, responding to new regulatory reporting. So the core business is good.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Ed, could you just take us back through the margin comments? I think I understood you saying that 2011 margin was excluding the weight from the liquid deposits? But I guess my questions are, can you just confirm that and what it means for the fourth quarter margin as a starter?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, I gave you both numbers, with and without. The 144 basis point number included the excess deposits, the $33 billion average number, if you will, okay? If we take those out for the third quarter, it was 157. Okay?", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I know what it was, but I'm saying your guidance for the low end of 160 to 165 is based on using that 157, not the 144.", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, that's correct.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So the question is, I would presume that those deposits are going to be pretty sticky, even though you consider them transitory. So can you give us a thought on just presuming that's now kind of a run rate for now, what gives you the confidence that the margin can only drip given that in the last 2 quarters, you've reinvested $25 billion at around a 1% reinvestment yield, with the portfolio still in the 2.5-ish type of range?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, we're not assuming that those deposits stay, and that's a conservative assumption. We're not taking them and putting them into the portfolio to any long duration or anything like that, Ken. So we continue to have them at the Fed. Just as a point of information through this call, through as of last night, the deposit level has stayed a little bit elevated, okay? So that's the point of information for you, the first couple of weeks of this quarter. In terms of why the margin won't decline more precipitously to your question, it's mainly because of the effect of us being 61% in floaters, and that's principally driven in Europe [indiscernible] getting the benefit by this quarter-end of the broker being somewhat elevated. So while the U.S.-based [indiscernible] security will decline [indiscernible] to reinvest in the low-rate environment, we're getting an uptick in Europe, which will modify the decline in U.S.-related margin. So that's why we feel pretty comfortable with what we're saying about the margin overall declining slowly.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. This last thing, can you just give us some clarity on if the ECB cuts from here, what's the risk to the margin if the ECB were to cut?", "Edward J. Resch", "If the ECB were to cut and all else equal in terms of the -- we're talking about a roughly $20 billion non-dollar investment portfolio. That's worth about $20 million in NIR annually per 25 basis point of cut. That's not something, Ken, that really will impact 2011. That's more a 2012 comment.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Of course, if it happened in November, December, the run rate on an annual basis is helpful just to understand that. Great.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from ISI Group.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Just to clarify once again on the 2012 NIM outlook, when you said behave similarly to 2011 and we look at sort of 1Q '11 starting out at about 166 on a core basis and drifting down to the 157 area, basically, are you saying that under the scenarios that you've outlined, we should expect around, say, about roughly 10 basis points of NIM pressure from current levels through, say, the end of 2012?", "Edward J. Resch", "A little early to give precise guidance, Brian, but our comments were intended to guide you that way, okay? I don't want to comment on whether it's 10 points or 12 points at this point. We'll give some guidance on the fourth quarter call more specifically. But the slow decline that has been evidenced over the last year is what we're trying to signal.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, that's good. Okay, great. And then just on the cost save program, the 400 basis points operating margin, what operating margin are you using for 2010? I know there's a lot of different ways to calculate that, but what's the actual number that you're basing it from?", "Edward J. Resch", "We're using our operating basis pretax margin of 28.8.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Okay, great. And then just a couple of things on the quarter. The core servicing fees were very good. Was there any negative impact from the dollar strengthening?", "Edward J. Resch", "Immaterial. I mean, on average, for the quarter, the dollar strengthened 2% against euro and 1% against sterling, so no material effect.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then on the securities processing costs, they were a little -- I guess they would imply they're about $15 million higher in the third quarter versus second based on your comment of that being responsible for the delta. Do you view that as an elevated level, or do you think you can improve upon that?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, I think the securities processing costs, as we talked about, over time, can move around a bit. They depend quarter to quarter on exactly what happens.  So I wouldn't say that's a run rate by any means. We've had some quarters this year and in recent years where they've been actually pretty low. So a $10 million or $15 million increase in the quarter is not a big delta there.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Right, okay. And then just lastly, on the $13 million of nonrecurring comp, and I think you said about $5 million in some other buckets. Should we be adding that to the $85 million restructuring cost number to get at a more sort of nonoperational run rate?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, I mean, that's money we're spending in order to execute on our Business Operations and IT Transformation Program. And we're trying to highlight that as being something that's in the run rate that probably goes away once we're done executing.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Right. That's part of that 15 to 20 that you've  been talking about.", "Edward J. Resch", "Right, exactly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.", "Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "I appreciate the additional color on the new business wins, and I think it's very helpful. And I guess just since we're always going to ask for more, is it possible to get some additional insight on the $200-odd billion to $245 billion wins, kind of a breakdown by alternative, pension, fund, just any color around kind of just in a general sense typically what kind of maybe a typical kind of revenue mix would be with $5 billion of alternative new wins kind of equivalent of like $100 billion of pension or any kind of metrics along those lines?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Rob, it's hard. The mixes vary. And actually, that's the good news, which is there's no one single engine firing. I think we're firing globally across asset classes. You saw a big European component this quarter, which, I think, is encouraging and probably indicative of the times. The alternatives continue to be a strong theme throughout this. I'd say the mix of business, the preponderance of it is multiproduct, kind of complex deals. The other thing I would add is I didn't mention specifically, but you may remember Scottish Widows was an early outsourcing deal that we had in the U.K. They've recently concluded to re-up that deal and add a number of additional assets. So some of the context is customers concentrating more of their activity with us. But it's really hard to give you 2 or 3 summary points. It's quite varied in a number of ways, which, again, I think is the strength in it.", "Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And I'm just curious. I mean, of course, M&A has been a consistent part of how you think of capital. Just curious of everything going on in Europe. Are you starting to finally see that activity tick up? It kind of felt like it was kind of a lot of expectations but maybe not a lot actually going on. You're actually starting to see people say, \"Okay, now, I need to see to do something,\" and pace of conversations is accelerating?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "I would say without being specific, it feels to me like we're getting closer to that time. I think if you -- we're all following the plight of the European banks and their need to either recapitalize or strengthen capital levels, and I think that most of that has been more discussion and less action. But I think as that moves to action, it's likely that we'll see opportunities. I assume your reference is to the custody books of business in Europe. So it just feels like we're moving in a positive direction. On a smaller scale, I mentioned the Complementa acquisition as well as the Pulse Trading. To me, those, in a different sort of way, represent some of the pressures that the world is feeling, small companies that no longer have the ability to invest or leverage from a revenue side their product. And in both of those cases, I think they're small but nice pickups which add great enhancement to our product mix and through which we should be able to leverage pretty materially the revenue side.", "Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And one last quick question for Ed. I'm just curious, a little bit more of a near-term modeling question, but of your $80 million run rate, I mean, any sense of how much of that is kind of in the numbers as of Q3?", "Edward J. Resch", "On the savings?", "Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Yes.", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes. Q3 numbers have about $18 million in there.", "Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "So there's a little bit of a back-end loading, I guess, in Q4 from the...", "Edward J. Resch", "A little more in Q4 in terms of run rate, yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just a follow-up on expenses. If we just kind of think about it maybe a little bit differently, so you guys are currently running with about $1.7 billion per quarter in expenses. Can you give us a sense how much of that is sort of fixed versus variable expenses? And then can we just assume that the bucket that's sort of fixed will just subtract the run rate numbers in savings that you guys have given out sort of in 2012, the $170 million number?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, it obviously depends over what period of time you're trying to define fixed and variable expenses, Alex, so in terms of...", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just on a year-to-date basis.", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, I mean, on a year basis, I think what you're proposing is fair in terms of taking the salary and benefit savings out of that number. Again, we have to anchor them all back to 2010 as our starting point, and the business has grown since 2010. But I think if you look at over a year and call the salary component and the related benefit costs variable, I think that's a fair characterization of it. Does that answer your question?", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, okay. So of the $1.7 billion total expenses, you would, I guess, think of salary and benefits as 100% variable?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, over a year within the context of the business ops and IT program, yes. I mean,  we're saying that most of the savings, more than 100% of the savings for the program will be coming out of that line over the life of the program.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "All right, understood. And then on capital deployment, and I guess, obviously, the situation with the regulator is always fluid, but can you talk about your preference looking out into next year? Dividend raises from current levels are like $0.18 a quarter versus buybacks. And then if you could also address the acquisitions in Europe more from a perspective of potential size of how big or small you guys will be looking for.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Sure. Let me start that one, Alex. Just to reframe the parameters here, we'll go into, at the end of this year, the next annual stress test. We'll get parameters in December and then deliver off our own self-evaluation stress test in January and should hear by the end of the first quarter from the regulators, how they view those stress test and capital available for deployment. With regard to preferences and priorities, I'd say it's always a point-in-time assessment, but we would like to get more capital back to shareholders. So buybacks are a bit of a priority for us. I'd also say that from an acquisition standpoint, the other part of your question, if you look at the landscape of what's possible and try to size those acquisitions very broadly, $0.5 billion to $2 billion is kind of a broad range of -- if we're talking about -- I suspect your question is pointed at custody roll-up acquisitions. They'd be in that broad framework of $0.5 billion to $2 billion. Does that answer your question?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Jay, just a follow-up on that last point on capital planning because you made some fairly constructive commentary within the release. Just given the strength in underlying business and the stock price, just hoping to get your thoughts on maybe taking up the payout ratio. I know you can only speak for yourselves, but we're seeing other firms not put up nearly as much profitability as you all but seemingly taking up kind of their payout ratio or capital return in the back half of the year.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "The back of this year, Howard?", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Right, like right now.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, I mean, I think if I understand your question, I mean, the Fed guidance is annual guidance. And so we get our next shot at having that discussion at the end of this year leading into next year. The payout ratio with regard to capital, I think, was pretty consistent among the banks. We think based on the strength of our capital, the relative risk of our business profile, that we should be in pretty good shape going into this year's stress test, and we'll argue for more flexibility with regard to returning capital to shareholders. I think the factors that -- so those are the factors unique to us. I think the other factor would be how the regulator views the broad environment and what criteria that they put forward against which we'll run our stress test. But we feel pretty good going in.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then, Ed, just another follow-up on the NIM and sensitivities. I realize the environment's fluid. You mentioned the sensitivity to an ECB cut, but what about potential sensitivity of things like the benefits of what we see into LIBOR and twist in the states? Is there any sort of potential offset there?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, we haven't seen much of an effect on us and, specifically, our mortgage-backed element of the portfolio because of twist. It looks like spreads are about 10 basis points tighter when all's said and done so far based on twist, so not a huge effect. I think with 3-month LIBOR widening out a bit and Fed funds staying where it is, there's a little bit of potential upside on securities lending, for example, if that would maintain itself and volumes would stay where they are. But I mean, overall, our interest rate risk position is fairly low with where we are with floaters as the mixture of floaters and fixed, and our shock and ramp tests are pretty low, a little bit bigger than they were in June given that we have a larger balance sheet. But overall, we're in a pretty low interest-rate risk position, so the sensitivity would not be that great.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then finally, thanks for all the details on the long-term efficiency program in the slide deck. I'm just realizing this is an invest-to-ultimately-save initiative. Can you provide a bit more details on maybe sort of the gross spending and net saving by year or quarter? I think that'd be helpful if possible.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Let me just  [indiscernible] that question up. Howard, I'll just remind you that I think it's often loss because of the focus on expense saves during this time, but I believe this is going to transform this company with regards to how it delivers new products to the market and how it responds to -- how it picks up the pace of responding to industry needs. So I don't want you to lose sight of that. But with that, Ed, do you want to comment on...", "Edward J. Resch", "Sure. Howard, if you look at Page 7, okay, what we're trying to present there is by year, by component of the program, what we believe the net benefits to be before nonrecurring project-related expenses, okay? So we break out the nonrecurring in order to show those expenses that we're incurring in order to execute the program, but we think we'll drive to 0, as you see, out in 2015, and their costs basically incurred to execute on the program. Everything that we are spending that we believe will be an offset to our savings, i.e. it's a permanent increase in expenses in order to execute the program or for whatever reason relative to this program is included in the net benefit numbers in the 2 lines, business operations transformation and information technology transformation. The only other element of cost other than the nonrecurring that we're probably breaking out are the expected restructuring charges, which I've already talked about.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "Can you quantify the pipeline? I guess you talked about installed business, but your total pipeline, where is that now and how does that compare to the start of last quarter?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "I don't know that we give necessarily pipeline visibility, but if you go back, Mike, 3 quarters we've been running as far as committed business in the $250 billion  to $350 billion a quarter. I think last year, it's probably closer to $350 billion down at $250 billion. So if I look at the visible pipeline, that doesn't seem like an unreasonable rate going forward as far as translating prospects to clients.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "All right. So it's pretty similar to what it's been?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, it's very steady and good.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "Okay. And your comment about consolidation in Europe, so you're still looking to do some deals in Europe, perhaps?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "I think the screen that we put over that is the strategic screen. I mean, we make these acquisitions because we think it positions us for future growth. And then I think given the environment, we'll be ever more discerning about price paid. So if it falls into the strategic sweet spot and it meets our hurdle rate for pricing, then we're a buyer.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "What about the tradeoff between repurchasing more of your own stock versus acquisitions? I mean, where is that tipping point? When your stock is really low, maybe it makes sense to buy more stock. If the stock goes up to $50, maybe it makes sense to do more deals. How do you think about that?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, I mean, we think about it as a point-in-time assessment. We're constantly looking at acquisitions. We're trying to measure the flexibility that we'll get through the stress test as far as our ability to purchase shares. And I think we -- at a point in time, you'll look at stock price and make that determination, but we're obviously very focused on that.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "And then separately, you get this question all the time, if you take all the expense savings that you expect and add it to the pretax margin, your margin would be even higher than, I guess, the 33%. What you're saying, you're saying 400 basis points higher than what it was in 2010. That was 29%. Add 400 basis points, you get to 33%. So I guess, it could be even higher. So I think just looking at this, it implies that you're going to reinvest 1/3 of the savings and let the other 2/3 hit the bottom line. Am I reading that correct?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "No. I think what we're saying is that, that 400 basis points of margin lift, pretax margin lift from 10 to 15 is a translation of that $600 million on a direct basis. So we're saying kind of all else equal -- which is we're in this constrained environment from a standpoint of equity markets, interest rates and the like, but all things being equal, that $600 million translates into 400 basis points of margin lift.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "Okay. So you're assuming it all kind of hits the bottom line then?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "So I guess you're, okay, maybe assuming some revenue loss, or I guess you don't want to give forecast so many years out, but how do you think about the revenues? Because that goes into the assumption.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, I mean, I think the revenues, if you break down the revenue equation, I think that we have demonstrated that we've performed pretty well in the core line items. We would expect that to continue. And over time, they get some help from markets and interest rates and cross-border investing and spreads, which help our securities, lending and other businesses. So we would project that we can continue to run at this rate from a revenue standpoint with, hopefully, some upside.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "And then last question. You said of your top 100 servicing clients, 75% of them have some portion of their assets with SSgA. Can you give the dollar amount of the overlap in revenues, those assets that are managed by SSgA for 75% of the top 100 servicing clients. What's the dollar amount of revenues of that business?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "I wouldn't have that off the top of my head. But what I would say is that you can assume that those top 100 customers are some of the top 100 financial institutions across the globe. So the SSgA comment is that not only it's a cross-sell, but I think when you look at SSgA's business and its upside, a lot of it's about cross-sell. So once you have a relationship with the big financial institution and you get your foot in the door, that's generally the best prospect for the next asset class to sell.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.", "Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Jay, you mentioned that you expect to hear about the SIFI buffer by the end of the year. Are you guys expecting to be a global SIFI or just a national SIFI?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "The expectation for the end of the year is largely tied to the Dodd-Frank-legislated SIFI, systemically important financial institution. And further, that would be -- we think a designation which would largely have Tier 1 capital in the 7% to 9.5% is going to be broadly thought to be the range. I think the global SIFI, which is -- my understanding doesn't add additional capital but puts you into a different club on a global scale, much less visibility on -- other than the broad considerations of size, complexity, interconnectedness and the like. So we really don't have any visibility on what the thinking is of trust banks in that group.", "Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And assuming you're just a national SIFI, what are you guys comfortable with in terms of the buffer? What do you think is appropriate for you folks? You just gave us a range which is commonly talked about for the bigger banks. Where do you think you guys fit in?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "I wouldn't comment on that. I think that you've got to look at -- and you can do this yourself. You look at the above-$50 billion financial institutions or banks in this country and look at the range of types and complexity, and the regulators are going to slot us in some way there, I'd be guessing, to put us in a certain bucket.", "Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And on the expense savings that you guys talked about and you detailed in great detail what you expect, the $600 million. From a static basis using your year-end '10 noninterest expense number of just around $6.8 billion, do you actually think your numbers would decline when we get to the final number, or is it just going to reduce the rate of growth?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, I mean, when we get to the final number, hopefully, what we've done has been to grow the company in the interim and take the $600 million of expense out. So I would expect that the overall level of expense in 2015 will be higher than what it was in 2010.", "Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then finally, just going back to your net interest margin comment about the operating margin in '10 being 168 basis points, and if you exclude out those extra deposits, you're going to be in this range of 160 to 165 for this year, at the lower end. If we keep those deposits in, as you pointed out last night, they're still there, where would you think that margin would be if those deposits end up staying for most of the quarter?", "Edward J. Resch", "Probably in the range of 5 to 8 basis points lower for the full year.", "Operator", "That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'll hand the program back over to management for any further comments or closing remarks.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "No, we would just say thank you and look forward to speaking with you at the end of the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

Today's discussion is being broadcast live on State Street's website at www.statestreet.com/stockholder.", "This call is also being recorded for replay. State Street's call is copyrighted. All rights are reserved. The call may not be recorded for rebroadcast or distribution in whole or in part without expressed written authorization from State Street, and the only authorized broadcast of this call is housed on State Street's website. [Operator Instructions] ", "Now I'd like to introduce Kelley MacDonald, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at State Street.", "S. Kelley MacDonald", "Good morning. Before Jay Hooley, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ed Resch, our Chief Financial Officer, begin their remarks, I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in State Street's 2010 annual report on Form 10-K and its subsequent filings with the SEC.", "We encourage you to review those filings, including the sections on Risk Factors concerning any forward-looking statements we make today. Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of today, January 18, 2012, and the corporation does not undertake to revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after today.", "I'd also like to remind you that you can find a slide presentation regarding the corporation's investment portfolio as well as our fourth quarter 2011 earnings news release, which includes reconciliations of non-GAAP measures referred to on this webcast in the Investor Relations portion of our website. ", "Now I'll turn the call over to Jay.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Thanks, Kelley, and good morning. Our full year 2011 results, which include double-digit growth in our total fee revenue and earnings per share as compared to 2010, reflect the strength of our franchise in the face of volatile equity markets and continued uncertainty in Europe. ", "In addition to remarks about the 2011 and fourth quarter results, this morning, I'll make some comments about the economic outlook, our continuing success generating new business in our core asset servicing and asset management businesses, the ongoing progress of our business ops and information technology transformation program, as well as our plans for leveraging our strong capital position. ", "As we began 2010, like many others anticipated, the first half of the year would be challenging and that the U.S. and European economies would improve in the second half, increasing our prospects for growth. ", "After a strong first half, Europe weakened in mid-May and a major rating agency downgraded the credit rating of the U.S., resulting in very challenging and extremely volatile markets in the second half, with the U.S. market recovering at the very end of the year. This second half environment significantly affected investor confidence, and we saw a broad-based derisking of our clients, which put pressure on our servicing and management fee revenue. ", "Compared to the third quarter, our fourth quarter revenue for trading services also declined due to the weak environment in the capital markets. Based on the weakening global market environment at year end, we accelerate our expense control program. In particular, our compensation and benefit expenses were reduced by about $145 million or 7%, comparing the second half with the first half of 2011. Part of this reduction is due to the successful execution of our business operations and information technology transformation program and the remainder due to incremental actions we took regarding incentive compensation. ", "We expect this weakness in the capital markets to continue into 2012, and so this morning, we announced measures that will result in a further reduction in the run rate of expenses in our capital markets-facing businesses. As part of our annual review of all of our businesses, we also recently announced our withdrawal from the fixed income trading initiative. This decision reflects a number of factors, including continuing market turmoil and regulatory changes both in the U.S. and Europe that likely would have required us to increase capital and expenses associated with this initiative. ", "Despite the challenging environment, we continue to add new business to the core franchise. In the fourth quarter, we added about $590 billion in new assets to be serviced and had $109 billion in gross new business at State Street Global Advisors. One notable anticipated departure in SSgA assets was the $41 billion of planned assets from -- planned asset sales from accounts we manage for the U.S. Treasury. ", "For the full year 2011, of the $1.4 trillion in new service wins, about $560 billion or 40% were from non-U.S. clients, and of the $109 billion wins in U.S. in SSgA, $39 billion or about 36% were from non-U.S. clients. Among our large and new mandates was AllianceBernstein for investment manager operations outsourcing for more than $360 billion in assets. In addition, we also won a mandate from American Century, which awarded us custody, accounting and fund administration for its '40 Act Mutual Funds totaling about $90 billion in assets. Also, PEMCO renewed its long-standing relationship with us for investment manager operations outsourcing services for assets totaling approximately $1.3 trillion. The state of Washington renewed its agreement with us for servicing and securities finance for $75 billion in assets. SSgA was awarded a mandate to provide fixed income management for EUR 82 billion for the BNL-BNP Paribas employees pension fund, one of the largest pension funds in Italy. ", "Regarding the timing of installations, as of December 31, 2011, we had installed $1.1 trillion of the $1.4 trillion in new asset servicing wins this year. We expect to install the remaining $300 billion in 2012. ", "In the alternative asset servicing area, demand remained strong. This quarter, we added 38 new mandates in our alternative investment servicing business, and our alternative assets under administration increased from $793 billion as of September 30, 2011, to $816 billion as of December 31, 2011. ", "At State Street Global Advisors, of the $109 billion in gross new mandates in the fourth quarter, $20 billion is scheduled to be installed in 2012. We continue to benefit from the concentrated effort to cross sell products between asset servicing and asset management. Illustrating the power of the franchise, 77 of the top 100 clients of State Street are clients of both investor servicing and SSgA. Those 77 clients generated 40% of SSgA's total 2011 revenue. ", "Let me now share our outlook for the global economy. We expect G7 economies to grow modestly about 1.5% in 2012, similar to the slow growth experienced in 2011. Additionally, we expect a slowdown in emerging market economies, resulting in weak expectations for the capital markets. All major central banks are on hold or are easing. The potential fallout from the European debt crisis remains as a significant risk factor, and the market remains cautious. Destruction of household wealth due primarily to a drop in housing prices as well as the decline in equity valuations is limiting growth in consumer spending. Therefore, in the U.S., we expect a very slow but sustainable recovery. ", "As we indicated when we announced our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program in November 2010, we expected the expense savings in 2011 would be slight. However, when the global economy weakened in mid-year, we accelerated our program, and our total expense savings in 2011, excluding restructuring costs, were approximately $86 million. ", "Through this program, we continue to expect to achieve 400 basis point improvement in our operating basis pretax margin compared to 2010 by the end of 2015, all else equal. ", "In 2012, we expect to add 2 additional global centers of excellence to balance our global footprint. The cloud computing infrastructure has been installed and is in production. We continue to scale this technology as we migrate major systems through 2014. ", "In 2012, we also expect to have substantially completed the transition to the 2 strategic partners we announced in mid-2011. As a result of these activities in 2012, we expect to achieve an annual pretax run rate expense save of $94 million, bringing the anticipated annual pretax run rate expense savings to $180 million compared to the expense rate in 2010, all else equal. ", "This program is going to substantially transform State Street, both in terms of service to our clients, more rapid development of new products as well as significant reduction of our expenses. ", "I also want to update you on our capital position, which remain very strong in the fourth quarter. We continue to await the capital requirements for globally systemic important financial institutions. At this time, we expect to know these requirements by the end of 2012, enabling us to evaluate the effect on State Street and on our expectations for return on equity. ", "In the fourth quarter, we purchased approximately 5.6 million of our common shares, which brought the total shares purchased in 2011 to 16.3 million. This completed the $675 million program announced in March 2011. We also announced a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share in the fourth quarter. We've submitted this year's capital plan to the Fed Reserve and expect to hear back in March. And we continue to prioritize increasing return of capital to shareholders through dividends and our share repurchase program. ", "Due to the strength of our capital position, we were able to take these actions while retaining the flexibility to respond to future acquisition opportunities should they become available. Regarding our recent acquisitions, in 2011, we added 2 small acquisitions, both of which strengthen our product capability. Complementa in Switzerland, which provides performance measurement and analytics to asset managers and banks, pension funds and insurance companies, primarily in Switzerland and Germany, and Pulse Trading in the United States, which enhances our electronic trading capabilities by adding an equity crossing platform that we can cross sell to our client base. ", "I'll now turn the call over to Ed, who will discuss our results for the fourth quarter, the performance of our investment portfolio and provide additional details on our capital position. Then I'll return to provide some final remarks before opening the call to your questions. Ed?", "Edward J. Resch", "Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. As Jay said, this morning, I'll cover 3 areas: first, the results of the fourth quarter; second, I'll summarize the performance of and outlook for the investment portfolio as well as worldwide interest rates and the impact on our net interest margin; and finally, I'll review our strong capital position. I'll present some of the more significant results first, comparing 2011 with 2010 and then comparing the fourth quarter to the third quarter of 2011. And this morning, all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today's earnings news release. ", "First, comparing full year 2011 with 2010. The revenue from almost all of our businesses increased. Our servicing fee revenue increased by 11%, due primarily to net new business and the impact of market appreciation, as well as acquisitions. Our asset management fee revenue increased 11%, due primarily to stronger equity markets and the impact of an acquisition. ", "Regarding trading services and securities finance. Foreign-exchange revenue increased 14%, brokerage and other fee revenue improved 6% and securities finance was up 19%, due primarily to improved spreads. Net interest revenue increased 6%, due primarily to an increase in lower cost deposits, offset partially by lower yields. ", "Our net interest margin averaged 152 basis points in 2011 or 160 basis points, excluding the impact of excess deposits in the second half of 2011.", "Comparing the results of the fourth quarter 2011 with the third quarter. Across both our asses servicing and asset management businesses, we have seen investors become more risk-averse, given economic uncertainty in Europe and the continued volatility in equity markets. Investors are shifting from global and emerging market equity strategies into more conservative, lower-risk asset classes, such as money market funds and insured deposits. ", "Servicing fee revenue declined 4% to $1.05 billion due to mix shifts and negative flows as a result of investors' risk-averse behavior, the impact of the strong dollar and lower valuations in the European equity markets. To put this decline in context, the daily average valuation of the S&P 500 was flat compared to the third quarter, and the MSCI EAFE was down about 7%. ", "The VIX, which measures the change in equity market volatility, was near its historical average at 23 to close the quarter at 23.40 after starting the quarter at an elevated level [ph] 43. ", "Similarly, the 3-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rate closed the quarter at about 58 basis points, having begun the quarter at about 37 basis points and averaging about 48 basis points in the quarter. Investors reacted to these worldwide economic events by adjusting their portfolios, thereby affecting the mix of assets under custody as well as investment management flows. ", "Investors transitioned from higher-risk strategies, such as those in international and emerging markets, to cash and fixed income. In either case, they remained in our assets under administration, but the revenue was lower. ", "Investment management fee revenue declined by 12% to $202 million, due primarily to negative flows and active equities, fixed income and cash. The latter was the result of lower demand and securities finance. The average of the 3-month end valuations as measured by the S&P 500 was up about 3% compared to the third quarter, and the MSCI EAFE was down 5%. ", "In total, in the fourth quarter, we experienced $89 billion of negative net new business, which was comprised principally of the $51 billion decline in cash assets and the planned $41 billion redemption by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. ETFs, however, had one of their best quarters, adding about $12 billion in flows. ", "While cash assets under management, excluding securities lending cash in the fourth quarter, was about the same as the third quarter, the revenue decline was affected by a mix shift from prime money market funds into U.S. government funds, which reduced revenue. As a result of this shift, we expect our money market fund fee waivers to increase from about $5 million per quarter to about $10 million per quarter should this trend be maintained. ", "Trading services revenue declined 18% to $273 million. Foreign-exchange revenue declined 26% to $150 million due to weaker volumes and lower volatility. ", "In foreign exchange, for the first time, we are experiencing a decline in indirect foreign-exchange products as this area of the business has come under increased scrutiny. Some clients have chosen to move to electronic exchange, which we offer through our Street FX product or through Currenex, or have decided to transact using our direct services. We have several different ways through which a client may choose to transact foreign exchange with us, and so while the type of transaction may be changing, the clients find one of our other services to be a value to them. ", "Brokerage and other fees declined 5% to $123 million, primarily due to weaker transition management revenue. Securities finance revenue increased 6% to $90 million based on an improvement in spreads. ", "In the quarter, the 3-month LIBOR to Fed funds effective spread was 40.6. Securities on loan averaged $340 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011, down from $368 billion for the third quarter of 2011 and from $368 billion for the fourth quarter of 2010, both declines due to reduced demand. Average lendable assets for the fourth quarter of 2011 were about $2.23 trillion, down 2% from $2.28 trillion, the same level in the third quarter of 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2010. ", "As of December 31, 2011, the duration of the securities finance book was approximately 17 days, up from 12 days in the third quarter of 2011 and flat with 17 days in the fourth quarter of 2010. ", "Processing and other fee revenue declined 50% to $45 million, due primarily to the fair value adjustment relative to the positions in the fixed income trading initiative that we are exiting. The large decline from the prior quarter was also the result of $22 million of gains in the third quarter related to real estate and certain leases. ", "Net interest revenue of $577 million increased about 2% in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to an increase in earning assets driven by an increase in lower-cost client deposits, offset partially by lower investment yields. ", "We continue to benefit from clients leaving additional deposits with us in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, clients left on average about $23 billion of excess deposits compared to $15 billion in the third quarter. The additional deposits contributed to slightly higher net interest revenue in the fourth quarter. An average of $19 billion in increased client deposits was left with State Street in the second half 2011 compared to the first half. ", "Including the excess deposits left with State Street in the fourth quarter, operating basis net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 140 basis points. Excluding those deposits, net interest margin would have been about 158 basis points compared to 157 basis points in the third quarter. This increase in net interest margin from the third quarter was primarily due to the improved yields on the fixed income securities purchased in the fourth quarter. ", "We maintained tight controls on expenses. Our compensation and benefits expenses decreased 10% or $93 million from the third quarter of 2011 to approximately $872 million, due primarily to lower salaries and employee benefits, achieved partially from the acceleration of the business operations and IT Transformation Program, as well as reductions in incentive compensation. Compensation and benefits expenses included about $13.5 million in nonrecurring costs related to the implementation of this program, with another $13.8 million reported in several other expense lines on the income statement. ", "In the fourth quarter of 2011, compensation and benefits expenses were approximately 38.1% of total revenue, down from 40.0% in the third quarter, which was down from 40.8% in the second quarter, which was down again from 41.8% in the first quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our full year ratio is 40.2%. ", "Other expenses were $274 million, up about 6% compared to the third quarter, primarily due to increased fees for professional services including nonrecurring costs incurred in executing the Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. ", "As Jay said, our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program is proceeding as planned. As we said when we announced the program in November of 2010, we expect the run rate of nonrecurring expenses to peak in 2012, averaging about $25 million per quarter, up from an average of about $20 million per quarter in 2011. The amount of net pretax run rate incremental savings for 2012 is expected to be $94 million, slightly higher than the update we provided on our third quarter call due to the acceleration of this program. ", "Our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2011, increased about $2.7 billion compared to September 30, 2011, to $109.8 billion. During the fourth quarter, we invested about $12.9 billion in highly rated securities at an average price of 102.31 with an average yield of 2.34% and a duration of approximately 2.56 years. This is less than we have invested in the prior 3 quarters of 2011 because, as we have discussed with you, we invested early in 2011 to capture what we perceived to be good investment opportunities. ", "The $12.9 billion of purchases was composed of the following securities: $1.1 billion in U.S. Treasury securities; $6.3 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities; $3.8 billion of asset-backed securities, including about $2.1 billion of foreign RMBS, mostly in the U.K; with the remaining $1.7 billion being invested in U.S. securities backed by credit card receivables, student loans and floating rate auto receivables. The remainder was invested in smaller amounts in various miscellaneous asset classes. The aggregate net unrealized after-tax loss in our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios as of December 31, 2011, was $374 million compared to a net unrealized after-tax loss of $259 million as of September 30, 2011, and an improvement of about $130 million from December 31, 2010, when we -- the net unrealized after-tax loss was $504 million. ", "The deterioration in net unrealized after-tax position compared to September 30, 2011, was due primarily to a modest widening in spreads. In our investment portfolio presentation, we have updated the data through quarter end for you to review. And as of December 31, 2011, our portfolio was 89% AAA or AA rating. ", "The duration of the investment portfolio was 1.49 years, up from 1.09 years at September 30, 2011, due primarily to purchase of agency mortgage-backed fixed-rate securities. The duration gap of the entire balance sheet was 0.36 years, up from 0.09 years at September 30, 2011. This duration is in line with our historical duration gap, which we target to be a maximum of 0.5 year. ", "Regarding European assets. We do not own any sovereign debt from the peripheral countries of Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy or Ireland in our investment portfolio. Of our non-U.S. assets, we hold about $1.2 billion in securities from those peripheral countries, primarily RMBS and all floating-rate securities. About $500 million from Italy, $400 million from Spain and about $100 million each from Ireland, Greece and Portugal. All are performing within expectations and remain current as to principal and interest. Substantially, all our prime mortgages and the mortgages backing these securities all have relatively low loan-to-value ratios.", "On Page 7 of the investment portfolio presentation, we list all of our non-US investments and show the average rating as well as the asset types we hold. Our primary non-U.S. holdings are British, Australian, German, Canadian and Netherlands securities, totaling 93% of the non-U.S. investment portfolio. At SSgA, our Eurozone exposure in the investment funds is consistent with client mandates. We hold the non-U.S. fixed income portfolios at their benchmark weightings ratings, and our actively managed cash portfolios have minimal exposure to the peripheral countries. ", "Regarding pre-tax conduit-related accretion, we expect to record a total of about $1.1 billion in interest revenue from January 1, 2012, through the remaining terms of the former securities, including about $140 million in 2012. These expectations are based on numerous assumptions, including holding the securities to maturity, anticipated prepayment speeds, credit quality and sales. As of December 31, 2011, 59% of our investment portfolio was invested in floating-rate securities and 41% in fixed-rate securities. ", "Now for our outlook on net interest margin. First of all, let me emphasize that we continue to believe that we should invest through the cycle. We also intend to invest in highly rated AAA- or AA-rated securities, agency mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities. I'll now review some of the assumptions we used in determining our 2012 outlook for net interest revenue and net interest margin. We believe that the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates on hold through at least mid-2013 and possibly beyond. The ECB has cut rates to 100 basis points, and we expect them to hold that level through the end of 2012. ", "If the ECB rate declines further, we estimate our NIR will decline by approximately $25 million on an annual basis for each 25 basis point reduction. We believe the Bank of England will hold its base rate at 50 basis points through 2012. We project a potential reduction of 25 basis points from that rate by the Bank of England with lower net interest revenue by about $5 million annually in 2012. ", "With these rate assumptions in mind, should our client deposits return to a more normalized level, then we would expect our average net interest margin for the full year 2012 to be between 145 and 155 basis points. Should the current level of excess deposits remain on State Street's balance sheet for which we receive a low rate of interest, then our net interest margin could be at the lower end of this range. ", "In the fourth quarter, State Street Corporation's capital ratios under Basel I remained very strong. As of December 31, 2011, our total capital ratio stood at 20.5%. Our Tier 1 leverage ratios stood at 7.8%. Our tier 1 capital ratios stood at 18.0%. Our TCE ratio was 7.1%, and our Tier 1 common ratio was 16.0%. ", "Based on our understanding of the Basel III regulations and the information published by the Basel Committee and the Federal Reserve, we estimate our capital ratios under Basel III as of December 31, 2011, to be: total capital, 14.5%; our Tier 1 leverage ratio to be 6.0%; our Tier 1 capital ratio to be 12.8%; and our Tier 1 common ratio to be 11.7%. ", "For 2012, we expect the S&P to average about 1328, an increase of 5% above 2011's daily average of 1268 and the EAFE to decline 7.2% to 1494 from 1609 based on our view of little growth and market disruption in this region in 2012. ", "In conclusion, while the economy in the United States appears to be very slowly repairing, the global economic outlook has continued to be uncertain. The headwinds created from the low interest rate environment, new regulatory requirements, increased compliance costs and the outlook for weak capital markets have led us to focus intensely on growing revenue, executing our business operations of information technology transformation program and controlling expenses in general in 2012. ", "Now I'll turn the call over to Jay to conclude our remarks.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Thanks, Ed. Given the difficult environment during the second half of 2011 and the effect it had on investor confidence, we remain cautious about 2012. Should the improved U.S. markets we saw at the end of the year and so far this year be sustained, we'd expect investors to re-risk, improving the outlook for growth. ", "Given our outlook, we intend to continue to exercise expense control and to successfully execute on our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. We expect our core business momentum to continue. ", "Our new business wins in 2011 were strong, and our prospect pipeline again looks good going into 2012. As has been the case for the past decade, our cross-sell revenue has been robust, demonstrating the power of our franchise. Our capital position remains strong, positioning us well for the new Basel standards, while maintaining flexibility if the right acquisition presents itself and providing the resources to increase our returns to shareholders. I believe that in 2011, the resilience of our strategy allowed us to achieve strong results and enabled us to achieve a capital position among the highest in our industry. We intend to apply the same principles to our business in 2012, in what we expect to be a continuing difficult environment. ", "Before opening up the call to your questions, I remind you that our annual investor and analyst meeting will be held on February 9. During that meeting, we'll provide additional comments on our outlook for 2012. ", "Now Ed and I are happy to entertain your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "You continue to see great balance sheet growth during the quarter. Just curious, as the macro-environment says fairly choppy, are you seeing anything kind of unique and interesting about some of these continual frictional or nonfrictional inflows?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, we saw a continuation of the third quarter into the fourth quarter with, actually, some increase, Howard. As I noted, we went from an excess deposit position of $15 billion in Q3 to $23 billion on average in Q4. We actually, as the year has started, are seeing a bit of a return to back to a more normal level on those deposits, but it's only been a short period of time. So hard to extrapolate a trend from that. But that's where we are short time into the year so far.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then thanks for all the detail on the NIM outlook. I guess there's debate that the ECB will cut further ahead of quantitative easing measures. I'm just curious, from your point of view, is there anything you can and would do to shift around some of the asset liability management, given either that view and what we're seeing in the U.S. in terms of the rise on the short end of the curve?", "Edward J. Resch", "No, not really. I mean, we feel pretty comfortable where we are, around that 60, 40 floating fixed level, Howard. Again, our investment plan is predicated on the rate forecast I gave you for the year. So I don't think we're anticipating much of a change from that.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And then my final one's on just on capital return and payout. Ed, you walked through all the strength of the ratios at the end of the year. Maybe, Jay, I'm just hoping to get your appetite and potential ability to potentially increase that payout ratio in 2012.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, sure, Howard. Let me comment on that. As you know, we've recently submitted our CCAR plan. And as we expressed, our capital ratios is strong and getting stronger, and we think on a relative basis, some of the strongest in the industry. Based on that, it would be our hope to increase both our dividend payout as well as the level of share buybacks that we're -- that we had in 2011. So our hope would be to increase on both fronts.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And is there a sense of where you would like to take that, Jay, in the upper bounds?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "I won't say right now, Howard. Just that given the capital that we have, we think that increasing both of those is appropriate, and we'll see what the regulator's reaction is.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Two questions for you. First, a follow-on on Howard there. As part of the CCAR and then your outlook for other uses of capital management, you've commented on this last quarter, but just given that you've now submitted, maybe you have a better understanding. You have an expectation of hoping to get some decent amounts of dividends and buybacks in the CCAR plan. Can you talk to us about how M&A would be either included within that plan? Would it be a crowd out to buyback activity or could it be incremental? And as a part of that then, second part of the question is just then how is the European landscape continuing to evolve and opportunities that you see out there?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Sure, Ken, let me -- short answer is we would view it as incremental. So as you know, the CCAR process really attempts to assess existing capital position, and we make judgments about any distributions for 2012. Doesn't really deal with existing capital levels or ability to take on acquisitions. So our view is that we should be able to increase the dividend and the buyback while leaving sufficient capacity to take on any acquisition within reason. I've given you in the past, within the investor services or custody space, we would view most acquisitions to be in the kind of $0.5 billion to $2 billion range. So based on our assessment, we think we could do all those things. And Ken, I think the other part of your question was really just the environment...", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "The other part of the question is just regard to appetite and what -- obviously, the European dislocation disruption continues, banks are now formally shedding assets. What -- how do you look at the landscape? Do you think this is going to be an active year? Are there going to be opportunities on the table for you guys?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, I do think it will be an active year, I think, for all the reasons that you've mentioned. We've got European banks recapitalizing, continued pressure on capital ratios. So -- and we've seen, I guess, some evidence in 2010, not necessarily in the trust and custody space of European banks -- 2011, shedding assets. I think that will continue, and we remain poised. So I think the environment is a positive one, and we think we're better positioned than anybody.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And my second question is for Ed. Ed, you mentioned this in your prepared remarks about why some of the revenues in core business servicing and management were down because of customer derisking. But I just want to try to understand the juxtaposition between new business versus where the market's active versus transaction activity. So just how much of the decline in revenues was really related -- I guess -- trying to get the best way to ask it. Just the net of all those things was obviously negative, but how much of it was just the transactional activity versus the markets and then the positive and new business?", "Edward J. Resch", "I'd say, if you're looking for an attribution in terms of the -- for the quarter, right? Sequentially, the stronger dollar and market attribute about 1/3 of the delta. And I'd say the other factors, which you're calling customer activity, client activity, is the other 2/3.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And would you say that's the same in both servicing and -- that's more for servicing. Is it the same in -- and in asset management, it was more just flows?", "Edward J. Resch", "Much more skewed toward the client activity, 10 versus 90, something like that.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, got it. And so is that the type of thing that can reverse pretty quickly or if this environment stays where it is, that kind of level of activity could stay as low as it was?", "Edward J. Resch", "I think it is environmental dependent. If the environment does reverse, we could see a return back to more normal customer flows and levels. But if this environment continues the way it unfolded in Q4, we could see these types of levels being maintained.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Sorry to go back to the previous question. But it feels like you guys are winning new business and sort of higher fee revenues, and I get that activity levels were a little bit lower. But do you think if we just kind of think about the custody business and the fee rate that you're earning today, on a go-forward basis, is that a decent run rate? And then a similar question for the asset management. It feels like the big runoff you guys had in the treasury win was extremely low fee, so it feels like the fact that you had some outflows there should actually benefit the fee rate, not drive it lower. So what's -- do you think the fourth quarter, I guess, is a good run rate on a fee rate basis for both of those businesses?", "Edward J. Resch", "Tough to prognosticate into the future. I mean, our market assumptions for next year are, on average, as I said, the S&P up about 5%. So I would think that there could be some uplift if that actually materializes, Alex. I mean, we are a little more cautious on EFA, as I noted in terms of our market assumption. I think rates are pretty well and certainly, in the U.S., a given. I think most people accept the fact that the Fed's going to stay at 25 for a protracted period of time. So assuming those environmental factors play out, I would not feel comfortable saying that the fourth quarter is a run rate to extrapolate into the future. I mean, certainly, we plan on having the business grow, and that's always the way we approach a year going in from a budget standpoint. So it is, though, partly, dependent on the markets, the environment and how customers feel about risking or rerisking or continuing to be in a relatively derisked position.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Okay, and the next question, so speaking of budgeting expenses, it feels like this is probably a decent run rate on a quarterly basis. So Ed, when you're thinking about next year off of this kind of like a $1.6 billion per quarter run rate, what do you think is a normal growth and kind of like your core expenses? And then should we just think about the incremental $90-plus million savings that you've highlighted kind of -- just on top of that from an overall dollar perspective for next year?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, again, I don't want to predict quarterly levels but -- in terms of expenses, but I think that the way to think about it is broadly, as you said, that we have an incremental contribution coming from the ops and IT transformation, which needs to be factored into the run rate. Obviously, the expense run rate is, in large part, calibrated based on the revenue performance of the company. And we're cognizant of that as we think about both our budget and our -- any adjustments we need to make either way, up or down. The other thing that I think you need to factor into your thinking is that we still see some headwinds from a regulatory cost and a compliance standpoint. That number is -- we estimate to be around $30 million annual next year. So that's going up from a $50 million number this year as we continue to work through the new regulatory landscape, figure out the effects of Dodd-Frank, et cetera. So -- and the other point that I mentioned in my comments, Alex, is that we expect the costs associated with implementing the ops and IT program this year to increase next year. So that would be an increment to the run rate. They will peak in 2012 at about $25 million a quarter. So there's a couple of moving pieces on the expense side, but I'd say, if you look at all of those things and then try to calibrate them to how the revenue environment is shaping up, that should give you an idea of what we're probably going to do on the expense side.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. So put in another word, $90 million in savings, but the offset is drag of $30 million and maybe a little bit more in the implementation, maybe net savings of, I don't know, call it, $50 million to $60 million and then the core will grow on revenue.", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, I mean, I think that's generally okay. But again, you have to look at the fourth quarter. We moved the incentive compensation down reflective of results. I mean, if the opposite is true, we may move some of that up. If you look at the first quarter, we have a bump in comp in the first quarter based on the accounting associated with our bonuses for the early-retirement eligible people. So it's a little tough to just take a quarterly average and kind of run it out through 2012. There's some peaks and valleys potentially.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got you. And then my last one, just on your comments regarding foreign change. I think this is the first time we heard of Charlesbank [ph] kind of talk specifically about some clients deciding to shift into other areas. So you alluded some of the decline this quarter, 26%, was partially driven by the shift in, call it, client mix. How much more of a drag do think this could be for you guys going forward, given how much money you're currently generating from the indirect business?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "I would say it's hard to predict. I would say, though, that for 2 years now, this has been a subject of discussion and debate, and customers have talked to us about the various ways of executing foreign exchange. And what you saw this quarter, although it was not a major driver, was more of a decline in volumes of volatility. But we saw some evidence of clients moving to different options. And as I've said repeatedly, we have all the options that are necessary, so no customers are leaving. And I'd expect over time, you'll continue to see some movement in that direction. What we're planning to counteract that is we're looking to drive more volume in the foreign exchange business, not only with our existing customers but new customers as well. So where that all levels out, it's hard to say, but not surprising that were seeing some movement in the direction of alternative execution platforms.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with ISI Group.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Just on the lines of the FX question before, what was the proportion of FX revenue from the indirect channel in the quarter?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Ed's going to look that up.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And I guess, while he's looking on that, just another housekeeping. On the run rate savings, the $180 million, the way we should be thinking about that is $180 million lower expenses in the fourth quarter of '12 versus the fourth quarter of 2010, is that correct?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, that would be right, Brian. So full effect run rate at end of year.", "Edward J. Resch", "Brian, the answer to your question is about 50-50.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "50-50. Okay. That's up from last quarter. Okay. And then on the excess deposits. Ed, in your comments on the net interest margin, did you include any more aggressive investment of the excess deposits? I guess if they stick around a little bit longer, is there a possibility you could invest that in longer duration or do your assumptions basically assume continued very short investment in those excess deposits?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, it assumes more the latter in terms of keeping any excess deposits we have at central banks. We are, though, assuming, more of a normal level of excess deposits, if I could say that, and probably about half the level of the fourth quarter. We averaged $23 billion in the fourth -- $23 billion in the fourth quarter. Our planning for 2012 is about half of that, so we're on $11 billion on average. So it's more driven by that.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And is there any chance you could invest at a longer duration, or would you definitely continue to keep it short?", "Edward J. Resch", "I think we're of the view to keep it short. I mean, it's pretty transitory for the most part. I mean, just to put that in perspective, our point estimate at 1231 for excess deposits was $50 billion, 5-0. All right? So we're pretty cautious about where that -- where we put that.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Where you invest that, okay. And then you gave us your assumptions on the short-term rates globally, but can you talk a little bit about where you see intermediate rates, say, a 2- to 3-year treasury and a 10-year treasury for 2012 in terms of your NIM assumptions?", "Edward J. Resch", "About it is now, where it is now [indiscernible] have changed.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, Jay, can you talk about the timing of the new businesses installments and the -- what was installed in the fourth quarter and what you have left to install in 2012, given the business that you've won so far on the custody side?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Well, Brian, I think the number for the fourth quarter was $590 billion on the asset servicing business, and I believe there's $300 billion to be implemented. I'd say the majority of that in the first, a little leakage into the second quarter, so it's kind of front part of the year loaded.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "$300 billion to -- in the first half. And then was $590 billion installed? No, no. $590 billion was won in the fourth quarter, right?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "$590 billion was won in the fourth quarter, and off that, so $290 billion was installed in the fourth quarter and $300 billion flows over into 2012.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Got it. Okay. And then on the processing fees, you mentioned a couple of different, obviously, onetime items. Should we be thinking of that run rate at around that $70 million level or lower, given the new business -- or I'm sorry, given the exit of the business, the fixed income business and...", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, there's been some noise in that line both ways in the last couple of quarters, Brian, some gains that were nonrecurring, and we would expect that fair value adjustment that I referred to as being nonrecurring in that line. So I think the -- kind of the average is probably better around that $70 million level, something like that.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just lastly, just to Jay, you did hit about 10% EPS growth on an operating basis in 2011 if we use the $0.93 for the fourth quarter. What's your thought about -- I know you try to grow your EPS about 10% to 15% annually, and you try to hit that every year. Obviously, we're in a tough revenue environment. What's your thought about controlling expenses to try to make that 10% EPS growth again in 2012?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, we -- I mean, I guess I'd begin by saying that we consider this to be a little bit of an abnormal environment in 2012 where we think we did a good job in generating EPS in 2011. It was driving the expense line. It was driving revenue. It was returning capital to shareholders. Now that -- to me, that theme is going to carry forward in 2012 where we're driving revenue on all fronts, looking at new business, cross sell, examining fee schedules, fee increases, new products. So we're driving on all fronts there. And I think you've seen, particularly evidenced by the fourth quarter, that we're prepared to take expense action in order to make sure that we calibrate to the environment from the standpoint of generating earnings. So expect more of the same for 2012. And we'll give you a little bit more insight when we get together in February at the investor and analyst conference as far as some of the underlying assumptions, which drive top line, bottom line and EPS. But I'm not in a position to do that right now.", "Edward J. Resch", "Brian, just to circle back to your FX question in the interest of completeness. 50-50 is FX, excluding the electronic execution. If you include the electronic execution, indirect's about 1/3 [indiscernible]. Okay?", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.", "Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Jay, can you share with us -- in the past, you've talked about going back to the installed base and renegotiating maybe some pricing for your products. How is that proceeding? And are you having better luck with smaller clients or larger clients on winning price increases?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, Howard -- sorry, Gerard. I would say it's a journey. I think we've been at it for a while. I think -- when I look at, call it, broadly pricing power, the way I think about that is, first and foremost, we need to continue to develop and create new products so that we can differentiate ourselves. Because without differentiation, it's hard to get fee increases or pricing power. So combined with that, the more complex the deal, the better opportunity there is for differentiation and therefore pricing leverage, which naturally takes you to the larger end of our client base. I think in the smaller end of the client base, we can increase price through pricing increases, and it's probably easier to do, but it's got less impact. So our focus is really on looking at -- I think we have very good customer base profitability metrics, and all of our account teams know what target margins are and they're using all their tools within their power, cross-selling, fee increases to make sure that we get paid for the value that we're creating. And I think there's been some evidence of the ability to increase fees. I'd say some of the more common areas would be in things like securities lending, where we can shift the split, or in some cases, straight pricing increases. So let's say it's -- as each quarter rolls on and as the environment continues to be constrained, we're working harder and harder and more aggressively on making sure that we're capturing the right level of economics for the services that we're providing. So ongoing.", "Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. You talked about potential acquisition opportunities should some of these European banks in particular look to raise capital by selling off maybe custody businesses. Are you guys seeing any evidence that there are some banks that may just have to throw in the towel because they're too small to compete with yourselves and JPMorgan Chase or Bank of New York who are real giants in the industry? Is there any evidence of that? Or do you guys see any of that in your day-to-day business wins where you continue to win from the smaller guys?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, I'd say a couple of points there. One, pretty clear to me that this group of organizations that you're referencing are not growing. They're not gaining any shares. So we compete. It's rare that they show up in a meaningful competition. So I think from the standpoint of if you're looking from inside one of those, let's say, universal banks looking out, you wouldn't be seeing growth. I think the reason that these assets have not come out before now is that there's some perception that the deposit base provide some stability to their funding, so I think that's one of the reasons that a bank might be looking at potential assets for sale, that this would be not in the first wave or first phase. I think we're getting past the first phase. I think the need to raise capital overwhelmed. The belief that the deposits provide a good source of funding for these banks. So I think it's just a slow process. But they're not growing from what I can tell. They're not being funded, so new product investment is likely to be low. So I just think it's a little bit of a waiting game here, but it will eventually happen.", "Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And then finally on the return of capital approach, clearly, the Federal Reserve for you and your peers will have a dominant say on what can be returned to shareholders. If next year, meaning spring of 2013, if companies like your own get your final Basel III Tier 1 common ratio target with the SIFI Buffer by the end of '12 and you exceed that during the stress test, do you -- would you guys be comfortable in giving back to shareholders more than 100% of earnings if you exceed the Basel III Tier 1 common ratio under stress test conditions? And do you think the Federal Reserve would allow you to do it if you do exceed it?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "I would say a couple of things. One, up 'til now, the stress tests have really been geared around the following years, capital generation and how that might be deployed for things like buybacks or dividends. I don't know out a year whether that -- I think that eventually changes where you look at total capital and look at use of capital, look at -- not use of capital, but look at capital under stress. And you'd expect, over time, you'd see more flexibility. Too early to tell. I guess from another standpoint, we'd look at that from a standpoint of kind of the point in time. What does the acquisition environment look like? How much capital should we hold on the side to make sure that we didn't get shut out of that. And then what our stock was trading at and whether or not it would be attractive to buy back shares at what price. So it's very hard to project out over a year what the environment might look like. It's also hard -- although I think, over time, the Fed will relax rules around capital. And that will probably be a factor of the environment. If the environment looks, feels more stable, if Europe appears more predictable, it's likely we'll see more flexibility with -- from the regulators.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Stilmar with SunTrust.", "John W. Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Just really quickly. You showed an impressive amount of expense control this quarter. I'm wondering in terms of the motivation. Do you look at -- because of the environment, do you look at specific verticals of businesses and then choose not to continue like you did in some of the FX? Or are these regulatory businesses that you have changed your perspective around the opportunity? Or thirdly, is it something where the environment has caused you to look at other things in your business processes, like overhead and essential expense base to the platform that may not be as directly tied to a specific business line and take kind of that next level of expense cut? I'm wondering if you could kind of prioritize that in terms of how you look at businesses versus expenses.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Sure. Let me take a swing at that. I would say -- the first thing I would say is, almost a couple of years ago, I think we got out in front of this a little bit by anticipating the environment was going to be challenging, and so we put in place the IT and ops transformation plan, which is pretty broad-based and far reaching throughout the organization. We anticipate upon execution we'll -- it'll affect close to 10% of the expense base of the company. So it's pretty pervasive, it's structural. It's recurring. It's hard to do, but will provide many benefits. So I'd say that's kind of the centerpiece. I would say beyond that, every year, every quarter, we review business lines, look at expenses against revenues. And there's a certain amount of calibration you can make there largely around headcount, around some of the other fees that are associated with delivering those products and services. I'd say the third dimension of how we view expense control is -- there are more short-term things we can do -- tend to be around things like consultant expense in this quarter. Incentive compensation, there are adjustments you can make in a quarter. So I would say we look at it across, I think, 3 dimensions: one, broad organizational structural changes in the cost base, and those will continue; two, at a product or a business line level, making sure that the product or business line is returning the right level of economics to the corporation; and then within a period, within a quarter, there are certain adjustments we can make. And we're focused on all 3 of those levers.", "S. Kelley MacDonald", "Brandy, we'll take one more question.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Just what are your new expense initiatives in light of your more cautious outlook?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Well, I think the -- so I just mentioned, I just talked about the IT and ops, which is the 4-year plan. I think the -- we made a decision this quarter to shut down our fixed income rates initiative, which we just thought wasn't going to allow us to achieve a hurdle rate that we thought we could achieve, we felt we needed to achieve. So we're constantly looking at business line level, our products reaching the hurdle rate. Other than that, we're looking at personnel efficiencies across the organization. We're looking at other expenses, how we -- what we pay for consultants, what consultants we use. So it's a little bit of my response to the prior question, Mike. It's structural, it's business line and it's at a point in time within a quarter things that we can moderate in order to reflect the environment that's occurring in the quarter.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "I guess in terms of your outlook, is there any chance you can show positive operating leverage in 2012? Just have revenues go faster than expenses even if it's a decline? Or is it just too tough of an environment?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "I would say it would be tough. I mean, I've said before that if we approach again more normalized environments, 10-plus percent revenue growth, you'd expect a couple of percent of operating leverage as you get to a mid-single range. Maybe it's a percent as you get into the kind of 0 to 5 growth rates. It's -- things have to happen the right way in order to get operating leverage.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And I wasn't clear. Is the FX decline shifting, is that a structural change or away from your firm or to other places within your firm?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, Mike. No, it's within the house. It's just we have, I think, 4 different products within FX, depending on how people interact with us. And they're just moving from one option to another. But it's all staying within State Street.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And in terms of EPS guidance for 2012. I know you'll talk about that, but you're giving such a negative outlook. Don't you just want to get it out now? I mean, some sense?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "I think I'm not trying to give necessarily a negative outlook, just a realistic outlook around the challenge of the second half of last year. And I don't think anybody's ready to predict that the most recent markets are going to sustain themselves. If they sustain themselves, then my outlook changes. I think we're just being cautious. The most recent market action looks good. We still worry about Europe. So we're just trying to be realistic about the environment that we're operating in. And also being, I think, straightforward in our disclosure that we intend to keep adjusting the expense base to make sure that if the environment continues to be constrained, that we can continue to generate earnings.

Kelley MacDonald", "Before Jay Hooley, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ed Resch, our Chief Financial Officer, begin their remarks, I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in State Street's 2011 annual report on Form 10-K and its subsequent filings with the SEC.", "We encourage you to review those filings, including the sections on Risk Factors, concerning any forward-looking statements we make today. Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of today, April 17, 2012, and the corporation does not undertake to revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after today.", "I'd also like to remind you that you can find a slide presentation regarding the corporation's investment portfolio as well as our first quarter 2012 earnings news release, which includes reconciliations of non-GAAP measures referred to on this webcast, in the Investor Relations portion of our website.", "Now I'll turn it over to Jay.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Thanks, Kelley, and good morning. Overall, I believe we're off to a good start this year amid continued economic headwinds. First, we achieved solid growth in both fee and total revenue compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Our earnings per share, however, were particularly impacted by the seasonal accounting effect on the first quarter of the annual equity incentive compensation for our retirement-eligible employees, as well as payroll taxes. ", "Second, we maintained strong new business momentum with $233 billion in assets to be serviced and net new business at SSgA. ", "Third, we received the results of the CCAR stress test released by the Federal Reserve in mid-March. As a result, we were able to increase our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.24 per share, consistent with its previous split-adjusted high. ", "In addition, our board approved a $1.8-billion common stock purchase plan, which we expect to begin to execute this month. ", "In addition to remarks about the first quarter results, this morning, I will address the economic outlook, our continuing success generating new business in core asset servicing and asset management, the ongoing progress of our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program, as well as our strong capital position. ", "As markets improved in the first quarter, a number of our clients began putting their cash back to work. The level of excess deposits left on our balance sheet declined and the performance of our core business improved compared to the fourth quarter. At the same time, investors remained cautious, especially in view of continuing uncertainty in Europe. ", "We continue to control expenses. Other than compensation and employee benefits, all other expenses on an operating basis were held in check. The seasonal impact of equity-based incentive compensation for retirement-eligible employees was $76 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $40 million in the first quarter of 2011, an increase of $36 million or $0.05 per share.", "We continue to add new business to the core franchise. Of the $233 billion in assets we won in the first quarter, about 2/3 were in the U.S. We had $10 billion in net new business at State Street Global Advisors. One notable planned reduction in SSgA assets was the $31 billion of asset redemptions from accounts we manage for the Department of the U.S. Treasury. Excluding this redemption, net new business at SSgA in the first quarter was $41 billion. ", "Among our larger new servicing mandates was an award for QSuper, an Australian superannuation fund with more than 500,000 members and over $32 billion of assets under management for which we'll provide a broad range of custody administration and accounting services. This new mandate further builds on our previous wins with Sunsuper in November 2011 and REST Industry Super in January 2011. State Street now services 3 of the top 10 superannuation funds in Australia.", "The integration of the Intesa Securities Services acquisition has met our stated targets and this business continues to attract new wins. In fact, just recently, we've been appointed custodian to the Fondo Pensione Banco di Napoli, with EUR 700 billion pension fund for the employees of Banco di Napoli. ", "Also, the state of Washington renewed its agreement with us for servicing and securities finance for $80 billion in assets. ", "Regarding the timing of installations, during the first quarter, we installed $205 billion, $90 billion of which was awarded in the first quarter and $115 billion which was awarded in 2011.", "Of the total business award in the first quarter, about $143 billion remains to be installed. ", "In the alternative asset servicing area, demand remains very strong. This quarter, we added 42 new mandates in our alternative investment services business and our alternative assets under administration increased from $816 billion as of December 31, 2011, to $895 billion as of March 31, 2012. ", "SSgA has been awarded new business from several U.S. public plans including those from Michigan, Nevada, Oklahoma, Indiana and Missouri. ", "Now let me share our outlook for the global economy. We expect the U.S. to continue its slow recovery with 2012 GDP growth slightly above 2%. Recent consumer confidence has improved slightly, but housing prices continue to slide as unemployment continues to be a challenge. ", "In Europe, the picture is mixed. In the U.K., GDP declined in the first quarter, consumer confidence eroded and the housing market weakened. Germany's rate of unemployment continues to decline, but retail sales in the first quarter were weak. Other Eurozone countries exhibited some consumer strength in the first quarter. And in Italy, wage inflation appears to be stabilizing. However, manufacturing overall appears to be in decline. The long-term refinancing operation by the ECB relieved some of the liquidity pressure in the region, but the debt status of Greece and Spain continues to weigh on the equity markets.", "On balance, our cautious outlook is consistent with the moderate improvement in U.S. markets. However, we remain guarded, primarily due to European uncertainty, which can affect the U.S. recovery. ", "We continue to be on track in executing our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program and expect to achieve approximately $94 million in annual pretax run rate savings this year, excluding restructuring charges. This brings the total annual run rate savings anticipated to be achieved since the inception of the program through the end of 2012 to approximately $180 million compared to the expense run rate in 2010, all else equal. ", "Returning capital to our shareholders has been a priority for us. As I mentioned earlier this morning, we're pleased that the Federal Reserve did not object to the increase both in our common stock dividend and in our common stock purchase program that we proposed. We believe the return of capital to our shareholders projected by our post-CCAR capital actions announced in March 2012 is among the highest among major financial institutions also executing on the corresponding post-CCAR announced capital actions. ", "Due to the strength of our capital position, we expect to be able to take these actions while retaining the flexibility to respond to future acquisition opportunities should they become available. ", "I'll now turn the call over to Ed, and then I'll return to make final remarks before I open the call to questions. Ed?", "Edward J. Resch", "Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll review 3 areas: first, the results for the first quarter; second, I'll summarize the performance of and outlook for the investment portfolio, as well as worldwide interest rates and the impact on our net interest margin; and finally, I'll review our strong capital ratios.", "I'll present some of the more significant results comparing the first quarter of 2012 to the first quarter of 2011, as well as to the fourth quarter of 2011. And this morning, all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today's earnings news release.", "Fee revenue in the first quarter was approximately flat compared to the first quarter of 2011 and was up 7% from the fourth quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2011, servicing fee revenue was down 2%. The decline in servicing fees from the first quarter of 2011 was due to the impact of weakness in non-U.S. markets in the second half of 2011 and mix changes, offset partially by net new business and a slight increase in the daily average of the S&P 500. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, servicing fees increased 2% due to higher average equity valuations and net new business. ", "Management fees were flat with the first quarter of 2011 and increased 17% from the fourth quarter due to higher month-end equity market valuations and net new business. We believe that the implementation of the LTRO in Europe had a positive impact on global investor sentiment, as we saw evidence of U.S. investors beginning to put cash back to work. During the quarter, our investment servicing clients began putting cash back into the market, albeit mostly into conservative short-term and fixed income investments. ", "At SSgA, we were awarded $10 billion of net new business, even after the planned $31-billion redemption by the Department of the U.S. Treasury. ", "Net new business was composed of 3 main elements: one, flows into ETFs, which had one of their best quarters, adding about $10.8 billion in net inflows. We also added about $8 billion net into institutional funds, primarily passive, and added net flows of $23 billion into cash strategies. Many of these cash flows went back into prime money market funds from U.S. government funds, reversing last quarter's trend. Our fee waivers declined about $2.4 million from $11.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $9.1 million in the first quarter of 2012. ", "Regarding trading services and securities finance. Trading services, in the first quarter of 2012, declined 7% compared to the first quarter of 2011, but were up 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Compared to the year ago quarter, first quarter foreign exchange revenue decreased 7% due primarily to lower volatility, partly offset by higher volumes. Brokerage and other fee revenue was down 8%, due primarily to lower transition management revenue. Compared to the fourth quarter, foreign exchange revenues decreased slightly and brokerage and other increased 7% due primarily to an improvement in revenue from transition management. ", "In foreign exchange, in the first quarter of 2012, the percentage of total foreign exchange revenue represented by indirect and direct foreign exchange services remained approximately consistent with the fourth quarter. We continue to expect, however, that some clients over time may choose to reduce indirect FX transactions in favor of other execution methods, either directly or through electronic trading. ", "Compared to the first quarter of 2011, securities finance revenue increased 47% in the first quarter of 2012 and was up 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Both increases were due primarily to higher spreads. In the first quarter of 2012, the average of one-month LIBOR to the Fed Funds effective rate was 14.4 basis points and the 3-month LIBOR to the Fed Funds effective rate was 39.9 basis points. ", "Securities on loan averaged $331 billion for the first quarter of 2012, down from $340 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011 and from $359 billion for the first quarter of 2011, both declines due to reduced demand. Average lendable assets for the first quarter of 2012 were about $2.36 trillion, up 1% from $2.34 trillion in the first quarter of 2011 and up 6% from $2.23 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2011. ", "As of March 31, 2012, the duration of the securities finance book was approximately 16 days, down from 21 days in the first quarter of 2011 and down from 17 days from the fourth quarter of 2011. ", "Processing fees and other revenue was up about $49 million in the first quarter of 2012 from the fourth quarter of 2011, due to the positive impact of fair value adjustments as we successfully exited our fixed income trading initiative. As you may recall, last quarter we announced the withdrawal from our fixed income trading initiative. And as of March 31, 2012, we have substantially closed out all trading positions.", "Operating-basis net interest revenue of $607 million increased about 5% in the first quarter of 2012 compared with the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily due to higher yields on fixed income securities in the investment portfolio and higher spreads on floating-rate securities. ", "In the first quarter, excess deposit at the Federal Reserve and other central banks averaged about $18 billion compared to $23 billion in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect the excess deposits to trend down on average for the full year 2012. Including the excess deposits, operating-basis net interest margin was 152 basis points in the first quarter of 2012, compared to 140 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2011. ", "Now turning to expenses. Compared to the first quarter of 2011, compensation and benefit costs were up $90 million or 9%, primarily due to the $36-million effect of changes in employee demographics on equity-based compensation for retirement-eligible employees, with the remainder of the increase resulting primarily from merit increases and employees added as part of new business and acquisitions. ", "Our compensation and benefits expenses increased 22% or $192 million from the fourth quarter of 2011 to approximately $1.064 billion, due primarily to the seasonal accounting impact of annual equity-based compensation for our retirement-eligible employees and additional payroll taxes, which together accounted for $105 million of the increase. ", "In the first quarter of 2012, compensation and benefit expenses were approximately 44.3% of total operating-basis revenue, up from 38.1% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we continue to target a reduction of the ratio of compensation and benefits to total operating-basis revenue by about 100 basis points compared to the 40.2% ratio we had in 2011.", "Other expenses were $244 million, up 6% compared to the first quarter of 2011, due primarily to higher regulatory costs, and were down 11% compared to the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower professional fees and lower securities processing costs. ", "As Jay said, our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program is proceeding as planned. We continue to expect the amount of annual pretax run rate savings for 2012 to be approximately $94 million compared to the pretax run rate in 2010, all else equal. ", "In our operating-basis expenses, we incurred $22 million of nonrecurring costs relating to the program, consisting of $17 million in salaries and benefits and $5 million in several other expense lines on the income statement. As you may recall, we have previously indicated that we expect our nonrecurring costs to peak in 2012 at an average of about $25 million per quarter.", "Now let me turn to the investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio as of March 31, 2012, of $113.7 billion increased about $4 billion compared to December 31, 2011. ", "During the first quarter, we invested about $9.2 billion in highly rated securities at an average price of $103.28 and with an average yield of 2.34% and a duration of approximately 2.90 years. Our primary investments during the quarter were in agency mortgage-backed securities, which represented $4.3 billion of new purchases at an average price of $105.60 with an average yield of 2.93%. ", "In the first quarter, we have opportunistically invested ahead of this year's plan given the environment. The aggregate net unrealized after-tax loss in our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios as of March 31, 2012, was $81 million compared to a net unrealized after-tax loss of $374 million as of December 31, 2011. The improvement in the net unrealized after-tax position compared to December 31, 2011, was due primarily to tighter spreads, offset partially by higher rates. ", "In our investment portfolio presentation, we've updated the data through quarter end for you to review. As of March 31, 2012, our portfolio was 89% AAA or AA rated. The duration of the investment portfolio was 1.57 years at March 31, 2012, up from 1.49 years at December 31, 2011, due primarily to our purchase of agency mortgage-backed securities during the first quarter. The duration gap of the entire balance sheet was 0.49 years, up from 0.36 years at December 31, 2011, and this duration gap is in line with our internal guidelines. As of -- excuse me, March 31, 2012, 58% of our investment portfolio was invested in floating-rate securities and 42% in fixed-rate securities. ", "Regarding European assets. We have no direct sovereign debt exposure to the peripheral countries of Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy or Ireland in our investment portfolio. Of our non-U.S. assets, we hold about $1.2 billion in securities from those peripheral countries, primarily RMBS and all floating-rate securities. And they are comprised of about $500 million from Italy; $400 million from Spain; and about $100 million each from Ireland, Greece and Portugal. All are performing within expectations and remain current as to principal and interest. ", "On Page 7 of the investment portfolio presentation, we list all of our non-U.S. investments and show the average rating as well as the asset types we hold. Our primary non-U.S. holdings are British, Australian, German, Canadian and Netherlands securities, totaling 92% on the non-U.S. investment portfolio. ", "At SSgA, our Eurozone exposure in the investment funds is consistent with client mandates. We hold the non-U.S. fixed income portfolios at their benchmark weightings and our actively managed cash portfolios have no exposure to the peripheral countries. ", "Regarding pretax conduit-related accretions. Looking forward, we expect to record a total of about $1.1 billion in interest revenue from April 1, 2012, forward through the remaining lot -- terms of the former conduit securities, excluding the approximately $49 million we recorded in the first quarter of 2012. These expectations are based on numerous assumptions, including holding the securities to maturity, anticipated prepayment speeds, credit quality and sales. ", "Now for our outlook for net interest margin. First of all, let me emphasize that we continue to believe that we should invest through the cycle and we also intend to invest primarily in highly rated AAA or AA agency mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. ", "I'll now review some of the assumptions we used in determining our 2012 outlook for net interest revenue and net interest margin. We believe that the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates on hold through the end of 2014, that the ECB has cut rates to 100 basis points and we expect them to hold at that level through the end of 2012. If the ECB rate declines further, we estimate NIR would decline by between $20 million and $25 million on an annual basis for each 25-basis-point reduction. We believe the Bank of England will hold its base rate at 50 basis points through 2012. We project a potential reduction of 25 basis points in that rate by the Bank of England would lower net interest revenue by about $5 million annually.", "Based on these rate assumptions and our first quarter results, if our client deposits return toward more normal levels, our net interest margin for the full year 2012 will likely be in the upper half of our 145- to 155-basis-point range. ", "Finally, I'll briefly review our capital ratios. In the first quarter, State Street Corporation's capital ratios under Basel I remained very strong. As of March 31, 2012, our total capital ratio stood at 20.6%, our Tier 1 leverage ratio stood at 7.8%, our Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 19.1%, our TCE ratio was 7.5% and our Tier 1 common ratio was 17.1%. ", "Based on our understanding of the Basel III regulations and the information published by the Basel Committee and the Federal Reserve, we estimate our capital ratios under Basel III as of March 31, 2012, to be total capital ratio, 16.0%; our Tier 1 leverage ratio to be 6.2%; our Tier 1 capital ratio to be 14.4%; and our Tier 1 common ratio to be 13.2%.", "We were pleased with the results of our CCAR submission and with the return of capital we are projecting to make to our shareholders. ", "So in conclusion, while we are beginning to see signs of improvement, particularly in the U.S. economy, the global economic outlook has continued to be uncertain. The LTRO has improved liquidity in the European banks, but it has also restrained growth in new issuances. We still face a low interest rate environment, new regulatory requirements and increased compliance costs. We need to continue to drive fee revenue growth while maintaining cost controls, and we intend to reduce the compensation-to-revenue ratio in 2012 compared to 2011 and also to continue to execute on our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. ", "And now, I'll turn the call over to Jay to conclude our remarks.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Thanks, Ed. While we're encouraged by the early signs that investor confidence in the U.S. is rebuilding, we remain cautious, especially around the uncertain environment in Europe. During the first quarter, the momentum in our core business returned. The increase in the core business was supported by the installations of new business won last year and new business wins in the first quarter. The flows into SSgA in the first quarter were very encouraging. ", "I'm also pleased with the growth in our ETF assets, which exceeded $300 billion as of March 31, 2012, up more than 12% from December 31, 2011. ", "We intend to continue to exercise expense control and to successfully execute on our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. ", "Our capital position remains strong, allowing us to return capital to our shareholders in the form of increased common stock dividends and a substantial increase in our common stock purchase program. ", "Our outlook of cautious optimism for 2012 is restrained by the continued uncertainty in Europe. However, our pipeline of new business potential is very healthy and we expect to contribute to further growth in 2012. ", "Now Ed and I are prepared to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Ed, I was wondering if you can just kind of walk us through the comp guidance. This quarter, comp revenues ratio was even -- we had the 105 and then plus a lot of excess, so it was more like 44%. So to get down to that low 39s, got to presume a well-below 39% comp-to-revenues ratio over the next few quarters. So I was wondering if you can help us understand what else either comes out of the comp ratio on the expense side. And also, should we imply that there's also a meaningful step-up in revenues expected? It just seems like a pretty big, big leap to get down to 39% full year.", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, I mean, it's what we're targeting, Ken. And you're right. I mean it is largely predicated on revenue. We said at Investor Day that assuming revenue grew modestly, that would be our target for the year, to bring it down to around 39.2% for the full year. We -- obviously, we're cognizant of the first quarter step-up, which is just timing, when we made that comment in February. We're proceeding with the ops and IT transformation as we indicated on the call and we're going to target around 39.2%, plus or minus a bit, even recognizing the first quarter step-up, which was significant because of the early retirement accounting.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then secondarily, just wanted to tease out a couple of the transaction-based areas. It looks, on the surface, that it was a soft volume quarter, yet you guys did really well in terms of total trading fees. Sec lending was up sequentially. Can you talk about what you saw in terms of -- was it market share gains? Or was there anything specific to the types of transaction that you guys enjoyed?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "I would say a few things, Ken. The trading was up 3% sequential quarter. And the -- I would say the drivers were foreign exchange, pretty good performance against lowering volatility in the quarter. I think that was a question of just volumes. We saw our volumes go up Q4 to Q1. I think it's just the result of whether you can interpret share gains out of that. It's hard in that market. But we're pleased with the volume growth to offset the volatility shortfall. The brokerage line, I think it was up 7% sequential quarters. Transition management, which is, again, hard to get market share data in that segment of the market, but we think we're performing pretty well as far as capturing our share of transition. And then securities finance was really more a story of largely holding on to current outstanding and the LIBOR -- the 3-month LIBOR increase. So I think that roughly covers the transitional line items in the quarter.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then asset management had a really strong rebound. I'm just wondering how much of that was just the market, which we can kind of tease out, versus the re-risking that had gone against you last quarter? And I guess it's a question for custody as well. Just the amount of re-risking. Where are we in that kind of -- it was a kind of a sharp decline in the fourth. And how did it re-base as we came to the first?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, let me -- I'll start that and Ed can jump in as well. Very pleased with SSgA performance in the first quarter, up 17% sequential quarter -- on a sequential quarter basis. And it was really a combination of both the markets, which is the obvious point, and very good net new business growth. So if you exclude that Treasury redemption, which was planned, $41 billion in net new flows in the first quarter, which is as strong a quarter as we've had in a while. Highlighted by ETF, we continue to talk about ETF as a focus and a theme for us. We continue to add new products. We saw -- I think it was $8 billion in new flows in the first quarter into ETFs, as well as passive. So I'd say on the -- let me come to servicing fees and then comment about the risking. On the servicing fee side, a little bit of a different story. We were up -- service fees were up 2% sequentially. You'll recall back at the end of the last call, we talked a little bit about the de-risking in the last half of 2011. We saw that start to come back in the first quarter, but it was -- frankly, it was more back-end quarter loaded than front-end quarter loaded, so I think the service fee line reflects that more than the asset management fee line. In the re-risking, Ed mentioned this in his comments, it was a little bit less than one might expect and that was mostly in the fixed income instruments. So we really didn't see a move back, and this is broad strokes, back to cross-border and emerging markets. But we did see good intra-quarter flows into the servicing line. Does that help?", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "That's great, Jay. And just one final little thing. The processing and other improvement, it was $49 million. I'm just wondering if you can tell us how much of that $49 million was the actual kind of recapture of the fixed income marks.", "Edward J. Resch", "Virtually the entire delta, Ken.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "So, look, the LTRO was mostly a good thing for everybody involved. But I get a sense that it slowed down the deleveraging process and the business unit rationalization. And I think for a while now, you and we all have gotten a sense that there would be business freed up and maybe some consolidation on the heels of this. Has that just come to a halt as well, given the LTRO and the time that it buys some of these institutions?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, Ken -- I mean, sorry, Glenn. I would say that it has slowed it down, so I think that your question, I think, is pointed at custody consolidation in Europe. And we -- so the European banks, many European banks were under capital pressure and there's been a slow move towards recapitalize. I think there are some deadlines upcoming in 2012 which may create a stimulus for that. I think the one thing that we observed, not universally but in several cases, is that European banks who had custody books of business in 2011 were very concerned about funding and liquidity. And the custody banks, even though it might not be strategic with any universal banks, provide a stable source of funding. And therefore, I think there was a little bit of a slowdown. So you could say the LTRO potentially relieved that, with funding being provided by the ECB, maybe less pressure on the core funding. We would hope if that sustains itself, that it might unlock some of those properties in Europe. Haven't seen any recent evidence, but would expect that over time you'd see that.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "So you still have expectations of the bigger trend of consolidation?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Absolutely.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. One more strategy question. In asset management land, you're clearly on pole position in passive land. And I just thought we'd revisit State Street's, I guess, expectations or aspirations on the active side. And you have more capital than you have approval for, so you've got a big buyback coming. But just thoughts on the active side of asset management business.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, I think we -- our asset management business is probably somewhat misunderstood and that there's a fair amount of quantitative active within that $2-trillion-ish pool of assets that we manage. And we think that's a growing segment, the quant active scientific, if you can use those terms. With regard to kind of fundamental active, we have very little. As you recall, we acquired Bank of Ireland's Asset Management business, which gave us a little bit of fundamental active. That's been a good transaction for us. We've been able to leverage our institutional distribution to grow that. We'll continue to selectively look at different asset classes, whether they be active or fundamental active, as I interpret your question, or other places where we have gaps. I think that as I look at the franchise, as you point out, it's got a solid footing in the passive space. I think ETFs gives us another vehicle to create a little bit more product creativity within asset management. And I think we also have, as a core competency, great institutional distribution and some emerging intermediary distribution through the ETFs. So if we can, through acquisition, was your question, selectively acquire asset classes that we think we can leverage up and distribute through our distribution system, we think that would be a smart thing to do.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Super. One last one, and just a numbers question for Ed. On the deposit outflow side, I totally get the environment thawing and therefore some of that money that was parked with you for safety reasons goes out. Can you just talk through what percentage of that piece of the business you think you're through? And then maybe the rate differentials so we can back into our own NIM estimates between the core deposits that you have and those temporary deposits?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, I mean, our thinking for the year, Glenn, full year 2012, is that we basically have the excess deposits that we had in the fourth quarter. So from $23 billion on average down to, let's say, around $11 billion or so for the full year, okay? And it was predicated on that, that we gave you the 145 to 155 and said that -- for NIM guidance, and said that if the deposits stuck around longer, we'd be toward the lower end of that range. And obviously, the converse is true. If they leave more quickly, we'll probably be toward the higher end of that range. So I'd say moving from $23 billion down to $18 billion, we're maybe 1/3 to 1/2 of the way there based on our expectations for the full year. But it can move around, obviously, depending on sentiment. But it seemed like there was some thawing, some improvement, as you note, in the first quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to follow up on your comments on capital. So it looks like you guys are returning 100% of earnings roughly. Still lots of excess capital, even if you kind of compare that 13% to your sort of self-imposed 10% capital ratio. How should we think about deployment, I guess, of that excess, because it feels like you can continue to do 100% of earnings and still grow capital? So should we be thinking special dividend or something like that? Or this is just kind of like excess capital for potential acquisitions in the future.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "I think the way you should look at it, Alex, is that we want to have some capacity to execute on acquisitions in a world that we think is going to deliver attractive opportunities. Whether it's the European banking situation, whether it's selectively in the asset management world, we think we're well situated to maintain that flexibility. And we think by increasing the dividend and authorizing -- the board authorizing a buyback, we're providing some relief to shareholders. On the other hand, we think it's prudent to stay flexible given what's likely to be an opportunistic future from the standpoint of acquisitions. And we think we struck that balance.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got you. Ed, one for you on expenses. So it looks like the clean number this quarter was probably around $1.7 billion. Can you walk us through, with cost cuts coming through probably in a bigger way towards the back half of the year, how we should think about the progression of that kind of $1.7-billion expenses total run rate currently into the second half, between growth in the business plus the net savings coming through?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, $1.7 billion is taking out the early retirement accounting effect, Alex. Is that what you're -- I'm assuming there.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, because that's really seasonal, first quarter thing, right?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, right. I mean, we're assuming that the business will grow this year. We haven't put a revenue guideline out there for you, as you know. We are assuming some level of growth, so there'll be some related expense growth associated with that. And that's factored into our progression for the year. We also expect, as we noted, to get in about another $90 million, $94 million of savings from the ops and IT program. That will be principally in the -- as a reduction to salary and benefits line, which is part of our planning for moving that comp-to-revenue ratio down over the year. So I mean the progression from the starting point of $1.7 billion, as you said, is really a function of what the revenue growth is. I mean, we have, as I said, plans to grow the company. We're not planning on staying flat or down for the year. But I mean, it's hard to give you even a range for the year based on the potential variability of what the revenue outcome is. But I would say that if you started at $1.7 billion, you'll be probably looking at tracking up a little bit from that as we assume our revenue growth comes in per quarter.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Right, so up slightly despite the fact that the savings will be coming through in a bigger way towards the back half?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, I think, net -- yes, that's our thinking, again assuming that revenue grows modestly for the year, as we said. And that's consistent with our thinking on the comp-to-revenue ratio again.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Just looking out, do you expect the usual strength in securities lending in the second quarter?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, we would -- we don't see anything that caused us to believe we won't see that cyclical second quarter, positive cyclical second quarter.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And you have the new buyback authorization and shares were flat. So what's going on there? Why not be more aggressive?", "Edward J. Resch", "We didn't buy any shares back in the first quarter, Mike.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And what sort of pace do you expect to have? Again, you have new authorization. If you think your stock's inexpensive, wouldn't you be buying aggressively? Or how do you think about buying back stock?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, I mean, we can't get too far into our plans for that. But we're going to -- the way to look at the buyback is the remaining 3 quarters of this year and then the first quarter next year, which is the new piece of the program for this year versus last year. So for the remainder of this year, the plan is around $1.35 billion of stock to be bought back, with the remainder in the first quarter of next year. That was the program that we put out. And we'll act opportunistically within the constraints of the marketplace...", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "You can't front-load it?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, I mean there are requirements to -- based on volume, as you know, and there's also the particulars of the plan that we submitted to the Fed and the Fed did not object to it. So it's not something where we can just all decide if we wanted to, to front-load it to an extremely large degree, let's say that.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And then switching gears. You've said in the past you're a big beneficiary of higher equity markets and the S&P was up 10%, depending how you look at it. Your assets under custody were up 7% and the custody fees were up only 2%. That seems like awful a sequential increase in the custody fees relative to the market and your assets under your custody. So what's happening there?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, I think it's -- probably the best explanation for that, Mike, is the re-risking which underlies the issue of servicing fees and growth. We actually saw intra-quarter growth from front to back. And so I think the 2% probably is light if you were to average the back end of the quarter.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "So second quarter should be better due to some sort of lag impact?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, I mean I think if you assume that equity markets keep the same pace as the first quarter, you'd expect that there is some lag effect which would filter into the second quarter.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Even if there is a lag effect, that still doesn't seem like it's keeping pace with the market.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, we have broadly -- I mean, it's hard to pick a line item. But we say 10% equity markets, 2% revenue growth on a total basis. And that -- so you look at the asset management side of the business and we're up 17% sequentially. So 2% seems a little light, but I don't think extraordinarily light given the trend, intra-quarter, that I mentioned.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And then, lastly, the comp ratio. I mean, you're 44% in the first quarter and you're looking for 39% for the year. So should we look at 37% or 38% in the second quarter? And are you looking for an absolute reduction in personnel expenses? Because I don't recall this being overly dependent on revenue growth and now I'm hearing Ed say, well, we need revenue growth to meet our comp rate. And there's a general concern that the customers of State Street are treated well and the employees are treated well, but the shareholders aren't. And today, the market's up over 100. You're the only stock down and so I think there's a general concern about getting the comp and expenses in line. So can you give any reassurances that they will be?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "I think -- let me start with that and Ed can jump in. I think that I'd point to 2011, which was really the first year that the IT and ops really had an effect. And we were able to drive the comp-to-revenue ratio down, very focused on it. In the first quarter, we have the seasonal expense, which we've spoken about. So I think between internal focus, execution of IT and ops, which we have high confidence in, we think with moderate revenue growth, we should be able to drive that down again this year.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And Ed was going to follow up or...", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Sure.", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, I mean I'd just repeat what I said earlier, Mike. I mean, I think that the math, depending on what level of revenue you want to pick, is in the right range. I think the earlier question was somebody saying 39% in future quarters. But clearly, it's got to be below 40% in a meaningful way to drive to 39.2% for the full year. It's something that we're focused on. And as Jay said, it's something that we delivered on last year. If you recall, the sequential quarter decline in the comp-to-revenue ratio was something that we targeted and we delivered and we brought it to 39.2% -- I'm sorry, 40.2% for the full year. So it's something that we believe we're going to get. And relative to my statement about revenue, I mean revenue, obviously, is a piece of the function here. So my only comment there is that if revenue were, for some reason, and we don't anticipate this to be soft, okay, in a meaningful sort of way, that revenue would be a significant challenge for us to get for the full year. But again, we don't anticipate revenue being soft and we are planning on modest growth and will drive to the 40 -- the 39.2% approximately for the full year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with ISI Group.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Jay, can you talk a little bit more about the investment servicing? Obviously, the lower yield on the asset -- on the custody and administered assets is, to some degree, a factor of the revenue mix that you alluded to. And you also implied that it's getting better as we move to the back half -- back end of the quarter into second quarter. But can you also comment on to what degree pricing or through servicing mix impacted that? And when I say servicing mix, I mean mid-office versus custody mandates and things like that.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, sure, Brian. Let me try to give you a little color. From a mix standpoint, nothing really extraordinary. We commented on the Australian superannuation business where we've made nice strides in the last 6 months. That's kind of a typical mix. We also had a big deal around real estate administration. Again, shouldn't have been a real change in mix. So I don't think mix was dramatically different within the quarter. I think that there was the lag effect of when people were re-risking. I think that had some effect. And regarding pricing, I would say that we continue to, almost quarter-to-quarter, get more aggressive or more aligned around pricing strategies with our customers. So in the last couple of quarters, you've seen some effect, but we would expect that as we continue to make sure that all of our relationships are appropriately priced, that pricing will be a -- more of a factor in time. So I don't think you can point to the quarter and say pricing was a factor, but I would leave with you the notion that we're pretty focused on pricing and we would expect over time to that -- for that to be a contributing positive.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So as we move through the year, if we think about a little bit of re-risking in the business mix, maybe a little bit of sort of sequential traction in pricing, we should expect that revenue yield on administered assets to improve as we move through the year?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, I would say, again, all else equal, we continue to see good markets. All of those things. The mix may be a little lesser effect. But other than that, yes, I think that's probably a fair assumption.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then on the FX business, you mentioned that obviously this is a strong quarter and very consistent on the indirect versus the direct, but you do expect a headwind. Any way to frame what type of headwind we should expect? I know it's almost impossible to do on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but, say, over -- on an annualized basis over the next 1 to 2 years? This is the headwind from moving from -- from clients moving from direct to -- or indirect to direct, rather.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Let me give you the strategic response to that and then if Ed has anything, he can add. Our strategy has been to -- we've got a broad range of FX offerings, and -- is to drive volume. And we can drive volume not only in existing customers, but in -- in existing servicing customers, but in non-servicing customers because of the variation of foreign exchange offerings that we have. So I think you can see some of that in the first quarter where we're driving volume in the case of this quarter outrunning volatility changes. We would hope over time that, in the mix shift from indirect to direct or other electronic means, that we could overrun -- outrun that with volume. So that's what we're attempting to do. And, Ed, I don't know if you'd...", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, just on indirect, Brian, it's clearly something that we're focused on, as are other people, given the publicity around it. We had a $4-million to $5-million sequential quarter decline in Q3 -- in Q4 from Q3. This quarter, actually, the indirect revenue picked up to bit. So there's no -- there's clearly no evidence of a trend from Q4 to Q1. But it is something that we're monitoring. The business overall, though, is performing pretty well and we'll keep you posted as to if any trends from a client standpoint develop.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just on the processing fees, Ed. I think we were thinking about $70 million being a normalized run rate on a quarterly basis after the fourth quarter $25-million write-down. And obviously, we're much higher than that in this first quarter. What should we think about for a normalized run rate over the next 3 quarters?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, I mean that number, as we've said many times, can move around. But I think if you're thinking in the range of $70 million to $75 million for kind of a \"normalized level\" for that line, that's probably a good range to pick, Brian.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "I just want to go back to the processing fee line that moved around this quarter. It was up $49 million. But then last quarter, if I recall correctly, there were some markdowns on some of those securities. So how should we think about that as kind of a good kind of run rate number, because some of that won't stay around obviously?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, I mean, it was all related to our decision to exit a fixed income trading initiative that we had looked at in the last couple of years, Andrew. So on a go-forward basis, given that we're done with the exit, there should be no effect to that line for those types of market value adjustments.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Right. But then last quarter, it was unusually low, if I recall, in the fourth quarter, right?", "Edward J. Resch", "Right.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "So if we adjust for that and adjust for the upward revisions this quarter, based on kind of the -- my quick take on it, it looks like kind of in the mid-70s or low 70s should be kind of a good run rate. Is that fair? Or am I missing something in terms of...", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, yes -- no, that is fair. I just answered that to a question previously. But yes, I think if you strip out the fourth quarter and first quarter impact of this exiting that we undertook, yes, $70 million to $75 million is probably a good estimate for that line on a normalized basis. I mean that line can move around, as we've said. But that's probably a good range.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then just to back up a little bit on -- a lot of focus obviously on expenses this quarter and going forward, but -- in your comp revenue target. But can you just give us a sense of kind of overall this year, is it achievable? Or is it possible to achieve positive operating leverage in this environment, given we're still not into kind of the heavy lifting on the IT cloud initiative yet? Or do we have to wait until next year?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, again, I think it's, in large part, a function of how the revenue picture unfolds for the full year. And as we've said, if revenue does not grow in a robust way, operating leverage will be a difficult thing for us to achieve, with obviously the opposite being true, that if revenue grows 10-plus, 12-plus percent on an annual basis, the operating leverage should move rather easily onto the page. So I think it's too early to say what our prediction is for the full year, Andrew, but at a relatively modest level of revenue growth, I think it's fair to say that operating leverage will be difficult to achieve on a full year basis, assuming the market-driven revenues continue to be in something of a trough.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from the line of John Stilmar with SunTrust.", "John W. Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Gentlemen, just with regards to your operating expense initiatives. One of the things that you've talked about is not just the dollars of expense savings and the potential operating leverage past 2012, but also new business wins that could drive the top line. Are you seeing evidence that -- or can you share with us progress, at least in terms of potential new business wins or new areas, that we might think about for the top line because of capabilities and functionality that you've created from your operating expense initiatives?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, John, we have started to see some of that. In fact, this quarter, we introduced a couple of new products. They tend to be data- and analytics-oriented new products and services, which were enabled based on moving to the cloud environment. So I think it's early days. But the evidence is quite strong that in the cloud environment, we'll be able to not only improve the speed with which we deliver new services, but the flexibility around information and analytics services which are in great demand by our customers. We should be able to be a little bit more creative and innovative on the information side. And we did introduce, I think, 2 products, in particular, in the first quarter that fit that bill. So I think, appropriately, the IT and ops transformation is focused on executing against the cost saves. But your question just -- does draw out a point, which is we think it's transformational because we think that we're doing something that no one else in this custody group is doing and it will, over time, enable us to differentiate more on the product side, and we see evidence of that.", "John W. Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then I guess your answer dovetails back into my second question, which is many of us analysts -- and we've repeatedly asked on this call. The yield or fees per assets under custody, which, for lack of a better term, has shown less of volatility during down markets and doesn't necessarily trend up as well during bullish markets, which leads me to think that the services business or the custody business has a greater proportion of fees that aren't necessarily tied directly to assets. If that's -- one, would you agree that over the past 2 years or so that there's been a greater composition of custody revenues that aren't necessarily tied to assets? And if so, how should we think about that unfolding for the next couple of years?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "And when you say -- are you isolating servicing fees or overall fees?", "John W. Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Just the asset custody fees, fees per AUC.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, it's -- unfortunately, the mix is so varied, whether it's alternative, whether it's long-only, whether it's U.S., non-U.S., whether it has a middle office component. It's hard to isolate those variables to give you a clear direction on that. Our strategy is to, as you know, by our 80% of new revenues coming from existing customers, to cross-sell a wide variety of products and services. And we think over time, if we do that and customers are successful and assets grow, not only will we be the beneficiary of the revenue growth, but we can also further penetrate some of the transactional service fees. But it's hard to isolate specifically for that question. Thanks, John. We look forward to talking to all of you at the end of the second quarter call.

Kelley MacDonald", "Before Jay Hooley, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ed Resch, our Chief Financial Officer, begin their remarks, I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in State Street's 2011 annual report on Form 10-K and its subsequent filings with the SEC.", "We encourage you to review those filings, including the sections on risk factors concerning any forward-looking statements we make today.

Hooley", "Thanks, Kelley, and good morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning. Overall our financial results improved in our second quarter from our first quarter of 2012, with a 20% increase in operating basis earnings per share, but were affected by increasing weakness in international markets, reflecting global concern about the stability of the Eurozone.", "We remain cautious in our outlook for the second half of the year and very focused on delivering value-added solutions to our clients and controlling expenses.", "Our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program has contributed to our results in a difficult market environment, while positioning us favorably when the economic outlook improves, and has also enabled us to accelerate new product development for our clients.", "In addition, the reduction in compensation expenses and strong expense control, coupled with business momentum, enabled us to achieve positive operating leverage in the second quarter compared to the first quarter of 2012 on an operating basis.", "The ratio of compensation expenses to total operating basis revenue improved to 38.8% in the second quarter, as a result of the absence of the seasonal accounting effects related to retirement-eligible employees recorded in the first quarter and a continuing success of the Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. Our capital position remained very strong and allowed us to repurchase 480 million of our common stock in the second quarter of 2012 and to increase our quarterly common stock dividend in 2012 to $0.24 per share.", "In addition to remarks about our second quarter results, this morning I'll address our continuing success in generating new business in our core asset servicing and asset management business, our economic outlook, the ongoing progress of our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program, as well as our strong capital position.", "The growth of both our fee-based businesses and our total revenue in the second quarter compared to the first quarter was affected by the derisking activity of our clients in the second half of the second quarter. Our results reflect stronger U.S. equity valuations early in the quarter, as well as the seasonal strength in securities finance, but equity markets became more volatile later in the quarter and remain so today. Capital markets affecting foreign exchange and trading were weak throughout the quarter.", "Compared to the first quarter, the impact of the new business we won and installed, plus the business we won in past quarters, provided some strength in our core business revenue in the second quarter.", "We continue to add new servicing business to the core franchise. Of the $133 billion in assets we won in the second quarter, about 48% were from the U.S. and 52% from international markets. The Board of Trustees of the $36 billion Maryland State Retirement and Pension System renewed its global custody contract. We won a significant mandate for servicing collective funds from a Middle Eastern client to service their conventional and Sharia-compliant fund umbrellas.", "Mitsui Fudosan, a Japanese real estate firm, has extended its relationship with State Street to include administration, registrar and trustee services for 2 additional Jersey property unit trusts. The endowment fund at Emory University has expanded its custody and accounting services, now including risk analytics services for its $5 billion endowment.", "The integration of the acquired Intesa Securities Services business has met our stated targets, and our presence in Italy continues to attract new business. Just recently, SSgA was appointed as investment manager for EUR 110 million in assets for the Italian pension fund of employees of Rai, the Italian public television network. SSgA has also been selected by family investments to manage a combination of passive equity and fixed income strategies for GBP 1.5 billion in asset, as well as the tactical asset allocation overlay for the majority of these assets.", "Regarding the timing of asset servicing installations, during the second quarter we installed $130 billion, $79 billion of which was awarded in the second quarter and $51 billion was awarded previously. Of the total business award in the second quarter, about $55 billion remains to be installed.", "In the alternative asset servicing area, demand remains strong. In the second quarter, we added 32 new mandates in our alternative investment servicing business, and our assets under administration were $877 billion as of June 30, 2012.", "We announced the proposed acquisition of Goldman Sachs' hedge fund administration business early today. This business had a total of $200.6 billion in assets under administration as of March 31, 2012.", "This acquisition would increase our alternative assets under administration to a level which solidifies our lead in servicing this fast growing asset category. We expect this acquisition to be accretive in earnings in the first year of operation on a cash basis, excluding one-time costs.", "Let me now share our outlook for the global economy. The lack of stability in Europe seems to be dominating every macroeconomic headline for the past 2 months. The election in Greece was positive, but the outcome has not been persuasive enough to alleviate concerns that Greece may exit the euro. Questions were also raised in the market about the stability of Italy and Spain. The decision by European leaders in late June to create a single supervisory body to oversee the recapitalization of euro area banks alleviated some of the concern, but until the European stability mechanism is in place and functioning, the uncertainty in Europe will overhang the economy.", "Looking forward, we expect global GDP to rise at somewhat anemic 3.2% in 2012, reflecting slow growth in the advanced economies and more marked slowing in the developed ones. We expect the U.S. recovery to remain lackluster, with 2012 GDP slightly -- growing slightly above 2%, up from 1.7% in 2011, but slow by historic standards.", "While we currently believe that the GDP may increase in 2013, our view of 2013 is dependent on a likelihood of legislation to extend the Bush tax cuts and reductions in the federal budget.", "Although consumer confidence in the U.S. has improved slightly and there are signs that housing prices are stabilizing, unemployment continues to be a problem with a worsening in the expected rate of unemployment for 2012.", "In the U.K., the GDP declined in the first 2 quarters of 2012, the number of unemployed increased, and so technically, the country has slipped back into recession. The Eurozone economy rebounded in the first quarter, but then stagnated in the second. Based on our current outlook, we expect the GDP in the Eurozone to contract about 0.5% in 2012, followed by a slight improvement in 2013.", "On balance, our outlook is cautious, primarily due to European uncertainty and the effects that it may have on the U.S. economy.", "The performance of our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program continues to meet our expectations. In 2012, we expect that we'll achieve approximately $94 million in annual pre-tax run rate operating basis expense savings, resulting in a total of $180 million of pre-tax run rate operating basis expense savings since the beginning of the program.", "In 2012, we expect the greatest benefit to come from the business operations transformation, as we deploy automation and reconfigure our operations to more efficiently meet the needs of our global client base. We are also focusing on transferring certain aspects of our IT management to our service providers, as we prepare for the migration of many of our existing and new applications to the cloud environment in 2013 and 2014.", "We are training our IT developers on cloud technology and are currently running application using this technology in our production environment.", "Our capital ratios remained strong, after paying a $0.24 per common share quarterly dividend and purchasing $480 million of our common stock in the second quarter. In addition, we announced the proposed acquisition of Goldman Sachs' hedge fund administration business at a purchase price of $550 million, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter, subject to regulatory approval.", "I'll now turn the call over to Ed, then I'll provide some final remarks before we open the call to your questions. Ed?", "Edward J. Resch", "Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll review 3 areas. First, the results for the second quarter. Second, I'll summarize the performance of an outlook for the investment portfolio, as well as worldwide interest rates and the impact on our net interest margin. And finally, I'll review our strong capital ratios. I'll present some of the more significant results comparing the second quarter of 2012 to the second quarter of 2011, as well as to the first quarter of 2012.", "This morning, all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today's earnings news release.", "Our total revenue was down 2% compared to the second quarter of 2011, and increased 1% compared to the first quarter of 2012. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to the effects of weaker international markets. The quarter-over-quarter increase was due to seasonality in securities finance and strength in net interest revenue, offset partially by weakness in international markets.", "Fee-based revenue in the second quarter was down 6% compared to the second quarter of 2011 and was approximately flat with the first quarter.", "Compared to the second quarter of 2011, servicing fee revenue declined 3%, primarily due to the impact of weakness in international markets and the effect of the weaker euro, offset partially by net new business and a 2% increase in the daily average of the S&P 500. Compared to the first quarter of 2012, servicing fees increased 1% due to net new business, offset partially by weaker international daily equity valuations.", "In our servicing business, clients derisked their investment preferences later in the second quarter, primarily moving from U.S. domestic and emerging market equity funds to fixed income and government funds. Management fees were down 2% from the second quarter of 2011, primarily due to weakness in month-end international equity valuations, offset partially by new business, and increased 4% from the first quarter due to new business, offset partially by weaker international month-end equity valuations.", "Given the continued weakness in international markets, we are adjusting our assumption for the 2012 EAFE average to decline to about 1,400 for the full year, down 12% from 1,590 in 2011 and revised from our assumption of 1,490 earlier this year.", "At SSgA, net new business was a negative $6 billion. This was composed of inflows into ETFs, adding about $7 billion in net inflows, with about $1 billion net into institutional and fixed-income funds, which were primarily passive, offset partially by $12 billion in cash outflows, primarily due to the reduced positions in securities lending collateral as the seasonal impact of the dividend season in Europe dissipated, and $2 billion of outflows from active and enhanced equity funds as clients derisked.", "Our money market fee waivers were $7 million, a decline from $9 million from the first quarter of 2012. Regarding trading services and securities finance, trading services in the second quarter of 2012 declined 18% compared to the second quarter of 2011 and declined 9% compared to the first quarter of 2012.", "Compared to the year ago quarter and the first quarter of 2012, second quarter foreign exchange revenue decreased 24% and 13%, respectively, with both declines due primarily to lower volatility reflecting weak capital markets, offset partially by slightly higher volumes. Compared to the second quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, brokerage and other fee revenue declined 11% and 4%, respectively, due primarily to weaker revenue from sales and trading.", "In foreign exchange, the second quarter of 2012, the percentage of total foreign exchange revenue generated by our indirect offering decreased about 12% from the first quarter compared to a 15% decline in revenue from the direct foreign exchange services, both of which reflected overall weakness in the capital markets.", "Compared to the second quarter of 2011, securities finance revenue increased 4% in the second quarter of 2012 due to higher spreads, offset partially by lower volumes, and increased 47% compared to the first quarter of 2012, due primarily to the normal second quarter seasonal increase.", "In the second quarter of 2012, the average 3-month LIBOR to Fed funds effective rate was 30.2 basis points, compared to 16.1 basis points in the second quarter of 2011 and to 39.9 basis points in the first quarter of 2012.", "Securities on loan averaged $337 billion for the second quarter of 2012, down from $379 billion for the second quarter of 2011 due to lower demand and up from $331 billion for the first quarter of 2012, due principally to seasonality.", "Average lendable assets for the second quarter of 2012 were about $2.36 trillion, down 0.5% from $2.37 trillion in the second quarter of 2011 and flat with the first quarter of 2012.", "As of June 30, 2012, the duration of the securities finance book was approximately 18 days, flat with the second quarter of 2011 and up slightly from 16 days in the first quarter of 2012.", "Processing fees and other revenue was $48 million, down 31% from $70 million in the second quarter of 2011, due primarily to a gain on a early termination of a lease in the second quarter of 2011 and additional amortization expense in the second quarter of 2012 related to our tax-advantaged investments.", "Compared to the first quarter of 2012, processing fees and other revenue decreased 49% from $94 million, due primarily to the positive first quarter 2012 impact of fair-value adjustments related to positions in the fixed-income trading initiative and second quarter 2012 amortization expense related to our tax-advantaged investments.", "Operating basis net interest revenue of $629 million in the second quarter of 2012 increased about 14% compared to the second quarter of 2011, primarily due to a higher level of earning assets, including a larger investment portfolio, as well as lower funding costs, partially offset by lower yields on our earning assets.", "Compared to the first quarter of 2012, operating basis net interest revenue increased 4%, primarily due to lower funding costs and a larger investment portfolio, partially offset by lower yields on assets generally.", "In the second quarter, excess client deposits averaged about $15 billion compared to $18 billion in the first quarter. Our operating basis net interest margin was 154 basis points in the second quarter of 2012, up slightly from 152 basis points in the first quarter of 2012.", "Now turning to expenses. Compensation and benefit expenses decreased 7%, or $67 million, to $942 million from the second quarter of 2011, primarily due to the impact of cost savings resulting from lower incentive compensation, and 11% or $122 million from the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to the impact of the seasonal accounting effects of approximately $105 million of equity compensation for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes in the first quarter. Additionally, both periods benefited from the Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program savings, which were offset partially by the effect of merit increases effective April 1, 2012.", "In the second quarter of 2012, compensation and benefits expenses were approximately 38.8% of total operating basis revenue, down from 44.3% in the first quarter.", "For the full year, we continue to target a reduction of the ratio of compensation and benefits expenses to total operating basis revenue by about 100 basis points compared to 40.2% in 2011, assuming a modest increase in total operating basis revenue, an outlook which appears less certain now than in the first quarter.", "The increases of 5% and 9% in information systems and communications expenses compared to the second quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, respectively, were due primarily to the transfer of certain IT functions to our service providers as part of the Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program.", "Operating basis other expenses were $291 million, up 20% compared to the second quarter of 2011 and up 19% compared to the first quarter of 2012. Both increases were due to higher securities processing costs and increased professional fees driven by regulatory initiatives. Our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program is on track. You can particularly see the progress we are making in the reductions in compensation and benefits expenses. In our operating basis expenses, we incurred $25 million of nonrecurring costs related to the program, consisting of $20 million in compensation and benefits expenses and $5 million in several other expense lines in the income statement.", "As you may recall, we have previously indicated that we expect our nonrecurring costs to peak in 2012 at an average of about $25 million per quarter.", "Now let me turn to the investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio as of June 30, 2012, of $114.4 billion increased about $8 billion compared to June 30, 2011.", "During the second quarter, we invested about $7.9 billion in highly rated securities at an average price of $102.5 and with an average yield of 1.95% and a duration of approximately 2.54 years.", "During the quarter, we invested about $3.3 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities and $2.7 billion in asset-backed securities. The remainder was primarily invested in small denominations of commercial mortgage-backed securities and in corporate and municipal bonds. The aggregate net unrealized after-tax loss in our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios as of June 30, 2012, was $54 million compared to a net unrealized after-tax loss of $81 million as of March 31, 2012. The improvement in the net unrealized after-tax position compared to March 31, 2012, was due primarily to the benefit of lower rates, offset partially by the impact of wider spreads.", "In our investment portfolio presentation, we have updated the data through quarter-end for you to review. As of June 30, 2012, our portfolio was 89% AAA or AA-rated. The duration of the investment portfolio was 1.59 years at June 30, 2012, up slightly from 1.57 years at March 31, 2012.", "The duration gap of the entire balance sheet was 0.41 years, down from 0.49 years at March 31, 2012. And this duration gap is in line with our guidelines.", "As of June 30, 2012, 57% of our investment portfolio was invested in floating-rate securities and 43% in fixed rate securities.", "Regarding the European assets. We have no direct sovereign debt exposure to the peripheral countries of Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy or Ireland in our investment portfolio.", "Of our non-U.S. assets, we hold about $900 million in securities from 4 of those peripheral countries, primarily RMBS and all floating-rate securities. These entail $400 million of securities from Italy; $300 million from Spain; and about $100 million each from Ireland and Portugal. All of these securities are performing well, except for a few bonds. We sold all of our Greek securities during the second quarter, about $91 million worth, and recorded a non-operating pre-tax loss of about $46 million.", "On Page 7 of the investment portfolio presentation, we list all of our non U.S. investments and show the average rating, as well as the types of assets we hold.", "Our primary non-U.S. holdings are British, Australian, German, Canadian and Netherlands securities, totaling 91% of the non-U.S. investment portfolio. At SSgA, our Eurozone exposure in the investment funds is consistent with client mandates. We hold the non-U.S. fixed income portfolios in line with our benchmark weightings and our actively managed cash portfolios have no direct exposure to the peripheral countries.", "Regarding pre-tax conduit-related accretion. We recorded $123 million in the first half of 2012. Looking forward, we expect to record a total of about $900 million in interest revenue from July 1, 2012, through the remaining terms of the former conduit securities.", "These expectations are based on numerous assumptions, including holding the securities to maturity, anticipated prepayment speeds, credit quality and sales.", "Now for our outlook for net interest margin. First of all, let me emphasize that we continue to believe that we should invest through the cycle. We also intend to invest almost exclusively in highly rated AAA or AA agency mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. I'll now review some of the assumptions we use in determining our 2012 outlook for net interest revenue and net interest margin. We believe that the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates on hold through the end of 2014. The ECB has recently cut rates to 75 basis points and adjusted its deposit facility rate to 0%. We expect these 2 actions to reduce our net interest revenue in the second half of 2012 by about $20 million.", "We expect the ECB to hold these rates through the end of 2012. We believe the Bank of England will hold its base rate at 50 basis points through 2012. If the Bank of England were to lower its base rate by 25 basis points, it would lower our net interest revenue by about $5 million annually, assuming market rates fall in relation to administered rates.", "Based on these rate assumptions and our second quarter results, if our excess deposits remain at the current level, our net interest margin for the full year 2012 will likely be in the middle of our 145 to 155 basis point range.", "Finally, I'll briefly review our capital ratios. In the second quarter, State Street Corporation's capital ratios under Basel I remained very strong. As of June 30, 2012, they were -- our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios stood at 19.9%, our total capital ratio stood at 21.5%, and our Tier 1 common ratio was 17.9%. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio stood at 7.7% and our tangible common equity ratio was 7.2%.", "The impact under Basel I of the acquisition of Goldman Sachs' hedge fund administration business is expected to reduce our June 30, 2012, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio by 75 to 80 basis points.", "I'll now direct your attention to the last page of the addendum including in this morning's news release. Column A shows our Basel I capital ratios. Column B shows our estimated Basel III ratios applying the rules effective as of January 1, 2013, to our balance sheet on June 30, 2012, and are calculated consistently with our disclosure of these ratios in prior quarters.", "Our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was estimated to be 13.9%; our total capital ratio, 15.5%; our Tier 1 common ratio, 12.7%; and our Tier 1 leverage ratio, 6.1%. For ease in the following discussion, I will just refer to our Tier 1 common ratio, unless otherwise noted, although Basel III will have an impact on all the ratios.", "The Federal Reserve recently published 830 pages of notices of proposed rulemaking, or NPRs, to implement Basel III in the United States. Like our peers, we are still reviewing the potential impact of these proposals, and the table on the last page of the addendum and my comments reflect our best estimates as of June 30, 2012, of the impact of these proposed rules. It is important to note that the rules recently proposed in the NPRs are not final, and once finalized, are expected to be phased in over several years. The regulators have specifically asked for comments regarding the inclusion of the mark-to-market on certain available-for-sale securities in other comprehensive income for the purposes of calculating regulatory capital. We intend to comment on this proposal.", "Based on our understanding of the proposals, we believe that the simplified supervisory formula approach, or SSFA, that deals with the risk weighting of securitized assets is expected to be implemented on January 1, 2015. These proposed regulations have both positive and negative implications. As written today, higher quality assets are being disproportionately penalized in that they receive a higher risk weighting compared to the previous Basel III proposals, moving from 7% to 20% or higher depending on the securities.", "In contrast, those securitized assets with lower ratings, such as those rated below BB- received more favorable treatment under the NPRs than under the previous Basel III proposals, adjusting the risk weightings from 1,250% to as low as 20%. During the comment period, we intend to present the regulatory authorities the disproportionate effect of these rules.", "In Column C on the last page of the addendum, we display the estimated impact of these proposed changes to our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III, including our estimate of the proposed impact of the SSFA as we understand it today. These estimates are subject to change based on regulatory clarification and further analysis.", "The implementation of the SSFA, without giving effect to asset run-off in the investment portfolio or any management actions, is expected to reduce our Tier 1 common ratio to 9.8%, approximately 290 basis points lower than the 12.7% ratio as calculated prior to the recently published NPRs and as shown in Column B.", "Column D shows our estimate of our Tier 1 common ratio after getting effect to both the SSFA and the investment portfolio runoff and assumes reinvestment of $16 billion of relevant securitized assets.", "As you can see, runoff alone is expected to bring the ratio back up to 12.0%. Finally, Column E shows that management actions, if needed, are expected to lower our risk-weighted assets to approximately $96.2 billion and fully restore our Tier 1 common ratio to 12.7%. Therefore, based on our current understanding of the proposed rules, the net effect of the risk weighting of the securitized assets under the SSFA, after investment portfolio runoff and with the potential management actions, is expected to be neutral to our Tier 1 common ratio by the assumed implementation date of January 1, 2015. We believe that 10% continues to be a reasonable long-term target for our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio using the same assumptions we outlined at our investor and analyst forum in February of this year. This 10% ratio is the foundation for our 12% to 15% target range for our operating basis return on common equity goal.", "In conclusion, while we saw signs of improvement in the U.S. during the first quarter, that improvement seemed to slow a bit during the second quarter given the uncertainty that exists in the Eurozone. We still face a low interest rate environment, new regulatory requirements and increased compliance costs. We remain focused on growing our revenue modestly, controlling expenses and executing on our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. Now I'll turn the call over to Jay to conclude our remarks.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Thanks, Ed. Although we maintain business momentum through the second quarter, the increased weakening of global macroeconomics later in the quarter, especially the situation in Europe, leaves us with a cautious outlook for the remainder of 2012.", "Our clients reacted to the uncertain environment by reducing risk in their investment choices, moving from U.S. and emerging market equities to bond funds. However, we did achieve positive net new business in the servicing segment of our business.", "We're pleased that our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program is on track with our plans and is contributing to the achievement of our 2012 goals.", "Our capital position remains very strong, allowing us to return capital to our shareholders in the form of a quarterly common stock dividend, stock buybacks and through strategic acquisitions.", "We look forward to closing the acquisition of the Goldman Sachs' hedge fund servicing business, which we believe will benefit our shareholders over the long term, and which enables us to expand our hedge fund client base in this fast-growing market. Now Ed and I are happy to entertain your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Just a quick wrap-up on the Goldman deal, makes plenty of sense strategically in line with everything you've done in the past, and you've got a lot of capital sitting around, so I get it. I'm sorry if I missed it, but did you tell anything about revenue earnings impact and any of the main assumptions you get to on the -- be accretable in the first year?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "No, we didn't report that. We just reported it was some $200 billion in assets under management, 150 customers. But just reported the conclusion. On a cash basis, it's accretive in the first year.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. So I should stop trying on the spot [ph] assumptions, right? I have a bunch of follow-up questions on that?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay, cool. And then on the Basel III. I think this got a lot of attention so far this morning. I was just wondering if you could oversimplify it for us. Walking from the 12.7% to the 9.8% and back to the 12.7% in that great table you laid out, what are the securities that are getting the biggest increase in the risk weighting? And that -- is that just a runoff of them getting back to the 12.7%? And over what period of time do you get the bulk of that?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, Glenn. I mean, it is basically the effect that I explained in my comments, where the higher rated securities, apparently, we have a lot of AAA-rated securities that are adversely treated under this proposal, may serve to increase our risk-weighted assets. Okay? And offsetting that are some of the lower-rated securities, the ones that are currently subject to the securitization deduction, under current rules, that actually benefit us from a risk-weighted asset perspective. Okay? So you have 2 opposing comments going on there in terms of the risk-weighted asset calculation. And that is what's moving the ratio down to the 9.8%. And conversely, going back up to the 12.7%, there's 2 things going on. One, the portfolio runoff that is scheduled to occur between now and December 31, 2014, so another 1.5 years or so before the -- I'm sorry, 2.5 years, before the implementation date of 1/1/15. As well as, if we need to, potential management actions to get the ratio back to the 12.7%, which is where we started from.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "I guess the main thing is this is highly likely included in your CCAR plan and approved, and you're not changing the way you conduct business. I know I'm putting words in your mouth, but is that correct?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, it's not included in the CCAR plan that was just approved, because the rules have just been issued. I would expect that it will be factored in to the next CCAR. But more importantly, the bigger point that you raise is right, we're not changing the way that we conduct business based on this. We feel like we have ample capital, enough room to react to this if we need to. Remember the rules are proposed, they're not final. And a lot could change between now and implementation date.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. And a follow-up on the Greek securities sale, and I apologize if I missed this, too. But did you say what exactly they were? What -- where they were held? And if all the mark-to-market was taken this quarter?", "Edward J. Resch", "I didn't, but I'm happy to go into it with you. There were 5 bonds. They were all RMBS. They were held in our investment portfolio and held to maturity. They totaled $91 million of principal amount, and we booked a $46 million loss on them. It's a total exit of our Greek position. We thought that given the uncertainty in Europe, and more specifically, the extraordinary events in Greece, that it was wise -- and we did this before the election on June 17, it was wise for us to exit the position.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Got it. And I take it you're assessing the other periphery -- the securities held in the other periphery on the same basis right now?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, yes, I mean, obviously, there is still a lot of disruption in the Eurozone. We have about $900 million of securities in the peripheral countries, they are virtually all RMBS. They're all performing well, with the exception of a handful of a couple of bonds that are on our watch list. But we don't think that the situation, as it relates to those specific securities that we hold, is anywhere close to our analysis of what we saw as the potential on the Greek position, which is why we sold the Greek position and we still are holding securities in the other peripheral countries.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay, now, that's very helpful. Last one is just curious...", "S. Kelley MacDonald", "Glenn, we really need to move along. We've kind of given you a little bit of our time. But you can get back to me, Kevin or Valerie, later today and we could be helpful.", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes. I'm happy to get back on, Glenn.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just a follow-up on capital. I just wanted to -- from a big picture perspective, you've got the NPR changes, 75 to 80 basis points also from the deal today. So as you look forward, does this at all change the way you're looking at the buyback? Will you continue to pour through the buyback as planned in this year's allowable? And then will it change at all the way you think about capital return into next year and acquisitions as well?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, Ken, let me pick that up. The proposed acquisition of Goldman Sachs' hedge fund administration business will go through a regulatory approval process. And we'll conclude, based on that, the deal, hopefully, in the fourth quarter is our current plan. I guess the point about capital decisions, I go back to the kind of point in time, we plan to continue to execute the buyback. But should other acquisition opportunities come along, we would evaluate those from a standpoint of shareholder return versus continuing to buy back our stock based on what's outstanding and where the stock is trading. So our plan is to continue it, but it could be interrupted by other possible acquisition opportunities.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "But that will -- okay. So -- and that's my second question, was just related to -- you're talking about using 75, 80 basis points of capital on something that will be cash accretive but GAAP dilutive next year. First of all, can you talk about when this deal will turn to GAAP accretive, and any magnitude, if you can help us on that? And then secondly, how do you think through that deals versus buyback? Is it in fact the trade-off? I thought it was always supposed to be kind of separate from however you think through your buyback? And what changed? Did something change with this NPR restatement?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes. I mean, nothing has changed in terms of our thinking relative to the NPR, Ken. The deal on a GAAP basis is slightly dilutive currently. It will turn to be accretive out in 2014, 2015, in that timeframe. But the thinking has not changed. I mean, we're in a bit of a unique position, I think, in that the pure numerical analysis of buyback versus acquisition is somewhat constrained because of the CCAR and the plan that we have approved, okay? So it's not a pure analysis of one versus the other. The way that we looked at this transaction was it made sense. It was strategic. It was opportunistic. Obviously, it may not necessarily been here in the future. And we had a CCAR plan approved. So we thought it made sense to do it. Going forward, as I said before, it depends how the Fed factors the Basel III proposals, and I underscore proposals, into the next CCAR and what effect that has on any potential capital distribution next year or any potential acquisitions.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "All right. Okay. And then last little one, just on other expenses was much higher this quarter versus last, anything you can point out in there?", "Edward J. Resch", "Sure. Yes. Other expenses are really 2 things going on. One was our securities processing costs. We're comparing a low quarter, Q1 actually had a credit for those securities processing cost, a small credit, but it's relevant to a higher level of securities processing expenses in Q2. So you've got that delta. And then you have a ramp up in professional services, Q1 to Q2. That's driven by 2 things. One, these regulatory initiatives were talking so much about. We're spending on -- spending money on professional services in order to evaluate them. And two, the expenses associated with the transformation program. Those also incur some professional services, some consulting costs. So those 2 things are the drivers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "You're making really good progress on the long-term transformation program. But could we just get an update on the asset servicing competitive landscape or the conversations on pricing changing or the composition of what clients are asking for a change and all?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Sure. Let me take a good shot at that, Howard. The -- on the asset servicing, second quarter, you saw that revenues were up 1%. We just begin to frame the question. S&P was up slightly quarter-to-quarter. The EAFE average daily was down, I think, 7%. So that performance was constrained by the market. The -- I'd say from a standpoint of market activity, pipeline, deal flow, pretty constant through the quarter. I'd say the demand is high and pretty consistent from a standpoint of customer deal flow and prospect pipeline. I'd say on the pricing point, which is the other point you raised, the longer this environment hangs around and the more constraining it is on some of our revenue lines, the more aggressive, I'd say aggressive, or the more formalized our plans are to make sure that we're capturing fair economics from our customers. So we have a pretty broad-based effort underway across, obviously, only those customers that require some remediation to get the margin up to our target margin internally, and have gone out to customers with requests for increases in fees, broader servicing relationships in order to correct some of those situations. So I would characterize that as more of a journey as far as the pricing environment. From a standpoint of the competitive pricing environment, I would say it's mixed. It's probably mix by geography, mix by asset class, but generally, it doesn't feel that changed from prior quarters. Did that capture, Howard, your -- the essence of your question?", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Yes, that was very comprehensive. And Ed, on the NPR, you focused a lot of your commentary on the risk weightings for securitized assets and the non-investment grade securities. But putting those 2 elements aside, do you have any thoughts on some of the other factors that we heard about, including counter-party risk and the supplemental leverage ratio and potential impact on you all?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, our analysis so far on those other elements is ongoing. And our view is that a lot of them are immaterial to us and net probably don't have much of an effect on us. The 2 things that I mentioned in the call are the ones that we're the most focused on, and I think, potentially have the most effect, which is the mark, OCI and the SSFA, Howard.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then final one, you have both been really conservative about the FX outlook and what mix shift you might see. I guess with all that said, I would have thought maybe we could see a sequential quarter-on-quarter lift to given international dividend season? I mean, could you just put a little bit more content around what you already said in the prepared remarks, Ed?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, I mean, we saw both the sales and trading and the indirect FX both down sequential quarter. It was across-the-board in both of the areas. Indirect FX volumes were down a bit. The FX sales and trading, which includes direct, the volumes were up a little bit. But overall, it was a quarter where it was tough in our FX business, Howard.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "And our FX business would be proportionately more tied to the core asset servicing business. So some of the derisking or the lack of risking that went on with regard to emerging market investing and global investing obviously had a bearing on that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with ISI Group.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Just one more on the Basel III. I assume the ratio out to 2015, of 12.7%, that assumes no -- or I guess what level of buyback does that assume? Is it really just at the second quarter share levels and assumes no buybacks? Or do you have an assumption in there?", "Edward J. Resch", "Continuing at the current rate.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Continuing at the second quarter pace through that, through the end of 2014?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's great. Okay. And Ed, going back to your comments on the revenue growth -- and maybe this is a question for both Ed and Jay. So in terms of your new modest revenue growth assumption, obviously, a little bit at risk with the environment being a little trickier. What -- to what degree do you think the comp revenue ratio will be pressuring that? You were saying, obviously, trying to get to about 39%, if we have a more, say, flat to slightly up revenue year in 2012 versus 2011, what would -- roughly, what would you envision the comp revenue ratio to be? And then, adding onto that for Jay, if you can talk a little bit about client derisking at the end of the second quarter. If you think that's a material impact to third quarter realization rates and the servicing business?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, I'll take the first one, Brian. I mean, we start off at 40.2%, the last year's ratio. We said we'd target 39.2% for this year, assuming modest revenue growth. Now the first half of this year versus last year, revenue growth is about 0.6%. So it's pretty modest 6 months year-to-date, which is why I said that if second half is relatively weaker, the 39.2% target is going to be very, very difficult to achieve. It's hard to put a point estimate on it. But I mean, I would think we're talking about 39.5%, 39.6%, something like that, if revenue in the second half of the year is challenged. I mean, we're not going to do anything relative to compensation just to hit 39.2%, if revenue is not strong. I mean, we have to balance out the needs of everybody, shareholders, employees, et cetera, to make sure that we're maintaining the appropriate level of staffing for the business.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And that's still year-on-year progress, isn't that? I would regard that as good.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "And Brian, to your other question. The volatility here just continues. If you think back to the first quarter, the first quarter started out slow and then the back end of the first quarter, clients began to re-risk as we get into the second quarter. Mid-point, the re-risking went to derisking. So I just think, we are cautious because as we look out from where we sit here, we have worries about the U.S., the election cycle, the fiscal cliff. Europe is, at times, day-to-day, if not week-to-week. So we sit looking forward saying, \"It's hard to envision a short-term scenario where there will be a shift back to re-risking.\" That could happen, but we're not planning for it, which is why we make the cautious comments.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Right, right, that's helpful. And then just lastly on the securities processing costs, Ed. Can you frame how much that impacted the second quarter in terms of higher level versus the credit in the first quarter?", "Edward J. Resch", "In the range of $0.03.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So wanted to go back to the capital question just one more time, I guess. In previous discussions, I think we talked about potentially the regulators looking at Basel III framework a little bit more in determining how they will allow banks return capital in 2013 and beyond. How does that change? How does this revision, I guess, change your view on whether or not you might be able to return the same level of capital kind of post this year?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, I mean, we don't know. We have to see how the rules evolve, what the comments are. I've outlined what we're planning on commenting on at this point, the 2 big items I noted. And we have to see how the regulators factor these proposals or maybe some revisions to the proposals in their thinking about the next CCAR. We just don't know at this point.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, understood. And then on net interest margin and I appreciate guidance you guys give around some sensitivity into the back half of the year. But I guess looking at the balances, can you give us a little bit more granularity on maybe where the deposits sort of sit with you guys, with which central banks versus the Fed or the ECB, just to get a sense of the sensitivity from here, if there's further rate cuts?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, they're mainly with the Fed, but they're also in part with the ECB. And they can ebb and flow, Alex. It depends where those deposits actually come in. Right now, the excess deposits are largely DDA in the U.S. So we're leaving them at the Fed, principally.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then the last question that I have for you guys is just on bigger picture on the margins, which you look at over the last, call it, 2 quarters. Your pre-tax margins is in the high 20s, call it 28%, 29%. If you go back to when you announced the program, you were kind of in this high 20% range still. It feels like, call it, $100 million of the program on a net savings basis is already in the run rate. That's a good chunk, I think, of what the -- of the total savings that you outlined. But the margin hasn't really moved. So I guess what gives us some -- can you give us some confidence, I guess, around that 400 basis points of margin expansion given the fact that so far we really haven't seen any?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes. I mean, remember, we pegged that margin improvement off of the 2010 results. And obviously, the world has changed since 2010. So the answer is a complex one, but I'll try to take you through it because we breakdown how we think about the margin in terms of various categories to try to frame the changes from 2010. So starting with the effect of transformation. We think we've gotten around 100 basis points of transformation. This is June year-to-date 2012 versus June year-to-date 2011. So that's the relevant -- that's the right way, we think, to look at it, 6 months versus 6 months. So there's 100 basis points of improvement there. You have some one-timers which need to be adjusted for. Those reduce the margins by about 90 basis points. So they roughly offset the effect of transformation right there. And then if you look at the core business, which includes market impact, that's down, in terms of margin, about 1.5%, given the environment that we're operating in. Okay? So those are the 3 broad buckets, Alex, that we look at in terms of the margin effect, giving recognition to the achievement of the ops and IT transformation savings.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. I guess, said another way, if you look at -- to get to your 400 basis points of margin expansion, I guess, what did you guys assume for revenue growth for the next few years?", "Edward J. Resch", "We assumed various levels of revenue growth and just struck a number. And it really didn't matter much, frankly. We just assumed revenue growth grew at, pick a percentage, Alex, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 10%, whatever. And we also increased expenses at the same growth rate. Not making any assumptions about operating leverage. Okay? Just to simplify things. Obviously, we target operating leverage, we say that every year. But just for this model, bring expenses and revenue up at the same rate from 2010 and add in the $600 million savings, and then you'll see that approximately the margin increases by around 400 basis points. It doesn't matter what revenue growth you took, as long as expenses grow at the same rate.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.", "Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "A couple of questions. Firstly, one small clarification. Let me get that out of the way. There was a securities loss in your reported earnings, but a securities gain in the operator, can you just clarify why the difference and what causes that?", "Edward J. Resch", "Sure. We recorded the Greek exit as nonoperating. Our thinking there was that it was unique, extraordinary, given the circumstances in Europe, and particularly Greece. And we exited an entire position in the country, Vivek. Okay? So it's something that we think is more appropriately viewed as nonoperating, given that our view of operating should be to give the reader a view of the core earnings power of the company. And I think if we're talking about exiting a position or several -- 5 positions, specifically in Greece, at the class of item is operating, that would be, in my view anyway, not the appropriate way to look at it. In operating earnings, we have both purchases and sales, some gains, some losses that are at the margin, if you will. And we've done those over time and we report them as part of the core earnings of the company, and we had that this quarter, too.", "Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, okay, okay. That's an easy one. Let's go back -- I want to go back to the buyback question that's been asked. So looking at your 9.7% Basel III Tier 1 common ratio, that would be, I guess, 9% if the acquisition were pro forma that of June 30. And you said you've continued to buy back at the current pace that you have in the second quarter, you intend to continue that. But if you do that, that would have no growth in the capital ratios, because essentially you're buying -- you bought back almost as much as you made in net income. And given that your target at your Investor Day was to try and keep your Tier 1 common at 10%, can you reconcile how you get to 10% if you're going to be -- when would you get to 10%? Since I know you've said there's going to be some runoff in securities. But clearly, looking back over the last few quarters, it hasn't run off that fast that it's led to any improvement in the capital ratio. Your Tier 1 common didn't really change if we adjust for OCI, quarter-over-quarter from Q1 to Q2?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, I mean, it's not much of an OCI effect, right? But the growth from the 9.7% up to 10% and over 10% will occur over the next 2.5 years from the mid-point this year to the end of 2014, as those securities that are subject to the higher risk weighting run off.", "Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And so are these what the AAA's subprime asset-backed that you have moved into your -- that were part of the conduit that have been moved to held to maturity that you're hoping will pay down over time? And does it come more in '13 or is it more back-ended? Can you give any more color?", "Edward J. Resch", "No, it's not those securities at all, Vivek. It's some of our actually higher rated, we believe higher-quality RMBS securities. Some, mostly foreign, that are driving the increase in risk weighted assets. And that is actually offset by a benefit on some of the securities that I think your question refers to. Okay? Some of the lower-rated securities that some of which we sold in 2010 in order to reposition the portfolio. Those securities are actually benefiting in this calculation.", "Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. So you're thinking that your 9.7% goes to 9%. And then you still intending to stick to the 10% target?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes. And 9.7% going to 9% is just layering in the Goldman Sachs' acquisition in those calculations, right?", "Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And how long do you think does it take for you to get back to 10%?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "1 year.", "Edward J. Resch", "1 year. Certainly by the end of 2013.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Just on the derisking commentary. It sounds like it wasn't fully reflected in this quarter's run rate. How do we think about the go-forward implications from the derisking stepping down, and maybe put in the context of what we saw last year, if possible?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes. It's a hard one to answer, Andrew. I attempted to do that a few questions ago by talking about -- the first quarter had the same dynamic, which is the derisking started slow and then people re-risked in the second half of the first quarter, and now we've cycled back down again. So I think you should look at it more from a go-forward perspective of the U.S. and European markets and whether the confidence steps down again or whether it remains where it is right now. I mean, that's really what I'm signaling.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Got it. It seems like in the fourth quarter, even last year, like that was maybe more reflective kind of in the numbers. Is that fair?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, that is fair.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Is that how we should think about it going forward? Or are we not there yet in terms of kind of just if you were to rank them or put them in a magnitude?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "It's just that it's hard to give you a signal on that.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay, got it. And then in terms of the comp to revenue target. It sounds like modest revenue growth, less confidence in that now. How do you guys think about modest? What is the definition of modest? And why even kind of keep that target out there if there is less confidence?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, I mean, I've used the term modest and the way that I have defined it without putting a point estimate on it, Andrew, is to say, clearly, 60 basis points first 6 months, the first 6 months. 1% or 2% is not modest, and 7% or 8% is above modest. Okay? So it's somewhere in between. That was our thinking coming into the year. But based on the first half results, that thinking is lower.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just a ticky-tack question on the processing fee line. It came in at $48 million this quarter, I know there was some noise last quarter, too. How should we think about it going forward? Is that -- second quarter, is some of that non-repeatable? Or should we go back to 70, 75 type quarterly range or are we resetting lower?", "Edward J. Resch", "We're not resetting lower. I mean, I'd say, again, it's tough to predict the line. But I think I've said in the past, 70, 75 per quarter is probably a good number to use. This quarter was significantly below that for a couple of reasons that I think I touched on it in my script.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then the tax rate, just the last ticky-tack, tax rate also lower?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, yes.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Is it also reset lower. Or should we also think about it kind of going back to the 27, 28?", "Edward J. Resch", "No. I think we're -- in our press release, I think we signaled that we expect 25% to 26% effective for the full year. And that's a combination of 2 things. One, the overall mix of revenue. We're obviously getting some advantage there. And then secondly, we have, and this is one of the benefits in the second quarter, a renewable energy investment which is generating some positive tax effects and will be for the full year.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Thank you. I appreciate all your time this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again after the third quarter. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes the conference.

[Operator Instructions] Now I would like to introduce Valerie Haertel, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations of State Street.", "Valerie C. Haertel", "Thank you, Christy. And good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2012 earnings call. You may have noticed that we made some changes this quarter to the presentation of information in our earnings materials as a result of feedback we received from many of you. We hope that the new format of the earnings press release and the addition of the financial highlights slide presentation are helpful in enabling you to access the information you need quickly and to aide your understanding of our results.", "Our third quarter 2012 earnings materials, including the slide presentation that Jay Hooley, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ed Resch, our Chief Financial Officer, will refer to in their remarks and reconciliations of non-GAAP or operating basis measures to GAAP, measures referenced in this webcast, our financial trends package as well as other materials can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Before Jay and Ed begin their discussion of third quarter results, I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in State Street's 2011 annual report on Form 10-K and its subsequent filings with the SEC. We encourage you to review those filings, including the sections on risk factors, concerning any forward-looking statements we make today. Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of today, October 16, 2012. The corporation does not undertake to revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after today.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman, President and CEO, Jay Hooley.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Thanks, Valerie, and good morning. Welcome. I'd like to add my welcome to the third quarter call as well. And as Valerie noted, our remarks will follow the financial highlights slide presentation that we issued with our earnings press release. And more specifically, my comments will relate to Pages 3 and 4 of the slide deck.", "We're pleased to report solid third quarter 2012 financial results, which I believe reflect continued strong demand for our products and services across our global client base, continued progress on our Business Ops and IT Transformation Program, as well as other cost initiatives, and our commitment to return capital to our shareholders.", "As you can see, the GAAP third quarter earnings per share were $1.36 and included a benefit related to claims associated with the 2008 Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and a few offsets that Ed will cover in his remarks. But from my perspective, resolution of the outstanding issues associated with the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy is a positive and we're pleased to have these matters substantially behind us. If I go to operating basis earnings, here, where you can see, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $473 million or $0.99 in earnings per common share.", "And before I review our business results, I want to make a few comments on the financial, economic and business environment. Since the end of the second quarter, the environment is Europe feels a little bit better. The ECB's commitment to buy bonds and the active discussion about common bank regulation in the Eurozone has given markets a sense that the probability of a tail risk event is declining, which is, I think, a very big move. I think that the European issues are far from resolved, but I think the concern up until now had really been an event. At the same time, concerns about the U.S. fiscal cliff are rising as we head into the elections and the year end, all of which contribute to a lack of confidence both at the institutional and retail level.", "Equity markets performed well in the third quarter with the daily S&P average up nearly 4% and the daily EAFE average up approximately 3% from the second quarter. And despite this recent strength in equity markets, our clients, global institutions, mutual funds and their shareholders, continue to have an aversion to taking risk in their asset allocations and continue to prefer fixed income and cash over equities, which is a trend we've seen over the past several quarters.", "If I turn to our results, our momentum from new business wins continued in the third quarter. New asset servicing mandates were $211 billion in the quarter, split roughly 55% from the U.S., 45% from outside the U.S. Again, our alternative asset servicing mandates for the quarter totaled 32 and that excludes the Goldman Sachs Administration Services business. If you include the Goldman Sachs Administration business, we now service over $1 trillion in total alternative assets. And as you've heard me say before, we believe that the alternative asset category is going to grow proportionately better than traditional asset classes. So we're pleased with our positioning there.", "So our State Street Global Advisors. Net new assets to be managed totaled $78 billion in the quarter, which included a significant pass of fixed income mandate from an Asia Pacific client. We also continued to have success in our ETF product line with approximately $13 billion of the $78 billion representing positive flows into ETFs during the quarter, mainly into our larger ETF funds such as SPDRs, gold and fixed income, but also have noticed the success we've experienced in the 54 newer, more complex ETF products we introduced over the past 18 months. And as I say, as I look ahead in both the asset servicing and asset management business lines, the pipelines remain strong and well diversified from an asset class, as well as from a geographical standpoint.", "Our market-driven revenues remain under pressure due to client risk aversion and deleveraging, in addition to persistently low interest rates in most part of the world. Trading service, and most notably foreign exchange trading, continued to be weak with volatility at the lowest level over -- in the past 5 years. And low interest rates are affecting our net interest margin, which was 144 basis points on an operating basis in the third quarter.", "Turning to expenses. We're managing our expenses aggressively, as you can see from our results, while continuing to invest in the business. Third quarter expenses on an operating basis declined 3.7% compared to the second quarter. We achieved positive operating leverage compared to the second quarter of 2012 and the third quarter of 2011. And we'll continue to manage our expense base in the face of a challenging revenue environment.", "We continue to be pleased with the expense reductions generated by our Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program, which remains on track to deliver the expected savings of $575 million to $625 million in pretax run rate savings by 2015. And I continue to believe that this program will provide us with strategic advantages to our business over time.", "Turning to capital. We remain focused on returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and our common share purchase program. In the third quarter, we announced a $0.24 dividend per common share and we purchased $480 million of our common stock. As of September 30, there were approximately $840 million remaining for purchase through March 31, 2013, under our $1.8 billion authorization. With respect to our capital ratios, you can see on the chart that we continue to have very strong ratios under both Basel I and under the proposed Basel III standards based on our current understanding of the rules.", "Before I turn the call over to Ed, I just wanted to touch on our acquisition of Goldman Sachs Administration Services. We're excited to have closed the transaction because it extends our leadership in this fast-growing product segment. Importantly, it brings to us a very attractive client base that will have access to a broad array of State Street services. Since we announced the transaction, as you'd expect, we've had a chance to meet with most of the Goldman Sachs administrative services clients. And their reactions have been very positive, which continue to give me confidence in our ability to achieve our 90% revenue retention goal. As we indicated last quarter, we expect this business to be accretive on a GAAP basis, excluding merger and acquisition costs, in the first full year of operation.", "Regarding acquisitions more generally, we plan to be very cautious in our approach to acquisitions as we remain focused on our priorities that include leveraging the power of the core franchise, managing our expenses carefully, maintaining our strong capital position and returning capital to shareholders.", "With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Ed.", "Edward J. Resch", "Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. My comments this morning will follow the third quarter financial highlights presentation beginning on Slide 5.", "As Jay stated, the GAAP results include a net pretax benefit of $277 million, which is composed of a $362 million benefit related to claims associated with the 2008 Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, partially offset by a $60 million provision for the previously disclosed litigation arising out of the financial crisis and a special $25 billion contribution to fund the company's charitable grant-making activities.", "Now turning to Slide 6. I'll discuss our operating basis results as defined in today's earnings release and focus my remarks on the most significant sequential quarter and year-over-year quarter changes. We performed well in a difficult global economic environment. Comparing the third quarter of 2012 with the second quarter of 2012 and the third quarter of 2011, our total revenue declined 3.2% and 2.7% and expenses declined 3.7% and 2.9% respectively, generating positive operating leverage relative to both periods. Our third quarter return on equity was 9.6%. We purchased $480 million of common equity during the third quarter resulting in 480 million average fully diluted shares outstanding during the quarter, a reduction of 8.5 million average shares in the sequential quarter comparison.", "Turning to a more detailed discussion of our income statement, Slide 7 details our revenue. The most significant revenue drivers for the quarter are noted in the far-right column. The sequential quarter growth of servicing fee revenue was driven by higher equity markets and net new business. Sequential quarter growth in management fee revenue was driven primarily by higher global equity valuations. Money market fee waivers were down $2 million from $7 million in the second quarter.", "The increases in our core businesses were not enough to offset the decline in trading services, the seasonal decline of securities lending and the decline in net interest revenue due to the low interest rate environment. Total trading services revenue compared to the second quarter declined 9%, driven primarily by an 11% decline in foreign exchange revenue. Compared to the third quarter of 2011, the approximate 44% decline in foreign exchange revenue was due primarily to lower volatilities offset partially by increased volumes. In the third quarter, while we saw an increase in total foreign exchange trading volumes compared to the second quarter, as we have previously noted, our foreign exchange revenue was affected by a decline in our indirect or custody FX volumes, given the increased focus on this service. We have several ways to execute foreign exchange transactions and are in a position to service clients through their preferred foreign exchange execution method.", "Brokerage and other fees declined approximately 7% from the second quarter due primarily to weakness in transition management and declined 10% from the third quarter of 2011 due primarily to lower electronic foreign exchange trading volumes. The volumes in electronic foreign exchange trading weakened in the third quarter compared to the second, but this weakness compares favorably to industry data. The rate of decline in the average daily volumes across all our electronic foreign exchange platforms was about 2% compared to larger industry-wide declines of 17% as measured on the electronic broking system platform and 11% as measured on the Thomson Reuters system.", "Securities finance revenue declined 36% sequentially due to a decrease in activity from the seasonally elevated second quarter levels. Securities on loan averaged $321 billion for the third quarter of 2012, a decrease of 5% from the second quarter due to lower seasonal demand and a decline of 13% from the third quarter of last year due to lower overall demand. Processing and other revenue declined 50% from the third quarter of 2011 due primarily to a gain in the third quarter of 2011 and an increase in amortization expense related to tax-advantaged investments in 2012.", "Our investments in tax-advantaged investments like renewable energy resulted in a tax benefit, which was the primary reason for a decline in our operating basis effective tax rate from 27% in the third quarter of 2011 to 24.5% in the third quarter of 2012. On a fully taxable equivalent basis, these transactions are favorable to our overall results. We now expect our effective tax rate for 2012 to average approximately 25.5%. Net interest revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined nearly 3% from the second quarter due to the lower yields on earning assets as a result of the persistent low interest rate environment.", "As we have been discussing with you for several quarters, higher-yielding fixed-rate securities in our investment portfolio are maturing or paying down and are being reinvested at lower rates, while floating-rate assets are resetting at lower rates. It's important to note that our investment portfolio is comprised of approximately 55% of floating-rate securities that adjust periodically with changes in market rates.", "During the quarter, excess deposits remain elevated, averaging approximately $16 billion, an increase from $15 billion in the second quarter. Our net interest margin was 144 basis points in the third quarter of 2012 compared to 154 basis points in the second quarter of 2012 and 144 basis points in the third quarter of 2011.", "Regarding our net interest margin. We continue to expect to achieve an operating basis net interest margin near the midpoint of the 145 to 155 basis point range in 2012. However, should excess deposits remain elevated, we may achieve slightly below the midpoint of that range. With the announcement of QE3 and the continued low level of interest rates in 2013, we think we will probably be near the higher end of the 10 to 12 basis point range in terms of decline in our net interest margin, assuming interest rates, spreads and prepayment speeds remain at their current levels through 2013.", "Turning to expenses on Slide 8. You can see that overall expenses declined 3.7% compared to the second quarter and 2.9% from the year-ago third quarter. The decline in compensation and employee benefits expenses compared to the second quarter of 2012 and the third quarter of 2011 was primarily due to lower compensation benefit costs associated with the execution of the Business Operations and IT Transformation Program. Compared to the third quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2012, information systems and communications expenses increased as a result of the planned transition of certain functions to service providers as part of the Business Operations and IT Transformation Program. In the third quarter, compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total operating basis revenue was 39.0%, a slight increase from 38.8% in the second quarter.", "I would like to remind you that our first quarter ratio was unusually high at 44.3% due to the impact of the effective employee demographics on equity compensation for retirement-eligible employees. Revenue growth is an important factor in determining the comp-to-revenue ratio. In setting our goal of improving the compensation-to-revenue ratio by 100 basis points for 2012 compared to 40.2% for 2011, we assumed modest revenue growth in 2012. However, revenue has declined on a year-over-year 9-month basis by approximately 50 basis points. While core revenues have performed reasonably well, market-driven revenues have been soft. We've been working diligently on improving our expense base and taking action where we can and we are continuing to do that in the fourth quarter.", "Despite the revenue decline, our second and third quarter ratios stayed within targeted levels. However, if the overall revenue environment remains weak, it will likely affect our ability to achieve our compensation-to-revenue goal for the full year 2012. Our Business Operations and IT Transformation Program continues on track to achieve annual pretax run rate operating basis expense savings in the range of $90 million to $100 million in 2012. The estimated cumulative pretax expense savings through the end of 2012 are expected to be approximately $180 million. In the third quarter, our nonrecurring expenses related to the Business Operations and IT Program were approximately $30 million and should peak in 2012 and trail off in 2013 and 2014.", "Wrapping up my comments on this slide, I just want to note that other expenses declined by 13% from the second quarter due to lower securities processing costs, where those costs were above trend in the prior quarter, as well as a decline in professional fees.", "Turning to our balance sheet strategy and investment portfolio on Slide 9. You can see that our strategy remains intact. As outlined on the top half of the slide, the key elements of our strategy that have worked well for us over time include: investing in primarily AAA and AA rated assets through the cycle; maintaining an investment portfolio duration of about 1.5 years; maintaining a balance sheet duration gap of between 1/4 and 1/2 a year; and targeting an investment portfolio allocation of fixed-rate securities between 40% and 45%.", "Our investment portfolio as of September 30, 2012, was $115 billion, a slight increase compared to June 30, 2012. We have a solid credit profile of 88% of our portfolio securities rated AAA or AA, slightly lower than our guideline of 90% due primarily to downgrades over time of certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. The duration of the investment portfolio is 1.52 years at September 30, 2012, a decrease of 1.59 years at June 30, 2012. As of September 30, 2012, 55% of our investment portfolio was invested in floating-rate securities and 45% in fixed-rate securities. The aggregate net unrealized after-tax gain in our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios as of September 30, 2012, was $577 million compared to a net unrealized after-tax loss of $54 million as of June 30, 2012. The improvement in the net unrealized after-tax position compared to June 30, 2012, was due primarily to narrower spreads.", "During the third quarter, we invested about $7.3 billion in primarily AA-rated securities at an average price of $100.83 and with an average yield of 1.67% and a duration of approximately 3.89 years. Of the $7.3 billion, we invested about $0.2 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities, $3.3 billion in agencies and asset-backed securities and $1.2 billion in foreign asset-backed securities, primarily Dutch and U.K. RMBS and German order receivables, as well as $1.1 billion in Japanese government securities. The duration gap of the entire balance sheet was 0.28 years, down from 0.41 years at June 30, 2012, due to the shorter duration of the mortgage-backed securities portfolio and longer duration of our client deposits.", "Regarding European assets, we have no direct sovereign debt exposure to the peripheral countries of Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy or Ireland in our investment portfolio. Of our non-U.S. assets, we hold about $900 million in securities from 4 of those peripheral countries, primarily RMBS and all floating-rate securities: about $400 million from Italy, $300 million from Spain and about $100 million each from Ireland and Portugal. On the whole, these securities are performing well.", "Turning to capital. Slide 10 has a summary of our strong capital position. Our capital ratios are displayed on this slide. Our Basel I Tier 1 common ratio is 17.8% and our estimated pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio post the NPRs is 11.3%, both ratios as of September 30, 2012. Also based on our September 30, 2012, balance sheet and including the effect of the reinvestment of assets that are maturing or paying down and the acquisition of Goldman Sachs Administration Services business, the estimated pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio as of January 1, 2015, the assumed implementation date of the SSFA, would be 11.9%. We expect to complete our CCAR submission for 2013 early next year, in which we expect to include a capital distribution program of dividend and share repurchases consistent with our strong capital position and earnings capacity. The 2013 capital distribution, of course, will be contingent upon the Federal Reserve not objecting to our request.", "Before I turn the call over to Jay, I wanted to mention that during the quarter, taking advantage of favorable market conditions, we issued fixed-rate perpetual preferred stock and redeemed our floating-rate perpetual preferred stock. In the third quarter, we recorded preferred stock dividends of approximately $7 million on the floating-rate preferred stock and approximately $8 million on the newly issued fixed-rate preferred stock. This latter dividend on the new issuance extends from August 21 through December 15, 2012. As a result, we will not record a perpetual preferred stock dividend in the fourth quarter of 2012. Our very strong capital position allows us to make returning capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases a priority.", "And now I'll turn the call back over to Jay.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Thanks, Ed. Let me briefly close so we can get to your questions with really 3 points. The first is that I believe our third quarter results demonstrate our continued resilience amid the difficult environment, as well as the strength of our business model. Second, we continue to invest in our business, expanding the range of solutions we can deliver to our clients. But we're balancing these investments with a clear focus on managing costs across the enterprise, and I hope you'll agree the results of this focus are evident this quarter.", "And finally, I continue to have confidence in the secular trends that underpin the future prospects for growth in this business. And I believe we're striking the right balance between continuing to invest for the future and aggressively managing costs during this challenging period. As always, we appreciate our ongoing dialogue with shareholders and look forward to continuing to update you on the progress of our company.", "And with that, I would open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "So I want to ask this the right way. There's been -- there's obviously changes on Wall Street on comp and the industry has adapted to the lower revenue backdrop. You guys definitely get a bunch of questions on that. And I wonder if you could speak to your views on how similar and how different obviously the business mixes are and what you can clearly control or not in the short run, so just really focus on the comp side of the equation.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes. Let me start that, Glenn. I would say we do have a different structure than what's traditionally referred to as Wall Street, in that we don't have a high variable incentive component of our overall compensation. It's a lot smaller than you'd find typically on Wall Street. So having said that, for us, the key drivers in managing down costs tend to be headcount-driven, efficiency in our core operating models, as well as -- and you've seen some evidence of that this quarter, managing the other cost category, the cost that we incur from outside suppliers. So those are really the big levers that we have. And I think the reason I continue to go back to the IT and ops transformation initiative that we have is that I believe that, that's fundamentally changing the cost drivers in this business. And it's going to take some time, but you'll find those changes will be durable and sustainable over time.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "So you answered part of the follow-up, in that not a big percentage of the comp base is all that flexible on a short-term basis. I guess, someone put this question to me recently, so I want to put it to you. Does it make sense that the business mix would have a thereabouts 40% comp ratio when you look at say, asset managers or investment banks, that these days actually have same or lower, that attritionally are thought of as much more people-intensive, comp-intensive businesses? Is it the scaling of certain parts of the business that will put that ratio as high, if not higher than some of those other models?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes. I think that over time, we've hovered around 40% for a long period of time. And I think that maybe it's obvious, but I'll say it anyway, the fee-based components of the business, the service fee and management fee, I really look to the servicing fee-based business as the offset to that 40%, whereas historically, the market-based revenues, and you know what they are, they're the net interest revenue, securities, finance and foreign exchange, have provided the upside. So I would like to think that the moves that we're making today against a very constrained, market-driven revenue should put us in a position where that 40% should go down over time as we achieve something near-normalized environmental factors, which is consistent with the $600 million cost-save plan, which we're 1/3 of the way into at the end of this year. We should see that ratio go down.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Got it. One last one, I apologize if I missed it earlier. But did you mention the one but not yet funded pipeline?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "We didn't, but we will. Ed, do you want to cover that?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes. I'll give you those numbers, Glenn. Out of the $211 billion of asset servicing mandates that we announced this quarter, $86.1 billion was installed in the quarter prior to September 30. The remaining $125.2 billion is expected to be installed during the remainder of this year and later. And then in the third quarter, we also installed approximately $115.7 billion of new business and assets to be serviced that we were awarded in prior periods.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.", "Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "First question I had, I just wanted maybe a little point of clarification about next year's NIM guidance. The 10 to 12 basis points, is that off of where you expect this year to average or where you expect the year to end?", "Edward J. Resch", "It's off of where we expect this year to average, Rob.", "Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Great. And maybe talk a little bit about the ETF business. I know you touched on the strong flows there. But clearly, you've had Vanguard in their announcements, some BlackRock make some strategic announcements in their iShares business yesterday. So could you maybe talk about how, if at all, you think you are positioned within that relative to some of that changes your peers have made or how it's making you maybe rethink your approach to the business and if there's any changes you need to make in the direction or strategy?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Sure. Yes. Happy to do that. You've heard me say before and I think underpinning the BlackRock and the Vanguard statements have been an industry that's growing pretty rapidly and has a pretty attractive growth rate. From our standpoint, our strategy for ETFs, and you've seen, I think, the last 3 quarters some pretty strong net flows, including $13 billion this quarter, has been really to have some positioning in what I would say is the commoditized end of the ETF space, but most prominently SPDR, which is our S&P 500 fund, and then really differentiate through new product introduction. I referenced 54 new products. Those new products almost all have quite a bit higher management fees associated with them. So we think the strategy should be to compete in a commoditized area and in the newer area, which tend to have higher revenues, more innovation. That's where we're putting a lot of our focus from a standpoint of investment. Now the other thing I would say, which I know part of your question is anchored around fees and the movement of fees, our large SPDR fund has and has forever breakpoints in it. So it's kind of a natural -- if somebody gets to a certain size in that fund, they get a natural fee break associated with it, which I think is a little bit of an unusual structure. So we feel like we've structurally made those adjustments around volume and fees in the core products. And as I say, our orientation is primarily towards new product introduction and the other angle I would say is geographic growth. So the ETF business still is largely anchored in the U.S. I think Europe and Asia represent significant opportunities. You won't remember this probably, but we were the first to introduce an ETF in Asia. We're building on that strength. So we think it's a great product. It's got good growth trajectory, which should sustain itself. And we're trying to make sure that we're innovative on the product side so that we're not racing to the bottom on the fee side.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "My first question, just regards to the NII outlook. Ed, on the 10 to 12 basis points for next year, can you just -- I know it's really hard to forecast, but can you try to give us some perspective of how you're expecting the balance sheet size to trend?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes. I mean, we're expecting low- to mid-single digit growth in customer deposits, which is our estimate at this point in time, Ken. I mean, I would tell you that relative to QE3, which is, I guess, where you're going, we feel that by putting the guidance at the top of the range, 10 to 12 basis points, use 12 for this discussion in terms of the decline next year, that, that captures the pressure that we're going to see on NIM. We've talked about this before, and our initial thinking already had the impact of lower rates included in it. And since we have a limited amount of fixed-rate runoff next year, and that's about a $6 billion number, we feel like the estimated NIR impact from QE3, which would be incremental to the earlier guidance, is in the range of $15 million to $20 million, which is about 2 basis points.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Right. So okay. And then -- so when you talk about low-single digit core deposit growth, are you also presuming at this point that the excess liquidity is sticky and that the balance sheet actually might see growth from where it currently is today?", "Edward J. Resch", "We expect some of that excess -- those excess deposits to transition away. So we're not projecting a significant balance sheet growth next year. No.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So the core might offset the runoff of the excess? And then there's the -- the rub is just where that ends up in.", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, rough. I mean, just like the rub this year, Ken, on the NIM is where excess deposits end up, right? So that's the point of friction.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And my second question, just related to NII. It just seems like you are extending duration, a decent amount, just hearing what you rattled off in terms of your incremental purchases. So how are you balancing out again this QE3 balance with incremental risk-taking? It sounds like you're buying your very high premium bonds and extending pretty decently. So what's the incremental risk you're taking on the interest rate side to get that extra yield?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, we're actually not taking much incremental interest rate risk. I mean, our duration gap is shorter this quarter than it was prior quarter, 0.28 was the number at September 30 versus, I think, 0.41 the prior quarter. And we have an offset with mortgage duration coming in, with prepayments accelerating a bit because of QE3. So we feel like we're taking appropriate levels of interest rate risk. And when you see our Q, you'll see the rate -- the ramp and shock are basically in line with prior quarters relative to the effect on our interest rate risk position.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And my last one is just servicing fees are still down year-over-year against a big improvement in the market levels and a lot of new business wins. And Jay, you touched on this in your written commentary in the release. How much is the negative impact from low volumes and activity? And what do we need to really see that servicing line start to do what it can do?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Sure. You're right about the year-over-year, and I would say it's -- the most material factor underpinning that is this -- a derisking that I tried to come on to, which is as our customers shift their asset allocation more to less risky assets, fixed income and money market versus equity, global equity, emerging market equity, there is a meaningful change in revenue per unit of asset. And that's not even including the foreign exchange associated with that. So I think that it's a little bit frustrating, particularly against a backdrop of better equity market, although that equity market growth is based on some pretty thin volumes. And we're just not seeing any broad-based movement to rerisking. So I think the other question you asked, Ken, is what would it take to change that. I intentionally in my prepared remarks talked a little bit about Europe, which to me feels better. I think that if we could -- if Europe looks like just a long, grinding recovery versus high event risk, and I think we're moving to that second phase, where the likelihood of event risk declines. And then I think the focus has moved to the U.S., elections, fiscal cliff. You could paint a scenario that as Europe continues to reduce its tail risk and the U.S. gets through the end of the year and the first part of next year, if there was a scenario where the fiscal cliff got resolved, I think the confidence level, which underpins the thing that's pressuring our service fee revenue, I think you could make an argument that, that's a real positive. And that would cause people to move into riskier assets, which would have a pretty meaningful effect on our revenues. So same assets but allocated differently, and then you'd also bring on the foreign exchange volumes, the volatility, so, so. That tries to explain why the year-over-year is where it is and attempts to give you a scenario where maybe confidence improves, rerisking occurs. And that should result in some pretty meaningful upside to us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with ISI Group. And his line disconnected. Your next question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Jay, just as we see some time lines to U.S. derivatives reform, I was hoping you could update us on just where we are in some of these tactical opportunities that I know you're excited about and positioning the firm for in asset servicing side, things like collateral management and derivatives. How long is this going to take to play out in your mind?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "I think it's -- stubbornly, it's taking a little longer than anybody thought. The CFTC is pushing hard, but the rulemaking has been a bit slow although steady. We have -- and as you rightly point out, we've put a fair amount of investment into both derivative-clearing initiatives as well as collateral management. And we have customers onboard, so we're even ahead of the final rules from the CFTC regarding derivatives clearing. The buy side is moving to essentially clear some of these things even before they have to, which maybe isn't surprising. And so we're starting to see customers, we're starting to see small amounts of revenue. I think that as the rules get finalized with specific dates, we should start to see a steady stream of revenue associated with these initiatives. And we think it could be material over time. So we still believe in it and the regulations have been slow, but it hasn't deterred us from investing in the platforms and the expertise to position ourselves for it.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then Ed, just follow up on the reinvestment environment. Just looking at 2013, putting aside frictional deposit impact, just how much of the floating portfolio do you anticipate is scheduled to roll off? And just what are some of the examples of securities you're investing in, I mean, that kind of land us at that 10 to 12 basis point compression?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes. About $9 billion or so of floating rate, we expected to reset next year for a total of about $15 billion for the year, Howard. And the way that we get to the QE3 effect, which again is incremental to what we said previously and puts us at about 12 basis point decline in NIM year-over-year, is the following, okay? Our fixed-rate runoff yield is about 3.2%. Our new purchases that we expect next year, about 1.2%, principally mortgage-backed securities. The difference is 2%, obviously. Already in the 10 to 12 basis point was about 150%, so the effect of QE3 is an incremental 50 basis points. And 50 basis points on the $6 billion of fixed-rate runoff is $30 million. We're going to average that over the year, so that's how I get the $15 billion. And I say $15 million to $20 million of NIR effect.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "That's very helpful. And just, I mean, given the challenging environment, I mean, are you all thinking about anything different on the funding cost side?", "Edward J. Resch", "Not really. I think we're pretty low.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just final one from me. With respect to the foreign exchange business, I mean, Jay, you noted the low volatility. But I mean, you've been discussing kind of the channel mix shift within that business pretty actively for the past year. I mean, what inning are we in? How much left do you all see here?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "We see some movement away from -- well, let me back up. The movement from custody FX to its other forms, our pricing is in the service we have, daily electronic servicing tied to an index. That movement has ground away for years, it's accelerated a bit over the course of the last year or so. Middle innings, late middle innings, yes. So it's -- some of it is work-through. I think I would say an additional way to look at it, the way we're looking at it, is there's some inevitability to these trading businesses as they go electronic. And for us, the objective is to retain the volume, to move it to platforms that fit customer needs. And by the way, some customers believe that custody FX is the right fit for them. And in addition, if you look at the foreign exchange franchise that we have here, there's a fair amount of noncustody business. So we've demonstrated that we can grow that business independent of the custody franchise. And we view this as an opportunity to gain share. So we think we've gained share. We know we have the widest variety of options to trade foreign exchange, at least among the trust bank universe. And so what we're doing is trying to gain more volume through more options to offset the natural compression spread that occurs from a voice-traded security to a electronic-traded security. But probably middle innings.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with ISI Group.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Just one more on the portfolio. That was good color on the reinvestment side of it. Just the 1.2% MBS reinvestment yield that you mentioned, Ed, for your sort of projections for next year. Is that also the current yield that you would be investing in right now? Or are we a little bit lower than that right now?", "Edward J. Resch", "We're a little bit lower. I mean, it went down, I think, about 85 basis points when the QE3 was first announced. And I think we're a little bit below the 120 level now.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So you're assuming a little bit of steepening in that in your NIM guidance for next year?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes. Okay. And then on the premium amortization, the coupons that you're buying at are pretty -- or the premium that you're buying at is fairly low. But was there a significant impact of premium amortization acceleration this quarter, given prepayment speeds going up?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, we're not buying premium mortgages, Brian. No, I mean, we had some prepayments in the U.S. in the quarter that served to actually depress our net interest revenue a bit in the quarter.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just to switch back over to the comp-to-revenue outlook so can you just remind me then what that guidance implies for the fourth quarter comp-to-revenue ratio if the revenue environment, let's say, stays stable in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter?", "Edward J. Resch", "If the revenue environment stayed stable, I think we'd probably be in the position where we're considering some adjustments as we work through the quarter. So speaking on that basis with that assumption, I'd say we're probably in the 39% or a little bit below type range for the fourth quarter, Brian.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then Jay, as you mentioned earlier, going into 2013 to get the comp-to-revenue below 40% and obviously, as the IT and ops transformation program helps that. If we do stay in, let's say, a flattish revenue environment in 2013, do we still think you can get significantly below the 40%? Or would you be more right around 40%, inclusive of that first quarter additional noncash comp?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "I would say it's probably a little premature to comment on that. What I can say is, as you know, we've got, I think, it's $200 million of saves associated with IT and ops next year. So that should be a big factor. But we're still, as you'd expect, going through the overall planning for 2013 to determine where we'll peg revenue based on different scenarios and what expense actions we're going to take. So I'd prefer to hold on that one until we get to the fourth quarter and give you maybe a more informed response to that.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes. Sure. No, that makes sense. And then just lastly, if you can comment, Jay, on the repricing environment. Obviously, we continue to be in a fairly subdued market-based revenue environment, as you talked about. What is your outlook, say, over the next 6 to 12 months and sort of your ability to generate higher revenue realization rates off of the assets that you're administering? And if you can include comments of -- or include in that -- within that a cross-sell of additional services -- your expectation of cross-sell of additional services into that cost inside [ph] base?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes. I would say pretty good progress, Brian. I think I mentioned in a prior quarter that we've got a fairly structured and organized approach to client profitability, where people fall below margins. We've gone out with a couple of waves, waves being groups, hundreds of customers, where we have proposed fee increases, and the take has been good. The clients largely have accepted fee increases, as you'd expect, where we're starting towards the lower end of our account base. But we've been pleased with the response, and so we're moving up the client base. I think your cross-sell comment is pertinent here because we're a little bit indifferent to how we improve the economics of an individual account relationship. And in fact, we probably prefer to sell them more services, which would collect the net income deficit that we have on our side and grow our revenue stream. And I think we're particularly well positioned when you think about the range and breadth of product that we have to do that. So you'll see -- I think you asked over the next 6 to 12 months. Progressively, we'll work up the account base and make sure that we get to all the relationships that we have. And as I say, I think we have the best toolkit available in order to remedy situations where client profitability has dropped below our target margin. So good progress.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Ed, I wanted to kind of touch upon something you talked about a couple of quarters ago, which is once everything is said and done, the pretax margin benefits should be about 400 basis points from the time you announced the program. So given the fact that it feels like the revenue environment is a little worse, especially in some of the higher-margin bucket, NII, FX declining, et cetera, do you guys still feel comfortable around that 400 basis point margin expansion? Or do you need to do more on the cost side to achieve that target?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, we're going to continue to work on the cost side. As we've said many times on the call, Alex, the ops and IT transformation program is progressing on track. But I think that you have to go back and look at the basis upon which we said the 400 basis points would be achieved. And that was pegged off of the 2010 results, with all else being equal. And obviously, the world has changed since then. But let me try to break down for you where we think we are relative to the operating margin on a pretax basis, given the success that we've had on the transformation program. And I'll do it comparing September year-to-date this year versus September year-to-date last year. And I think that's the best way to do it. And given what we've done on the transformation program, that should drive 120 basis points of margin improvement, okay? We consider that to be part of the core of the company, of the business. You have to adjust, secondly, for the one-time items that occurred in both '11 and '12. And that actually depresses margin by about 50 basis points, and those are principally securities gains and some nonrecurring items that we've called out over time. So you've got a depression of 50 basis points on the margin. You have 120 basis points of improvement in ops and IT. And that leaves you with the core, okay, including the ops and IT achievement, of up about 40 basis points for your -- I'm sorry, down about 40 basis points for about your 90 basis point decline in margin, okay? So we break it down really those 3 buckets, the ops and IT achievement, the effect of that on the core, and then the adjustment for the one-timers.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. That's very helpful. And my second question is, Jay, you mentioned we're heading back into CCAR times. So when you guys think about the preference for dividend over buyback -- I don't know if it's too early to talk about it, but clearly, it feels like there's preference for dividends for some of the financial institutions that could pay it out. What's your appetite for bumping up the dividend maybe closer to, I don't know, like a 30% payout versus what it is now or maybe even above that?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes. A good question, Alex. And as you pointed out, we're in CCAR season, almost into CCAR season. And you'll also recall, I think, it's the fourth cycle that with regard to dividends, the Fed has been -- has provided some guidance, let's say, around appropriate levels of dividends. And 30% is the number that we've all been kind of managed to. I think that as we go into the stress test, my comments about Europe, which I think have kind of broadly understood, hopefully it will cause the Fed to, as they have in the previous years, provide a little more latitude or a little bit more nuance to banks that are very well capitalized such as ourselves versus others. So we would expect more and more flexibility as time goes on. The dividend versus the -- first off, I should say that our expectation, and I think Ed referenced this, is that returning capital to shareholders is our #1 priority. So the rate that we're running at today, we would hope to at least be the same going into the next cycle. And depending on what other signals we get from the Fed, that could be adjusted. With regard to the mix of dividend versus buyback, we look at that every year. If we have flexibility, we'll look at whether or not it makes sense. And by the way, we derive a lot of our input from talking to shareholders over time. We'll make that determination. But up until now, there hasn't been too much latitude. I think you're aware of this. The latitude changes, then we'll assess the mix, as well as the overall return level.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Ketron with UBS.", "Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "In terms of thinking about the revenue environment or the current environment and the impact that it's had on revenue, go back earlier this year, you'd made the comments predicated on moderate revenue growth, you would have a certain comp payout ratio. The fact that revenues have trended to more of a kind of a flat year-over-year growth basis, is the way to think about the revenue opportunity being flat versus moderate growth, more of that takeaway is due to just lower activity, lower volatility levels and, I guess, impact on margin? And then if we did see that return, that would get you back to more of the moderate revenue growth that you were maybe expecting earlier this year?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Absolutely. And I would, further to that, Greg, say that this derisking thing, which is a newer phenomenon in the past several quarters, same applies. So I take it back to confidence the world gets better, investors more likely to take more risk. As investors take more risk, they move out into equity, global equity, emerging equity that drives higher revenues, that drives higher activity volumes as in trading volumes, higher FX. So the other way of responding to your question is we're working very hard to make sure that the core revenue lines have the appropriate level of expense offset against them. We're working in this constrained environment, where low confidence levels, low interest rates are casting a pall on many of our variable revenues. I think as we move through this and get our -- right-size our expenses against those core revenues, there should be a lot of leverage on the upside once things break and confidence restores. And that's what we're playing for.", "Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. Thanks for the color on that, Jay. And then Ed, maybe on the excess liquidity or if you look at the deposit levels, do you have a sense for how much in excess deposits you have today and what kind of impact that is having on the margin?", "Edward J. Resch", "They're staying about where they were in the third quarter, Greg. No significant increase or decrease at this point, so in that $15 billion, $16 billion average range.", "Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And how much that may be weighing on margin?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, I mean, we said at the beginning of the year, that we expected excess deposits to average about $11 billion for the year. Unless something significant happens in the fourth quarter, that probably won't materialize. And predicated on that assumption, we put the range of our NIM out for the year, Greg, 145 to 155. So if excess deposits are higher, which we probably expect above the $11 billion average, that's the basis for us saying we'll probably be around the middle of the range for the year in terms of NIM. If the opposite were true, we'd obviously be in a higher position relative to NIM.", "Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then the charges that are out there potentially for deposits in certain parts of Europe, do you expect that they have any meaningful or noticeable impact?", "Edward J. Resch", "You're talking about our announcement that we're going to charge negative rates, relative to Swiss and krona?", "Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Yes.", "Edward J. Resch", "No, we don't expect that to have a significant effect. They're fairly immaterial currencies to us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hopson with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just on the asset management trends. I know there were a couple of larger items. But anything beyond the ETF business that we've already talked about, anything else that would be driving the pipeline? And then on the asset management flows, were those through the full quarter? I know the ETFs were particularly strong in September. But was the other mandate in for the full quarter?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes. Let me take that one, Jeff. As far as overall trends, a little bit of reflection of my broader comments, which is we're seeing flows into passive asset categories, cash. I think cash was up $5 billion in the quarter. So it tends to be the more conservative asset classes. Having said that, our new products, the 54 new products that we introduced, good flows into those, too. So mixed, but anchored around lower-risk assets. With regard to the large Asian-based passive fixed income mandate, that was installed in mid-September, so kind of later end of the quarter.", "J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then finally on the expenses in Q4 in regard to the comp number, anything that we should think about in terms of accrual adjustments, et cetera, that would affect the number otherwise?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, I mean, we'll determine where we're going to set the incentive comp levels up the chain with the normal year-end process. And out of that could come some accrual adjustments, certainly. It depends on how the year ultimately sorts out from a performance standpoint.", "Operator", "That does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I hand the program back over to Mr. Jay Hooley for closing remarks.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes. Thanks, Christy. And thanks, everybody, for your attention and good questions. We look forward to talking to all of you at the end of the year. Thanks.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions]", "Now, I would like to introduce Valerie Haertel, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations of State Street.", "Valerie C. Haertel", "Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings materials include a presentation that Jay Hooley, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ed Resch, our Chief Financial Officer, will refer to in their remarks. Reconciliations of non-GAAP or operating basis measures to GAAP measures referenced on this webcast as well as other materials can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Before Jay and Ed begin their discussion of our results, I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements and as a result to various important factors, including those discussions in State Street's 2011 annual report on Form 10-K and its subsequent filings with the SEC. We encourage you to review those filings, including the section on risk factors concerning any forward-looking statements we make today. Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of today, January 18, 2013. The corporation does not intend to revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after today.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman, President and CEO, Jay Hooley.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Thanks, Valerie, and good morning, everyone. As Valerie noted, our remarks will follow the financial highlights slide presentation that we issued with our earnings press release this morning. In this morning, Ed and I will focus our remarks on the fourth quarter and make select comments regarding our full year 2012 financial results, then we'll share some initial observations about our expectations for 2013.", "While 2012 was another challenging year for the financial services industry due to the global economic backdrop and increased regulatory requirements, we remain committed to our strategic and operational priorities. In the fourth quarter, we delivered on those priorities, driving new revenue growth while leveraging the scale of our core business and returning capital to shareholders. And as we begin 2013, I'm confident that we'll continue to deliver on these priorities this year.", "I'm going to make a few comments on our performance which you can follow on the slide deck, and I'll begin on Page 3. On an operating basis, fourth quarter 2012 earnings per share increased 12% to $1.11 from the third quarter and 19% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Revenue growth coupled with prudent expense control including the savings realized from our business operations and IT transformation program, produced positive operating leverage on a sequential quarter, year-ago quarter and full-year basis. This morning, we announced additional actions we are taking to lower our expenses going into 2013 to align with our business outlook for the year. We announced the reduction of approximately 630 positions or about 2% of our workforce. While decisions regarding our people are among the most difficult we make, we fully recognize the need to adjust our workforce and locations around the globe in response to a challenging and changing revenue environment. These reductions underscore our continuing efforts to create a linear, more efficient and more profitable enterprise.", "Now, I'd like to make a few comments regarding the business environment, equity markets and client activity. The global equity markets rose during the fourth quarter with the EAFE daily average increasing 5.2% and the S&P 500 daily average increasing 1.2%. Those as opposed to the third quarter. While the economic situation in Europe appears to be stabilizing, concerns around the U.S. fiscal cliff kept many investors on the sidelines in the fourth quarter. But during the quarter, equity markets improved but clients remain conservative until the back end of the fourth quarter when we saw a noticeable re-risking by some of our clients as they shifted allocations for more conservative fixed income investments to domestic and global equities.", "As we begin 2013, client re-risking has continued, as you see from recent data, market data about equity flows. In spite of what feels like a positive start to the year in client risk appetite, we remain conservative in our expectations for the market and cautious regarding investors' willingness to take on additional risk.", "If I turn to our revenue and new business results in the fourth quarter, we continue to generate solid core fee revenue and experienced momentum from significant business wins. Total operating basis revenue increased 3% to $2.46 billion from the third quarter of 2012 and 7% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Our fourth quarter results include the acquired Goldman Sachs Administration Services business that we closed on October 2012. Importantly, we experienced some early cross-sell success as we introduced our new clients to an expanded range of State Street services. Core fee revenue comprised of asset servicing and asset management fees increased 4% from the third quarter to $1.4 billion. Our fourth quarter results reflect continued strong demand for our products and solutions across our global client base. The fourth quarter was the strongest quarter of the year for new business and asset servicing. New asset servicing mandates was $649 billion, split roughly 86% from the U.S. and 14% from outside the U.S.  And of that $649 billion, $143 billion was installed prior to December 31, 2012 and $506 billion is expected to be installed in 2013. Also included in our new assets to be serviced are 92 new alternative asset servicing mandates.", "If I turn to our asset management business, State Street Global Advisors had a strong quarter and year due to improved global equity markets, strong long-term flows into higher-yielding strategies and disciplined expense controls. Net new assets to be managed totaled $24 billion for the quarter and that excludes net outflows in short-term cash collateral related to securities lending. Of the $24 billion, $13 billion went into ETFs with the remainder flowing into the institutional channel including passive equity strategies and fixed income, as well as some money market assets.", "With any ETF product line, asset classes gaining new inflows with the SPDR S&P 500 fund, the gold fund and the high-yield fixed income fund. Of note is that year-to-date, ETF assets under management is at a record level of $340 billion, reflecting a 24% increase year-over-year. In both asset servicing and asset management, our pipelines continue to be strong and well-diversified.", "If I move you to Slide 4, market-driven revenue remains under pressure from subdued capital market activity, low levels of volatility and low interest rates. In trading services, foreign exchange trading revenue for the fourth quarter increased compared to the third quarter due to higher direct FX volumes, while volatility continues to be challenging. Securities finance revenue declined in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter as a result of spread compression between the fed funds to 3-month LIBOR rate, as well as lower volume. Our net interest margin on an operating basis declined to 136 basis points from the third quarter due to persistent low interest rate environments and the continued high levels of excess deposits.", "Now, if I turn to expenses. We continue to demonstrate good control over our expenses while continuing to invest selectively in the business to fuel future growth. While fourth quarter operating basis expenses increased 3%, we achieved positive operating leverage. We're pleased with the expense reductions related -- generated to date through our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. And in the fourth quarter, we were able to accelerate some expense savings from the program, achieving $112 million in incremental pretax savings in 2012 and $198 million accumulative expense savings through the end of 2012. Our transformation program remains on track to deliver the expected savings in 2013 and through the end of 2014.", "I'm also pleased that we achieved a comp to revenue ratio of 39.4% for the full year, reflecting our emphasis on strong expense control.", "Let me now move you to Slide 5. Our financial strength and disciplined approach to capital management have enabled us to maintain consistently strong capital ratios under Basel I and the proposed Basel III standards based on our understanding of the proposed rules. In early January, we submitted our 2013 CCAR plan to the Federal Reserve, which included a capital distribution program of dividends and share purchases that we believe is consistent with our strong capital positions and earnings capacity. The amount in form of our capital distribution is contingent upon the Federal Reserve not objecting to our request, and we expect to receive the results of their review in mid to late March. Distributing capital to our shareholders through common stock purchase and dividend programs remains a top priority as we continue to be very cautious in our approach to acquisitions.", "In the fourth quarter, we purchased approximately 11 million shares of our common stock for $480 million and we declared a $0.24 per share common dividend. And as of December 31, there was approximately $360 million remaining available for purchase through March 31, 2013 under our $1.8 billion authorization.", "So in summary, we're focused on growing revenue, carefully controlling expenses and creating value for our clients and shareholders.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ed to take you through the financials in a little more detail. Ed?", "Edward J. Resch", "Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my comments on Slide 8 of the earnings presentation which shows a summary of operating basis fourth quarter results. My comments this morning will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today's earnings news release. GAAP results are presented earlier in the presentation and in the release.", "Revenue increased 3.2% from the third quarter to $2.5 billion and 7% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings per share demonstrated solid growth, up 12% from $0.99 in the third quarter and up 19% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Additionally, we generated positive operating leverage on a sequential quarter, year-ago quarter and full-year basis.", "Return on equity of 10.3% increased from 9.6% in the third quarter of 2012. We purchased 480 million of common stock during the fourth quarter at an average price of $43.99 per share, resulting in approximately 468 million average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter, a reduction of 12.5 million average shares in the sequential quarter comparison.", "Slide 9 shows a summary of our full year results. Revenue for full year 2012 increased 1.7%, primarily from net interest revenue, servicing and asset management fees offset by lower trading revenues. Our core asset servicing and asset management fees performed well in 2012 in a difficult economic environment with servicing fees up 1% and management fees up 8% from 2011. Both increases are due to improved equity markets as well as new business, partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar. 2012 market-driven revenues included an approximate 10% increase in net interest revenue to $2.4 billion due primarily to higher interest earning assets partially offset by lower asset yields. Our net interest margin for the year averaged 146 basis points compared to 152 basis points.", "The year-over-year decline in our net interest margin was, in large part, driven by the $16 billion of average excess deposits in 2012, which was higher than we had originally projected at the beginning of last year and higher than the $10 billion we averaged in 2011. 2012 trading services revenue declined 17% from 2011 due to continued weakness in foreign exchange revenues. Foreign exchange revenues for the year decreased 25% due to low volatility, partially offset by higher volumes.", "Expenses were well controlled in 2012, increasing 1.7% from 2011, slightly less than revenue growth resulting in 3 basis points of positive operating leverage. Incremental expense primarily reflects new business and regulatory requirements. Earnings per share increased 5.9% to $3.95 for 2012 and our ROE was 9.7%, slightly lower than 2011. For full year 2012, the company purchased approximately 33 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $1.4 billion.", "Now, let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss fourth quarter revenue drivers. As you can see, we continue to demonstrate strength in our core business. Servicing fees increased 4.5% to $1.2 billion on a sequential quarter basis due to $24 million in revenue contributions from the acquired Goldman Sachs Administration Services business, net new business and stronger global equity markets. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, servicing fees increased 8.8% due to the impact of a stronger global equity market, net new business and acquisitions. Investment management fees and SSgA were up 3.6% from the third quarter due to higher performance fees and stronger global equity markets. Compared to the year-ago quarter, investment management fees were up almost 29% driven by stronger equity markets, net new business and higher performance fees. Performance fees in the fourth quarter were $8.2 million, up $4.3 million and $6.1 million from the third quarter and the year ago quarter, respectively. Money market fee waivers were approximately $5 million in the fourth quarter, flat compared to the third quarter, and down 60% versus the prior period. Total trading services revenue, compared to the third quarter of 2012, increased 4.7% driven by higher brokerage and other revenue, including transition management and foreign exchange revenue. Foreign exchange revenue increased 2.6% from the third quarter due primarily to a higher direct foreign exchange trading offset by lower volatility and a decline in indirect foreign exchange from the third quarter of 2012.", "Our volumes in electronic foreign exchange trading increased in the fourth quarter on a sequential basis. The increase in average daily volumes across all of our electronic FX platforms during the fourth quarter was about 5%. In comparison to the same period, the primary interbank foreign exchange platform vendors electronic broking system and Thomson Reuters reported an 8% and 12% decline, respectively in the average foreign-exchange daily volumes traded across their platforms. Foreign exchange revenue decreased 21% when compared to the fourth quarter in 2011, primarily due to lower volatility, partially offset by higher volumes. Securities finance revenues was $74 million, a decline of 19% and 18% from the third quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2011, respectively. The decreases from both periods reflect lower spreads and volumes. Securities on loan averaged $305 billion for the fourth quarter of 2012, a decrease of 5% from the third quarter and 10% from the fourth quarter of last year due to lower overall demand. Processing fees and other revenue has been adjusted in the fourth quarter and in all prior periods presented to reflect a tax equivalent adjustment related to tax credits generated by tax-advantaged investments such as renewable energy and low-income housing. This adjustment enables management to compare revenue from all investments on a tax-equivalized or pretax basis similar to adjustments recorded to net interest revenue related to tax-exempt securities. For your benefit, we have included a table in Addendum B of the earnings presentation outlining the effective line items with and without the adjustment for the fourth quarter of 2012, as well as its effect on selected financial ratios. The adjustments, which are $36 million for the fourth quarter and $126 billion for the year, are offset by an equivalent amount of income tax expense and has no impact on our net income or earnings per share. Processing fees and other revenue increased 37% from the third quarter of 2012 primarily due to a $12-million increase in revenue from joint ventures which included a $7-million gain from the sale of an asset. Additionally, the quarter included a $10 million gain from the sale of a Lehman-related asset.", "Processing fees and other revenue increased 92% from the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily due to a $25-million negative fair value adjustment related to exiting the fixed income trading initiative in the fourth quarter of 2011, as well as an increase in revenue associated with tax-advantaged investments. Net interest revenue on a fully-taxable equivalent basis declined 1.8% from the third quarter, primarily due to the lower yields on earning assets as the result of the persistent low interest rate environment. As we have noted, higher-yielding fixed-rate securities in our investment portfolio are maturing or paying down and being reinvested at lower rates while floating-rate assets are resetting at market rates.", "Our net interest margin was 136 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to 144 basis points in the third quarter of 2012 and 140 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2011. During the quarter, excess deposits remained elevated, averaging approximately $15 billion, a slight decrease from $16 billion in the third quarter.", "Turning to expenses on Slide 11. You can see that overall expenses were well-controlled for the quarter. Total expenses increased 3% compared to the third quarter, an increase to 4.8% from the year ago quarter. Included in expenses for the fourth quarter of 2012 is $13 million related to the acquisition of the Goldman Sachs Administration Services business that was closed on October 15, 2012.", "Compensation and employee benefits expenses were down slightly compared to the third quarter despite the incremental compensation assumed with the Goldman transaction and the support of new business. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, compensation employee benefits increased 4.9% due to higher benefit and incentive compensation costs, merit increases granted earlier in the year and acquisitions, partially offset by the savings realized from our business operations and IT transformation program.", "In the fourth quarter, the compensation-to-revenue ratio was 37.2%. Excluding the taxable equivalent adjustment for tax-advantaged investments included in processing fees and other revenue, the compensation-to-revenue ratio was 37.7% for the quarter. Compared to the third quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2011, information systems and communications expenses increased 10.9% and 20.0%, respectively. The increases from both periods were primarily related to the planned transition of certain functions to service providers as part of the Business Operations and IT Transformation Program, as well as additional cost to support growth in the business. These expenses are expected to continue to ramp up with a slight increase over the fourth quarter run rate into 2013 as we finalize the program implementation and transition to our service providers.", "The business operations IT transformation program continues to be on track. Realization of expense savings accelerated during the fourth quarter and we achieved $112 million in incremental pretax expense savings for full year 2012, which is slightly ahead of our third quarter guidance of $90 million to $100 million of expected savings for 2012.", "In the fourth quarter, our nonrecurring expenses related to the Business Operations and IT Transformation Program were approximately $36 million. These nonrecurring expenses should trail off in 2013 and 2014 as we near completion of the program.", "The cumulative expense savings through the end of 2012 were $198 million. For 2013, we continue to anticipate achieving approximately $220 million in incremental pretax expense savings resulting in approximately $418 million of cumulative savings. For the entire program, we expect to achieve, consistent with our initial forecast, cumulative pretax savings in the range of $575 million to $625 million by 2015 compared to year end 2010, all else equal.", "Now, turning to transaction processing. These expenses were up about 5% from the third quarter due to both higher market levels and volumes in the asset servicing business. Lastly, other expenses increased approximately 5% from the third quarter of 2012, driven by higher legal and regulatory cost, partially offset by a onetime Lehman-related client recovery of $14 million.", "Now, I will turn to the balance sheet investment portfolio highlights on Slide 12. As outlined in the top half of the slide, the key elements of our strategy remain unchanged. Our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2012 was $120 billion, an increase of $5 billion from September 30, 2012. We have a solid credit profile with 89% of our portfolio securities rated triple or double A. The duration of the investment portfolio was 1.7 years at December 31, 2012, an increase from 1.5 years at September 30, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, 53% of our investment portfolio was invested in floating-rate securities and 47% in fixed-rate securities. The aggregate net unrealized aftertax gain in our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios as of December 31, 2012 was $698 billion compared to a net unrealized after-tax gain of $577 million as of September 30, 2012. The improvement in the quarter was due primarily to narrower spreads.", "During the fourth quarter, we invested about $11 billion dollars in primarily AA-rated securities at an average price of 101.5 with an average yield of 1.75% and duration of 4.28 years. Of the $11 billion, we invested $6.2 billion in agencies and agency debentures and $3 billion in asset-backed securities with the remaining investments spread among various asset classes. The duration GAAP of the entire balance sheet at year end was .36 years, up from .28 years at September 30, 2012. The increase was primarily due to fixed-rate portfolio purchases.", "Turning to capital. Slide 13 has a summary of our strong capital position. Our capital ratios are displayed on this slide. As of December 31, 2012, our Tier 1 common ratio was 17.1%. Our estimated pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III NPRs, as we currently understand them, was 10.8%. Also as of December 31, 2012, the estimated pro forma Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III NPRs, including estimated effects of scheduled runoff and anticipated reinvestment of the securities affected by the SSFA through January 1, 2015, would be 11.9%. These estimates are subject to change based on several factors. As you know, the Basel III rules are not yet filed, and certain of our models are still under review by the Federal Reserve.", "As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2012, the company issued fixed-rate perpetual preferred stock and redeemed its floating-rate perpetual preferred stock to take advantage of favorable market conditions. As a result, we declared and recorded 2 preferred dividend payments in the third quarter and accordingly did not record a dividend in the fourth quarter of 2012. We expect to return to the normal pattern of declaring quarterly preferred dividends in the first quarter of 2013.", "To summarize our fourth quarter, our strong performance was driven by solid core fee revenue growth and a continued focus on controlling expenses. There were several onetime items totaling approximately $36 million on a pretax basis that favorably impacted our results, most of which I discussed when explaining sequential quarter changes.", "Slide 14 outlines our outlook and assumptions for 2013. Looking ahead to 2013, we expect to continue challenging market environment despite the recent rise in equity markets. We are resuming, for planning purposes, for the S&P to increase 5% above 2012's daily average and the EAFE to increase approximately 2% above the 2012 daily average.", "With respect to net interest margin. For 2013, we currently expect our average earnings assets to grow in a range of 1% to 4% and our operating basis net interest margin to be in the range of 130 to 140 basis points assuming interest rates, spreads and prepayments fees remain at their current levels through 2013. The impact of the expiration of the Transaction Account Guarantee program resulted in approximately $7 billion of deposits leaving our balance sheet since December 31, 2012. Given the expiration of TAG and absent any significant U.S. debt ceiling impacts, we expect to invest the remaining customer deposits in either highly liquid money market-type assets, including central bank deposits, or in investment portfolio assets depending on our assessment of the deposit characteristics. We expect to remain on track to deliver an additional pretax savings of approximately $220 million in 2013 from our business operations and IT transformation program, and we remain focused on controlling expenses across the company. We expect the compensation-to-revenue ratio to continue to decline in 2013 as we realize incremental savings from our Business Operations and IT Transformation Program. Our expectation is for a continued challenging operating environment in 2013.", "In light of this uncertainty, we will not provide a specific compensation to revenue target for 2013. We'll continue to report the progress of our Business Operations and IT Program each quarter.", "I would like to remind you that as in previous years, the first quarter of 2013, compensation and benefits expense will be higher due to the effect of the accounting treatment of equity compensation for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes. We expect the incremental amount attributed to equity compensation for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes in the first quarter of 2013 to be approximately $125 million, up from the $100 million incremental amount in Q1 2012 over Q1 2011.", "To align our expense base to the challenging environment in 2013, particularly related to our market-driven revenues, we recorded acquisition restructuring cost of $139 million, primarily related to a reduction force of approximately 630 positions. Most of the reduction in the headcount will be completed by 2013, and we expect the payback period of about 1.5 years due to the timing of employee departures.", "The effective tax rate on an operating basis for full year 2013 is expected to be generally consistent with the last 2 years in the range of 23% to 25%.", "And finally, and importantly, we will continue to optimize our strong capital position and return capital on the form of share purchases and dividends.", "Now, I'll turn the call back to Jay.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Thanks, Ed. Let me briefly conclude our comments with 3 points: One, in the fourth quarter, we delivered solid results in a very challenging economic environment and demonstrated core business momentum. We've continued to invest in our business expanding the range of solutions we are able to deliver to our clients, balancing this investment with aggressively controlling our cost. And I remain confident in the secular trends that underpin the prospects for growth in this business, and I believe we have the right focus in the short-term to position us well for continued strong performance. I'd like to say we appreciate our ongoing dialogue with shareholders and look forward to continuing to update you on the progress of our company.", "And with that, I'd like to open the call for questions, Christy.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Howard Chen.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Jay, you've read your commentary noting the recent re-risking that you've seen across the business. I realize we're probably early in that process, but can you help us size how much you believe that cumulatively maybe weighed on your servicing fees last year and how much you potentially have kind of recaptured so far with what you've seen?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, I would say it's probably hard to size it, Howard, but I would just -- directionally, we saw it at the back end of the fourth quarter, kind of into December, where there was a noticeable move of clients rotating from fixed income or lower-risk assets into equities, and then as well as some cross-border assets. Europe was a fair amount of that focus. And then you've seen, as we've turned the corner into 2013, you've seen some industry stats with regard to equity flows. That trend continues. I think your question is really pointed towards that effect in the fourth quarter of 2012, fairly moderate, not a big factor given where it fell in the quarter.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Great. And then separately, I wanted to clarify the expense commentary. On the additional workforce actions that you announced today, what do you anticipate the savings relating to those are? And I wanted to confirm that that's incremental to the business Ops and IT transformation program that you've all been working on for a few years now.", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, it is, Howard. It is absolutely incremental. The savings are in the range of $90 million annualized, so the payback's about 18 months on it. And, as I said, driven by, largely, the timing of the departures of the employees.", "Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. So just a quick follow-up on that, Ed. If we put everything together, your rate and market outlook for the year, the acquisition that was done, I know you won't -- don't want to guide to a comp ratio, but how do we think about the puts and takes of overall expenses 2013 versus 2012?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, I mean, again, it's largely driven by the -- first of all, operating leverage is paramount, right? So our thinking coming into 2013 is we're driving toward a year where we have positive operating leverage. Related to that, though, is the issue of how robust or not the market-driven revenues may or may not be in the year. So that'll largely drive the expense performance, I would say. But we're not planning on robust market-driven revenues, as I hope -- I've noted in my comments. So our expectation is that we'll be able to drive -- our plan is to drive positive operating leverage notwithstanding that, okay? Now there are puts and takes. We're -- we expect to achieve $220 million on the Ops and IT. We expect to achieve some benefit, as I said, on the reduction in force. But I'm not in a position to give you a number for the full year on expense growth overall, Howard.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Ed, I was wondering if you could just kind of walk us through the changes and some of the tax stuff and where it's located relative to the improvement on the forward tax rate that you're expecting. How does that all net out versus just kind of a re-showing and restating? I mean, was anything incremental? Or is this just a logical restatement and they're showing it differently?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, there's couple of things, I think, to your question, Ken, one in terms of the way in which we're presenting the tax-advantaged investments. We think that's a more meaningful presentation so we're just presenting them similarly to how we present municipal securities, i.e., grossing them up to present them on a pretax basis, okay? So the effect there is for the year to increase the processing fee and other line by $126 million, okay, and the related impact to the tax line, so no net effect. In terms of the tax rate for the year and moving forward, we expect 2013 to be broadly similar in terms of the effective rate to 2012, okay? That is driven by an assumption of relatively the same mix and, if the market opportunities present themselves, an increase in tax-advantaged investment activity during 2013.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So the 24%, 26% -- the 23% to 25% guidance there was definitely lower than you had been thinking about previously, though? And but part of that presentation and part of that is what you're investing in differently?", "Edward J. Resch", "I'm sorry, Ken, can you repeat the beginning part of the question?", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I'm just trying to understand, the tax rate of 23% to 25% going forward is definitely lower than you had expected it previously. And then how much of that is just the presentation change versus any incremental investment that you're making that affect it incrementally?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, I mean, if there is an incremental effect in 2013, it's because of an expected increase, again assuming the opportunities are presented to avail ourselves of more tax-advantaged investment opportunities.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, got it, got it. All right. And then the second question, I just want to come back on the net interest margin outlook and understanding that the range that you gave is a little broader but it's certainly in line with how you've been talking about it versus the full year 2012. What I want to try to understand is, at what point do we get to a -- even in all things equal on rates, how close -- how much closer are we to the bottoming of the margin? So on full year, we'd presume that you're still exiting '13 lower each quarter, but are we closer by the end of this year to getting flattened out on the margin?", "Edward J. Resch", "Closer but, again, assuming the low rate environment persists for the next couple of years, our estimate is that it would bottom out at around 120 of net interest margin, and that's toward the end of '14, 2014.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, so the same context of the annual rollovers will still happen unless there's a meaningful change in the rate environment.", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, got it. And then the last thing for me is securities finance. Everyone's seeing the challenges in the business. With regards to activity and spreads, can you just give us a little more color of what's going on in that business line? How quickly does that business or could that business react to a change in improvement on the broader side? Does it lag? Does it lead? Any color there would be helpful.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, let me take that one, Ken. I think it probably lags the recovery in the economy and re-risking. And that business is really a byproduct of leverage put on by hedge funds and the demand for borrowed securities. So I would say, with recovering economic environment, re-risking, I think you'd see a greater demand for borrowed securities. The business can ramp very quickly. The customers that have committed their securities to the program continue to have their securities committed. And it's really just a matter of demand in the market, which can change quickly. Spreads, as you know, get influenced by the market, so the volume can flip pretty quickly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee.", "Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "First question I had, would it be possible to get a -- I'm kind of curious a little about fee differentials between the alternative business and the traditional asset servicing business. I mean, you broke out a little bit the contribution from the recent acquisition. But if I think of the $1.15 billion of servicing fees, I think, number one, it'd be helpful to get some sense of how much of that is being driven by your ALTs business, which I'm presuming is growing at a faster rate. And any kind of color you can give on how kind of the fee dynamics may differ between that and the rest of the book? Which I hadn't -- I know it's hard to do, it varies all over the place. But any kind of color you can give on kind of the mix and trend would be great.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, let me try that. The new business flows are actually pretty balanced between long-only and alternatives. We continue to cite alternatives because there's been continuous growth there, and we think, given our market position, we're capturing more share than most. I'd say the fee dynamics are pretty similar. The -- in the alternatives business, we have a middle office, back office component. Fees are quite similar in the alternative business increasingly over the past couple of years. Some custody of cash has been included in the product mix. So not a real difference. I would say, we continue to highlight it because the -- in the alternative segment, we get growth 2 ways. As flows come in and customers grow, we get growth that way, but there are still more outsourcing that's going on in the alternative segment, particularly in the private equity in the real estate segment. Hopefully that helps.", "Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "It does. But maybe just to follow up. I mean, in thinking about within the total revenues, I mean, is it still kind of in the -- well, would it be in the kind of mid-teens kind of raised proportion of the total? I'm just trying to -- because that, obviously, from a modeling perspective, maybe kind of helped a little bit with...", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, let me -- give us a minute. Maybe we can give you some direction in that. So percentage of service fees, alternatives as percentage of service fees, is what you're trying to get at?", "Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Yes.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Right.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Can you hear me?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, we got you, Brian. Well, we'll take your question and then we'll try to come back and answer Robert's question.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Sure, yes, yes, okay. So, I guess, along the lines of the new asset servicing mandates, can you give us a sense of, first of all, how much -- in addition to the $506 billion that's going to be converted in 2013, how much is left to be installed from prior new wins? And then just talk a little bit about the cross-sell that you alluded to with the GSAS business. It looks like operating margin there is around 45%. Just trying to get a sense of, sort of along the lines of Rob's question, how incrementally positive the growth in that business can be for your overall servicing effort and for operating margins.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, let me try to take those couple questions, Brian. I'll give you a little color on the $630 billion. Ed maybe can talk about the GSAS margin that we saw in the fourth quarter. Overall, robust quarter for new business growth, as I mentioned in my comments, pre-mix, and some -- a couple of large competitive wins that we saw where we had pretty good pricing on which we're happy with. The -- I gave you the breakdown of the $630 billion, what was installed last year, what will be installed this year. And this year, it'll roughly phase-in over the 3 quarters of the year. And by the way, I said $630 billion, it's really $649 billion, our business mandates. Ed, do you have the last quarter, what was installed; and what's left to be installed? That was another question Brian asked.", "Edward J. Resch", "I do not have it at hand, so we'll have to follow up with Brian.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "We'll Follow up with you on that one, Brian. With regard to the GSAS business, let me talk a little bit about the cross-sell, and then Ed can comment on the margins that we experienced in the quarter. As I mentioned, when we announced the acquisition of the Goldman Sachs hedge fund administration business, we thought it was a great business, a sterling set of customers, but we also thought that we had a broader product set that we could sell to that customer base. And in the early days, we've seen some success, largely around reporting services, things like PF reporting which is a routine reporting requirement for hedge funds. We have a pretty nice little service offering, many of the customers have taken it up. We've engaged them in conversations about additional products and services that we can bring on, still feel highly confident about the retention of 90-plus percent of that client base. So it's largely playing out the way we thought we would and we're still pretty excited about it. Ed, on the margin in the fourth quarter, do you want to comment on that?", "Edward J. Resch", "Sure. The margin was benefited by a little bit lower level of expenses in the quarter, Brian. We're looking at the business as being around a 35% margin kind of business pretax. So we did a -- better by about $3 million on the expense line than we projected. We closed it October 15, everything's on track. Revenue's coming in, customers are retained. But I'd be thinking about it more in a 30%, 35% type margin context, as opposed to 45%. We got a little bit of a benefit in the quarter.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. So it's still better than your core servicing business, it sounds like.", "Edward J. Resch", "A little bit.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And then just on the balance sheet. So your expectation, it looks like around $170 billion size balance sheet, if I have that correct, for 2013 by your guidance. Is that 1% to 4% up of 2012 averages?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, yes.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and so getting to that bottom of $120 billion, I mean, if we get yield curves steepening, so no rate tightening of course, but if we get the treasury curve moving up, let's say, 50 basis points or so over the next 6 to 12 months and MBS yields maybe not coming up quite that much but directionally moving there. It -- I mean, it's hard to say exactly how much upside, but does that $120 billion -- and if we continue to get that curve steepening in 2014, does that $120 billion become obsolete and you'd start to get to the point where you get expansion from this $135 billion-ish range?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, probably. But I mean the $120 billion is the -- as to the question of what happens to the margin if rates stay this -- at these levels and very low for a protracted period of time, i.e., through 2015, as the fed's comments would suggest. If we have a different set of -- a different sense of the market rates that we're dealing with because the world's changed, then that $120 billion would change. And you're describing a scenario where $120 billion would go to some number higher than $120 billion, in all probability.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Right, great. And so then just for the maturity schedule, roughly, what's rolling off of your book every year that you can deploy into new securities?", "Edward J. Resch", "I can give you the runoff that we're planning on for 2013. The runoff is just about $20 billion, and that is split just about 50-50 floating and fixed. And as we see 2014, if you want to go out that far, it's $22 billion, and that's split about 10 on floating and -- I'm sorry , 12 on floating and 10 on fixed, ballpark.", "Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And then just lastly, as this -- as your projection is coming down from the fourth quarter, I'd assume you're assuming excess deposits begin to roll off, would that be incrementally helpful to them as well?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, it would, and it's incorporated into my comments on the NIM expectations for this year. As we see the effects of TAG, which I noted, hitting our balance sheet, we don't expect a decline in total customer deposits. We just expect a decline in what we have called excess deposits. So the deposits that we have and retain will invest accordingly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "First question is, if you look over the last, say, 4 or 5 quarters, assets under custody grew nicely. Servicing fees actually grew pretty well, just not as much, and I'm assuming that's a little bit of the mix shift and the de-risking that happened through 2012. So I guess if the re-risking holds -- it doesn't have to zoom up from here, but if it holds what we saw in the last couple of weeks, 2013, could we expect a reversal, meaning servicing fees grow at a higher pace than you see just on the positive mix change?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "I think the -- as you've heard, Glenn, in my comments, the re-risking or the rotation to higher-risk assets back into the year, first part in the year, has been positive. Our base case assumes that doesn't sustain itself, based on whether it's the debt ceiling or any other number of factors that could influence investor behavior. So that's our base case, which I think is prudent. If the re-risking -- if the rotation into equities and global equities were to sustain itself throughout the year, which will be a very positive case, then yes, I think you would see that correlation between service fees and custody assets. Again, it's not -- we've seen this before over the last couple of years, a quick start and no follow-through, which is what we're assuming is going to happen.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Understood. Hope you're wrong.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, me too.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Yes. In FX, I think you compare nicely to a bunch of different peers of different flavors. Assuming in my mind that Currenex has a little something to do with that, but curious of the mix of business within FX.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, the -- I'll let Ed give you the specifics. But we did have -- I think the FX environment is still not great. Volatility continues to be constrained. We've got a multifaceted and, we think, quite attractive foreign exchange proposition, multiple ways to deliver foreign exchange. And I think what we saw in the quarter is success not only in our direct foreign exchange, which is where most of the positive quarter-to-quarter came from, but as Ed mentioned, we also continue to see growth in Currenex, which is the high-speed foreign exchange platform where we not only grew but, if the rest of the industry was down from a volume standpoint, we were up. So I think the trend is good and we think we're well positioned. Hopefully, volatility comes back, then it gets even better.", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, it was a good quarter, Glenn, from the perspective of volumes, really, across the board. The direct business and custody FX increased slightly, a little bit over 1%. FX Connect was up over 8%, Currenex was up over 2%. So from a volume perspective, a pretty good story, really, across all execution methods.", "Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Great. Final one, in asset management land. You're obviously in a sweet spot and it shows in your flows. Curious what -- where margins are at these days and just overall profitability trends, as I think that's the one area that you probably do have a pretty positive outlook on.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, I think the story of the fourth quarter, I'm pleased with, but I'm also pleased with the whole year. I think we saw a pretty steady flow of net new flows into that business, ETF being probably the dominant theme pretty consistently through the year. And equally, we did a good job in controlling expenses, so I think we had a story in SSgA, our asset manager, where flows were good and they generated positive revenues. And we got good operating leverage based on our good expense control. As far as margins and...", "Edward J. Resch", "And the margin is clearly improved. I don't have it. We'll have it in the 10-Q segment footnote, Glenn.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just want to go back to the expense discussion, for a second. When you look, I guess, at the run rate right now, so like $1.7 billion for the quarter. And maybe there's a little bit more of a couple one-offs that helped you guys, so call it, like, a $1.73 billion or so. So you're annualizing, I guess, at like 6 9. Just from a core business perspective, what do you guys think you need to grow that by on an annual basis to keep kind of where the business momentum and the core businesses? And then on top of that, I'm assuming we'll obviously layer on the savings. But can we try to tackle the question this way?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, I mean, and unfortunately, I guess, Alex, the question is, again, answered in terms of how the market-driven revenues perform. And as I said, we're looking at the year cautiously from that perspective. That's part of the reason why we took the actions that we announced today to better calibrate our expense base to that market outlook. I will say, though, that overall for the year, from a planning perspective, we're coming in assuming, planning on generating positive operating leverage for the full year, okay? And that's with a conservative, muted, you could say, look, a view on the market-driven revenue. So that's the way we've done it. I'm -- I can't put a specific number on it in terms of what we think that, that $6.9 billion is going to move to, but we're incorporating all the cost of activities that we talked about, the ops, IT, the reduction of force that we announced today, in our planning.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, but I guess the reduction in force is really not hitting the numbers in 2013, right, that this is going to be, like, a 2014 effect and it's incremental to the 140 that you highlighted.", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, the employees will be leaving over the course of 2013 which is why there's not going to be a full year effect in 2013's expense numbers for those departures. That's correct.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just following up on the last question. When I look at the business types that you guys are winning, a lot of the alternatives; a lot of middle office, the fee rate on those tends to be a little bit higher. If we, I guess, extrapolate from the numbers that you've given us, it feels like the Goldman business was maybe about 4 to 5 basis point type of fee rate. So, I guess, holding everything else equal, assuming that there's no incremental pickup in risk appetite and things kind of stay as they are, should we still -- shouldn't we just still see an improvement in the kind of the core servicing fee rate just given the mix shift in the business?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, I think, broadly, Alex, it was really the question I answered to the -- in the answer to a prior question, which is, if we see the mix shift, the mix shift being two things: one, the shift in mix of investments that our customers invest in, obviously a positive. When we talk about alternatives versus long-only, to make that broad differentiation, we're seeing pretty good growth in both sides of those, so I -- there's less of a mix shift effect on revenue growth from that.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And just, I guess, the last one, on securities lending. The balance just seems like you keep going down. Any sign of stabilization? Where do you guys see this troughing out?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "I think I would have thought it was troughed out now. It's really a demand in the market question. I think it's hovered for many quarters in the 350 to 300 range. There's just not much demand for borrowing of securities, so I -- it's hard to call it. I do -- to my earlier point, I think markets heal, customers re-risk. That's one you'll likely to see the demand for borrowing recover. And when it recovers, I think you'll see a bounce in our securities lending business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "On the business operation transformation program. So, I guess, you have $200 million of savings the last 2 years and you look for $220 million of savings this year and, I would say, $200 million in 2014, roughly. So in other words, this should be the biggest payoff year from this 4-year kind of endeavor. And so I'm just wondering how you feel about getting that big payoff. I mean, you started before many others in the industry to change how you operate. How has the expected ROI tracked according to expectations? How far along are you in your cloud transformation? And what other color can you give us from the operational side?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Sure. Let me start that, Mike. And you're right, the first 2 years ending '12 were $100 million a year, roughly, ramps to $220 million this year, and $214 million is the plan that we've had from the beginning. The progression has been correcting some -- or improving some processes, moving to Centers of Excellence. And then the third leg of that is really introducing new technology to further automate those core processes. And we're squarely midstream in it. I think we've been pretty on track with regard to the performance against our original plan. I have a high level of confidence that we're going to achieve the 2013 goal. We are operating under our private cloud environment. I think we have, roughly, 50 applications that have been operational for over a year. So that's been tested, and confident that the technology is in place. We're building systems as part of this. There can always be some slippage when you build systems, but it's not one system, it's hundreds of applications. So I think I have a lot of confidence that we'll stay the course on this. Not only will we stay the course, but we will achieve the targets that we set out for 2013 as well as '14. And just -- let me just make one more comment, Mike, because I know you'll appreciate this. I just want to -- to me, this is about efficiency effectiveness, reducing cost, eliminating errors, but it's really the transformation that's going to enable us to introduce new information-based products and services to our customers. So it has that dimension to it too. Go ahead.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "It -- is there one quarter or one day when you say you'll shut off the dual systems and you go live from development to the main platform? I mean, you have to run multiple systems until you get through this. When's the day?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, well, there isn't because, fortunately, and I say this fortunately, it's not 1 system, it's not 10 systems, there's some 200 projects, so that's -- there's many systems or applications that we're redeveloping to -- and we're redeveloping them in the cloud in parallel. So there's -- as a result, there's no day, there's no quarter. It -- they -- it happens throughout 2013 and 2014. As a result, I think that it's a less-risky proposition, in my opinion.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Why is this the biggest payoff year?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "It's just the way it ramped. Initially, the -- initially, we had process improvements. We moved to lower-cost locations. The technology -- the efficiency effect from the application of new technology has proportionately higher payoff than the human side of it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja.", "Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "On NIM, what changed in your NIM guidance? Your prior range, has this come down? You'd earlier talked about '14 being just around $130 billion, and now the '13 is going to $130 billion to $140 billion, given that the 10 years moved up a little bit and you're expecting the TAG deposits have started to go out, so -- which would help NIM. So could you explain what's changed that guidance?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, Vivek, we've previously said we thought 2013 would be in the range of $130 billion to $140 billion. I think that our comments this morning are consistent with that...", "Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "It wasn't $135 billion, okay, I thought it was...", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, no. We may have spoken and just used the middle -- midpoint of the range as a point of discussion, but our overall thinking in terms of 2013's NIM has really not changed. And in terms of the U.S. Treasury 10-year being at 1.80%, 1.90% today, in actuality, if -- even if that was the rate that persisted throughout all of 2013, the effect as we model it would be, maybe in the range of $15 million or $20 million in terms of our net interest revenue, so 1 basis point or 2 on NIM. And the reason for that is because we have $10 billion, as I mentioned earlier, $10 billion of fixed-rate assets rolling off. And our budgeted rate for the year is about 160, so you can do the math on that. The 30-basis-point differential applied to that on average of -- for half a year, would give you the $15 million or $20 million improvement. So not much of an effect, again, assuming the curve doesn't change shape, just steepens.", "Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Right. And given your commentary about the $120 billion towards the end of '14, so should that imply more like a $125 billion as an average '14?", "Edward J. Resch", "Well, again, if the question is -- assuming rates stay low for a protracted period of time and the curve doesn't change, $120 billion is our estimate of where the margin would bottom out in '14. If we have a steepened curve from where we are today through 2014, then the $120 billion would be a higher number. Okay?", "Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. And one other question, on the comp expense in the fourth quarter, was there anything related -- it was flattish, it seemed like, so nothing -- any change related to incentive comp accruals, anything like that, that we need to be aware of?", "Edward J. Resch", "Nothing significant. I mean, we went through the normal year-end process of setting incentive compensation in accordance with the company's overall performance.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery [ph].", "Unknown Analyst", "Obviously, there's been a pre-sizable move in your stock price over the last quarter, currently, I think, about 15% higher than the average purchase price for 2Q -- or Q4, I'm sorry. Does that change your appetite for buybacks and perhaps how you are going to execute your capital distribution goals this quarter or for this coming year? And obviously, we haven't had a look at your CCAR plan for 2013, but it sounds like you have aggressive goals to distribute capital. So would you have any flexibility in your plan to consider a special dividend in lieu of buybacks?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, the recent change in the stock price doesn't change our outlook. We put our CCAR plan in earlier in the year. The -- and we look at, really, a distribution between buybacks and the dividend rate. There's some guidance around dividend rate from the fed. Special dividend is something that we've thought about but haven't really considered.", "Unknown Analyst", "Would you have to build that into your CCAR plan? Or is that something you can default to if you -- if the stock price runs up too much?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "No. I think you absolutely have to build it in. And I -- my sense would be it wouldn't be encouraged by the fed because of the onetime nature of it versus the laddered effect of either buybacks or dividends.", "Unknown Analyst", "And then I just wanted to come back to Glenn's question on SSgA's margin. You noted the progress this year, so that's great, but it continues to look a bit lower than some of your peers that I think would be comparable to you. So I was wondering if you might conjecture as to why that is. Is it because your product suite is more commoditized? Is it cost allocation related to the overall business? Is it ad hoc bundled pricing with custody services? And then what adjustable steps do you think you could consider to improve the margin more?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, Luke, let me -- that -- it's hard to get good comparison, I think, as a starting point. We think that we, obviously, have a mix which is more anchored around passive strategies and cash. I think that, as opposed to looking at trying to reconcile our margin versus others, our objective has been to improve the margin. And we think we're on a track to do that on a sustainable basis, what we've done to invest in areas of the business that we think have higher growth prospects, whether it's defined contribution segment, ETFs continuing to expand outside the U.S. while, at the same time, much as we've done for the whole firm, is really take a hard look at the cost model and say what's essential and necessary, what's not necessary and how to create more efficiencies. The benefits that State Street realizes as a result of IT and operations also translate to SSgA. So I look at it more from a standpoint of how do we continuously widen the margin, improve the business, grow the top line, as opposed to trying to compare it discretely to other models in which, in many cases, are not apples to apples.", "Unknown Analyst", "And then a final one. I'm sure you're aware that BNY Mellon is establishing a CSD in Europe. They're indicating that it has strategic benefits with respect to collateral management, internalization of settlement, maybe linking to T2S. So I'm wondering if you think it places you at any competitive disadvantage that you're not going to offer these services, or if you'd be interested in making a move into the upstream market.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, we -- the centralized securities depositories, that is an opportunity. It's a -- the regulation in Europe is changing, and we took a pretty long look at whether or not that made sense for us. We, through our sub-custody arrangements, we use CSDs all across the globe, and concluded that where it might be an opportunity from some, that we have better opportunities in other parts of our business from a standpoint of return on capital. It would get us into a new regulatory regime. We think it's kind of a cost re-entry to get into the CSD world. So we've taken a good look at it and concluded that we've got better options.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Josh Levin.", "Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "If it's re-risking you're seeing, if this really is the beginning of a sustained trend and your business starts to improve and that really looks sustained, how does that impact your thinking about your cost-cutting program?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "It doesn't change it. I think that the cost-cutting effort is really about creating sustained efficiency in the operating model. And it was conceived in an environment where there was pressure on that, but the closer we get to it, it's a no-regrets move. It's a way to improve on a sustained and structural basis the operating cost to run this business. And it not only has cost efficiencies but it should lower error rates and will position us for being able to produce new products on the back of a cloud environment that will enable kind of real-time data information and analytics. So we're going to do nothing but stay the course.", "Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then on capital return, as you think about how much to return, I mean, you -- how do you think about the relationship between the fact that you're over-capitalized relative to your long-term target but your near-term outlook -- earnings outlook is somewhat cloudy just because of the environment we're in? How do you think about the relationship between those 2 items?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Well, I think that the CCAR process itself brings those issues together quite nicely. And it's an exercise that we do, obviously, for submission to the Fed, but it allows us internally to look at, over multiple periods, what we think the earnings opportunities are for the business, what our capital position is, how that gets affected by things we do in the future. And so it's all blended in. It combines the organic growth potential of the business as well as the starting capital position, and the required capital requirements as Basel III starts to unfold and become implemented. So it's all ready to growth.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marquardt.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Just back on expenses. Can you guys just clarify a little bit in terms of what's different about this new initiative versus the original and sort of, kind of, when you step back, kind of why is it needed if you had this kind of long-standing, big-initiative IT cloud expenses over the last couple of years?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "So you're referring to the initiative, the reduction in force that we announced this morning.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Yes.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "We -- again, we've been living in a constrained revenue environment for some time. And as I've mentioned a few times, we -- our base case is we're going to continue to live in that environment. And the IT and Ops transformation is a structural redo of how we're offering services to our customer, as I mentioned previously. We also look at all other parts of our business and say, \"Are there ways to become more efficient? Are there ways to apply process improvements? Are the things that we've done historically that aren't critical or necessary today?\" So it's really just part of an ongoing effort to make sure that we're looking at everything, to make sure that we're as lean and as efficient as we can be while at the same time not disturbing customer service levels, our ability to invest in high-growth businesses, and do the things that are productive for us long-term. So it's just really good management discipline.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "And, well, that sounds like the original kind of IT cloud initiatives. And it -- so is -- are we to read in this recent staff reduction as an offshoot of that, in incremental? Or that's just part of the culture going out of it?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "No. The IT and Ops transformation was really targeted at our core global asset servicing business where we do -- for the 24 trillion in assets that we service, we conduct many different transactional activities. In fact, around 18 different transactional activities is where most of the work gets done. And it was the redo, it was the change, the process change where we do the work and change the technology around those core activities that are the IT and Ops transformation project. There's a whole bunch of other places in the company where we spend money to support different business lines and staff functions, and it's really those other things that are largely targeted by this announcement we made this morning.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then in terms of the ultimate benefit from the original IT cloud initiative, going back, you had long talked about the ultimate benefits, $600 million pretax, but then ultimately a 400-basis-point benefit to your operating margin, if I recall correctly. Is -- does that still hold in this new environment?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, we believe it does, Andrew. I mean, I'll give you some numbers which takes you through the first 2 years of the project where, as we've noted, we've achieved about $200 million of the overall program. And again, predicating these comments on 2010, which is our base year, okay, we've gotten 200 basis points of margin which we count against what we'll call the core business, and the core has expanded 160 basis points, okay, in total. And adjusting for the onetimers, that brings the margin -- the starting margin down by 170 basis points. Those are mainly, as you recall, insurance recoveries that we got in 2010. So the core expanding at 1.6% over the first 2 years, with the accomplishment of the 200 basis points against the program considering that our market-driven revenues, specifically trading services, have been rather weak over those 2 years, we think is -- while not certainly in excess of what we expected, it's tracking in the right direction and showing positive momentum in terms of the effect of the Ops and IT program.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "All right, that's helpful. And then should we also -- I mean, does that all still roll up to operating margins in the low 30s, ultimately, in the out years?", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes, I mean, that's -- I mean, we started with the margin around 28%, and we estimated 400 basis points improvement, again predicated against 2010, all else equal, which so far, relative to the trading services, it has not been. But yes, with those assumptions, we would expect 28% pretax margin to improve to around 32% pretax margin.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just lastly, Jay, any update on the CFO search, how it's -- where that stands now?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, let me just give you -- as we announced, Ed had -- has come to me and said he'd like to hang up his spikes in 2013. And as a result of that, we are going through a process looking at suitable replacement candidates, and we're in the middle of that right now, nothing really to update. Ed has assured me he would stay on through a smooth transition. So nothing really to update, other than, in subsequent quarters as we do have something to report, we'll certainly bring it forward.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Cynthia Mayer.", "Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess just to come back to the question of the servicing fee rates. Is it possible to tease out a little bit the impact of global versus U.S. on those fee rates in the quarter, as opposed to a rotation to equity and maybe by giving some sense of how many of those fee rates are tied to global versus U.S. within equity? And then along those lines, could you give us a sense of how your wins are breaking down?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Let me start that with the last part of the question. I'm not sure we're going to be able to be very helpful on the front part. The wins, the $649 billion, was roughly 85-15, 85 U.S., 15 non-U.S. That's source, so that would be U.S.-based customers. That's a little bit of a different mix than what we've seen. That's a little bit more tilted to the U.S. where I think we've been running more probably 50-50 non-U.S., U.S. So that's on the win side. On the...", "Edward J. Resch", "I mean, I'll take a stab at it. And I don't have specific numbers for the fourth quarter, Cynthia, but I think the way that it might be helpful to think about it is that approximately 40% of our revenue is from outside the U.S. So that's one way of thinking about the servicing fee line, I think that's valid. From a pricing perspective, I think it's also valid to look at the non-U.S. business as being generally higher priced, and it's higher priced but it's also higher cost against it. So net-net, you probably have around the same pretax kind of margin for that kind of business. And again, I don't have specific numbers that I could quote you with, but that -- quote to you, but that's where we are. I think, two, if you look at State Street from an asset servicing perspective, we're probably around 50-50 in terms of equity versus fixed income, maybe a little bit more skewed to the equity markets than some of our close-end competitors. So hopefully, that's -- that gives you some guidance in terms of your question.", "Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes, that's really helpful. And then I guess, maybe to poke into a more esoteric area. It looks like your transition management revenues were up pretty well this quarter, and I'm just wondering if you could give a little color on that business. What is it that drove that? What -- is there a seasonal component to that? Maybe a sense of how profitable that is compared to other businesses.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "The transition management, it is a little bit narrower business, just -- you know but just for the broad audience, when an investment manager is going to replace a manager in their asset allocation mix, will make moves. They might hire somebody like State Street to execute that change. So it's a transactional-type activity. It is a little bit lumpy in that it's driven by manager rotations either in and out of asset classes or in and out of managers. We've got a, I think, a highly competitive product across the globe in transition management, so we compete quite well in that space. I think the quarter was probably the result of a little bit more market-based activity and us being successful in winning those deals. I think, generally, transition management has been, against historical rates, a little bit soft over the last several quarters as a result of maybe a lack of conviction by investment managers around market direction. As people do change and as you see broad-based moves in asset allocations or even managers transition management activity, you'd expect to see that pick up.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Great. Let me just -- that was the last question, but there was a question that Robert Lee asked that I think we have an answer to, so I'll ask Ed to respond to that.", "Edward J. Resch", "Yes. There's actually one from Rob and, I think, one from Brian Bedell that, I think, got cut off on, so I just wanted to answer both of them. First, Rob asked about the revenue on alternatives business broadly. And the answer to the question is, about 15% of our servicing fee revenue on an annual basis, around $600 million annual, is the revenue associated with alternative asset servicing business. Secondly, Brian, I believe, asked how much was remaining to be installed from our wins in 2012. And the answer to that is $550 billion, including what we won in the fourth quarter. So for all of 2012, what remains spilling over into 2013 is $550 billion of assets to be installed.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Thanks, Ed. And I -- thanks, everybody, for joining us on the call today. I'll just remind you that we have our own investor and analyst forum which will be held on February 28 at the Mandarin Hotel in New York, and hope to see all of you then.

Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of today, January 24, 2014. The Corporation does not undertake to revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after today.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman, President and CEO, Jay Hooley.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Thanks, Valerie, and good morning to all. We are pleased to report our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results, which reflect our focus on our key priorities to deliver value for clients and shareholders. Mike and I will comment on our full year 2013 results, but we'll focus our remarks on the fourth quarter. Then we'll share some initial observations about our expectations for 2014.", "By many measures, 2013 was a strong year for State Street. For the full year, we reported operating basis earnings per share of $4.54, which is a 14.9% increase over full year 2012. We stayed focused on our key priorities, growing our core business, controlling our expenses and returning capital to our shareholders. And while we benefited from the strong equity market performance, we executed on our strategic priorities against the headwinds of low interest rates and increasing regulatory requirements. For full year 2013, we grew total operating basis revenue 3.3% to more than $10 billion, despite the pressures from the low interest rate environment.", "We grew core servicing and management fees approximately 10% over 2012. We ended 2013 with a record $27.4 trillion in assets under administration and a record $2.35 trillion in assets under management. We delivered approximately $220 million of incremental pretax expense savings in conjunction with our Business Operations and IT Transformation program during 2013, and we achieved positive operating leverage of 171 basis points for full year 2013 compared to full year 2012, calculated on an operating basis. Additionally, we returned approximately $2.5 billion in capital in 2013 to our shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividends.", "Turning to the fourth quarter 2013 results, we reported operating basis earnings per share of $1.15. Reflected in these results was the continued strength of our core asset servicing and asset management business, partially offset by lower foreign exchange trading revenue.", "Now I'd like to share some insight on our new business and our client asset flows during the quarter. Regarding new business, our fourth quarter 2013 new asset servicing wins totaled approximately $392 billion. Of these wins, 30% were from outside the U.S. Also included in these new wins were 41 new alternative asset servicing mandates. Our clients say now we're -- we remain the market leader and continue to see above-average long-term growth potential.", "Regarding flows, equity markets rose significantly during the fourth quarter, stemming from continued optimism regarding an economic recovery, especially in light of the Fed's decision to taper its bond purchases and maintain a low rate environment. Our clients experienced increased flows into equities and continued outflows from fixed income funds.", "Similar to last quarter, we also continued to see client flows into money market funds. Additionally, we continued to experience high levels of client deposits in the fourth quarter. Trading activities during the quarter were weak as the spread of the global ceiling showdown froze markets in the first part of the quarter and volatility was low throughout the quarter.", "Turning to asset management, in the fourth quarter, we experienced net inflows of $5 billion, driven primarily by strong inflows into ETFs, partially offset by institutional outflows from passive equities driven by client rebalancing and rerisking. We also experienced short-term outflows from securities finance pools, offset by inflows into money market funds.", "With respect to ETFs, we experienced strong inflows of $18 billion, led by our S&P 500 fund and our sector SPDR funds, partially offset by continued outflows from our Gold ETF. Our new business pipelines in both asset servicing and asset management remain strong and well diversified.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike, who will review our financial performance. Mike?", "Michael William Bell", "Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. This morning, before I start my review of our operating basis results, I'd like to mention a couple of nonoperating items included in our GAAP reporting. First, our GAAP results for the quarter included a $71 million tax benefit associated with the completion of a multiyear project related to our deferred tax accounts. This contributed approximately $0.16 per share to our GAAP earnings in the fourth quarter. In addition, the quarter included $45 million of additional accruals for costs associated with previously disclosed litigation and non-U.S. regulatory matters. This reduced GAAP earnings by approximately $0.06 per share in the quarter.", "Now I will review our operating basis financial highlights, beginning on Slide 10. From this point on, I'll reference only our non-GAAP operating basis results in my comments.", "Overall, our strong full year 2013 results were driven by year-over-year fee revenue growth of 7.4% and good execution on our priority to effectively manage our expenses. In full year 2013, we achieved approximately 15% year-over-year EPS growth despite low short-term interest rates, which negatively impacted both our net interest revenue and our securities finance revenue.", "We also generated 171 basis points of positive operating leverage, comparing full year 2013 to full year 2012, and improved our pretax operating margin to 30.1% for full year 2013. Our return on common equity increased to 10.3% for the full year.", "Now turning to Slide 11. Fourth quarter 2013 earnings per share of $1.15 decreased from third quarter 2013, primarily as the result of the soft trading environment. The fourth quarter operating results also included several noteworthy items. Net interest revenue included $19 million of revenue associated with a municipal security that was previously impaired. Other expenses included $28 million of securities processing costs, offset by Lehman Brothers-related gains and recoveries.", "Compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, EPS increased primarily due to higher fee revenue and a reduction in the number of our outstanding shares, partly offset by increased expenses. Fourth quarter total revenue increased compared to the third quarter of 2013, driven by higher core servicing and management fees and higher net interest revenue, partially offset by lower trading revenue.", "Total expenses increased in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, occupancy and other expenses. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 8 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of approximately $560 million, resulting in average fully diluted common shares outstanding of approximately 445 million for the quarter. At year end, we had approximately $420 million remaining on our common stock repurchase program, which is effective through March of 2014. We declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.26 per share and also declared a noncumulative quarterly perpetual preferred stock dividend of $0.33 per share during the quarter.", "Turning to Slide 12. I'll discuss additional details of our operating basis revenue for the fourth quarter of 2013, focusing on the notable variances. Fourth quarter servicing fees increased approximately 2% from the third quarter and 7% from the fourth quarter of 2012, primarily due to stronger global equity markets and net new business.", "Fourth quarter management fees increased approximately 5% from the third quarter and 12% from the fourth quarter of 2012, respectively. The increase in both periods primarily reflects stronger global equity markets. Fourth quarter management fees were negatively impacted by $13 million of money market fee waivers compared to $12 million in the third quarter of 2013 and $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. For the full year 2013, money market fee waivers were $40 million.", "Performance fees in the fourth quarter of 2013 were approximately $5 million, up from $4 million in the third quarter and down from $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Total trading services revenue decreased 11% compared to the third quarter, primarily due to lower foreign exchange trading revenue from lower market volatility. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, total trading services revenue decreased 6%, primarily due to lower fees associated with the SPDR Gold ETF. Securities finance revenue increased approximately 3% from both the third quarter of 2013 and the fourth quarter of 2012. Average securities on loan were relatively unchanged sequentially at $315 billion.", "Processing fees and other revenue increased approximately 3% from the third quarter of 2013, primarily due to an increase in revenue associated with tax-advantaged investments. The decrease from the prior year quarter is primarily due to specifically noted gains recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012.", "Operating basis net interest revenue of $596 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 increased from $553 million in the third quarter of 2013, due in part to $19 million in revenue associated with a previously impaired municipal security. In addition, higher interest-earning assets and lower mortgage prepayments contributed to the sequential increase in net interest revenue. Excluding the $19 million in net interest revenue associated with a municipal security, our operating basis net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2013 was 125 basis points.", "Now let's turn to operating basis expenses on Slide 13. Our total expenses for the fourth quarter of 2013 increased from the third quarter, primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, occupancy and other expenses. Our fourth quarter 2013 compensation and employee benefits expenses increased 3.4% from the third quarter, primarily due to lower benefit costs resulting from planned changes in the third quarter, as well as increased costs in the fourth quarter to support new business.", "Our Business Operations and IT Transformation program continues to be on track. For full year 2013, we achieved approximately $220 million in additional pretax expense savings, resulting in approximately $420 million of incremental pretax expense savings since the inception of the program. Our nonrecurring expenses related to our Business Operations and IT Transformation program were approximately $26 million for the fourth quarter of 2013. Occupancy expenses of $124 million in the fourth quarter increased relative to the third quarter of 2013, primarily due to the effect of a one-time $8 million charge in this quarter associated with a sublease renegotiation.", "Other expenses increased to $292 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, largely due to higher securities processing costs, professional services fees and sales promotion costs. The fourth quarter also included $28 million of Lehman Brothers-related gains and recoveries compared to $30 million in the third quarter of 2013. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, other expenses increased, primarily due to higher securities processing costs.", "Now I will provide you some details on our balance sheet. As you can see on Slide 14, our overall philosophy to managing our investment portfolio has not changed. We maintain a high credit quality profile with 89% AAA- or AA-rated securities, and 44% of our security is fixed rate and 56% floating rate. Our interest rate risk position was in line with our position at the end of the third quarter of 2013, and the duration of the portfolio remains relatively unchanged at approximately 1.9 years. Additionally, the unrealized mark-to-market loss increased during the quarter to $213 million, primarily due to a rise in market interest rates.", "We monitor and manage our interest rate risk position using a variety of risk measures, including EVE, primarily to determine the potential impact of a rise in rates on both the mark-to-market and on our net interest revenue. During the fourth quarter, these risk metrics remained within our risk appetite.", "Maintaining a strong capital position is very important to us. Particularly in this evolving and complex regulatory environment, we continue to identify opportunities to optimize the capital efficiency of our balance sheet. As we reported last quarter, we've begun to invest in senior secured bank loans, targeting BB- and B-rated issuers, all subject to our credit underwriting standards. As of year-end 2013, this loan book exposure was $931 million.", "In accordance with GAAP, we recorded a provision for loan losses of approximately $6 million in the fourth quarter related to the aggregate senior secured bank loan portfolio. This calculation is based upon market credit loss factors for loans with similar characteristics and does not reflect an identified loss event for any particular loan in our portfolio.", "Now let's turn to the next slide to review our capital position. As you can see, we maintained a strong capital position, and that strength has allowed us to deliver on our key priority of returning value to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. As of year-end 2013, our estimated pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 10.1% under the standardized approach and 11.8% under the advanced approach. We estimate that our pro forma Basel III supplementary leverage ratios under the U.S. proposed rules are approximately 5.2% at the holding company and approximately 5.0% at the bank as of December 31, 2013. The slight decrease in the holding company ratio from the prior quarter is primarily due to the influx of client cash deposits on our balance sheet at year-end 2013.", "Recently, the Basel Committee released its final rules on the supplementary leverage ratio. While there were several modifications made to the rule that, if adopted by the U.S. regulator, would be helpful to us, we are disappointed that the committee did not exclude central bank deposits from the denominator. And we will continue to work with the U.S. regulators to seek exclusion when the U.S. rules are finalized. The target effective date is January 1 of 2018.", "Assuming the rules go into effect as proposed, we believe that we have a number of levers that would enable us to comply with these requirements in advance of the 2018 effective date. The Basel Committee also updated their thinking on the net stable funding ratio. While there's still more work to be done, the recognition of some liquidity value in operational deposits is helpful to us. Again, we believe that by the targeted effective date of January 1, 2018, we will have taken appropriate actions to be in compliance with the rules.", "In October, the U.S. banking regulators issued a notice of proposed rulemaking or proposed rule intended to implement the Basel Committee's liquidity coverage ratio or LCR. While the U.S. proposed rule is generally consistent with the Basel Committee's LCR, it includes certain more stringent requirements, including an accelerated implementation timeline and modifications to the definition of high-quality liquid assets and expected outflow assumptions. The proposed rule remains subject to interpretation, regulatory guidance and public comment until January 31 of 2014, before the issuance of a final rule.", "In addition, in December, 5 federal agencies issued final rules developed jointly to implement Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule. We continue to analyze the proposed rules and their potential impact on us, and intend to develop and implement any changes to ensure compliance. In the meantime, we remain focused on executing our capital plan that we submitted in conjunction with the 2013 CCAR, which includes our authorization to purchase up to $2.1 billion of our common stock through March 31 of 2014, of which approximately $420 million remained available as of year-end 2013.", "So to summarize our results, our strong performance for the full year 2013 was driven by positive core servicing and management fee revenue, as well as our continued control over expenses. We are proud of achieving 171 basis points of positive operating leverage for full year 2013 compared to full year 2012 and increasing our pretax operating margin to 30.1%.", "Now let's turn to our 2014 outlook on Slide 17, beginning with revenue. For 2014, we expect total revenue growth to be in the range of 3% to 5% compared to 2013. This growth rate is predicated on a number of important assumptions. First, we plan to continue to execute on our top priorities: driving core revenue growth, investing in new growth opportunities, controlling expenses and managing our strong capital position. Second, we assume a modest increase in market interest rates later in 2014. As we've discussed previously, until short-term interest rates begin to rise, we expect our net interest revenue to continue to be under pressure.", "For planning purposes, we assume equity markets, defined as the S&P 500 NEV [ph], will remain close to year-end 2013 levels for the full year 2014. In addition, we expect that the market environment will improve and benefit both our securities finance and trading revenues. We continue to target positive operating leverage on a full year basis. Our ability to achieve this goal is highly dependent upon our continued diligence in controlling expenses across the company. We continue to expect to achieve an incremental $130 million in pretax expense savings in 2014 from our Business Operations and IT Transformation Program and to continue to invest in initiatives to drive revenue growth from the expansion of new products and services for clients in key sectors and geographies. Additionally, we expect some upward pressure on regulatory compliance costs.", "Now I'd also like to remind you that, as in prior years, the first quarter 2014 compensation and employee benefits expense will be higher due to the effect of the accounting treatment of equity compensation for retirement-eligible employees, as well as for payroll taxes. We expect the incremental amount attributed to equity compensation for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes in the first quarter of 2014 to be approximately $150 million.", "In 2014, we expect to remain focused on optimizing our strong capital position and returning capital to our shareholders. We plan to complete our current 2013 common stock repurchase plan, effective through March 31 of 2014. In addition, we submitted our 2014 CCAR plan to the Federal Reserve, which included a capital distribution program of dividends and common stock purchases that we believe is consistent with our strong capital position and earnings capacity. The amount in form of capital distribution in our plan is contingent upon the Federal Reserve not objecting to our request, and we expect to receive the results of their review in mid-March.", "We continue to believe that our common stock repurchase program, combined with dividends, is the best way to return value to shareholders. And return of capital remains a top priority for us. Now I'll turn the call back to Jay.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Thanks, Mike. Let me close our call by briefly reiterating our continued focus on creating value for our clients and shareholders by growing revenue, diligently controlling expenses and returning capital to our shareholders through common stock purchases and dividends.", "Stephanie, Mike and I are now available to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI.", "Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Mike, just a point of clarification in the outlook on the modest increase in market interest rates. Are we talking specifically short rates later in 2014? And then just curious, does that even impact NII in '14, or is there a lag and it really starts impacting in '15?", "Michael William Bell", "Sure, Glenn. The short answer is, we do expect by the end of 2014 an increase in market interest rates, both at the short term as well as at the intermediate term. And we would expect some modest benefit from that in net interest revenue and, importantly, as well, in the securities finance revenue, that it would help immensely to see some uptick, for example, in the 90-day rates for the securities lending business. And what we intend to do, Glenn, is at the Investor Day, where we have time to provide some greater context, to give you some of the scenarios that we've looked at. So I think we can answer that question pretty thoroughly for you here on February 27.", "Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. On a related note, ECB had cut. I went back and looked, and I -- the last public comment I saw was 25 basis points, equaled something like $40 million in annual revenues. I'm just curious if that relationship holds or -- and how you're thinking about ECB as they talk about the potential for going negative on deposit rates. Do you have to park the money in the same locale? Can you park your money elsewhere?", "Michael William Bell", "Okay. Yes, ballpark, Glenn, we still think that, that sensitivity of the $40 million is rational. Again, let us give you a more thorough answer to some alternatives when we see you in February.", "Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Last one, just as a reminder for myself. There's a pretty big gap between or spread between your standardized and advanced Basel III ratios. So I'm curious, a, what produces the bulk of that large gap? And b, does it impact how you go about the CCAR process?", "Michael William Bell", "Sure. So Glenn, first, you're absolutely right. At the moment, we have a 170-basis-point spread between the advanced approach and the standardized approach for the Basel III risk-weighted asset calculations. As we've talked about last quarter, there are 2 main drivers of that. First, the standardized approach uses standardized risk factors and haircuts, where the advanced model uses advanced model-driven loss estimates.", "And the standardized risk factors and haircuts are more punitive in 2 areas. First, certain off-balance-sheet items, for example around the securities finance business, is treated more punitively under the standardized approach. And the other area that's more punitively treated is the high-quality assets. And our balance sheet is chock-full of high-quality assets. So as a result, the -- under the current environment with our current balance sheet, the standardized approach is the more punitive one of the 2.", "Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Do you anticipate a changing behavior? Because it would seem counterstates or counterintuitive to change your quality metrics based on that. Or just it is what it is, and hopefully, the metrics will adapt to the quality of the balance sheet? In other words, all I'm looking to find out is, does it change how you go about your capital return thought process?", "Michael William Bell", "Sure. So Glenn, we do need to meet the more onerous of the 2 requirements under the CCAR stressed scenario. So as we are working to sort out how to optimize our balance sheet mix going forward, that is part of our calculations, that is part of our thinking around balance sheet strategy for the future. I would remind you that the standardized ratio does not kick in until 1/1/2015. So for 2014, the binding constraint is the advanced approach.", "But again, CCAR is about the long term as much as it is about the short term. So qualitatively, as we go through CCAR, we need to be cognizant of the supplementary leverage ratio that may be coming down the line, as well as the more onerous of the standardized and advanced approach. And that's why the work that we're doing to optimize our balance sheet under the new rules is something that's a pretty complex undertaking. But we are confident we're going to be in compliance, and as we draw conclusions on that, we'll certainly plan to communicate that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Mike, I just wanted to ask you about the outlook for revenues you were very clear on and positive operating leverage. You've got the pretax margin at 30% this year, and last year, you did 170 basis points of operating leverage. So I was just wondering if you can help us put in context what type of magnitude of improvement can we see on both the pretax margin direction and if you can maintain or even increase that operating leverage gap.", "Michael William Bell", "Sure, Ken. First, I would prefer to wait until the Investor Day, where we have time to give you some additional context. For example, we do plan, as I mentioned to Glenn, we do plan to share some of the modeling we've done on various interest rate scenarios, and as well as talk about work that we're doing in our core businesses to drive revenue growth, but also in some of the new growth opportunities that we see out there. And then we'll also talk about some of the areas where we're investing.", "So I think, Ken, I'd prefer, rather than trying to give it to you in a 30-second answer on a crowded conference call, I'd rather wait and give it to you at the Investor Day. But I think stepping back, to me, what's most important is that, even in a relatively low growth environment where we would expect revenue growth to only be 3% to 5% compared to our long-term targets, which are quite a bit higher than that, we still believe we'll be positioned to achieve positive operating leverage, perhaps not as much as 2013, but again, another step forward on the operating leverage. And therefore, we would expect, again, good progress as an enterprise through our strategic goal of being a low-cost provider in this business.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then my second question relates to just -- I want to understand this, the increase in the FTE adjustment, which obviously gets backed out from a GAAP perspective. But is -- could you just walk us through the elevated tax adjustment, tax investments? How much is that carrying now in that processing other and if this is the new run rate for that, because I don't think people would've expected that to be as much of a backout this quarter?", "Michael William Bell", "Sure. Ken, first of all, as we've previously disclosed, we have been steadily looking for opportunities to make tax-advantaged investments. And we've been doing that pretty consistently over the last couple of years, and that's been beneficial in terms of our effective tax rate. On the specific tax-equivalent adjustment for Q4, let me -- why don't we take that one offline. I think we were going to talk to you a little bit later today. It's just not a -- it's not a simple calculation, so I prefer to do that, again, not in a crowded conference call, if you will.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then my last question then, Mike, just to get more granular then on the quarter itself, then is -- I mean, a lot of people are asking you about the elevated other expenses. And could you just help us reestablish a base for what that line should look like going forward? Because I think that's, again, that's another key question, I think, in terms of this stock's reaction today.", "Michael William Bell", "Sure, absolutely, Ken. First, on the other expenses, as we've talked about previously, remember, this stuff can bounce around quarter-to-quarter because some of the costs in this category are pretty lumpy. And a good example of that is the securities processing costs. So the securities processing costs in the quarter were $28 million. We don't think $28 million in a quarter is reflective of our outlook going forward, but it's a good reminder that the number does bounce around quarter-to-quarter.", "Now I'd point out, recently, in the recent past, we've been doing a good job in this area, and we would expect that to normalize in 2014. But that would be an example, Ken, of why I don't think the $292 million in total for the other category is a good run rate going forward.", "And then just to talk about a couple of the other larger pieces. We had sales promotional costs of $6 million this quarter. That mainly is part of our year-end process to support our investment management business. So that was planned. But again, that -- we view that as a Q4 item. We would expect that to normalize back out in Q1. So again, I would reduce for that.", "And I'd say the big wildcard really are the higher legal and regulatory compliance costs, and that reflects a combination of this regulatory environment that we are operating in, where we have had to spend more money on a variety of things that, in an ideal world, we wouldn't. But we do live in this world, and we've had to spend some more money in that area, in particular, more money on professional services, which increased for the quarter.", "And then the legal costs, which primarily relate to prior year problems, but there are areas where we do need to spend money to support our position. So at this point, I'd -- the number has been bouncing around enough and there's enough uncertainty around our regulatory compliance costs, Ken, that I'd prefer not to give you a new range or something like that for 2014. But I do think, at our Investor Day, we can give you some additional color on how we're thinking about it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I was hoping you can comment on the kind of continued disconnect between your servicing fees and assets under custody and administration. And I think this is the phenomenon that we've seen for almost 2 years now. And even this year, when your average assets are up 12, fees are up 9. Last year they were up 5, fees were flat. So can you help us flush out, I guess, this dynamic and what needs to happen to bridge that gap going forward?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, let me start that, Alex, and Mike will it pick up. First off, I look at market and service fee correlations, and if you look at, it's hard to examine much in a quarter. But if you look year-over-year, service fees are up 9%. Equity markets were up big, fixed income markets were not. So if you piece that apart a little bit, a couple of factors. One is the mix, the question of, when you look at the service, the global services business, I think, by our calculation, less than half of the revenues are tied directly to assets. So this -- the other half are tied to other fee levels, other fees that are unassociated with assets.", "The -- I guess the other thing I would say, which is -- makes the question even murkier is, if you look at the baseline, the baseline of service fees in any given period or period-over-period change is influenced by investor flows. And given that we have, proportionately, as a trust bank, higher exposure to asset managers, flows make a big difference.", "And if you look during the course of 2013, you have some positives. So obviously, equity markets and equity flows were very positive. But fixed income flows were pretty negative. In the second half of the year, they outstripped positive equity flows. And so you've got that factor, and then you've also got the factor of the emerging markets pullback, and the fourth quarter was also a little bit of a headwind. So I'm not sure that explains, but at least it gives you some of the ingredients that determine service fees. Mike, do you want to pick up anything else?", "Michael William Bell", "Sure, Alex, this is Mike. Only a couple of things I would add. First, I'll just reinforce Jay's point that it is important to note that only a little -- in fact, a little less than half of the service fee revenue line is directly driven by the basis points on assets. So that really is an important point. You would expect, in a market -- we would expect, in a market where markets are rising, that the service fees would trail the increasing assets because of that phenomenon.", "And then I just have rounded out. Transaction fees are between 10% and 15% of that particular number, and transactions were up just a blip relative to Q3 but were down relative to Q2. So again, transactions will tend to move, in general, with the relative bullishness or really relative to that kind of risk on, risk off in the market. And that's been something that's been a headwind for the -- that line item in the third quarter and fourth quarter.", "And then lastly, out-of-pocket expense recoveries also impact that line item. So again, just to give a specific example. We had lower out-of-pocket expense recoveries that -- of $6 million that's essentially the same $6 million of the drop in the information systems line item on the expense side. So again, there are going to be some things that don't matter from a P&L standpoint but can bounce around in the servicing fees line item, in particular.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got you. So I mean, you guys didn't mention pricing in any of this, so it's fair to assume that you haven't seen any change in the way certain businesses are priced relative to what they have been or what kind of amount that you are winning?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, I would say, directionally, Alex, no real change. In certain markets and certain product lines, it's highly competitive. It's less so on others. We continue to try to send signals to the market by backing away from deals that become so thinly priced in an attempt to try to establish more reasonable pricing. But that's a journey more than an event, but no marked change in pricing over the course of the last quarter.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got you. And then, Mike, I was hoping maybe you could just flesh out a little bit more the net interest income guidance for yours for next year. Just a couple of nuances around the balance sheet size. I'm not sure how much you expect to leave in the first quarter. So what do you guys think -- are you guys thinking as far as the average size of the balance sheet goes for 2014?", "Michael William Bell", "Sure, Alex, well, first of all, again, we'll give more color, more detail on this at the Investor Day. But if I focus just on Q1 for a second, we did see an increase in the excess deposits on our balance sheet of approximately $6 billion, Q4 relative to Q3. So the excess deposits we estimate in Q4 was approximately $25 billion. I would expect that, that number will decline in Q1 and decline even further by the end of 2014 if, in fact, short-term rates begin to rise as we anticipate that they will.", "So I think it's important to factor that into the thinking. In terms of the core deposits, we do expect that over any longer period of time, we expect that there'll be growth in our core operational deposits, essentially commensurate with our overall fee revenue growth and our overall client base. Again, I would view that as sort of a small single digits over the course of the year. So therefore, I would expect a drop in the excess deposits on average to reduce our average assets for full year 2014.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.", "Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Just a quick question, follow-up on Glenn's question about the 2014 outlook. I think it was my understanding, I think, generally, people see that your -- or feel that your balance sheet is short-term liability sensitive. In the past, you said that your net interest margin could actually compress until the rates stop going up. So has there been any change in your thinking about how rates affect your balance sheet and NII, at least in the short term?", "Michael William Bell", "Well, Luke, it's Mike. Obviously, I'm still relatively new here, so I can't connect all the dots from prior discussions. But here is how we're thinking about it. We're thinking about it that a rise in short-term interest rates in particular, the 30-day and the 90-day rates in particular, would be particularly helpful to us. Because remember, over half of our balance sheet is comprised of floating-rate securities. And therefore, as short-term rates rise, we get an automatic pickup in NIR from those securities.", "On the liability side, we would expect that liability rates would ultimately increase with short-term interest rates. But in the near term, they would likely increase at a slower pace than what we would pick up on the yield side. So if you take the combination of the benefit I just described on NIR, combined with the benefit on the securities lending business, that would be a much better environment for us to operate in if short-term rates, in particular, would rise.", "Now I think the question that you're asking around the long-term interest rates may tie back to our mortgage-backed securities in the portfolio. We were in a phenomenon where there was some risk of those assets extending and then that having a collateral impact on the need to reduce the duration of our portfolio. I think if there's good news is that, that issue, for the most part, is behind us. There's not a lot more extension left in that particular book. So I wouldn't expect the second-order impact of that phenomenon to hurt us in 2014.", "Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then a back-of-envelope analysis would suggest that your organic growth in the custody business has been averaging somewhere around 1.5% over the last 4 years. I was hoping whether you would affirm or deny it, if that seems like a reasonable guesstimate. And then, I think given the strength of the new business wins you announced each quarter, it does seem to suggest that you're losing some mandates, and so perhaps you could kind of put that estimate in the context of how you're feeling about your market share gains or losses?", "And then along with that, have you given any more thought to increasing disclosure around components of organic growth? My sense is that the investment community really would like to see you and your peers move in that direction, but I think it's going to take one of you to set the disclosure bar higher for everybody. So wondering if that's going to be you.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Let me jump in there, Luke. Let me first go at the question of clients win -- client wins and losses and market share gains and losses. I think we don't win everything we compete for. There's some things that we really go after and we don't win, but I would say our win-loss rate for those things that we think are attractive where we have a differentiated position, therefore we can get decent pricing, is quite good.", "I point to segments like the alternative segment, which I frequently bring up. I think we have a differentiated value proposition there. We tend to compete very effectively. We don't win them all, but we do pretty well. I'd say the same thing for very involved and integrated complex asset manager sales, particularly if there is a middle office to it.", "Again, the number of competitors shrink and we fare pretty well there. You could say the same for some markets overseas. I would say, as a general theme, we compete more effectively in the asset manager segment versus the asset owner segment, so that's funds versus pensions as a theme, which leads you to things like offshore markets, Luxembourg, Dublin, very competitive there. Market share data is not easy to come by. There are some -- probably the deepest markets in the world for custodians would be markets like the U.S. mutual fund market. I think that's probably a market that has the clearest data. The ICI puts out information.", "And I would say that if you look at that as we look at that, we are gaining market share in that -- what we think is a key segment. With regard to just picking another one of your questions, the organic growth, as Mike has come on board, we've spent time with several of you in groups and individually, and we are really thinking about ways where we can express more clearly the issue of what drives organic growth and then incremental new business. And we don't yet have a conclusion on that. But I understand the point, both the interest, the keen interest in understanding the drivers of that, and also the point about somebody needs to lead.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Josh Levin with Citigroup.", "Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So we've seen some turmoil in the emerging markets in terms of equity markets and also in terms of the FX markets. How do we think about how that sort of turmoil affects your business, both the positives and the negatives?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, so let me start that one, Josh. The -- if you look at the core global services business, the type of asset that we're servicing is affected by the revenues or affected by the type of asset we're servicing. So in a simple example, domestic equity versus an emerging market, equity or bond is going to carry a lot more revenue per unit of asset. So that's the first thing. So as there's a retreat from emerging markets, which we saw in the fourth quarter, as well as we saw a little bit more recently over the last couple of days in the core global services business, that's a headwind. So movement into emerging markets would be a big positive given the incremental fees that we get associated with servicing emerging markets-type instruments.", "On the foreign exchange side, it cuts back a little bit the other way. Good market movement in and out of emerging markets and volatility would be a positive thing. Although, even though we've seen retreat from emerging markets, volatility remained pretty low throughout the fourth quarter, which you might say is a little unusual.", "Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. My second question is about M&A. So there is a lot of speculation that M&A is going to pick up in the United States this year. If we do see more deals, a higher number of deals, a greater dollar value of deals, how should we think about that affecting your business?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "I think the -- there is a lot of discussion, and actually, there's been some action probably in the merger and acquisition activity. I don't think you've seen much in financial markets. And I guess the way we would like at it is, break it down a little bit. In the core asset servicing business, it would have to be very special. And I can't imagine -- one, I can't imagine anything significant because I think it would get considerable regulatory scrutiny. And if it was a small add-on to us, it would have to be very attractively priced for us to be interested in it. I've said before that in the core custody business, I don't feel like we have any big gaps in our offering.", "Geographically, we're pretty well placed from a standpoint of asset classes with the moves we made into alternatives, pretty well placed. So I don't feel like there's a gap that we need to fill. And so therefore, any acquisition would be largely acquisition of clients. And again, size -- large-sized deals would be off the table, in my opinion, and smaller-sized deals would have to be extraordinarily attractive from a financial standpoint. I think probably off your question but a little bit on the small end of acquisitions, small software products or capabilities that would round out some products in our asset management business or in our emerging risk and analytics business, that might be interesting. But I'd say the big stuff for us is very unlikely.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "I just want to know if we're expecting too much too soon from the Business Op and IT program, if we should collectively stretch out our expectations. I guess fourth quarter was a pause in the efficiency progress. Linked quarter, you're 70% done with the Business Op and IT program for the expense savings. You said you expect positive operating leverage this year, but a little bit less, and that's partly predicated on higher short-term rates this year. But maybe with the expense savings mostly done, should we think about the additional benefits to be less visible in your earnings?", "And I'll refer to a -- there's a new book out this week by your neighbors, some MIT professors, called The Second Machine Age, and it looked at 600 firms and they showed that it takes 5 to 7 years before you really get the full benefits of productivity. So are -- while the best expense savings, I think, are behind you based on your reported numbers, should we be looking out 2, 3, 4 years from now?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, let me start that one, Mike, and our Mike can jump in. The -- we're entering the next-to-final year of our publicized IT and Ops transformation. We've got 130 million that we've got to achieve this year, and then there is a stub for 2015. You know because I've taken you through this before that the -- what we've done is structurally changed the cost of delivering core services here. We've centralized and standardized and leveraged offshore locations highly successfully, and now we're in that last leg of rebuilding the systems to make those processes even more efficient. And what you'll see this year and next year is the wrap-up of that.", "What inspired me along the way was you mentioned the MIT professors, the book that McAfee and his partner wrote on the Race Against the Machine, and this -- maybe this is Phase 2 of that book that you're referencing. But what you take away from that is that the power of technology in these transaction processing businesses is in the early innings. So I look at what we've done, and we've restructured our operations, we are applying technology, but as we look out into the future, I think it only gets more interesting, frankly, as we look at -- now that we've standardized these things, how much labor we can take out by displacing it with technology.", "And one of the great examples that, that book referenced, which is -- was insightful to me is the driverless car from Google and what technology can accomplish today. And I don't think, generally, the financial markets, and you might even say the financial transaction processing businesses in the financial markets, have anywhere near matured out that opportunity.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "So as a follow-up, and I don't want to put words in your mouth, it sounds as though you're as confident as ever about the future, but what I think I'm hearing is a little bit less confidence about this year in front of us. And if there's one item that changed from a few years ago, when you started on this initiative, has it more than any other factor simply been the regulatory cost? Is that -- has that been the unexpected negative surprise?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "I would say that's pretty fair, Mike. I think the -- unfortunately, I would have thought, 2 years ago, we would be cresting the hill and we would be declining our investment in these kinds of things. But it's not happening that way. I mean, it -- just a simple example that maybe highlights some of my frustration and some of the cost is, you look at the Volcker rule, which for a firm like State Street has a -- not a significant impact, yet the systems that we are building to report on, the trading that we're doing to prove that it's not proprietary, is just mind blowing. So I think you're right that probably one of the biggest surprises -- I guess the other thing that I would say, though, is we are also trying to walk a fine line between becoming more efficient and continuing to invest.", "And I think that -- so for the long term -- for the short term, we are trying to deliver good value to the shareholders, but we're also continuing to invest. And you've heard me say before that this IT and Ops transformation, probably the most exciting future aspect of it is laying in new technology which will allow us to be more agile with regard to introducing new products, both -- particularly in the data space. So -- but you're right, just to go back to your point about regulatory, and generally, compliance cost has been the biggest surprise.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to kind of go back to the rate sensitivity discussion. And Mike, you had mentioned that, kind of running your simulations, that you saw that short-term asset yields would go up faster than the short-term liability costs. When you report your economic value of equity, I think the brackets mean that, that's negative, which means that a rising interest rate environment, I think, would be negative to equity. I just want to make sure that I was reading the brackets right.", "Michael William Bell", "Yes, Marty, it's Mike. You are reading the brackets right. Now importantly, that relates to the mark-to-market on the balance sheet. So again, a little bit different phenomenon than what kind of impact would that have on our net interest margin and net interest revenue in 2014.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "All right. So I just wanted to make sure, there really is a disconnect between what you're looking at there, and you're saying the major difference is just the mark-to-market on the investment portfolio?", "Michael William Bell", "Yes. Importantly, Marty, the EVE is the entire balance sheet. So again, it's a little bit apples and oranges. But again, there's sort of 2 different phenomenon going on here. The rise -- I'll repeat, the rise in the short-term interest rates would be particularly helpful to our net interest margin and net interest revenue for 2014. And we believe that the impact on the mark would be manageable over the period.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And I think also, what's probably building into your EVE looking so negative is the duration assumption that you're probably applying to your deposits and DDAs and transaction accounts. I mean, they have a lot longer life, so.", "Michael William Bell", "Marty, that's absolutely right, and that is one of the issues around EVE, which is why we really look at a variety of different risk metrics, not just the EVE, to measure our overall profile.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. I just wanted to reconcile the comment you made earlier to that number. That helps a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ashley Serrao with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Ashley N. Serrao - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So I just wanted to, first, just dig into the expenses this quarter. I guess I was surprised, if I look at info systems and communications, I was surprised by the tick-down there. And then if I look at salaries and benefits and then look over the past 3 quarters, you've managed to show year-over-year declines, and this is the first quarter where it actually went up. So just wondering whether you could provide some additional color there.", "Michael William Bell", "Sure, it's Mike. I'll start. The -- on the information systems line item, importantly, that did include a decline of $6 million in out-of-pocket expenses, which is really -- means that we spend that money on behalf of our client and then get that money back in service fees. So there was a $6 million downdraft in both servicing fees and the information systems costs related to that phenomenon. So I think it's a little bit of a one-off, and I wouldn't put a lot of weight into those.", "More importantly, on your question on the comp and benefits, first of all, the Q3 comp and benefits included a one-time benefit of $12 million from a change we made in one of our employee benefit programs. So we had talked about that on the Q3 call being one-time and that you ought to naturally think that, that $12 million, it will go back up $12 million, all things equal in Q4, and that has materialized the way we expected. The bulk of the remainder, though, in the comp and benefits is to support our new business. We are obviously pleased with our overall new business results for full year 2013 and even accounts that will be generating revenue early in 2014.", "And we did have an increase in the new business support costs. This would include things like the on-boarding contractors that we use. It would include the growth in the alternative investment business that Jay referenced earlier. It would include year-end sales comp. So the -- that is related to new business. And as we look to first quarter of 2014, we do expect that to normalize, other than, of course, the $150 million one-time impact we will have in first quarter from the annual incentive comp. Put that aside, we expect the comp and benefits to normalize again in Q1 as we work through that on-boarding.", "Ashley N. Serrao - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And then, Mike, I appreciate that you'll be providing more details on your 2014 guidance on your Analyst Day. But I just want to clarify what -- the bottom end of your 3% to 5% revenue growth, does that assume a rise in interest rates?", "Michael William Bell", "Boy, that's a difficult question to answer in a vacuum. The 3% bottom of the range does look at a more pessimistic market environment than our base-case scenario. So I would say that it wasn't quite as precise as what you're -- as the question you're asking, but I think it's fair to say that if we did not see a change in interest rates, then we'd be more likely to be closer to the 3%. But again, there are a lot of moving parts there, and I think we can give you a more thorough answer when we take the time at the Investor Day to walk through that.", "Ashley N. Serrao - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess, just then finally, alternative services has been a great business for you guys and you've had a strong presence there. Like how are you thinking about the revenue opportunity from here? What can you do organically into '14 and '15?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, I think -- so I think -- let me take that, Ashley. The -- we think that we compete effectively and we do well in the hedge fund segment of alternatives. By our estimate, 70% of the hedge funds have outsourced the kind of work that we do. So there's potentially an additional market share gain. There's potentially more hedge funds, which we'll outsource. And I think that's -- maybe it\u2019s not a certainty, but it's highly likely given the pressures that hedge funds are under to be more transparent among -- to their customers.", "But I guess the other thing -- the other element of alternatives, which is kind of exciting, is we have also moved into the private equity and real estate subsegments of alternatives. And by our estimate and industry estimates, only 30% of those firms have outsourced. So we would expect proportionately greater growth in those nonhedged alternative segments, and we feel well positioned.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I had a follow-up on the other side of the revenue guidance, the 3% to 5% range that you talked about. So the 3% is a more negative outlook than your base case for interest rates. But can you give us some color around what is the assumptions behind the upper -- the boundaries on the upper end of the 5%?", "Michael William Bell", "Yes, Betsy, it's Mike. Again, I'd prefer to go into that level of detail at the Investor Day. But broadly speaking, we would expect a -- to -- at the 5% scenario, broadly speaking, we would expect a rise in both short-term as well as intermediate-term interest rates, certainly beginning July 1. And in that kind of environment, it's likely to be a more positive global economy. So in that kind of environment, with a more positive global economy and higher 30-day and 90-day interest rates, we would expect the sec lending business to be stronger, we would expect our trading revenue to be stronger and we would expect that to have -- mean good things for top line as well as bottom line. But let me leave it at that and save the additional detail here for Investor Day.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, great, because the kind of implication is that the fee line is a plus 4 grower, and that seems a little bit modest compared to what you've done historically. So that would be great to flush out at Investor Day. And then just separately, on the expense line, you've discussed regulatory a couple of times, and I know throughout the conference calls of the prior year you've indicated where regulatory expenses has crept up. So we've had rising regulatory costs throughout the year.", "I guess what I'm wondering is, as we look at the year-on-year, because you called out the year-on-year would have a higher reg cost, is it a run rate from 4Q? In other words, is the higher year-on-year function effect that regulatory costs increased throughout the year? Or is it -- are you also saying that there's an increase in reg costs from your 4Q run rate?", "Michael William Bell", "Yes, Betsy, I would think about it as a full year to full year as opposed to a full year to the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter, in our expectation, was relatively high in a number of these legal and regulatory compliance areas. So I would think about it more year-on-year as opposed to year versus Q4.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Yes, and excluding legal, just the regulatory cost itself, what you're basically saying is your run rate in 4Q is a decent run rate for the full year?", "Michael William Bell", "Yes, I don't think I'd be quite that precise. But I think that our comments around the upward pressure on regulatory compliance costs, if you exclude legal, really related to full year '14 versus full year '13. And one of the reasons, Betsy, just in full disclosure here, it's a difficult question to answer, is that, keep in mind, we've got spending across the enterprise that's driven by these demands. So it's not like it's a discrete budget that captures all the dollars.", "I mean, many of us just around this table are spending a lot more time on regulatory compliance issues than we have in the past. So it -- I mean, it impacts -- it really pervades a number of different budgets. It pervades systems costs relating to the Volcker reporting that Jay referenced earlier. It increases the staff that we need in the compliance area in ERM. It increases the professional services expenses. So it's not a -- it's not that it's a -- there's not sort of a readily easy single number to point to, which is why I'm -- again, I'd just urge you to focus more on the year-over-year trend.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Yes, no, I get that. I just wanted to make sure. Your message is essentially, look, those expenses have been rising throughout the year for things we all know about. You're not -- that's what you're making the statement on, not necessarily, \"Hey, there is more coming that we're anticipating from 4Q annually.\" So that answers the question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.", "Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of quick questions. The first thing is that I'm just kind of curious, I mean, the -- and this also occurred in 2013, but the normal seasonal bump in Q1 comp, the -- year-over-year, it's 27% increase, was pretty big of an increase this year. Is this -- is that simply just related to higher expected comp accruals as the business grows? I mean, it's pretty -- seems like a pretty outsized kind of jump.", "Michael William Bell", "Sure, Rob, it's Mike. In terms of relative to the Q1 bump that we saw in 2013, there are a couple of different things going on. First of all, it does reflect the fact that full year 2013 was a better result for the enterprise than full year '12. So that is reflected in what we expect the management compensation to be here in the first quarter, so that's a piece of it. Second, we have had some changes in the demographics. So the main impact that we get, of course, is the impact of those that are age 55 and have had 5 years of credited service. Again, that demographic has contributed to the increase.", "And then importantly, we have an approximately $10 million increase year-over-year related to some new regulations, new compensation regulations in Europe. So there was some compensation for certain individuals that had to be adjusted. And as a result, that drives that number up $10 million versus first quarter of 2013.", "Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And the -- maybe my next question is going back to trying to think about the asset servicing line and the business mix, and maybe this is something you intend to address at the Investor Day. But if I look at the assets under custody and administration, and I'm actually looking at Page 12 on the trends report, where you have the breakdown by funds, collective funds, I'm assuming the collective funds is where most of the alternative products sit. But is that -- should we think of that as a reasonable representation of those segments' contribution to the fee revenue line, or is it really not much of a correlation between their relative size and growth and how they're contributing to kind of asset servicing fees? Just trying to see if there's a way of using that data to kind of triangulate to kind of the growth expectations for servicing fees?", "Michael William Bell", "Yes, Rob, it's Mike. Its -- unfortunately, it's not quite that simple. And as Jay indicated earlier, it is something that we're working on now. How much of that we'll have done by the Investor Day remains to be seen. But let us work to give you an update, hopefully a down payment at the Investor Day and more to come here later in '14.", "Operator", "You're next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Rockingham (sic) [Buckingham] Research.", "James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Just one or two quick follow-ups, one on the balance sheet. Just your comment that you saw a spike in excess deposits around $6 billion. I'm assuming you're talking about on an average basis because deposits were up $28 billion on a period-end basis, and if you could just sort of -- is the commentary that those -- the vast majority of that $28 billion rolled off? Is that how we should think about it?", "Michael William Bell", "Sure, Jim, it's Mike. Yes, I was referring to the average. On average, our excess deposits in Q4 were approximately $25 billion compared to $19 billion on average for Q3. Importantly, we saw 2 significant spikes in the fourth quarter. We saw a significant spike in October around the debt ceiling crisis, and then we saw an even larger spike at the end of December that's impacting the period-end number that you're describing. And so again, it was well north even of the numbers that you were quoting. So again, we tend to focus on the period averages because that tends to be more of a driver of the net interest revenue and net interest margin.", "James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "No, absolutely, but so you're saying that the -- that won't have any -- the period-end balances won't have any real impact on the average going into first quarter because they rolled off. Is that the...", "Michael William Bell", "That's correct, Jim. They rolled off at the beginning of January, not the whole 25, but the spike that we saw at year end rolled off. And I would expect, on average for Q1, it to be below 25, again, barring another crisis in Washington here later in the quarter.", "James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Right, or in emerging markets, I guess. Just a follow-up also on the conversation, you mentioned you would expect it to normalize in 1Q. I wasn't quite sure I understood what you were referring to. Was that sort of the seasonal kind of uptick in incentives? Or -- it wasn't clear to me what you were referring to.", "Michael William Bell", "Yes, let me just go back to that point. First of all, we will have this $150 million increase in Q1 related to the annual compensation cycle. So put that piece aside. If you strip that out of our Q1 2014 numbers, what I was saying was that if you strip that out, if you took the Q1 2014 versus the Q4 2013, we would expect the comp and benefits to decline over that period, mainly because we don't anticipate those expenses that supported the new business in Q4 to continue through Q1.", "James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "And any ballpark on that number?", "Michael William Bell", "Well, it was the bulk of the rest of the increase from Q3 to Q4 if you strip out the $12 million of the benefit plan change in Q3. So round numbers, call that $15 million. I would, again, anticipate that $15 million not being there in Q1 of '14.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just a follow-up on the asset servicing question. If 50% is driven by asset levels and 10% to 15% is transaction, is it possible to generalize about the biggest drivers for the remaining 40%? So is it just number of accounts or the type of service provided, which we really can't see?", "Michael William Bell", "It tends to be the latter. It tends to be fixed fee arrangements or other particular services, again, just not specifically tied to either transactions or basis points on assets. So again, an example -- I keep harping on it, but just to give the example, $6 million of the -- of the servicing fees from Q3 went away in Q4, and these were out-of-pocket expense recoveries where we do spend money, in this case on information systems, but charge the client dollar for dollar for that. So again, there is a drop in information systems but a drop in revenue. So it's those kinds of things, Cynthia. Again, we'll look to add some transparency on that over time.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Let me just give you one other example, Cynthia, because it's a meaningful line item. With each portfolio, if we're doing portfolio accounting, there's a fixed fee to provide that fund accounting, so obviously, that would be driven by the number of portfolios that we add versus assets, just as another example.", "Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, got it. And then on your outlook for '14, it sounds like you're assuming improvement in market conditions for both sec lending and trading. And I guess the sec lending, it sounds like you think, will be helped by better short-term rates. But what gives you confidence on the trading? And any color you can give on what you're seeing so far this quarter, since 4Q was so slow?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, I look on the -- you're right with regard to securities lending. I'd also add another little element which could be helpful, and it came up earlier in the call, that the M&A activity has picked up. And to the extent that stays robust, that would increase the number of special securities, and so that's a helper to securities lending as well. With regard to foreign exchange, it's -- our comments are probably more a reflection of the unusual decline in volatility in the second half of the year, that we don't think that's a normal state of markets.", "And I think you can look at the Fed pulling back, you can look at some of the emerging economies and some of their actions as indicators that our base case would be we'd see a little better volatility in this year, 2014, than we saw in '13. And by the way, volumes in our foreign exchange business have been pretty good. So it's really more of a factor of volatility.", "Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And any color on what you're seeing so far this quarter?", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Too early to tell.", "Operator", "At this time, I'll turn it back over to management for closing remarks.", "Joseph L. Hooley", "Yes, we would just thank you for your attention this morning and look forward to hopefully seeing most of you in a little more than a month in New York on February 27, where we'll host our annual analyst call.

During the quarter, our results were affected by a constrained investment environment in seasonal expense factors. However, we continue to execute on our key priorities of growing our core business, controlling our expenses, investing in growth areas and optimizing our capital structure to deliver long-term shareholder value.", "The environment during the first quarter was mixed. Global equity and fixed income markets were up slightly and investor risk taking behavior had a negative bias until the end of the quarter when investors began to move back into emerging markets. While volatility improved from the fourth quarter and helped our trading business, it remained constrained hitting a 7-year low during the quarter. Concerns about the Ukrainian growth in China similar throughout the quarter, but there were no significant impacts on the geopolitical front.", "On the State Street front, we experienced seasonal expense increases in the first quarter as well as continued pressure on regulatory expenses. As a result of this tepid environment, we have taken action to further align our expense base by announcing this morning a reduction of 400 positions. We are committed to aggressively managing our costs and we will continue to evaluate additional opportunities to create efficiencies to position us to achieve our goal of creating positive operating leverage year-over-year.", "The constrained environment and increasing regulatory requirements are also putting pressure on our clients. Consequently, we continue to see steady demand for our products and services around the globe. Our first quarter 2014 new asset servicing wins totaled approximately $189 billion representing a range of clients and sectors. 38% of those assets were from outside the U.S. Included in our new business wins are 25 new alternative servicing mandates, a client segment where we continue to see above average long-term growth potential.", "New assets to be serviced that remain to be installed in future periods totaled $136 billion. During the quarter, we saw outflows from money market funds into long-term funds. However, as the quarter progressed, the flows into long-term funds shifted from equities to fixed income out of emerging markets funds and into mature markets, which is indicative of continued cautious investor behavior. As mentioned, we did see some movement back into emerging market equity funds at the end of the quarter.", "In our asset management business, we experienced net inflows of $4 billion for the first quarter driven primarily by strong inflows of $35 billion into cash collateral pools offset by $31 billion in outflows from ETFs and institutional mandates primarily passive equity. The net ETF flows of approximately $19 billion reflected typical seasonal activity in our S&P 500 fund. In this continued challenging environment, our objectives for 2014 are to drive growth in the core business, continue to mine efficiencies across the organization, including executing on our ops and IT transformation program, invest in growth areas and deliver positive operating leverage on an annual basis.", "Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mike who will discuss our actions more fully and review our financial performance.", "Mike Bell - Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Jay and good morning everyone. This morning, before I start my review of our operating basis results, I would like to note that our GAAP basis results for the first quarter included a pre-tax severance expense of approximately $72 million related to staff reductions and realignment. As Jay noted, this action was taken to help mitigate environmental pressures and to align our expense base with our current revenue outlook. We continue to focus on one of our key priorities which is to support positive operating leverage on an annual basis in 2014.", "On Page 11, I will begin the discussion of our operating basis highlights and I will reference our non-GAAP operating basis results in my comments unless I note otherwise. EPS for the first quarter of 2014 declined $0.99 per share from $1.15 in the fourth quarter of 2013 and increased from $0.96 a share in the first quarter of 2013. Our first quarter results in 2013 and 2014 included the seasonal effect of deferred incentive comp and payroll taxes. Compared to the first quarter of 2013, the increase in operating basis EPS was primarily driven by a reduction in average outstanding shares due to common stock repurchase program.", "First quarter 2014 total revenue increased 1.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 and 3.6% compared to the first quarter of 2013. Total expenses increased in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the prior quarter primarily due to an incremental $157 million related to incentive comp and payroll taxes, of which $146 million is associated with the seasonal deferred incentive compensation for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes.", "During the first quarter of 2014, we repurchased approximately 6 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of approximately $420 million resulting in average fully diluted common shares outstanding of approximately $439 million for the quarter. In March 2014, our Board of Directors approved a new common stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $1.7 billion of our common stock through March 31, 2015.", "Turning now to Slide 12, I will discuss additional details of our operating basis revenue for the first quarter of 2014 focusing on the notable variances principally from the fourth quarter. First quarter 2014 servicing fees were up modestly compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily due to stronger global equity markets and net new business partially offset by lower transaction-related revenue.", "First quarter 2014 management fees increased modestly from the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily due to net new business and stronger global equity markets partially offset by lower performance fees. Performance fees in the first quarter of 2014 were approximately $3 million, down from $5 million in the prior quarter. Additionally, first quarter 2014 management fees were impacted by money market fee waivers of $10 million compared to $13 million in the prior quarter.", "Trading services revenue increased by almost 5% compared to the fourth quarter primarily due to higher foreign exchange trading revenue from higher volumes and volatility. Compared to the first quarter of 2013, trading services revenue was lower primarily due to lower foreign exchange trading revenue and lower distribution fees associated with the SPDR Gold ETF. Securities finance revenue increased from the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily due to higher spreads and volumes. Securities on loan averaged $333 billion in the first quarter of 2014 up approximately 6% from the fourth quarter of 2013.", "Processing fees and other revenue increased approximately 20% from the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to an increase in revenue from joint ventures, tax-advantaged investments and certain portfolio transition services. Our net interest revenue decreased from the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily due to $19 million of interest revenue recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013 associated with the municipal security that previously been impaired and lower yields on interest earning assets.", "I also reiterate the two net interest revenue scenarios that we reviewed at our February Investor Day. In our first scenario, we assume a modest improvement in market interest rates but not administer grades later in 2014. And we would expect full year NIR to be $25 million to $50 million lower than 2013 adjusted NIR of $2.289 billion. The second scenario assumes a static interest rate environment at 2013 year end levels for the remainder of 2014. And we would then expect our full year NIR to be $50 million to $100 million lower than the 2013 adjusted NIR of $2.289 billion.", "Our operating basis net interest margin in the first quarter of 2014 was 124 basis points. And as a result of the persistent low interest rate environment we expect the net interest margin to continue to move forward into market interest rate rise. Average interest earning assets increased from the fourth quarter which was primarily driven by higher levels of client deposits.", "And I\u2019ll now update you on how we\u2019re positioned relative to the liquidity coverage ratio or LCR. We expect to be above the 80% minimum requirement for the LCR as of January 1, 2015. This will likely result in a higher level of high quality liquid assets on the balance sheet which will have a negative impact on net interest revenue and this impact is reflected in our full year estimates.", "Now let\u2019s turn to operating basis expenses on Slide 13. Our total expenses for the first quarter of 2014 increased approximately 9% sequentially primarily due to seasonal deferred compensation expense and payroll taxes and higher information systems and transaction processing expenses. Our first quarter 2014 compensation and employee benefits expenses increased from the fourth quarter 2013 primarily due to an incremental $157 million related to deferred incentive comp and payroll taxes of which $146 million is associated with seasonal deferred incentive comp expense for retirement and eligible employees and payroll taxes.", "Compensation and employee benefits expenses continues to be impacted by costs associated with installing new business, investing in growth opportunities and implementing additional regulatory and compliance requirements. Our business operations and IT transformation program continues to be on track and for full year 2014 we expect to achieve approximately $130 million of additional pretax expense savings which would result in approximately $550 million of run rate savings since the inception of the program.", "Information systems expenses increased from the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily reflecting the planned transition of certain functions to external service providers as well as higher maintenance costs associated with the new technology implemented that is part of the business ops and IT transformation program.", "Transaction processing expenses increased from the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase primarily reflects higher volumes and higher equity values in the investment servicing business. Occupancy expenses of $114 million in the first quarter of 2014 decreased sequentially primarily due to the effect of a one-time $8 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2013 and a $4 million credit in the first quarter of 2014 each associated with a sublease renegotiation.", "Other expenses decreased to $283 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared with the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily due to lower securities processing, sales promotion and professional services costs. I\u2019d also note that fourth quarter 2013 operating basis other expenses included $28 million of Lehman Brothers-related gains and recoveries which was essentially offset by higher securities processing costs.", "Now I\u2019ll provide you some details on our March 31, 2014 balance sheet. As you can see on Slide 14, our overall approach managing our investment portfolio has not changed and we maintained a high credit quality profile. Our interest rate risk position was also in line with our position at year end. Additionally, the after tax unrealized mark to market gain as of March 31, was $124 million, which improved from the year end, due primarily due to narrower spreads in the first quarter.", "And I will turn to the next slide to review your capital position. As you can see we maintained a strong capital position and that strength has allowed us to deliver on our key priority of returning value to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. As of March 31, 2014 our estimated pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 11.1% under the standardized approach and 13.2% under the advanced approach. Both capital ratios improved from the fourth quarter primarily due to an increase in Tier 1 common equity. This increase included a temporary 20% phase-in of the deduction of other intangible assets from Tier 1 common equity as allowed by the phase-in rules. Previously, our pro forma ratios included 100% deduction of intangibles which will be required by the Basel III rules once the reduction is fully phased in. Therefore, the improvement of approximately 100 basis points due to the phase-in will completely disappear by 2018.", "On April 8, regulators released the 5% and 6% supplemental leverage ratio requirements for certain bank holding companies and insured depository institutions. At the same time, a notice of proposed rule making was issued to codify the calculation of the denominator of the SOR and in the NPR the ability to use a daily average of total assets is included which is positive for us. But unfortunately central bank placements were not excluded.", "We estimate that our pro forma Basel III supplementary leverage ratio under our interpretation of the U.S. proposed rules issued on April 8 are approximately 6.4% at the holding company and approximately 6.0% at the bank as of March 31, 2014. The improvement in the leverage ratios is primarily due to the temporary capital benefit for the intangibles, the more favorable treatment of unfunded commitments, the use of the daily average of total assets and the issuance of preferred stock during the quarter. Partially offsetting these improvements was a larger average balance sheet driven primarily by the higher level of client deposits.", "Now, we are pleased that the Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan that we submitted in conjunction with the 2014 CCAR. In line with our capital plan, our Board approved the purchase of up to $1.7 billion of our common stock through March 31, 2015. Additionally, we will seek approval from our Board in May to increase the second quarter common stock dividend to $0.30 per share, up from $0.26 per common share that was declared in the first quarter.", "Next I will reference Slide 16 where we detail a change in the presentation of our operating basis effective tax rate. Beginning with the first quarter of 2014 we changed the calculation of the operating basis effective tax rate by reflecting the tax equivalent adjustment that is included in operating basis revenue. This change has no impact on operating basis revenue, pretax earnings or EPS. We believe the change will better align our operating basis effective tax rate with our other operating basis metrics and will provide a more informative measure of the ordinary rate of tax generated by State Street business activity. On this basis, the operating basis, tax rate was 31.2% in the first quarter of 2014.", "Before I conclude, I would like to address the question which maybe on investors and analyst\u2019s minds regarding our expense outlook for the remainder of 2014. Excluding the first quarter seasonal, deferred compensation expense for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes, we expect that expenses will increase in the last three quarters of 2014, primarily due to annual salary increases which are effective in April. We do expect to realize savings of approximately $22 million in 2014 from the staffing reductions announced today. I would note that we expect to achieve the majority of the $22 million of savings in the second half of the year and then expect $40 million of annualized benefit in 2015.", "Overall, for the full year 2014, we continued to target 3% to 5% revenue growth and positive operating leverage. And while the environment continues to present challenges we plan to continue to focus on our top priorities, (driving) more revenue growth, investing in growth opportunities, controlling expenses, and managing our strong capital position. The expenses actions that we announced today reflect the current environment and put us in a better position to deliver on our goal to achieve positive operating leverage on an annual basis in 2014.", "Now I am turning the call back to Jay.", "Jay Hooley - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Mike. Stephanie, Mike and I are now prepared to handle questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI Group.", "Glenn Schorr - ISI Group", "First one is a quickie. I just want to make sure I heard your comments right, Mike, so full \u2013 on a fully phased in basis the capital ratios on the slide are about 100 basis points lower, still strong, but is that correct?", "Mike Bell", "That is correct Glenn. In terms of the Basel III risk weighted ratios in particular.", "Glenn Schorr - ISI Group", "Yes, cool. And then just wanted to make sure that you are still according to the (annuals) that you had mentioned that you still have some more preferred to issue, I just want to make sure that that is still in the cards. And then an add-on question to that is how you balance the capital efficiency benefits with the earnings dilution and I am asking just because I see a lot of people short of their 1.5% bucket, but not issuing because you can\u2019t get back all the capital, what\u2019s the point.", "Mike Bell", "Sure. So Glenn, the overall answer is that our position on preps has not changed since the Investor Day. So as we talked about it at the Investor Day, we do expect to add at least $500 million over time for the preps to get to that 1.5% which we view as optimal in terms of the Basel III risk weighted capital ratios. Now really the key question when I say at least $500 million the key question is going to be the supplementary leverage ratio since the preps that we issue do count towards the SOR. There is an incentive. There is an economic incentive over time for us to potentially have issue additional preps which over the fullness of time we would expect to enable us to reduce the common equity that we have outstanding. And so in terms of your question on timing that is obviously something that we are looking at and we will continue to review our options. And again I would say that if we are really looking at this in terms of long-term shareholder value, it\u2019s a good trade to make the trade relative preps for common stock and the dilution is something that we think at this point is manageable, but it will be factored into decision going forward.", "Glenn Schorr - ISI Group", "Right, last one is this is good thing the asset management fees were up more than the assets under management which I haven\u2019t seen in a long time, that\u2019s a good thing. In the tax it doesn\u2019t say that it\u2019s a performance fees, so is that just a function of mix and selling higher margin product?", "Jay Hooley", "Yes, I would say if you recall Glenn from our Investor Day we featured (indiscernible) presentation that we have \u2013 we are less concerned about pure AUM and more concerned about revenue per unit of AUM. And we have intentionally focused on higher yielding products mostly through ETF vehicles. And we continue to push those out and that had the effect of improving the revenue per AUM which we think is good and we think we will continue to focus on.", "Glenn Schorr - ISI Group", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Hi, good morning.", "Jay Hooley", "Good morning Ken.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Mike, I just want to be super clear here. When you are talking about expenses moving up off of the first quarter base and you said excluding stock comp and payroll taxes, what\u2019s that explicit number that we should use to build off of?", "Mike Bell", "Thanks Ken. So what I would suggest \u2013 this is how I would suggest when you think about it Ken is I would take the first quarter comp and employee benefits number, I would back out the \u2013 let me just think about this for a second. I would back out the $146 million of 55 and 5, the retirement eligible comp that\u2019s embedded in there. And then I would think about adding approximately $21 million a quarter for the merit increases and importantly as you go from Q1 to Q2 we\u2019ll have an additional payroll day and that\u2019s worth about $5 million.", "So that\u2019s how I would think about I mean there are obviously other pluses and minuses but I am trying to answer your question in terms of how to think about the baseline. I would make those adjustments as a starting point for Q2. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks while we will get savings in 2014 they will be from the expense actions. The reduction enforce of a net 400 FTEs we\u2019ll get benefit from that in 2014 that\u2019s mainly in the second half of the year and then we get an additional $18 million in the full year 2015 that we don\u2019t get in the full year 2014.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Okay. Since I want to confirm but as you had said payroll taxes as well, so but the only thing we should really be backing out from the first quarter is just the $146 million?", "Mike Bell", "Yes. In the $146 million includes the seasonal effect of the payroll taxes on everybody. So what we look to focus on and with that $146 million number which is apples-to-apples with $118 million the year before is it\u2019s the deferred comp for everybody is retirement eligible and it\u2019s the seasonal bump up in payroll taxes that happens in Q1 as a result of flipping over the calendar year and FICA taxes and stuff starting back at zero base.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Okay. And just because I am getting the question a bunch of times, the severance charges are not in that 10.85 number, correct?", "Mike Bell", "That is correct, Ken.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Okay. And then operating expenses were higher than the range that you\u2019ve talked to in the past. Can you give us some color on what your outlook is for that operating expenses number, the other sorry other?", "Mike Bell", "Yes, sure. The other operating expenses Ken first of all continued to be very pressured by these regulatory compliance cost. So again very consistent with what we\u2019ve talked about at the Investor Day. And there is significant upward pressure on that number relative to 2013 levels. So in terms of the outlook for other operating expenses in 2014 it is going to be lumpy I mean it is going to be lumpy because of legal costs, it will be somewhat lumpy for regulatory compliance expenses so and actually lumpy as well because of securities processing costs.", "So it is one of those \u2013 it\u2019s very difficult to give you a quarterly number with a lot of confidence because in any given quarter stuff can go bump and either be good or bad. I would characterize the first quarter though is being roughly in line with what we\u2019re going to see is on a quarterly basis over the course of the remainder of the year based on our current expectations. But I\u2019d say that the big wild cards are really the legal expenses and also the regulatory compliance cost where there is upward pressure.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Okay. And then if I could just wrap a final one together. Your revenue growth was 3.6% and pretty much in that range you\u2019ve talked about. And obviously the expenses were in the 5s and even if you back out that retirement eligible the expenses were still growing 4.5%. So trying to understand then with a negative operating leverage start to the first quarter and the expenses still moving up from here albeit with your modest amount of incremental saves you are getting, what \u2013 what\u2019s your level of confidence that this can flip in the next three quarters and get us to a net positive operating leverage, when you think about revenues versus expenses. It seems like there is still an bad balance here between expense growth and revenue growth?", "Mike Bell", "Sure, Ken. A very important question that you are asking, so the overall answer is we\u2019re continuing to set as a goal for ourselves for the full year positive operating leverage for full year 2014 versus full year 2013. Now importantly as we\u2019ve talked about the Investor Day we are managing though for long-term shareholder value. And which means that we\u2019re going to continue to focus on the strategic plan that we\u2019ve talked about which is sure we want to be the low cost provider in the core activities but it also means that we\u2019re going to also focus on being an innovator of value-added services and which means we\u2019re going to continue to invest.", "And so in terms of some of the numbers that you talked about I\u2019ll add some additional commentary there. First we do recognize that the Q1 revenue results was at the lower end of our 3% to 5% range that we reiterated at the Investor Day. And importantly Ken I would note that the \u2013 both the revenue and the expenses in Q1 was nominally higher because of the weaker U.S. dollar. So if you actually make it on a constant currency basis for 3.6 and the 5.8 that you referenced are likely 3 and 5. So the point is we recognized that we did not get a lot of help from the revenue environment in Q1.", "Now we do think that there is some potential help that we could get for the full year revenue outlook. So for example we may get some potential help from equity markets. It was useful that equity markets now are higher than where they were at year end 2013 which was the basis of original 3% to 5% estimate. So that\u2019s useful. We also have not yet seen a material improvement in FX volatility but we would note that the FX volatility is still at a significant cyclical lows; we think there is some upside there.", "We didn\u2019t see a little bit of help on sec lending spreads in Q1 and again we expect more help in Q2 since that\u2019s the seasonal dividend arm quarter where it\u2019s \u2013 where it is tended to peak so that should help. And then again if we could get some help from market interest rates in the second half of the year we think the revenue outlook could be better than call it 3% that we saw on a constant currency basis in Q1. But importantly Ken I would just reinforce, if the revenue outlook continues to be very soft we will continue to review our operating expense options I mean everything is on the table. We\u2019re \u2013 again we\u2019re managing this for the long-term but we\u2019re also very serious about our goal. So rest assured if we continue to see more 3% kind of scenario than 5% scenario we\u2019ll look harder at operating expenses.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Okay. Thank you for all that color, Mike. I appreciate it.", "Mike Bell", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning guys. So just picking up on the last point I want to dig in into expenses, couple of specific items and maybe wanted on the revenues. So Mike I think when you mentioned is regulatory related costs are still going higher, that\u2019s something different than we heard from the other two trust banks. It sounds like the \u2013 they\u2019re still elevated obviously relative to where they have been kind of last couple of years but it didn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re growing a ton from here. Do you guys still expect that for State Street gets regulatory and legal related items will continue to grow in 2014 versus 2013?", "Mike Bell", "Absolutely, yes Alex. I \u2013 again I won\u2019t comment on any other company\u2019s issues. But I \u2013 it\u2019s virtually certain that ours will be higher and candidly it will be a challenge for us to manage the year-over-year increase in regulatory compliance cost to the $30 million to $40 million that we talked about at the Investor Day. There is real upward pressure on that $30 million to $40 million range.", "Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Thanks for that. And then on the revenue front the two items that I was hoping to spend a few minutes on our \u2013 the brokerage and other and then on securities lending. In brokerage and other I understand there is a couple of things that go in there. This line item has been kind of about 120, 130 range a year ago or so in the last couple of quarters has been closer to 100. So help us understand I guess what\u2019s been the biggest delta there? Is it really all the GLD or there has been some softness in the transition management business as well and then just a quick follow-up in sec lending?", "Mike Bell", "So on the brokerage and other revenue you\u2019re absolutely right, Alex. That category for us was down $30 million versus Q1 a year ago, a little over a third of that is the lower gold fees that we get were mainly reflecting the lower price of gold, but also outflows out of the gold fund. The other call it $19 million is really a combination of as you said lower transition management revenues but also importantly lower electronic exchange revenues. And again we feel like we are well positioned in that market. We see it really as a market phenomenon as opposed to a State Street specific situation. Again, if there is any silver lining to that dark cloud, it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s another area where we view as potential upside, if in fact global economic conditions improve.", "Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs", "Right and just ", "Jay Hooley", "", "Securities lending piece\u2026", "Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs", "Yes, I just wanted to get a sense on that\u2019s one of the bright spot I guess in the quarter pretty good growth year-over-year. And I think one of things you talked about at the Investor Day is enhanced custody and I think it was mentioned in your prepared remarks as well. So I was hoping you could either quantify I guess how much that new revenue stream has contributed if at all and maybe help us size the opportunity there?", "Jay Hooley", "Sure. It was a bit of bright spot both sequentially and year-over-year. First time in a while we have seen the online balances up nicely 6% sequentially and you did \u2013 you hit on the key element of the growth, which is in the quarter 25% of our securities lending revenues was driven by enhanced custody and almost all of the growth came through enhanced custody. So I will just remind everybody that\u2019s something that we began that\u2019s began investing three years ago and it\u2019s and we are still investing in it as we bring it into Europe and Asia. But we think it\u2019s a nice addition when we represent a lot of future of the securities lending business.", "Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Thank you so much for taking the questions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.", "Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse", "Good morning. I had a few clean up questions. First on revenues, can you just size your current asset servicing backlogs and also what is the CVA benefit to servicing fees this quarter?", "Jay Hooley", "Yes, its servicing backlog so committed not installed I believe the $136 million. And as for your other question I wasn\u2019t\u2026", "Mike Bell", "He is asking Jay about the CVA. The CVA was approximately plus $3 million in the quarter roughly flat sequentially.", "Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, got it. And then just on expenses, I just want to add another basically complete the picture you painted, Mike. Of the $130 million savings, how much have you realized so far this year, could you give us some color there?", "Mike Bell", "Sure, Ashley I would characterize it as we have achieve the substantial majority of that $130 million and overall feel like the full year as well as the remaining $50 million in 2015 are on track at this point.", "Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Got it. And just finally on the occupancy expense line, should we think of $118 million as a starting point ex-credit this quarter?", "Mike Bell", "Yes, I would suggest that\u2019s a good idea.", "Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brennan Hawkins with UBS.", "Brennan Hawkins - UBS", "So the asset management fee rate. If we adjust gross it up for the fee waivers and adjust for the performance and the day count. We would still down where it had been running the prior three quarters was there anything specific I know it was up year-over-year but versus where it had been in 2Q through 4Q, was there anything specific driving that drop?", "Mike Bell", "Well, so Brennan just to put some facts around it, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks the performance fees are down $2 million sequentially and I would also add that the day count cost us approximately $4 million. So again that would be the main headwind. We didn\u2019t get some help from little lower money market fee waivers as we saw money move out of the government funds and into prime money market, which leads to a little bit better waiver experience. And then some help from markets and also some help from a small amount of help from net new business.", "Brennan Hawkins - UBS", "Yes. I mean grossing up for all those, right I still had fee rate dropping from where it had been running, so I just \u2013 was there anything specific, was it just the flows out of SPY given that that\u2019s a higher fee rate and so it\u2019s a mix function what was it do you think?", "Mike Bell", "We did have some flows out of SPY so that\u2019s \u2013 and that tends to happen at Q1 that\u2019s a pretty common seasonality, seasonal pattern, excuse me.", "Jay Hooley", "", "But nothing unusual in the quarter I think it\u2019s fair to look at the year-over-year, if you are not considering trends more in the sequential quarter.", "Brennan Hawkins - UBS", "Okay, thanks Jay. And then on those typical seasonal offers on SPY, is this quarter it\u2019s $19 billion, last year it was $5 billion, is there anything that\u2019s causing that to be so much worse, so much more pronounced than it was last year because we are not seeing anything any other big outflows out of other index products, so I am just kind of curious whether or not you have any insights into what\u2019s making that, maybe a bit more seasonally severe this year?", "Jay Hooley", "I think it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t think there is anything unusual there and in fact after the quarter ended we saw a lot of that come back. So I think it is used as trading account at quarter end. And I think if we look back over several years you would see there is a fair amount of difference in those flows, but we are not reading anything other than, anything trend wise into it.", "Brennan Hawkins - UBS", "Perfect and helpful to hear that it bounced back here first quarter. And then last one from me, just really a minor one the CVA I think you guys highlighted the counterpart evaluation adjustment in the processing fee, can you maybe size that for us?", "Mike Bell", "It was approximately $3 million positive Brennan.", "Brennan Hawkins - UBS", "Terrific and that\u2019s versus sequential or year-over-year?", "Mike Bell", "Sequentially it\u2019s flat, it was also positive in Q4. Q1 doing some my memory I believe was minus $6 million. So it would be a $9 million improvement on comparing those two quarters.", "Brennan Hawkins - UBS", "Terrific. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.", "Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein", "I guess I am still confused by the slide on the asset servicing fees as a percentage of assets under custody, I think your asset value at the Investor Day, I get the context that less than 50% of the fees are directly linked to AUC, but I think you stopped sort of really providing a detailed explanation of the dynamics that will play there. So maybe you could do that for us now I mean I think we are seeing better flows at the asset managers portfolio turnovers finally picking up, so why is this still falling. What types of activity is specifically under pressure and all those cyclical \u2013 cycle of pressures?", "Mike Bell", "Sure, Luke, it\u2019s Mike, the transaction revenue is the main piece that I would ask you to factor into your analysis. So specifically transaction revenue was down $5 million sequentially Q4 versus Q1. And it\u2019s just lower market activity. I mean believe me when I tell you, we have looked at it several different ways and it just looks like it is driven by lower market activity going on. And so I would expect when we get into an environment where the global economies were healthier and there is a little more risk taking. We would expect that to improve, but I would certainly acknowledge that we have seen it move in the opposite direction now for three sequential quarters and just in time for me taking the job of course.", "Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, slightly more detailed question, maybe you could just touch on processing fees and other revenues. I think there was some noise in this quarter, but I think the last time you said anything in terms of guidance was first quarter 2012 and you pointed to $70 million to $75 million as a decent run rate, but then later you\u2019ve stated that line by about $35 million. So would you be willing to say that $100 to $210 million is a decent run rate for that line?", "Mike Bell", "Luke what I would suggest is if you include the tax equivalent adjustment that we detail every quarter which the recent increase there has been primarily caused by the higher volume of tax-advantaged investments. If you include that tax equivalent adjustment, I would expect that the processing fees and others would range between $125 million and $135 million a quarter for the remainder of this year, again importantly including the tax equivalent adjustment.", "Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then final one from me. Just high level, given that the scale asset managers have been earning sub-par for the last five years, I would imagine that smaller services are maybe even earning worse returns, so why haven\u2019t we seen more competitors accept the business will merge and maybe you can discuss the dynamics that caused I think so many to hang on this business and then what did that say about the benefit of having scale on the business?", "Jay Hooley ", "Luke, is your question pointed at asset managers or asset servicers?", "Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein", "I am sorry to say asset mangers, I mean asset servicers.", "Jay Hooley ", "Okay, it is a huge advantage of scale and I think they are getting even greater when you think about the position of regulatory and compliance cost that we referenced earlier. I think that the question of why you have done more consolidation on the back of that. First off there has been a lot of consolidation, so if you look at the concentration in the asset servicing business there are four firms that have 70% of the market by the industry calculations. You\u2019ve got a series of banks, European banks I think continue review this business even though sub scale is attractive and some parts because the liquidity is that provide an environment where those banks are under some pressure. So I think that move on its closure some point in the future but I don\u2019t see exchanging and short term. And other category of service providers I would point to if you look at the alternatives.", "As in servicing space its get a little bit more for us volume of sub scale players remains that many of you wouldn\u2019t know it and that\u2019s been I think that\u2019s a market that proportionally has higher growth prospects and has experienced higher growth. So, I think that\u2019s caused people to hang in there. So, in summary I would say there is, because of the concentration and consolidation that occurred up until now there is less prospects who are lapsed. And for different reasons people are finding it so interesting being in the game. I think that the need to drive efficiency out the core operations need to address components and regulatory costs will continue. And I think that puts pressure on sub scale providers.", "Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.", "Steven Dong - RBC Capital Markets", "Hi, guys, this is actually Steven Dong in for Gerard. Thanks for taking a call. Just going back to SOR you guys had provided some color on the improvements sequentially. Would you happen to have the break out of the percentage basis of the moving parts for that?", "Mike Bell", "Steven, it\u2019s Mike. So what was focus on the bank which went from 5% to 6%.", "Steven Dong - RBC Capital Markets", "Yes.", "Mike Bell", "And so specifically and going to give you round numbers here. The improvement that we got from the temporary credit on the intangibles is worth approximately half of that so call if 50 basis points. The combination of the moving to the daily average calculation rather than the month end calculation roughly offset the larger balance sheet we have in the quarter because of the spike up in the excess deposits. You can size that plus and minus that about 30 basis points but those \u2013 those two things of offset. And then the benefit that we got from the improve conversion factors under the rules, is worth approximately 30 basis points. And then we had a bunch of other odds and ends that contributed 20 basis points. So that would be the go forward at the banks from 5 to 6.", "Steven Dong - RBC Capital Markets", "Great, thank you. And we do have the holding company level at all?", "Mike Bell", "Sure. It\u2019s approximately the same numbers, the only other piece that you are going to factor in to that analysis is that the proceeds that we have from the pref issuance. So the call it 750 million of proceeds from the pref issuance is worth call it another 25 to 35 basis points that\u2019s it quarter level and not at the bank level.", "Steven Dong - RBC Capital Markets", "Right. When you issue your $500,000 million in plus you would expect perhaps another say 15 basis points then?", "Mike Bell", "That\u2019s correct, call it 20 yes.", "Steven Dong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, perfect. And just going back to your new business wins, do you have the break out what was the outside of the U.S. versus U.S.?", "Jay Hooley", "Yes. I think it was roughly 38% outside the US, which is consistent with downs we have seen over the last couple of quarters.", "Steven Dong - RBC Capital Markets", "Great, that\u2019s all for us. Thanks for taking the call.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi, good morning.", "Jay Hooley", "Good morning.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "A couple of questions one on expenses and one on revenues, so on the expense side I noticed you have the merit increase coming this year and I don\u2019t know if this right calculation we just look at relative to total comp dollars looks like around 2% hike and wondering how you think about sizing it. This feels a little bit higher than inflation right now. Looks like its not necessarily tight performance is that there is wondering how you size that number?", "Mike Bell", "Yes, Betsy, it\u2019s Mike. First of all, we did average a 3% increase in base salaries that\u2019s effective in April. And basically, we did a review of the market conditions. We reviewed what other companies were doing, where our compensation levels were versus other key competitors and key competitors, not just banks, but also just other people that we battle with for talent. And yes, I would certainly acknowledge that the 3% is a fair amount higher than the last couple of years where we had very small increases. And but \u2013 again, we thought it was important given the competitive landscape and the importance of keeping our top talent.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "So if we see a little wage pressure here maybe we will get interest rates rising on the front of the curve, so again that would be nice?", "Mike Bell", "That will be very helpful, Betsy.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Exactly. So then just the second thing is on collateral transformation, I just wonder at the Analyst Day, Investor Day, you have highlighted some of the things you are doing to try to increase your share of activity along the trading channels right doing more in TV related stuff doing more with collateral management and collateral transformation. Could you give us a sense of where you are in that process? And is this anything that we are going to see in the numbers, in the next year or this is more of a very gradual over time five years down the road we will look back and say, hey, this was a story something to act?", "Jay Hooley", "Betsy, this is Jay. Let me take that. I would say it\u2019s the latter. It will gradually bleed in over time. I think collateral transformation is a product that we offer today, where ramping up slowly that activity across the number of customers, derivative clearing probably a little bit more excitement going on. We are on the front end of timing of customers. There is a little bit of a lead time to sign them up. Once you sign them up, you should see a pretty steady flow. I think we are viewed as an attractive alternative on the derivatives clearing space. And then Enhanced Custody would be another product that I would say is maybe indicative of what I would expect that of derivatives clearing, collateral management a couple of years out. It took us a year or so to get it set get the infrastructure set, revenues started coming in, but once they start coming in, they should be pretty sustainable and improving over time. So it\u2019s the gradual enhancement to core revenues.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Hi, thanks a lot. Just a quick question on the assets under custody and administration levels, it looks like just looking at your Page 3 of the main release that it went up 0.2%, but the markets in most cases, I guess other than EEFA went up more than that and you guys do sight net new business. I am wondering just in terms of levels why wouldn\u2019t it go up a little bit more given your equity sensitivity?", "Jay Hooley", "Yes, let me take that one, Cynthia, because there is a \u2013 we did lose a customer that had low revenues and high AUA and let me just explain the situation, because it\u2019s unusual with the customer that we acquired through IBT back in \u201806 it\u2019s rare that we would do middle office without custody activities. In this case, we were doing middle office without custody activities and it had a pretty high AUA and pretty low revenues. It was a pretty simple middle office construct. And in talking to the customer over the last couple of quarters, they concluded we agreed that they would internalize it and so that really speaks to that abnormality, which I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 I would say was clearly one-off.", "Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "So can you give a sense of the size of that and I guess there is very little revenue impact you are saying?", "Jay Hooley", "Yes, $500 billion which is where you get the anomaly and pretty low revenue. Again, just a simple middle office only implementation, nowhere close to our, all of our other middle office implementations, but that\u2019s distortion.", "Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And in terms of the new asset servicing mandates you are bringing in, how does the mix compare to what you have in place in previous quarters? Any shift, is it similar?", "Jay Hooley", "Yes, it\u2019s similar, but it\u2019s heavily weighted in the alternative space, again more hedge and private equity. You also see \u2013 we all see those alternative structures moving down in market and to some of the liquid structures. So I would say we should continue to expect to see proportionately more of our new business growth coming in those alternative categories.", "Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then finally the $40 million cost saves you guys have cited and the headcount cut, maybe you said this. But where are those cuts and are there any offsets like for instance the increase in IT as you move to external service providers. Is that related to headcount cuts?", "Jay Hooley", "No, I would say Cynthia that the headcount cuts were kind of broad-based, no specific theme, but as we continue to mine the organization for efficiencies or things that we can do in other places we took advantage of that.", "Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "And are there any offsets in terms of greater use of outside services?", "Jay Hooley", "No, it\u2019s a straight reduction.", "Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Jay Hooley", "Yep.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steven Wharton with JPMorgan.", "Steven Wharton - JPMorgan", "Hi guys.", "Jay Hooley", "Good morning.", "Steven Wharton - JPMorgan", "I just wanted to I think this question may have been asked but forgive me if it was. What was \u2013 what\u2019s the business the whole outsourcing and IT initiative cost sales objective for 2014 incrementally and what has been achieved cumulatively to-date of the total that you\u2019re trying to achieve through the end of 2015?", "Mike Bell", "Sure. So Steven its Mike. The goal for 2014 full year is $130 million and that would bring the cumulative to-date to $550 million at the end of this year and there would be a remaining approximately $50 million that we would get in 2015, so $600 in total.", "Steven Wharton - JPMorgan", "Right. And were you saying that through the first quarter you\u2019ve already achieved the $130 million I was..", "Mike Bell", "I would characterize it is not the full amount but a majority of the amounts. If you then annualize the Q1 we would have achieved the majority of the annual amount.", "Steven Wharton - JPMorgan", "Okay. So basically that\u2019s why on degree you\u2019ve announced this additional restructuring of sort because you basically run out of benefits from the outsourcing initiative for this year and then there has been maybe a little bit more in 2015?", "Mike Bell", "Yes, I mean again we did for a variety of reasons including the software revenue picture. And the importance of our goal of achieving overall positive operating leverage for the full year.", "Steven Wharton - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan", "Hi Mike, hi Jay. I want to reconcile one comment you mentioned the transaction related fees were down $5 million or transaction related revenues were down $5 million linked quarter. But then when I look at your commentary in the release on transaction processing expenses, you say that those were up due to higher volumes. So how do I reconcile those two statements?", "Mike Bell", "Sure. Vivek its Mike. They are even though they\u2019re both, they had the word transaction and then they are very different items. So specifically as I mentioned earlier the brokerage and other revenue is driven by the combination of the lower gold fees with SPDR GLD fees as well as the pressure that we\u2019ve seen on the electronic exchange revenue that\u2019s picked up in other trading services. The transaction processing fees those are mainly service bureau fees and they are higher based on our higher volumes that, those kinds of volumes would tend to track more with our global service fee revenue as opposed to any of the other line items. So.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan", "But the gold and other is showing up in processing and other fee, right?", "Mike Bell", "Well the gold fee is driven by the volume of (indiscernible) that we. Sorry go ahead.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan", "Yes, the gold and other and the brokerage fees whereas I am referring to your asset servicing fees we\u2019ve talked about transaction related activity being down. And I am reconciling, trying to reconcile that with transaction volumes being up in the transaction processing expenses line?", "Mike Bell", "I am sorry, I misunderstood your question Vivek. So again the transaction fees that we get as part of the GS revenue is down just because of lower market activity. Things like the service bureau fees that can include things like pricing, services, transfer agent cost. Again, there are different volume drivers from the expense versus the transaction revenue.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan", "Okay, alright. Let me reask one other question asked earlier. The processing and other fees which went up from 106 to 127 which you said the run rate will be 125 to 135. When I look at the (tax less) quarter adjustment that went from 53 to 57, so a lot bigger increase in the processing and other fees, what\u2019s driving that and how sustainable is that?", "Mike Bell", "Sure. Again, I would suggest you look at in total because part of the processing and other fees. If you exclude the tax equivalent adjustment is actually the amortization that we have on the tax advantaged investments themselves. So that piece contributed three of number that you are describing. So I think of the tax advantaged investments as being up 7 sequentially which is poor from the tax equivalent adjustment and 3 from the lower amortization. In terms of the rest beyond the 7 of JV revenue was up sequentially 8 million Q4 versus Q1 of 2014.", "Again that tends to bounce around but I think the Q1 is pretty down close to what would expect further remainder of the year in term of JV fees but again with the caveat but it does bounce around. We also head on uptick in portfolio a transition services specifically some currency risk management fees that we saw in increase and again I would characterize the Q1 has being in reasonable expectation for the remainder of the year. In aggregate the back I would say that the processing fees and other including the tax equivalent adjustment or reasonable expectation would be 125 to 135 over the remainder of the year, with the, slight growth that we\u2019ll see there are mainly driven by higher tax advance investments for Q2 and Q3 in particular.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.", "Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Hi, good morning. Just want to follow up on your NII outlook in the balance sheet you had a bigger spike in deposits in the balance sheet when you peers I guess number one can you may be if you have any insides on what drove the spike. And then secondly embedded in your NII outlook what is your view \u2013 what\u2019s the embedded view of your balance sheet for the rest of the year? Thanks.", "Mike Bell", "Sure, Jim its Mike. I\u2019ll start the first we didn\u2019t see on increase in excess deposits in Q1 versus Q4 we estimate that they will up approximately 3 billion in terms of the average daily balances Q1 versus Q4. They spike significant at the very end of the quarter and view it as really a function of the fact that we viewed as a safe heaven and also that there are not other great alternatives for our clients to put very short-term money at this point in time.", "Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Europe for the US or so.", "Mike Bell", "It\u2019s actually both.", "Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay.", "Mike Bell", "Both so I again if you look at any particular plan there is a different story for each client but that in this \u2013 it is global\u2014phenomenon at this point. In terms of what we think size in the balance sheet would be the over the course of the year, the short answer is, if we expect, if the short-term interest rates do rise, we do expect of the majority of our excess deposits that are on the balance sheet would likely viewed and find other places where they get earn better yields. And that is embedded in our forecast that will gave under that scenario remember.", "Jim, I would ask you to remember that this is very low margin, this is because basically we take these client deposit fees, these excess deposits from our clients and put them with the big central bank. So again with earning for our numbers call it 20 basis point name on that \u2013 on those assets. So it\u2019s not a big move in terms of our net interest revenue over the course of the year. Excluding the impact of the excess deposits I would expect that we would have essentially stable to perhaps modest growth in the core operational deposits over the course of the Europe. The big mover in terms of the overall size of the balance sheet will be the \u2013 will likely be the excess deposits.", "Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.", "Robert Lee - KBW", "Thanks for taking my question. And yes, I apologize upfront for this, but it\u2019s \u2013 I want to go back to asset servicing and trying to get wrap my head around the idea of the lower activity, because when you look at a lot of things out in the marketplace, whether it\u2019s fund flows, whether it\u2019s move to alternatives, whether it\u2019s even, I guess I would characterize even higher sec lending balances as being some indication of leverage and risk taking? And then kind of also layer on top of it, but may be you are being impacted in asset servicing by lower customer activity? Couple of things, how much of that maybe is being impacted by pension movements for the LDI, was that having like negative impact on that business that\u2019s discernible and should we be thinking that maybe that business, maybe say to a point you made on emerging markets of actually maybe it\u2019s more leveraged to two emerging market flows and things like that, that maybe we would proceed from the outside? We are just trying to be a little more granular on it.", "Mike Bell", "Well, Robert, let me start with a couple of facts and then I will ask Jay if he wants to add. So in terms of the transactional revenue that\u2019s embedded in our global service fees, those were down as I said earlier, down $5 million sequentially and down $3 million versus Q1 of 2013. We have sliced in and diced it. And it just truly looks like simply lower market activity and unfortunately has been a continued trend that we have seen now for three straight quarters. I think there is potential for that to improve when we see a little bit more global market activity, but again, those are the facts. Let me see if Jay wants to add?", "Jay Hooley", "I don\u2019t know what I could add other than just it does reflect the portfolio managers who are part of the customer base that we serviced there, velocity of trading. And as you know, we proportionately we are greater in the funds business, in the alternatives business, less proportionately in pensions and corporates. So, it\u2019s \u2013 I can\u2019t put my finger on anything other just lack of trading volume. I think to me the service fees in addition to the actual trading activity being affected as much by kind of muted market activity, pretty slow growth on the equity and the fixed income front and lack of risky investments as much a drag on that service fee line as the transaction volume itself.", "Robert Lee - KBW", "I appreciate taking my question. Thank you.", "Jay Hooley", "Stephanie, is that it?", "Operator", "Yes, that\u2019s your final question sir.", "Jay Hooley - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "So thanks everybody. We look forward to getting on the phone with you again at the end of the second quarter. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Good morning everyone and welcome to our third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me on the call is Jay Hooley, Chairman, President and CEO and Mike Bell our Chief Financial Officer.", "Prior to discussing our agenda, I'd like to take this opportunity to invite our institutional investors and the analysts to join us for our 2015 Annual Investor and Analyst Forum in New York City on Wednesday February 25.", "We have chosen this date as it is our confirmed understanding that one of our larger peers will be holding their Investor Day, a day before on Tuesday February 24th in New York City. We look forward to seeing there, if not before.", "Now to our agenda. Jay will discuss the third quarter highlights and Mike will discuss financial results. Our third quarter earnings materials include a slide presentation. Unless otherwise noted, all the financial information discussed on today\u2019s webcast will reflect our operating basis results.", "Please note that the operating basis results are a non-GAAP presentation and this webcast includes other non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures, including operating basis results to GAAP basis measures referenced on this webcast, and other related materials, such as the slide presentation referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Mike Bell, will refer to the financial highlights presentation when he provides an overview of our financial results for the third quarter of 2014 which he will refer to as 3Q, \u201814 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 which he will also refer to as year-to-date 2014.", "Unless noted separately, Mike will reference only the non-GAAP operating basis results in his comments today. When reviewing our results to comparisons to prior periods, Mike will primarily focus on comparing our 3Q, \u201814 and year-to-date 2014 performance relative to our third quarter 2013 and nine months year-to-date 2013 performance; unless he otherwise notes that the comparison is sequential from our second quarter 2014 results.", "Before Jay and Mike begin this discussion of our financial performance, I\u2019d like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in State Street\u2019s 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC.

Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of today, October 24, 2014. The corporation does not undertake to revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after today.", "Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our Chairman, President and CEO, Jay Hooley.", "Jay Hooley", "Good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks, I\u2019d like to take a moment to welcome to State Street our new Head of IR, Anthony Ostler. Anthony recently joined us and has over 22 years of financial services experience.", "Now to my remarks, our third quarter results demonstrated good core fee growth in asset servicing and asset management, which together were up 9% from the third quarter of 2013, reflecting improved equity markets and new business commitments. Our market driven revenues also performed well in a traditionally seasonally slow quarter. Our pipelines are strong as evidenced by winning new business of $302 billion of assets to be serviced and we had $2 billion of net new assets to be managed this quarter.", "On the expense front, we continue to be very focused on controlling cost across our organization. As we have highlighted for you on the past couple of conference calls, we continue to experience increased pressure from regulatory compliance costs and would expect this pressure to continue in future periods. Despite the current challenges we faced some low interest rates, we have leveraged our strong market positions and capabilities to generate profitable top-line growth.", "Now, I would like to provide a brief overview of economic and market developments, and how our business was affected.", "For the third year in a row, the third quarter has seen economists downgrade their forecast for global growth for the current and coming year. While not uncommon, this quarter's adjustment has had a number of important consequences. Global commodity prices have fallen. This has put further downward pressure on already falling global inflation rates and what has been a very uneven global recovery, this means that deflation has returned as a clear and present danger in a number of economies, especially in the Euro zone.", "This has already created a good deal of policy uncertainty. The ECB cut its administrated rates on September 4th in response to mounting pressure to further address the region\u2019s weak growth and loan inflation. Additionally, the ECB also began injecting liquidity into the system putting further downward pressure on market rates. In light of the EBC's decision to reduce deposit and administered rates, we have notified our clients of the potential to charge negative rates or fees on euro deposits. Our plan which is similar to many other banks is to begin charging later this quarter.", "In contrast, the response of the Fed to the global slowdown is less clear. Most still project the Fed tightening next year but the timing and scale of rate rises is now a key point of uncertainty. Nevertheless on balance, monetary policy in the U.S. and perhaps the UK will likely diverge in 2015 from the continued easing expected in both the Euro zone and Japan.", "These economic divergences and uncertainties appear to have contributed to the return of volatility across assets. Geopolitical factors have also played their part. At the start of the third quarter, volatility across most financial markets was at historically low levels. Several central bank employees is concerned about this complacency as it potentially reflected the underpricing of risk.", "There is less cause for this concern now. Volatility has risen consistently across assets, a trend that has continued into the beginning of the fourth quarter. Together these trends impact our business lines in two different ways. First, the growth downgrade and this inflation risk means the low interest rate environment looks likely to stay for a while longer. This continues to negatively impact our net interest revenue and net interest margin as high yielding investments mature pay down and have to be reinvested in lower yielding investments currently available in the market.", "We also continue to experience high levels of deposits and for liquidity reasons maintain those that we view as excess with central banks. Another short run implication of the environment is that the low rates have continued to impact the spread associated with our securities finance business.", "Second, the benign conditions at the beginning of the third quarter, seems to have void asset values and flows into emerging markets. However, those flows reversed in September as the growth scare impacted risk appetite. This was somewhat offset by the return of volatility in foreign exchange markets. The economic divergence between the U.S. and most of the rest of the world also led to strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the second half of the third quarter. These factors along with heightened risk erosion and an increase in currency market volatility boosted both volumes and FX trading revenues in the third quarter of 2014.", "Now, I\u2019d like to talk about the growth of our asset servicing and asset management business. Our third quarter 2014 new asset servicing wins totaled approximately $302 billion, representing a range of clients and sectors. 38% of those assets were from outside the U.S. Also included in the new business were 32 new alternative asset servicing mandates. New assets to be serviced that remain to be installed in future periods totaled $250 billion at quarter-end and our current pipeline continued strong.", "In our asset management business, we experienced net inflows of $3 billion for the third quarter. The flows were driven by net inflows of $7 billion into EPS and $1 billion into cash [bonds] partially offset by net outflows of $5 billion from largely passive fixed-income institutional mandates.", "Our success in new business commitments across our franchise reflects our efforts to develop continued focus solutions to a continuous innovation. Given our client focus and ability to differentiate our offerings, we expect to build on our new business momentum for the rest of the year.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Mike who will review our financial performance for the quarter and outlook for the balance of the year.", "Mike Bell", "Thank you, Jay. Good morning everyone. Before I begin my review of our operating basis results, I'd like to comment regarding the $70 million pre-tax or $53 million after-tax non-operating charge recorded in the third quarter.", "This charge reflects our intention to seek to resolve some, but not all of the outstanding and potential claims arising out of our indirect FX client activities. This charge pertains to indirect FX [spenders] which we disclosed over the past few years. It is important to understand that we do not currently intend to seek to negotiate settlements with respect to all outstanding and potential claims.", "In addition, our current efforts, even if successful will address only a portion of our potential material legal exposure arising out of our indirect FX client activities. As I\u2019m sure you can appreciate, settlement discussions are confidential and we\u2019re not able to make more specific comments on those matters at this point.", "Now turning to slide 9 and note that we\u2019re pleased with our year-to-date 2014 EPS, which has increased approximately 10% relative to 2013. Year-to-date 2014 core servicing and management fee revenue increased approximately 8% compared to the same period in 2013, benefiting for both higher equity markets and net new business. As a result of the strong fee growth, year-to-date 2014 total revenue increased approximately 5% despite the downward pressure on net interest revenue from low market interest rates.", "Third quarter 2014 EPS was $1.35 per share, down from second quarter, but up from third quarter of \u201813. The decrease in EPS from second quarter primarily reflects lower revenue related to securities finance seasonality and a higher tax rate this quarter partially offset by the benefit of our share repurchase program. Compared to the third quarter of 2013, EPS increased primarily due to strong growth in our core servicing and management fees, as well as the benefit of our share repurchase program.", "Total revenue increased slightly from second quarter even with the seasonal decline in securities finance revenue and increased 8.5% from the third quarter of 2013. Overall, expenses were well controlled in the third quarter, although the result included the benefit from the U.S. dollar relative to second quarter of 2014. The third quarter 2014 operating basis effective tax rate was 31%. We currently expect the full year 2014 operating basis effective tax rate to be in the range of 30% to 31% which implies an expected fourth quarter 2014 rate of approximately 32%.", "Now, I\u2019ll discuss additional details regarding our operating basis quarterly revenue as outlined on slide 12. Unless otherwise noted, my comments here will focus on the comparison of third quarter 2014 to third quarter 2013. I believe this is more relevant since the sequential quarter comparison includes the effects of the seasonal pattern in securities finance.", "Importantly, servicing fees continue to perform well, up approximately 8% year-over-year. This reflects stronger global equity markets and net new business. Third quarter 2014 asset management fees increased 14.5% from third quarter of last year, primarily due to stronger global equity markets, net new business and higher performance fees. Money market fee waivers were $11 million in third quarter 2014 which was relatively flat.", "Trading services revenue increased 5%, reflecting the continued success in our foreign exchange trading which generated higher revenue as a result of increased volumes, partially offset by lower volatility. Securities finance revenue increased approximately 34%, primarily due to higher volumes in both our enhanced custody and agency businesses.", "Processing fees and other revenue increased from a year ago, primarily due to higher revenue associated with our tax advantaged investments and other fees partially offset by some valuation adjustments. Our net interest revenue also increased from third quarter of last year, benefiting from a higher level of interest earning assets. I would note that the third quarter 2014 net interest revenue also included a $5 million benefit from the prepayment of a corporate bond. Net interest revenue and net interest margin continue to be pressured from the persistent low interest rate environment and the reinvestment of the portfolio in the high quality liquid assets to meet the new liquidity requirements.", "Many of you\u2019ve had questions regarding the European Central Bank lowering the overnight deposit rate to negative 20 basis points and the related impact on a deposit pricing. As market interest rates have continued to drift lower, we\u2019ve notified our clients on potential for us to charge negative rates or fees on all balances. And as Jay described, our plan is to begin charging for negative rates later this quarter.", "Based upon our current assessment of market conditions, we expect operating basis net interest revenue for 2014 to be near the high-end of the $2.25 billion to $2.28 billion range that we previously communicated on our second quarter conference call. This estimate reflects a decline in net interest revenue relative to the third quarter of 2014 actual result, due to the impact of lower market interest rates and the impact of increasing our HQLA to comply with liquidity requirements. It also incorporates our estimated impact of the unfavorable interest rate environment in Europe.", "Now moving to slide 13, I\u2019ll provide some comments on operating basis expenses. Compared to third quarter of 2013, our total operating expenses increased approximately 7% primarily reflecting new business support, higher regulatory compliance costs higher transaction, processing and occupancy expenses. In addition, third quarter 2013 expenses included the impact of lower employee benefit expenses, resulting from plan changes, and a $30 million benefit related to Lehman Brothers related gains and recoveries.", "Compared to second quarter of 2014, our total third quarter operating expenses benefited by approximately $16 million, due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Third quarter 2014 compensation employee benefits expenses decreased from second quarter, primarily due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and lower incentive compensation costs. Additionally, third quarter 2014 includes a $4 million credit related to our pension adjustment.", "Transaction and processing expenses were higher than second quarter, primarily due to higher equity values and higher servicing volumes. Occupancy expenses of a $119 million, increased 3.5% compared to second quarter, due to a one time recovery of $5 million last quarter.", "Third quarter 2014 other expenses included a $20 million contribution to our charitable foundation partially offset by a $15 million insurance related recovery. In addition, third quarter 2014 other expenses were lower due to some delays of external consulting expenses, which we now expect will be spent in fourth quarter of 2014.", "Now, I\u2019ll provide comments on our September 30th balance sheet. As you can see on slide 14, our overall approach to managing our investment portfolio has evolved to reflect the impact of complying with emerging liquidity roles which is most evident in an $8 billion of U.S. treasuries that we purchased in third quarter of 2014.", "We intend to be in full compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio requirements by January 1, 2015. Our interest rate risk position also reflects the impacts of our actions to comply with the LCR roles and we remain comfortable with this risk position.", "Additionally, the after tax unrealized mark-to-market gain as of September 30, was $411 million which is lower than June 30th due to a modest increase in market interest rates partially offset by an improvement from narrowing spreads.", "Now turning to slide 15 to review our capital position. Our capital position remained strong and that strength has enabled us to deliver on our key priority of returning value to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. As of September 30 of 2014, our holding company Tier 1 common ratio under the current Basel III advanced approach was 12.7%. Under the Basel III standardize approach, which will not go into effect until 2015, our holding company estimated pro forma Tier 1 common ratio was approximately 10.9%. We estimate that our Basel III supplementary leverage ratios under our interpretation of the final U.S. rules are approximately 5.7% at the holding company and approximately 5.4% at the bank as of September 30, 2014.", "Generally speaking, our capital ratios were lower in third quarter of 2014 versus second quarter. The main contributors to the decline were a larger average balance sheet driven in part by higher levels of client deposits and the reduction in common equity from the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar following through foreign currency translation.", "Now as I mentioned, returning capital to shareholders continues to be a top priority. During the third quarter of 2014, we purchased approximately 5.8 million shares of our common stocks at a total cost of approximately $410 million resulting in average fully diluted common shares outstanding of approximately $430 million for the quarter.", "As of September 30, 2014, we had approximately $880 million remaining on our current common stock purchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $1.7 billion of our common stock through March 31, 2015.", "So by way of summary, third quarter 2014 results were driven by the strength of our core servicing and management fees and positive momentum in creating services. Core servicing and management fees grew 8% compared to year-to-date 2013 which demonstrates our success in the market. In spite the headwinds on our net interest revenue; we're well positioned to achieve our full year 2014 operating basis revenue growth target of 3% to 5%.", "On the expense front, we continue to feel pressure from higher regulatory expectations. And in addition, we continue to believe that our common stock repurchase program combined with dividends is the best way to return value to shareholders.", "So prior to wrapping up, I thought I\u2019ll address a question that is likely to be on investors and the analysts minds and that is, what is our outlook for fourth quarter 2014? Fourth quarter revenue performance could be impacted by overall market conditions in the quarter. In addition as I mentioned earlier, we expect fourth quarter net interest revenue to decrease relative to the third quarter 2014 results. We currently expect fourth quarter 2014 expenses to be higher due to the continued upward pressure on our regulatory-related costs and the delayed timing of some expenses from third quarter. Nevertheless, our goal is to generate positive operating leverage for the full year 2014, although the fourth quarter market conditions pose risk that are not completely in our direct control.", "And with that, I'll turn the call back to Jay.", "Jay Hooley", "Thanks Mike. And Stephanie, we're now -- Mike and I are now available to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Thanks. Good morning guys.", "Jay Hooley", "Good morning.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Just wondering if you could talk about the two core fee businesses in a little bit more depth, and services first, you had a modest growth and I am just wondering if you can help us understand the impact of FX and also just the commentary on the transaction activity this quarter versus last?", "Jay Hooley", "Yes. Let me start that Ken and Mike will pick it up. As far as core services I\u2019d start with the custody service fee base, which was up nicely year-over-year, up a little bit quarter-to-quarter. A reflection in order to priority the markets and we continue to see stronger business growth. We posted $2 billion of new committed business this quarter; there is 250 still to install. So we\u2019ve had a couple of nice quarters of good momentum in the marketplace.", "Let me just bridge into foreign exchange, which was another positive performer in the quarter. So, a few things, the volumes and volatility were helper in the third quarter. And I would say, volumes consistently, volatility really moving from front to back of quarter improved September in particular given the things that I noted. I\u2019d also broaden it out to say that foreign exchange is a pretty wide variety of service capabilities which we provide both to our custody customers, as well as our non-custody customers. And we continue to see good momentum in I would say generally the electronic trading part of foreign exchange, FX Connect and more recently 3FX, which is the hourly priced against an index. And even more recently in September, we introduced a new FX vehicle called TruCross, which is designed to allow those who don't want to trade against the WM fix to -- basically it's a trading platform buy side to buy side.", "So, I would say, market environment was good particularly towards the end of the quarter and generally volumes were pretty consistent across all platforms. Mike, I don't know you want to add.", "Mike Bell", "Yes. Ken, just add a couple of other facts just to support your quarter-over-quarter analysis. So relative to second quarter, the stronger U.S. dollar depressed our service fees by $10 million. So, if you\u2019ve done it on a constant currency basis rather than 1.302, it would be 1.312, if you used constant currency. In addition, the transaction revenue was down $4 million sequentially. Obviously we've got a little bit of help from market, so there were pretty sideways if you include Europe. So, as you can see, the underlying net new business revenue was very helpful in the core GS business here in Q3.", "As it relates to management fees, as I said in my prepared remarks, the main benefit that we got there relative to second quarter is a combination of positive net new business as well as our performance fees; there the FX impact was negative two from a sequential standpoint. And in grand total for our revenue, so inclusive of $12 million I just talked about, FX hurt revenue by approximately $21 million relative to Q2 and had a little bit less from that impact on the expenses Q2 to Q3.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Okay, great. And my second question is just to your commentary on the push out in some of those consulting costs into the fourth quarter. Can you help us understand what didn\u2019t get spend this quarter and the type of magnitude that you\u2019re talking about from a third quarter to fourth quarter overall increase in expenses?", "Mike Bell", "Sure, absolutely Ken. So this mainly relates Ken to the timing of our regulatory compliance spending, so it\u2019s mainly outside consultants. And so basically where we expected to spend on outside consultancy in Q3, we expect that now still to be spent, but delayed into Q4. And I would range that in the call it $10 million to $15 million kind of range.", "Now I\u2019d emphasize the operating expenses category as I talked about in the past, could be pretty lumpy, because we can add some, for example some legal costs in there and even the outside consulting spend tends to be pretty lumpy. But that was what I was referencing.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Okay, got it. So overall expenses, you are still -- and sometimes you typically have like a true up maybe on the comp side. But are you trying to also say that you expect overall expenses then to be distinctly higher in the fourth or just that portion of it?", "Mike Bell", "No, we do expect it to be distinctly higher, so the guidance that I had given at Q2 where we thought that Q3 would be 20 million higher than Q2 and Q4 would be 20 million higher than Q2, in aggregate there really has not been a change in our expense view other than number one with the stronger U.S. dollar, we got $16 million benefit in expenses in Q3. Obviously the Q4 benefit, if U.S. dollar continues to be strong will be what it\u2019ll be relative to Q2, but the currency helped the expense of $16 million in Q3. And then as I said, the timing between the two quarters will reflect the delay in the spending that I just mentioned.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Understood. Thanks Mike.", "Operator", "Your next quarter comes from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.", "Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse", "Good morning guys.", "Jay Hooley", "Good morning.", "Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse", "Mike, just hoping you could flash out where you stand on LCR today and just your latest thoughts around preferred issuance?", "Mike Bell", "Sure. Good morning Ashley. Regarding LCR, as we\u2019ve talked about previously, we do expect to fully be in compliance by year-end with the Fed's expectations. And we estimate that if we calculated that LCR as of September 30th, we would be in excess of the 80%.", "Now, I would tell you that following up on a question you asked me last quarter Ashley, the final Fed expectations regarding the actual calculation of operational deposits is not entirely clear. It's sort of slowly getting clear but not entirely clear. And that\u2019s as a result, following up on the question you asked me last quarter, at some point, we need to firm up the overall impact on our NIR. I would expect it to be modestly higher impact than what we had communicated previously but we\u2019ll have some more information on that in 2015.", "And as it relates to the preps, first of all, no change in that for the risk based capital ratios; we would ultimately want to get to 1.5% at a minimum of our overall capital structure being prep. So that would equate to approximately $1.8 billion. So that means we need another $500 million at some point relative to the balance of preps that we have currently.", "So just looking at the risk based ratios, no change in our expectations. The wildcard continues to be, Ashley, around compliance with the supplementary leverage ratio. And since at this point, it still looks like the supplementary leverage ratio will likely be our binding constraint. I would say it is likely we will go beyond the $1.8 billion that I just referenced and ultimately issue more press than that. Again at this point, I wouldn\u2019t give an updated number or an update on timing, but that continues to be our thinking.", "Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse", "Great. Thanks for the color there. And then just on the current reinvestment environment, I appreciate the guidance for this year. But just maybe a sense around what the reinvesting deals are in the U.S. versus Europe? And then any thoughts on what a flatter yield curve means for you in net interest revenue sensitivity would be appreciated?", "Mike Bell", "Sure. Well, as you can imagine, it\u2019s a little early to talk about 2015 because there are so many different moving parts going on there. Obviously, if we got to a flatter yield curve by an increase in short-term interest rates, we would view that as a very positive thing, particularly given that we\u2019ve got about half of our portfolio is invested in floating rate securities. So, an increase in short-term rates will be very helpful.", "I would also reiterate that we will particularly benefit from the first call it 50 basis point increase in -- the first 25 basis point of increase in short-term rates would likely accrue very heavily to our benefit, but even the second 25 basis point increase would also help us. So, if we get to a flat yield curve by raising the short-term rates that would be a very good thing.", "As it relates to Q4, we\u2019ve got some obvious headwinds. We\u2019ve got first of all, Q4 you don\u2019t want to back out the $5 million benefit we got in Q3 from the prepayment on that corporate bond, so I would do that right off the top. But then we\u2019ve got three other items that are driving down our expectations for NIR in fourth quarter. They are; number one, Europe, as you just mentioned, the market interest rates in Europe have dropped between 20 and 25 basis points at the short-end over the last five months. The [ECB] has obviously cut the rate from zero now to minus 20 in that same period.", "So, as Jay talked about, we're working to pass along that cost to our clients. So, but that will still be a headwind for Q4. In addition, we have now higher level of HQLA that's going to be a drag because we're obviously not doing any spread on the HQLA. And then third is just a normal grind as the portfolio matures and rolls off. So, as a result of all those things, we expect Q4 to be lower than Q3 from an NIR perspective. I think it's too early to try to speculate on 2015.", "Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse", "Great. Thanks for all the details there, Mike.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI.", "Glenn Schorr - ISI", "Just ISI. Thank you.", "Jay Hooley", "Excellent.", "Glenn Schorr - ISI", "And I don't have a [bow] either. So, just one point Mike on the clarification of the 4Q costs, in a standing steady state world, currency neutral fourth quarter from third quarter. We might add back that $16 million benefit on currency, the $10 million to $15 million catch up on the delayed consulting cost and then another $20 million on top for what was already planned on the consulting cost. I just want to make sure that I have that right?", "Mike Bell", "Yes that's fair, Glenn. I mean that probably puts more precision on it than it is warranted because again some of those other operating expenses are pretty lumpy. But directionally you are thinking about it just fine.", "Glenn Schorr - ISI", "Okay. And then on the regulatory question, we think of them as having a big seasonal component, because basically June through December is hot and heavy, or is this annual run rate thought process? In other words, should we get a benefit in first quarter as CCAR\u2019s done and you take a breath?", "Mike Bell", "Yes. Unfortunately Glenn, I mean there are a lot of moving parts to answer your question. You're certainly right that I would expect CCAR specific cost particularly outside consulting expenses to decline in Q1 of \u201815. But unfortunately, CCAR is just part of a wide horizon of regulatory expectation. So, I think it\u2019s a little early to speculate on Q1 2015 or even full year 2015 regulatory compliance costs; we\u2019re in the midst of the budget process as we speak.", "Again, a lot of moving parts, just to sort of give you a flavor for it, first of all I said before, we\u2019re seeing regulatory expenses, excuse me, regulatory expectations be higher in a number of different areas, not just CCAR. So that\u2019s putting some upward pressure on expenses. On the other hand, we do expect over the course of 2015 to be able to reduce our reliance on outside consulting expenses and ultimately replace that more with full time employees. So we expect to get some cost arbitrage there. So again, a little early to try to conclude on 2015 at this point.", "Glenn Schorr - ISI", "Okay. And then maybe just a very high level thought because it\u2019s so new. CCAR stress test came out last night. And I would just say particular to you guys balance sheet\u2019s grown 27%, it\u2019s help to offset some of the NIM compression. But the test specifically has wider credit spreads and a flatter curve relative to last year. Is this just a little bit worse, is a lot worse? I\u2019m just trying to get your gut reaction given the importance of that part of the test for you guys.", "Mike Bell", "Glenn, obviously we've had less than 24 hours to fully digest it and to run it through our models and such. But I would characterize it as modestly worse than last years, but again with the caveat that I am sure there will be some other devils in the details. But particularly the fact that the equity market decline would be higher than last year would be a particular area given our concentration in terms of our clients on equity assets.", "Glenn Schorr - ISI", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs", "Hey guys, good morning.", "Jay Hooley", "Good morning.", "Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs", "So, a bigger picture question I guess when we think about State Street\u2019s exposure to Europe. You guys clearly have significant business there and there is number. There is not a place as obviously where it hits the P&L, both on the NIR side with respect to securities rolling over but also as you kind of translate from euros to the dollar. As we think about the enterprise as a whole, strengthening dollar I am assuming is not a great thing but maybe you can flush that out a little bit more and give us a sense of from a pre-tax dollar perspective what the sensitivity could be?", "Jay Hooley", "Let me start that because I think it has -- there is a revenue side to that and there is an expense side. And Mike can pick up the currency effect as well as the effect potentially on the portfolio. But from a revenue side being our ability to generate servicing fees and management fees really unaffected, it\u2019s anything neutral to positive. I think if you look at our new business momentum over the past several quarters, Europe has been a little bit of a bright spot. I\u2019d even go a little deeper to say if you look at flows which is the other element of a critical element of organic flows; the offshore markets continue to perform exceptionally well, Thailand and Luxembourg where we had deep presence. So, from a standpoint of the fee revenues, I don\u2019t really see effect that the Euro zone continues to have difficulties affecting that, in fact if anything that\u2019s a little bit positive. Mike, why don\u2019t you talk about that?", "Mike Bell", "Sure. So, Alex, first from a P&L standpoint, I would characterize this as being relatively neutral to the FX changes because roughly speaking, it\u2019s not perfectly accurate, but roughly speaking, our revenue in different currencies tends to match our expense structure in different currencies. So, I would characterize this as roughly neutral out there.", "As it relates to the impact on our capital levels, we\u2019re modestly exposed, I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as material, but we\u2019re modestly exposed to the fact that we\u2019ve got some capital in non-U.S. currencies. And therefore -- and that\u2019s really weighted a little more heavily than for example the risk weighted assets in those same currencies. So as an example, what we saw at the end of third quarter was when the euro weakened so much relative to the U.S. dollar, we saw an impact on the September 30th currency translation and therefore that negatively impacted our capital ratios at Q3. Once again, I don\u2019t view that as a long-term threat, but I do view it as a source of fluctuation that can go either way quarter-to-quarter.", "Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Thanks for all that detail. And then the second question is -- and I appreciate the fact that it\u2019s still probably quite early. But as we think about NSFR and the way it could impact the broader securities lending industry. I was just hoping to get your thoughts on your business with respect to; a, your growth in enhanced custody to you think can stand where does you see a little bit of a principle business for you, but also the secondary impact and kind of what your core agency business?", "Jay Hooley", "So, let me start at Alex. Mike noted that our securities finance business this quarter was particularly healthy when you contrast it against last year\u2019s same quarter. And the growth was driven by better loan volume overall I would say of the growth. Two-thirds of it roughly was enhanced custody versus the agency business.", "So, generally good strength in the securities lending business, I don't see that abating. I think your question was to the NSFR. In our enhanced custody business, we have found ways to minimize the capital effect through netting with the counterparties that we\u2019re lending securities to, which has resulted in a pretty capital efficient trade.", "So, as we look at enhanced custody, which is a business that we see not only have seen good growth in, but we see the prospect for even increased growth. We think it can be done on a reasonably capital efficient basis. Mike would you add to that?", "Mike Bell", "Yes. Alex the only thing I would add that Jay is exactly right. The only thing I would add is that I do expect that prices will likely increase in that market particularly for those clients where we can't reach netting agreements with them. And I don't think that would be just us, I think that will be a phenomenon across the marketplace.", "So, our orally read is exactly what Jay said. We do expect this to be attractive business for us from the capital return standpoint overtime particularly with the [NIM].", "Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs", "Understood. Thank you. Thanks so much for all the color.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.", "Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein", "Good morning. Just following up Alex\u2019s question, I was curious if you could elaborate on it appears to be a little bit of improvement in securities lending, you seem to think that\u2019s maybe a little bit durable. But perhaps you could address what you\u2019re seeing in terms of structural changes since the crisis, what types of splits you\u2019re getting with client, the level of participation programs and the demand for activity related to collateral versus special lending?", "Jay Hooley", "Let me start that again Luke. If I take it up and broaden it, the participation securities lending from a customer standpoint has been stable to maybe slightly up. So, we\u2019ve come through a long cycle over the past six years of people leaving the program then rejoining the program. And that\u2019s been pretty stable if not say anything it\u2019s a plus some adds.", "If you look at the -- now the other thing you\u2019d look at would be unknown balances which have been over the past couple of quarters running at about $350 billion plus or minus. Within that the loan growth has been good and the attractiveness of spread is particularly driven by merger and acquisition activity driving specials. Again has been a positive in the last couple of quarters.", "You asked about structural changes, the one that comes to my -- most to me is this decrease in leverage that the banks are going through. And as a result, we\u2019ve seen the prime brokers be a little bit more selective about lending, which has really opened the window for that enhanced custody business that we frequently talk about. So, I would say if you look at sustainability, durability of trends that are going on, you can make your own judgment about whether the M&A activity will continue to be robust. But other than that, I think I would say it looks pretty durable from the standpoint of trend.", "Mike Bell", "Yes, Luke. It's Mike. The only thing that I would add is just thinking about it from a quarter-to-quarter perspective, first of all with the bad news and then with the good news. On the bad news side, Q1 was pretty difficult, spreads were tight. But as Jay said, we saw with the dividend arm season spreads and volumes pick up in Q2; in Q3 the volumes and spreads were attractive for example relative to a year ago. And again we attribute that primarily to higher M&A volume, higher IPO volume, and again whether it's durable into the future is a little bit of a crystal ball question but we're certainly happy with the trends we've seen over the last six months.", "Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein", "Great. Really helpful. And then on the FX settlements, I think I recall a few years ago when this broke, you seemed fairly resolute that the cases that didn't have a lot of merit. And I know it's difficult to say much given that you still have a number of cases pending, but maybe hoping you could provide some detail about why you decided it was in your best interest to settle in these specific cases? And then maybe in terms of order of magnitude or just number of cases how much of this might be behind us?", "Mike Bell", "Yes, Luke. First of all, just to be clear, we're not announcing settlement on these cases but these are basically situations where we are putting up reserves based upon additional information that we have. And I would not try to speculate what percentage of the overall pie this is going to relate to in terms of the indirect FX business; I think it\u2019s way too early to try to size that.", "Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for the clarification. And then just a real quick technical question; wondering how you plan to charge for negative rates, whether you determine that will appear as a credit to NII or the fee more or is that going to just differ across other clients?", "Mike Bell", "Yes. Luke, it\u2019s likely to differ by client and differ by country, so different by a jurisdiction but I would expect at this point speculating that the vast bulk of that would show up as positive fees. But once again, more to come there.", "Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, great. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.", "Brennan Hawken - UBS", "Good morning guys. Thanks for the taking the question. First one on the balance sheet. So, we saw a pretty nice sequential increase in deposits here. How much of that was non-operating? And do you have any insight into what might have driven some of the growth given how strong it was?", "Mike Bell", "Yes Brennan, it\u2019s Mike. First of all, we expect -- we estimate that the underlying growing in our core business was about call it $2 billion to 3 billion of the growth in our overall deposits. And the remainder of the growth in the balance sheet was a combination of growth in excess deposits as well as some issuance of wholesale CDs which were an important part of our plan to comply with the LCR.", "Brennan Hawken - UBS", "Okay. And that $2 billion to $3 billion is both U.S. and international?", "Mike Bell", "That\u2019s correct. That would be a combined number.", "Brennan Hawken - UBS", "Okay, terrific. And then thinking about the delta in SLR, clearly balance sheet growth was part of the drop there, sequential 40 basis points; AOCI looked like it fell too. Were those the main drivers and could you break down the 40 basis points and what were the main allocations specifically the big factors?", "Mike Bell", "Sure Brennan. So, those are the two main pieces. The growth in the balance sheet was approximately two-thirds of the 40 basis-point decline in the SLR and the other third when you\u2019re referencing AOCI, that's mainly the currency translation adjustment that I mentioned earlier, what we saw a drop in the euro rate pretty significantly at September 30th. Again from foreign currency translation standpoint, that's calculated on a spot basis based on currency rates as of September 30. So, it had a -- the drop in the euro had a disproportionate negative impact on the value of our euro capital as it gets converted to U.S. dollars and that was about a third of the 40 basis-point decline.", "Brennan Hawken - UBS", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, good morning.", "Jay Hooley", "Good morning.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "So, just a couple of follow-ups, one on the [Altera], I just wanted to make sure I understood it will be 80% by 1/1/15 and the 100% is the next year 1/1/16. Is that accurate?", "Mike Bell", "Betsy, let me just repeat what I said earlier. We do expect to be comfortably well above the 80% at 1/1/15. We do estimate that we'd be above the 80% as of now. But we would expect to have a very comfortable margin relative to the 80% at 1/1/15.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "I just wondered because you mentioned full compliance, so I wasn\u2019t sure if that meant full compliance with the interim step or the final step so?", "Jay Hooley", "Yes. Again, I would characterize this as we\u2019re in full compliance of the 80% now, but the -- I do think at the end of the day our regulators would expect overtime for us to have a significant buffer relative to the 80% and I would expect to meet that buffer at 1150.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then on just the European deposits and the negative interest rate you\u2019re going to be charging due to the fact that ECB is charging you 20 bps. Can you give us a sense as to how you\u2019re talking about with clients? And I\u2019m wondering is there a way that some of your clients can avoid this potentially from going from euro to another currency or through getting discounts for more soft dollars or is there -- just wanted to understand how your positioning is?", "Jay Hooley", "Betsy, this is Jay. First off, 45 days ago we informed customers of our intent. I think to me the question will be, is this charge enough to cause people to deal with their excess deposits in a different way. We would expect that there will be some for those deposits and that\u2019s probably a positive thing overall for us. But I don\u2019t think it would cause customers to change investment strategies or anything that would relate to those excess deposits, I think it\u2019s just a matter of -- is the charge enough of a deterrent to keep deposits with us and therefore would they could they in some form move some of those deposits away from our balance sheet. But I think that\u2019s the extent of the impact.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Have you seen any activity to-date from when you announced you were intending to charge this? I'm wondering if people have already started to move out of euro to other currencies or you just really haven't seen much behavioral change yet?", "Jay Hooley", "We have not seen any behavioral change. And while we think about the intent, we won't start charging until later on in the quarter.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Right. Okay. And then just lastly on the preps, I know you indicated that there is another plug for us to do here at some point when market conditions -- I'm just wondering what's your sense on that kind of timing or when you'd want to get that done. You probably were thinking maybe to do it by the end of 3Q that just passed for CCAR reasons. But just like to get a sense as to how you're thinking about it given the fact that some restrictions come down so much. Is there an opportunity here?", "Jay Hooley", "Sure. And Betsy, this is something that we're looking at. At this point, I wouldn't commit to a specific timing. But I would say just to give up a high level answer, I would certainly expect within the next 12 months that we would look for a potential window to go ahead and get a $500 million, but it will depend upon market conditions, it will depend upon our outlook. So, I'd say a number of different factors to think about.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Hi. I wanted to go back to lend a little bit. Jay, how do you view the market share shifts in overall custody? On the one hand you mentioned that the strong new business growth this quarter, which is a positive. On the other hand, it looks like some smaller players in Europe wants the mandates over the past year. And even further back just a big picture question. When we look at State Street's market share almost a decade ago and adjust for your acquisitions of Goldman in 2012, Intesa in 2009, Investor\u2019s Financial in 2007. It looks like your market share on a core basis adjusting for those acquisitions would be a little bit less in overall custody, regardless of what degree of [discrete], how you think about that market share would be helpful?", "Jay Hooley", "Sure. I can\u2019t track all the numbers that you have Mike without doing a little math on my own but I would say generally we focus, we\u2019re most concerned about market share in the most attractive markets that as we view them. So, if you look at I would say, starting out broadly asset servicing -- not asset servicing, but asset management versus asset owners, so investment management versus pension funds, by our math, we have held if not gained market share over long periods of time in the asset servicing for asset managers; pension funds probably a little bit more stable. So that would be my first cut at it.", "But then I would probably go a little deeper Mike, and if you look at some other faster growing streams in the world, I\u2019d start with the alternatives, hedge, private equity, real-estate, 10 years ago we were nowhere that was in the market, today we\u2019re the market leader by quite a bit and I think are positioned to continue to grow and gain share. I\u2019d look at another fast stream; I\u2019m in the U.S. right now, primarily ETF market which is close to $2 trillion now. We have a pretty significant share of the ETF servicing marketplace, so again fast growing market where we have established early position and have grown disproportionately with the market.", "And then, I guess the third place I would go is the derivative of the asset management market, if you look at the European market where we have a deep presence. Our market share leadership in both the Irish and Luxembourg offshore markets is pretty commanding and I would say continuing to grow. So, I look at the question and I break it down as I always do to say, as you look you in your crystal ball, which of the geographies, which is the markets, and which are the products that we think have a higher growth trajectories and making sure. I think we've done a pretty good job and getting in front of those growth markets that have turned out to be pretty attractive. So, that's one cut at it.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "That's helpful. And so just going back to the core custody business away from those growth areas that you emphasized, how is competition currently compared to the past? Is it getting easier and you're gaining more business that way or is it harder or what's the rate of change?", "Jay Hooley", "I would say it never gets easier. But I think it's I would say largely unchanged. I would say and it depends a lot by market. In the U.S., there are two or three different verticals, you have mostly U.S. competitors, we all have strength and weaknesses. If you go to Europe, you'll introduce a few additional competitors. I would say Mike that over the years following the financial crisis and particularly last couple of years, pricing has seemed a little bit more stable to me; there can be a situation where somebody will throw in irresponsible place. But I would say most of us in the servicing side of the business are being a little bit more careful about and thoughtful I should say about how we price these opportunities.", "I\u2019d also say what's helped that and I know we\u2019ve done some of this, but we're not alone is particularly when you have an intermediary in the sales process, a consultant in particular. We\u2019ve been really to walk away from deals that didn\u2019t make economic sense; I\u2019ve seen others do that as well. And I think over time that can create a little bit of a firming up or bottoming of the pricing.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Are you willing to give up market share when the pricing doesn\u2019t make sense a little more often?", "Jay Hooley", "Absolutely.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.", "Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, good morning folks.", "Jay Hooley", "Good morning.", "Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but just couple of more to drill down a little bit deeper. On the -- just looking at the average balance sheet on the deposit pricing, I guess first of all, take a picture of what do you view as your level of excess deposits right now? And then in terms of the impact, if you can go into a little bit more granularity on charging for -- when you charge for deposits later in the quarter, how that\u2019s going to impact the -- just looking at the average balance sheet, the average yield on your interest bearing deposits down 5 basis points linked quarter. How you see that dynamic changing because you mentioned there will be a fee offset; and where that would come in on fees on the P&L?", "Mike Bell", "Okay. So Brian, it's Mike. First of all, on your question on excess deposits, we estimate that our excess deposits at the end of -- I\u2019m sorry not at the end of third quarter, during the average of third quarter was approximately $48 billion. And so we expect that in third quarter, we were earning a NIM on those assets, call it in the high-teens, down what we\u2019ve given in the past an estimated NIM on excess deposits of 20 basis points.", "The fact that the rates dropped in euro, the short-term interest rates dropped in euro, call it 20 to 25 basis points over the last five months mean that would push the overall NIM down to the teen\u2019s level. I would expect that there is at least the potential for the excess deposits to decline in Q4 if in fact the [rural] excess deposits that we\u2019re getting in negative rate would go somewhere else, but that's speculated I probably speculated that all year and that long as excess deposits continue to grow. So I don't know how much confidence that gives you in that estimate.", "Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank", "But then as you charge for this, assuming some of the deposits stay we should see a pick up in the net interest margin that you just outlined from the high-teens?", "Mike Bell", "I think I'm not sure that's actually the case because we're likely to pick up a partial quarter for the most part, and maybe modestly higher fee revenue as a result of charging for deposit. So, I don't think that's going to help the NIR per se. We're earning negative interest rates on the asset side of those excess deposits. And again I think the negative rate credit decline will show up likely in all likelihood of fees not improves NIR.", "Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Then [segueing] to fees, first of all would that show up in the core investment service fee line? And then secondarily, if you back out the impacts you said from both volumes and FX currency translation versus the second quarter, your fee growth is actually stronger about 2%. So, just going back into some of Jay's comments earlier about some of the risk-off, I think you were saying, Jay some of the risk-off in later September looking into fourth quarter. How should we think about that positioning in terms of your yield on those custody and the [liquid] assets?", "Mike Bell", "So Brian on your first piece again, I do think that negative credited rates on deposits in Europe would likely show up in the service fees. I mean we\u2019re talking a few million dollars I mean this is not a big ticket item. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to hugely move the needle relative to the other factors. And I\u2019m just going back to the earlier question, I wouldn\u2019t say that for the most part the improvement that we got Q2 to Q3 in global services revenues X the impact of currency and X the impact of transaction it was mainly net new business volumes. Jay wants to comment on the risk-on risk-off question.", "Jay Hooley", "Yes. I would say, picking up on my prepared remarks, Brian, there was a little bit of risk-on at the beginning of the quarter and became risk-off at the end of the quarter somewhat offset by the volatility in foreign exchange or currency markets.", "Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank", "Okay.", "Jay Hooley", "And the equity markets have come back a little bit, so it\u2019s hard to predict at this point.", "Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank", "All right, okay. No, that\u2019s helpful color. Great, thanks very much.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan", "Hi Mike. A quick question for you, on this incentive comp reduction that you had in the third quarter, was there a reversal of an accrual and if so how much?", "Mike Bell", "Yes. Vivek, there is not a reversal of an accrual in terms of incentive comp. What happens is that the way we accrue incentive comp it tends to accrue based upon our overall level of earnings I mean there are some adjustments that go into it plus and minus. But as a result of again those factors, the accrual was slightly lower. That was not a material impact in the quarter itself.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then secondly, your ABS came down pretty sharply in the quarter, while I guess treasuries went up. So that's the change going on, I'm presuming. And how much more do you need to do in that?", "Mike Bell", "So, first of all, you are right in terms of your description. We did have a major security sale in the quarter and basically reinvested the proceeds in U.S. treasuries that's all part of being LCR compliance. In terms of how much more we need to do, as I mentioned in an answer to an earlier question, the overall regulatory expectations regarding the calculation of operational deposits under the LCR requirements is still not entirely clear. So, I\u2019d rather not try to be pin down to a number, when it's a moving target at this point.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research", "You mentioned that the net interest income impact from the LCR was probably going to be a big higher than you discussed previously. So, I wonder what was in the final rules that were different from what you've been expecting.", "Mike Bell", "Yes, Geoff, it's Mike. I'd assume a number of different factors and some of it actually relates to the underlying expectations of the calculation itself as opposed to change in the rules. But as an example, we have what we view to be operational deposits from both hedge fund clients as well as private equity clients that are explicitly excluded from the regulatory definition of operational deposits. I mean we view that as unfortunate, but those are the rules. So that would be an example of something that will push up our need to hold more HQLA that we previously thought.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research", "And then my second question is on the FX trading revenues. Can you give a sense of how those were distributed over the quarter; was there a big pick up late in the quarter as (inaudible) came back or was it kind of more even throughout?", "Jay Hooley", "I would say, Geoff, this is Jay. It was slightly tilted towards the back end of the quarter, followed the volatility change throughout the quarter that I mentioned; volumes were pretty steady throughout.", "Mike Bell", "Geoff, it\u2019s Mike. I would just add the volumes have really been strong, as Jay indicated. So again, we view that as a very positive thing and also a positive sign that the investments that we\u2019ve made in our direct FX capabilities over the last several years are really paying good dividends.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research", "Right. So strong volumes were out and that kind of take it from the volatility at the end?", "Mike Bell", "Correct.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.", "Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research", "Good morning. Just a follow-up on the preferred issuance thought process around the SLR. It seems to me that if you take a balance sheet back to where it was a year ago and assume some of these excess deposits run-off, as rates eventually move higher. You add based on my back of the envelop, almost 100 basis points to SLR and then all of a sudden it\u2019s not a constraint. So as you think about meeting that at least temporary constraint with preferred, does it make sense to wait to see how the excess deposits? I just want to get a sense of how you\u2019re thinking about the additional preferred above 1.5%?", "Mike Bell", "Sure Jim, it\u2019s Mike. First, what you're describing is rational and that is part of the overall calculus in terms of the prep issuance as I was mentioning to Betsy; there are a number of different things to think about. One of those of course is what will happen to excess deposits, particularly when rates rise.", "The other piece though that you didn't mention and I feel compelled to mention is remember that by the time we get to 2018 and the SLR is fully in effect, we will have lost all of the interim credit on the intangibles. And so we estimate that that's worth about 40 basis points. So on a pro forma the 5.4 down to 5.0 for the loss of that credit on the tangibles. And then as you said, you could considerably boost it by a 100 basis points if you assumed all the excess deposits found in different home. We probably still want to have some kind of buffer off the six. So I wouldn't characterize preps as being our only lever but that would be a scenario where we might meet all the items that you mentioned and still end up with additional preps.", "Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research", "Okay. That's helpful and makes sense. And then just maybe a follow up on the NSFR, have you looked at all how that may impact the way you think; is there more liquidity you need about the LCR, or do you feel like the NSFR is at the least the way it's proposed so far is pretty manageable?", "Mike Bell", "Jim, again, as you can imagine, it's early since we don't have any final rules to evaluate. I think it would be a little bit early to say anything definitively. I think based upon our interpretation of the preliminary guidance, it would require some additional HQLA, but I think the devil will be in the details of the final rules and I wouldn't try to speculate and try to put a number on it at this point.", "Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Adam Beatty with Bank of America.", "Adam Beatty - Bank of America", "Thank you and good morning. Just one question from me today; in regards to your operating leverage target, I was just wondering given where your business sits right now and where the market conditions are? Would you need in terms of it be subject to market conditions would you need the market to revert to more of an upward trend with flat from here allowing you to achieve operating leverage, what\u2019s the color around that? Also it seems like you\u2019re somewhat confident about heading your goal in terms of revenue growth, to me that sort of points to expenses as maybe the risk around operating leverage maybe if you could just flag up the biggest risk that you see? Thanks.", "Mike Bell", "Sure. Adam, it\u2019s Mike. Again, there are number of different factors that will impact the Q4 revenue. Obviously as we talked about earlier, we were pleased with the Q3 results in particularly the strength in our core servicing and management fees and then the additional benefit that we got from the strong direct FX trading results and also the securities lending business both enhanced custody and the agency businesses, obviously we\u2019re pleased with all of that. Exactly what conditions are going to be in Q4 in all of those areas; it\u2019s too early to tell.", "Having said that, we\u2019re at 5% year-over-year revenue growth through nine months, I certainly expect that we\u2019ll [barrowing] that catastrophe meet the 3% to 5% overall revenue target. But you\u2019re absolutely right; the expenses have been a headwind for 2014 mainly the regulatory compliance costs are the main item that we had not anticipated at the beginning of the year when we were laying out our budget targets and expectations for full year.", "I think we\u2019ve actually done a pretty good job in Q3 offsetting the impact of the higher regulatory expenses by finding other savings in other areas and opportunities to redeploy staff as opposed to having it all be incremental. But I certainly would not argue with your point that expenses have been a risk factor throughout the year relative to where we started the year.", "Adam Beatty - Bank of America", "Thanks Mike. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "And your last question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC", "Thank you. Good morning guys. Mike can you share with us the duration of the bond portfolio extended out slightly this quarter to 2.1 years. What's your comfort level, how far out would you consider going?", "Mike Bell", "Sure Gerard. Well first of all, I think it's important to understand that there has been no change at our philosophy or overall approach to interest rate risk in this quarter. You are right that the duration of the portfolio increased modestly. But importantly, please realize as well that our central bank deposits increased significantly in the quarter as well. So, we ended up on average for the quarter with central bank deposits of $53 billion.", "So, when I think about the duration of the asset side of our balance sheet, I look at it as a combination of the investment portfolio with as you said, the duration of a shade over two and the central bank deposits, which have a duration obviously of zero.", "And as part of the LCR compliance, we've had increase our HQLA revenues significantly. We've done that through an increase in central bank deposits, but also an increase in U.S. treasuries. Weighted together, I don't view it as a material change relative to Q2 or Q3. And certainly there has not been a change in philosophy.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC", "Great. And then second, can you remind us; you touched a little bit on earlier in the call that you\u2019d benefit obviously from a rise in short-term rates and if the curve flattened initially, that would be positive. If we were to get a 100 basis-point rise and rates, what kind of favorable impact in net interest revenue would that be?", "Mike Bell", "Yes. Gerard, I think that\u2019s a difficult one, because it will depend upon a number of different factors, not the least of which is whether the excess deposits that we have the $40 billion of excess deposits that we had in Q3 stick around or not. We do put some sensitivities out in the 10-Q. Again those based on static client behavior. And again our own thinking Gerard is that if we did see, certainly if we saw 100 basis-point increase in short-term rates, we believe that the vast bulk if not all of the $48 billion would likely find the home somewhere else.", "So I think it\u2019d be difficult to try to quantify that. I think the way -- I\u2019d say how I think about it, I think about it as if we get a 25 basis-point increase in rates, particularly short-term rates, I think we will get a benefit on the asset side of the equation, particularly the half of the portfolio that is affording rate portfolio, we\u2019d expect this would get the bulk of the 25 basis-point benefit on that half. On the half that\u2019s fixed investment rate will get that over time as the portfolio rolls over. And with rates of essentially forward in so many jurisdictions, we wouldn\u2019t expect much move in the liability side.", "And then as we\u2019ve talked about the second 25 basis points, it\u2019s a little more shared between us in our clients and then it\u2019s different beyond that. But overall, I would characterize this as a net item, but not one that I would try to quantify at this point beyond what we put out in the Q.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC", "Great, thank you very much.", "Jay Hooley", "Stephanie, I want to thank you and thank everybody else for joining us today on the call.

And good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results reflect strength across asset servicing and asset management businesses. Despite the low interest rate environment in 2014, our revenue experienced solid growth compared to 2013 from both asset servicing and asset management. As a result, operating basis total fee revenue for 2014 exceeded 2013 by 7.4%. Our focus on developing and delivering solutions to serve client's evolving need continues to position us well against strong global growth trend. As a result of this, we achieve new asset servicing commitment in 2014 of $1.1 trillion including approximately $400 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. And net new assets to be managed of $28 billion including $7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014.", "We are pleased that we have successfully completed our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation program on schedule and at the high end of our guided range. I want to acknowledge the efforts of the entire State Street team for helping us complete this important initiative. Going forward, managing our expenses and continuing to drive efficiencies across the organization remain a priority despite continued pressure on regulatory costs.", "Now I'd like to provide a brief overview of economic and market developments and how our business is affected. U.S. equity market end of the fourth quarter on a robust footing. But that thinly disguise the fact the quarter was characterized by greater uncertainty. US economic news continues to surprise to the upside but the collapse in commodity prices fuel fears of our growth outside of the U.S. This prompted significant moves in commodity- linked assets from the currencies of commodity exporters such as the Russian ruble to asset such as high-yield corporate bonds of energy producers here in the United States. We are only just beginning to observe the economic implications of those commodities swings. We believe they will exacerbate the downward pressure on already falling global inflation rate and impact expectations of movements in monetary policy. ", "Long-term bond yields fell considerably to reflect this. The decrease in long-term bond yield was most notable in the Eurozone. In September, the ECB cut its administered rate to ward-off the risk of deflation. In light of that decision we began charging clients for euro deposits on December 1st. However, now that lower oil prices have increased the risk of deflation, the ECB has finally responded with the full scale quantitative easing of a scale similar to that seen in the U.S. and the UK. The Bank of Canada reduces its administered rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday citing the impact of low oil prices on its economy and the outlook translation. The loonie dropped in reaction to this surprise move. The bigger surprise was the Swiss national banks last week. With their removal of the cap on the Swiss Franc and increased the negative rate being charged for deposits. Our FX business was not impacted adversely by the dramatic move in the Swiss Franc post the announcement. And all of our businesses have been working with clients as they manage the impact of this market disruption. ", "While our deposit basis Swiss Franc is much lower than it is for other major currencies, we do plan to communicate with clients that deposit pricing may have to be adjusted for Swiss Franc deposits. The Fed by the forecast of the FOMC members themselves at the December meeting is still projecting a tightening a monetary policy in 2015. Nevertheless, rapidly fall in U.S. inflation is creating a good deal of market uncertainty as to whether such hikes will actually materialize and has contributed too much lower U.S. long-term yield. These lower yields have resulted in the significant increase in mortgage applications in the U.S. which could result in a spike in mortgage prepayment as homeowners refinance to take advantage of low long-term yields. Monetary policy is still projected to diverge in 2015 across the G7, but that's now predicated more on continued easing in the Eurozone and Japan. Together these economic divergences and uncertainties have resulted in a greater fragility in financial market trends in the fourth quarter of 2014 and into the beginning of 2015. ", "Together, these trends impact our business lines in several ways including, first, global growth downgrades and disinflation risks means the low interest rate environment could be protracted. This continues to negatively impact our net interest revenue and net interest margin as high yielding investments mature pay down were experienced prepayment and then those funds are reinvested at low yielding investments currently available in the market. We also continue to experience high levels of deposits. And for liquidity reasons maintained those as we view as access with central bank. However, in Europe, after we began to charge negative rates on certain euro deposits, we saw euro deposits run off by an average of US $5 billion from September 30, 2014. Second, the uncertainties around certain global economies have caused some flows out of emerging markets towards the end of the fourth quarter. Emerging market flows would adversely impact our servicing fees. This was offset by continued volatility and elevated volume and foreign exchange markets in the fourth quarter, which positively impacts us our trading servicing revenue. ", "And finally, reduced values in securities market especially equities and the strength in the U.S. dollar have a direct impact on our investment servicing and asset management businesses. Later in this call, we'll be walking you through our 2015 outlook and our assumptions around equity market and foreign exchange rate. Our 2015 revenue while look assumes stronger global equity market valuation. And for the U.S. dollar do not strengthening any further than it already has in 2015. ", "Now, I'd like to talk about the growth in our asset servicing and asset management business. Our 2014 new asset servicing wins total over $1.1 trillion including approximately $400 billion in the fourth quarter, representing broad participation globally as well as across multiple sectors. 37% of the assets for 2015 were from outside the U.S. New assets to be serviced that remain to be installed in future period, totaled $406 billion at yearend and we continue to see deep and diverse pipelines. ", "In our asset management business, we experienced net inflows of $7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2014. The flows were driven by net inflows of $36 billion into EPS, offset by net outflows of $9 billion in cash funds and $20 billion from institutional funds which was driven primarily led by rebalancing by a client based in Asia Pacific out of fixed income. Our success in new business commitments across our franchise reflects our efforts to develop client focused solutions through continuous innovation. Given our client focus and ability to differentiate our offering, we expect to build on a new business momentum for 2015 and beyond. ", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike, who will review our financial performance for the quarter as well as our outlook for 20145. Mike? ", "Mike Bell", "Thank you, Jay. And good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our operating basis results, I'd like to comment on two non-operating charges included in our fourth quarter GAAP basis results. First, we recorded an after- tax charge of $40 million, or $0.10 a share, to increase our legal accrual associated with indirect foreign exchange matters. This charge pertains to indirect FX matters that we disclosed over the past few years, and it reflects our intention to seek resolve some but not all of the outstanding and potential claims arising out of our indirect FX activities. Our current efforts even if successful, will not address all of our potential material legal exposure arising out of these activities. As I am sure you can appreciate settlement discussions are confidential, and we are not able to make more specific comments on these matters at this point. ", "Second, we record an after-tax charge of $27 million, or $0.06 a share in restructuring cost related to the completion of the Business Ops and IT Transformation program, which we completed this quarter as planned. Overall, we are pleased with the success of this program. ", "Now please turn to Page 9 of the slide presentation, I will provide a brief overview of full year and fourth quarter 2014 operating basis results. Full year 2014 EPS increased over 12% from the prior year, driven by strong fee revenue growth and the continued execution of our common stock repurchase program. Full year 2014 total fee growth of 7.4% offset a persistent low interest rate environment which negatively impacted net interest revenue. For full year 2014, in the face of increasing and significant regulatory compliance cost, we achieved slightly positive operating leverage. 2014 ROE of 10.9% increased from 10.3% in 2013. ", "Turning to 4Q, '14 results. EPS increased 19% from 4Q, '13, driven by strong fee revenue growth and improved tax rate and a reduction in the number of outstanding shares, partially offset by lower net interest revenue and higher expenses. 4Q, '14 operating basis effective tax rate of 28.5% decreased from a year ago and from third quarter 2014. Our 4Q, 2014 ROE of 11.6% increased from both fourth quarter of 2013 and third quarter of 2014. ", "Now turn to Slide 12. I'll provide additional details on our operating basis revenue 4Q, '14 and notable variances to 4Q, '13 and 3Q, '14. There were notable items in 4Q, '14. The impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, negatively affected our fee revenue by $37 million when compared to third quarter of '14. In addition, processing fees and other revenue benefited from incremental equity earnings from joint ventures of $11 million, and net interest revenue included the benefit of one time accelerated loan prepayment of $9 million. Importantly, fee revenue increased 10.6% from 4Q, '13 driven by growth in all fee lines.", "Servicing fees were up from 4Q, '13 primarily due to net new business and stronger U.S. equity market, partially offset by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Servicing fees in 4Q, '14 were down slightly from 3Q, '14 due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar which negatively impacted servicing fees by $15 million. The currency impact was mostly offset by net new business and higher transaction driven revenue.", "Asset management fees in 4Q, '14 increased from 4Q, '13 primarily due to net new business and stronger U.S. equity markets partially offset by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Compared to 3Q, '14, management fees decreased primarily due to a $5 million impact from the stronger U.S. dollar, lower performance fees and weaker global equity markets. Total trading service revenue in 4Q,'14 increased 24% compared to the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting increased foreign exchange revenue driven by higher volatility and volumes. ", "Securities finance revenue increased approximately 40% compared to 4Q, '13 due to higher spreads and volumes and new business and enhanced custody. ", "Processing fees and other revenue also increased approximately 40% from 4Q, '13 primarily due to higher equity earnings from joint ventures, and increased revenue associated with tax advantaged investments. Net interest revenue decreased from 4Q, '13 and excluding the one time repayment noted on slide 12, the net interest revenue was approximately flat with 4Q, '13 primarily to due lower yields offset by higher interest earnings assets. ", "Now many of you have had questions regarding the impact of charging negative rates of fees on euro deposit balances. In December, we began to charge negative rates on certain euro balances. The primary impact of our action has been a decrease of approximately $5 billion in U.S. dollar equivalent of average euro deposits in fourth quarter relative to 3Q, '14. ", "Moving to Slide 13. Let's review 4Q, '14 operating basis expense. As you can see on the top of the slide there were some notable expense items affecting 4Q, '14 results. The stronger U.S. dollar benefited 4Q, '14 expenses by $33 million when compared to 3Q,'14. This was more than offset by a combination of elevated securities processing cost of $29 million, and $17 million charge related to our withdrawal from the over the counter derivatives clearing and execution activities. In addition, we recorded a $9 million impairment primarily associated with an intangible asset. ", "4Q, '14 compensation and employee benefit expenses of $962 million, increased from 4Q, '13 primarily due to increased cost to support new business and regulatory compliance initiatives as well as higher incentive comp expense partially offset by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. ", "Information systems and communication expenses increased from a year ago. 4Q, '14 information systems and communication expenses included $6 million related to our withdrawal from the over the counter derivatives, clearing and execution activities. Transaction processing expenses were higher than 4Q, '13 primarily due to higher servicing volumes. Occupancy expenses decreased 4Q, '13 primarily due to the effect of an $8 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2013 associated with the sublease renegotiation. Compared to 4Q of 2013, other expenses increased primarily due to higher professional services, primarily related to regulatory compliances initiatives. Cost associated with our withdrawal from the over the counter derivatives, clearing and execution activities in the fourth quarter of 2014. $9 million impairment primarily associated with an intangible asset and $28 million of Lehman Brothers - related gains recoveries recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013. ", "Compared to 3Q, '14, other expenses increased primarily due to higher securities processing cost, higher professional service fees primarily related to regulatory compliance initiatives, cost associated with our withdrawal from over the counter derivatives, clearing and execution activities in fourth quarter of 2014. And impairment primarily associated with an intangible asset.", "Now I'll provide a brief overview our December 31, 2014 balance sheet on Slide 14. Our balance sheet continues to evolve as we respond to regulatory changes including the liquidity rules. Our estimated liquidity coverage ratio is above a 100% as of yearend of 2014. The investment portfolio maintained a high credit quality profile and our duration was in line with the prior quarter. ", "Lastly, the after-tax unrealized mark-to-market gain as of December 31, 2014 was $487 million, which improve from September 30, primarily due to the decline in interest rate partially offset by wider credit spreads. ", "Now turn to Slide 15 to review our capital position. As you can see our capital position is strong. Its strength has enabled us to accomplish a top priority of returning value to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. As of yearend 2014, our holding company common equity Tier 1 ratio under the current Basel III advanced approach was 12.5%. Under the Basel III standardize approach, which will go into effect in reporting period beginning in 2015; our holding company estimated pro forma common equity Tier 1 ratio was approximately 10.8%. Under the fully phased in advanced and standardized approaches, our estimated pro forma common equity Tier 1 ratios were approximately 11.6% and 10% respectively. ", "We estimate that our supplementary leveraged ratios under our interpretation of the final U.S. rules are approximately 5.7% of the holding company and approximately 5.1% of the bank as of yearend 2014. Based on our estimate of the pro forma fully phased in supplementary leverage ratios as of yearend 2014, they were approximately 5.2% for the holding company and approximately 4.8% for the bank. We are comfortable we have the levers that will enable us to be in compliance with requirements in advanced of the 2018 effective date. ", "On December 9, the Federal Reserve released a notice of proposed rule making to establish capital surcharges for U.S. globally systematically important banks. Our prior proposed surcharge of 1% may increase under the Federal Reserve proposal to 1.5%. This will depend upon the final rules particularly the treatment of non operational deposits. Returning capital to shareholders continues to be a top priority. During 4Q, '14, we repurchased approximately 5.6 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of approximately $410 million, resulting in average fully diluted common shares outstanding of approximately $424 million this quarter.", "As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $470 million remaining on our current common stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchases up to $1.7 billion of our common stock through March 31, 2015. ", "So to summarize, our 2014 operating basis financial performance, we are pleased with the fee revenue growth of 7.4% and proud of our EPS growth of 12%. ", "Now let's turn to our outlook for 2015 on Slide 17 through 20. We plan to continue to focus on key priorities of delivering value added solutions to our clients, investing in growth initiatives, diligently managing expenses and returning capital to shareholders. Beginning with revenue outlook, we currently expect total operating basis fee revenue to increase 4% to 7% compared to full year 2014 as shown on slide 17. Our fee growth expectations are depended upon a number of assumptions including those for equity markets and foreign exchange rates which are summarized on slide 17. I would note that we project that the stronger U.S. dollar would reduce operating basis to 2015 fee revenue by approximately $200 million assuming constant currency rate relative to 2014. This $200 million headwind is built in to our 4% to 7% operating basis fee growth forecast. ", "We further expect that the stronger U.S. dollar would provide an operating basis expense benefit that is only modestly less than the detriment to fee revenue, using the same constant currency rate assumptions relative to 2014. As a result, we believe we largely have a natural currency hedge relative to fee revenue. We expect our operating basis tax rate to increase to 30% to 32% in 2015 as compared to 29% in 2014, due both to the non recurrence of certain tax savings realized in 2014 and to an increase in state and local taxes. ", "Slide 18, summarizes two scenarios for our 2015 net interest revenue, which we expect to be pressured in 2015 from the persistent low interest rate environment and reinvestment of the investment portfolio in the high quality liquid assets to meet the new liquidity requirements. The first scenario assumes interest rate remain static with 2014 yearend levels. Under this scenario, we expect operating basis net interest revenue for 2015 to be in the range of $2.07 billion to $2.17 billion. The second scenario assumes administered interest rate will increase in 25 basis point increment per quarter beginning in August of 2015 for the UK, and a single increase in December for the U.S. Under this scenario, we expect short - term market interest rate to increase and advance of the increase in administered rate. We estimate that operating basis 2015 net interest revenue in this scenario to be in the range of $2.15 billion to $2.25 billion. Since there is significant uncertainty to the amount and timing of interest rate increase, we believe both of these scenarios are relevant to consider.", "Now moving to Slide 19. Expense management remains a priority; while there continues to be upward pressure on regulatory compliance costs, our focus in 2015 will be on prudently managing expenses and driving further efficiencies, expanding our capabilities to meet increasing regulatory expectations, supporting new business growth, including higher information technology costs and continuing to fund growth initiatives. In this context and based on our current assumptions noted on the slide, we are targeting for our operating-basis total fee revenue growth to outpace our operating-basis expense growth by at least 200 basis points for the full year 2015 relative to 2014. I'd note that this assumes that we achieve our operating basis total fee revenue growth objective of 4% to 7% in 2015. Although positive operating leverage remains a long-term goal; our near-term ability to achieve is likely predicated on higher market interest rates for a significant portion of 2015. An additional point that is important to note is in prior years the first quarter of 2015 compensation and employee benefits expense will be higher due to the effect of the accounting treatment of equity compensation for retirement -eligible employees as well as for payroll taxes. We expect the incremental amount attributed to equity compensation for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes in the first quarter of 2015 to be in the range of approximately $140 million to $150 million, this compares to $146 million in first quarter of 2014.", "Now turning to Slide 20, I'd note that returning capital to shareholders remains a higher priority. We issued $750 million of preferred shares in 4Q, '14 bringing our total preferred outstanding to approximately $2 billion. Based upon preferred shares currently outstanding, we expect total preferred dividend cost to be approximately $31 million in first quarter of 2015, and $118 million for the full year 2015. Finally, the evolution of our balance sheet and of regulatory capital and liquidity expectations may lead to additional issuances of preferred shares of approximately $750 million in 2015. We may also issue additional long-term debt. ", "And with that, I'll turn the call back to Jay.", "Jay Hooley", "Thanks Mike. Stephanie, we are now open to responding call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. ", "Ken Usdin", "Thanks, good morning. Mike, in your fee revenue growth outlook I just wanted to ask you to kind of flesh out more; are you expecting -- which business do you expect to drive the incremental growth? And what is the real delta between the bottom and the top end as far as what goes poorly or what goes better at the low and high end? ", "Mike Bell ", "Ken, sure, in terms of the 4% to 7% our fee revenue growth that we expect in 2015 versus 2014. First, I'll just repeat what I said in the prepared remarks, Ken that does include a $200 million headwind from the stronger U.S. dollar. So that is built into the 4% to 7%, otherwise would be roughly 2.5 points higher than 4% to 7% range. So on a constant currency basis think of it as you call it 6.5% to 9.5% but we think again the U.S. dollar shrinking is a real headwind. In terms of what we expect to drive that, I'd really characterize it as continued strength in each of our main fee revenue categories for 2015. And specifically we are pleased with the net new business that we got in particularly in our global services business, we would expect that to continue and actually increase in 2015 relatively to what we saw in 2014. We expect continued growth in our management fees. And we are pleased with the uptick in the Sec [ph] finance revenue in Q4 and also the FX revenue in Q4. And while I wouldn't characterize as the new run rate going forward, I do think on a full year basis 2015 to 2014, we will continue to see good growth in both of those businesses. Lastly to your question on the magnitude of the range and how to think about it. I think, Ken, the major wild cards to me, number one would be again the market driven revenues. FX volatility -- pardon the pun, but FX volatility was quite volatile throughout 2014 and I think it's anybody's guess. So I'd characterize the low end of the range as being a returned or weaker volatility than what we saw in the second half of the year. Sec [ph] finance will please with the strengthening in those revenues in the second half of the year. M&A environment help with that. The enhanced custody revenue continues to be strong, that was helpful. But again we saw in the first half of the year, sec [ph] lending on the agency side, seeing very narrow spreads and certainly that could revert. Lastly, there is an overall question of client flows. We benefited in 2014 as Jay has talked about several times. We've benefited from strong flows in 2014. I'd characterize the upper end of that range is being continued strength there and the lower end a possibly some softening there. Let me see if Jay wants to add or add to those comments. ", "Jay Hooley", "Yes. The only thing I'd probably pile on, Ken, would be that I noted that we have $406 billion and committed yet to be installed pipeline in the asset servicing business. And I'd say broadly the pipeline they are as good as they looked in several quarters. So I'd add that to the input.", "Ken Usdin", "Okay. My second question on capital, you mentioned the extra $750 million potential. Basel III Tier 1 common has also kind of dripped back down to 10 [ph], so can you talk to us about what drives the decision tree on the potential to issue that extra $750 million? And also if any of that also informs any differing view on how you think about your capital return ask?", "Mike Bell ", "Sure, Ken. It is my -- first on the pref, the main couple things driving the likelihood of the additional pref issuance in 2015 would be number one, additional clarity that at least for the foreseeable future. The SLR particularly the 6% SLR at the bank is likely to be our binding constraint. Again, I would characterize that is likely to be our binding constraint for a while. And therefore it is more economical to meet that binding constraint with pref as opposed to common just given the relative cost to capital of common versus call it 6% for -- and after tax basis for after pref, so that's number one. Number two, we've seen an increase in deposit levels particularly non operational deposits throughout 2014. Again with that occurring in 2014, we view it as more economical to meet the required capital associated with that deposit growth with pref as opposed to common. Is it relates to the risk based ratios, since we turn around and place excess deposit with the central banks that does not increase our risk weighted assets and therefore that does not had an impact on the risk based ratios, and therefore I'd again just reinforce that we think the SLR is likely going to be the binding constraint for a while. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs.", "Alexander Blostein", "Great. Good morning, guys. So my question on the operating leverages. I guess in the outlook slide you guys have kind of outlined core fee growth versus core expenses, which I think your competitors are kind of migrating towards that sort of metric as well. But when we think about the operating leverage for the entire enterprise, from your comments it sounds like unless rates go up in the middle of the year it is unlikely that you guys will achieve material operating leverage in 2015. So I just want to make sure I understand that. And then I have a follow-up.", "Jay Hooley", "Yes, Alex, I would say that what we shared with you at your encouragement is our best thinking as we sit here today around 2015 outlook. And when you look at some of my comments what shifted in the last 90 days with regard to the general economic outlook and the likelihood that maybe the Fed delays tightening, we want to put out there they are two different scenarios. And Mike can comment at it if he like. We set every year as a goal operating leverage. We will continue to do that. And we will strive to achieve that. What we are signaling is that if in fact a rate stays stagnant, it is going to put a lot of pressure on our ability to achieve operating leverage. So -- Mike, you want to say --", "Mike Bell ", "Yes. Alex, the only thing I would add. I think there is arguably more uncertainty around the NIR outlook for full year 2015 than there has been for a quite while. I mean it's not loss on any of us just how soft a situation is in Europe. And while we are encouraged by number of the public comments coming out of the Fed on the possibility of increases in administrative rates in the U.S. Just given that relative divergence, we thought it made more sense to put out the two different scenarios. And that way again depending upon on your own view of the world you can model it the way you see fit. Second, I'd just emphasis, Alex that obviously the piece that we can control the most is our expense growth relative to our fee revenue growth. And we feel like that's going to be a good story for 2015. As we talked about we expect to get at least 200 basis point delta between our fee revenue growth and our overall expense growth for 2015. And that's the piece that we feel like we have the most control over. So in terms of the fundamentals on what we have the most control over, we feel good about the outlook. Obviously, we are recognizing uncertainty on the NIR.", "Alexander Blostein", "Got it. That is helpful way to doing it. Second question just on FX, and thank you guys for the comments around just this activity on the revenues front, but as you pointed out, there is obviously an offset around expenses. So, yes, it is a big $200 million of drag on fees, but you guys should get some help from expenses. Can you help us understand, when we think again about the enterprise as a whole from a pretax earnings or a net income perspective, what is the sensitivity of State Street's model today relative to -- in an environment where the US dollar continues to strengthen? If euro/dollar goes to parity, what is the pre-tax hit that we should think, or is it not a very meaningful number because of that natural hedge in the model?", "Mike Bell ", "Yes, Alex, it is Mike. The shorting answer is it is not a material and the grand scheme of State Street impact on our overall EPS. I mean there is modest impact of course because the fee revenue is slightly impacted more than the overall expense level. There is also some collateral impact on our net interest revenue. But again in the grand scheme of things, that's not the risk that I'd point out is being the top five or top ten list. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. ", "Glenn Schorr", "Thanks. I appreciate the rising rate scenario and obviously when you compare it to the static it doesn't have a huge impact because of the timing of your rate hikes. If you follow on the forward curve, even if it is just ballpark, can you talk about maybe a full-year type impact? Like I f2016 what kind of delta could we be looking at on an operating basis NIR?", "Mike Bell ", "Sure, Glenn, it's Mike. First as you can imagine there will be a lot of different factors that would impact 2016. So I would characterize my comments as a directional as opposed to precise. But I think it is -- I think your comment is fair one which since the rising interest rate scenario mainly gives us the benefit in the second half of the year. You could think of the delta between the static and the rising interest rate scenario is being roughly twice that delta in 2016 versus 2015. Now, again importantly there are so many different factors that would go into 2016. I mean what are -- where our deposit levels, how is the evolution of liquidity expectations taken place, the possible divergence between Europe and the U.S., so I mean there are 100 different caveats I could give you there. But I think you are thinking about in the right ballpark is kind of half the year impact in 2015 and that would then widen obviously with a even greater impact in 2016.", "Glenn Schorr", "Yes. I appreciate that. I'm trying to balance that all with the increased debt issuance, too. Okay. The question specifically on regulatory cost, because you noted there continues to be upward pressures there. I am curious on what is driving that, and I am reading into that line that it says the dollars would be up in 2015 from 2014 which was up from 2013. I want to make sure I'm reading that right. And just, literally, what drives it, what is left to do?", "Mike Bell ", "Sure, Glenn. First of all you are reading it right. We do expect 2015 regulatory cost to be higher than 2014 and 2014 was certainly higher than 2013. I would not point, Glenn, to a single area and say it is this area that's driving the higher regulatory cost. It really is the culmination of ratcheting expectations by regulators really across the globe on a higher expectation particularly for GSIBs in terms of regulatory compliance. And in many cases it is not just literal compliance with a literal rules. It is all of qualitative aspects of our management processes that end up getting evaluated by the various exams and various standards that were subject to. Let me see if Jay wants to add anything.", "Jay Hooley", "Yes. The only thing I would add I agree with that, Glenn. The only I add is that if you look at any one of these processes so take CCAR for instance, 2013 versus 2014 submission significant increase in our expectation. And the point I was going to add is that knowing or believing that this is a long-term gain, part of the investment that's going into this is to structurally change the way we are aggregating data so that not unlike our IT and Op Transformation program, we are looking at long -term regulation and compliance, need to be best in class, it must stand point of the results that we deliver but the way we collect data and deliver that information. So there is a pretty high effort going into creating internal data model so that we can quickly aggregate and bring together information not only for today's expectations but for tomorrows as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.", "Ashley Serrao", "Good morning, guys. So when you look at the NIR delta between the static and rising rate scenario that you painted, can you help us just bifurcate the upside there between the rise in the UK? Was it the US rates just given that they are happening at different times?", "Jay Hooley", "Sure, Ashley, it's Mike. We would anticipate that the rise in the Bank of England rates and the associated market increase -- market interest rate increase in interest rates from that would be round numbers worth about $20 million to $25 million US in full year 2015 versus full year 2014. And the way you might want to think about that is, think about it is we have approximately $12 billion of US dollar equivalent deposits in the UK, and we beginning a little more than half a year in terms of the impact on market interest rates and the basis point increase would be a little more than 25 because we get a little bit of an additional benefit from the second 25 increase. So that's the background of the arithmetic behind that number. And then the Fed fund increase would be approximately the remainders. So think of it is again round numbers, Ashley, of approximately $60 million of benefit from market interest rates rising modestly in advance of that Fed fund increase.", "Ashley Serrao", "Okay. Appreciate you guys having just a lot of challenges out there from the regulatory environment and environmental as well. Should this environment persist or deteriorate further is there anything else that you could do on the expense side to help mitigate the situation?", "Jay Hooley", "Yes, I would say, this is Jay, Ashley; I would say two things because we think the regulatory requirements will continue to grow. So the two things that we are consciously doing, one, I already mentioned which is to replace the labor with technology like we would in any of our operating businesses, and do better job at gathering information. And the second which we did in 2014, we will continue to do in 2015 is to replace external consultant dollars which come at a premium with internal staff. We are also doing some of these work in lower cost environment so all of the techniques should expect to do the work at a high level but do it more sufficiently, we are putting into place with regard to all of the regulatory initiatives. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein Research. ", "Luke Montgomery", "Good morning, thanks. So in your guidance you are forecasting the EUR1.16 to US dollar by the year end of 2015. I think we are already at EUR1.12 and possibly headed lower. So perhaps you could discuss how important that exchange rate assumption is to your NIR guidance, and then whether today's exchange rate would represent a material change in that expectation. I think I heard you downplay the risk factor in a prior response, but maybe you could be a little bit more explicit.", "Mike Bell ", "Sure, Luke, it is Mike. First of all, rule of thumb that I use around the euros specifically is it a 1% swing in the euro relative to the US dollar is worth approximately $10 million of annual fee revenue and a shade less than that. So call it $9.5 million of impact on full year expenses. And that's for the entire State Street enterprise. The NIR impact would be a fraction of that. So as I said, there are some very, very modest headwinds associated with the euro continuing to weaken on NIR but that is built into the range that I provided in the prepared remarks. ", "Luke Montgomery", "Okay, helpful, thanks. And then I wonder if you guys could talk us through the decision to shut down the swaps clearing business. I think the plan is to focus on futures clearing, although I think some would argue that you really don't have scale there either and you lost Pimco, which was your biggest client. So how are you gauging your prospects in the futures business? And then if you could speak to how these developments affect your ability or your appetite to offer collateral management and collateral transformation.", "Jay Hooley", "Sure, Luke. Let me take that and this is Jay. You are right in that I think we began this journey thinking that both OTC and futures clearing are both attractive, inter opportunities given the clearing requirement that were imposed by regulators. As it turns out what we are hearing from our customers is there is more of calling for future's clearing versus over the counter clearing, so we had taken a first steps in that journey and concluded that we were better serve to follow the futures clearing path. We think we have a very competitive offering. We've got good volumes through our futures clearing merchant, and we are optimistic that's a good additional product for us going forward. With regard to collateral management. We've spoken before we think that's nice additional service. I don't see it as having huge upside revenue potential but the need to optimize and manage collateral is ever present in the activities that we conduct for our customers. So we have the series of collateral management services that we offer to our customers and get good take up. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. ", "Brian Bedell", "Hi, good morning, thanks. Just in looking at the 2015 outlook, if I am getting this right, if we look at the middle of that fee range, so call it 5.5% growth and assume about 3.5% growth in operating expenses. If we take the static NIR range and then considering the tax rate and obviously share buyback, to me that comes to around a flattish EPS result for 2015 using those assumptions. Just wanted to check if I'm doing that right by your math.", "Mike Bell ", "Yes, Brian, I mean roundly -- there is obviously there are number of different assumptions built in there. I think roundly your arithmetic is in the ballpark, I think importantly number one, we do believe we are going to achieve at least 200 basis points of daylight between fee growth and the expense growth and again you took obviously the 200 basis points and we think there is a reasonable chance to get some help from market interests and obviously you took the static interest rate scenario. So I am not disagreeing with your arithmetic. But the -- just recognize the implicit judgments that you are making there. ", "Brian Bedell", "Yes, so some upside if those are a little better, okay. Then just clarification. I think I missed the revenue impact on the fee line that you cited, Mike. And then were there any fees from euro deposit charges or any bank charges that you passed along baked into the servicing fees and or do you expect those charges to come to the servicing fees in 2015 or through NIR?", "Mike Bell ", "Sure. So, Brian, in terms of the impact of the stronger US dollar, what I said in my prepared remarks is that the currency assumptions noted on the slide would negatively impact fee revenue in 2015 full year by approximately $200 million. That would be almost entirely offset by a same kind of reduction on the expenses. So that it would have a relatively immaterial impact on overall earnings for the full year. But think of it is, again 10% shrinking in the US dollar costing us $200 billion of reported fee revenue growth for the full year. In terms of the negative interest rates in Europe, we did collect some small approximately US $3 million in Q4 from the negative interest rates that we are charging on euro deposits in Q4. We have assumed that, that will continue at least at that level into full year 2015 reflecting the fact that the ECB rate obviously is negative, the Swiss bank rate is now even more negative and so again we are making the assumption that we will continue to charge for euro deposits as long as that situation is evident. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. ", "Brennan Hawken", "Good morning, guys. So I understand that the rules are preliminary and somewhat fluid, but at this point do you have an estimate for what proportion of your deposit base would be considered non-operating?", "Mike Bell ", "At this point, you are absolutely right. It is a fluid situation, Brenn, we do estimate that our excess deposits on average for Q4, 2014 were $52 billion, but as you correctly noted the ultimate calculation, the ultimate standards that are used to determine exactly what's an operational deposit versus a non operational deposit, that work is still in progress. ", "Brennan Hawken", "But for right now you feel confident that the way you view excess is in line with your understanding of the non-operating definition?", "Mike Bell ", "That's correct. ", "Brennan Hawken", "Cool. Okay, thanks. And just want to follow up on what Alex and Ashley both hit on. It is certainly helpful to hear that you might moderate regulatory expenses with tech and such, but the environment -- it is certainly nothing new that the environment has been difficult and it has been brutal for like five years for pretty much all financial services firms. So it is not like it is episodic to State Street, but it seems like the message is that you all are waiting for it to get better rather than proactively dealing with it. And I guess I hear that frustration from investors. I am curious how you would counter that and what will it take for you guys to start to get maybe a bit more proactive on managing the expense front; not just for the regulatory pressures, but also for the environmental ones.", "Jay Hooley", "I would say on a regulatory one, I think we are doing, I think we are being proactive. And proactive means not just responding to the need but looking at over the horizon to see what's coming next to making sure we can hardened an infrastructure to do this more efficiently than anyone else going forward. And I don't have perfect visibility to what others are doing but we are taking a longer view of this. And building sustainable infrastructure but very proactive. ", "Brennan Hawken", "Okay. And maybe on the environmental front, what do you guys think there? I get it that it is really difficult and it is hard to try to figure out how long this is going to last, but is there a point at which we start seeing you maybe take some hacks at the expense base or start to tactically start to think about how you want to reposition the business?", "Jay Hooley", "Yes. Let me -- the environmental front, just to make sure we get the -- we are talking about the same environment. I think we've been, we've talked a lot about the rate environment and its effect on net interest revenue. We try to give you the little bit of the book and thinking on possible outcomes for 2015. We commented on 2016 as well. Environmentally given this divergence of macro economic trends, actually that's a little bit more positive for the market driven revenues and you saw some of that in the fourth quarter and our expectation for 2015 is that continues to get better. With regard to expenses, as we mentioned the IT and Ops Transformation program wound down as we concluded 2014, but we have several efforts underway which pick up on the core themes of IT and Ops Transformation and that is to increasingly drive efficiencies through operational processes, through doing work in lower cost environment. And Mike referenced some investment in technology. We continue to employ technology to replace human labor. So even though the program officially ended in 2014, our jest to continue to get more efficient has not subsided. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Mike Mayo", "Hi, two follow-ups from prior questions. One, Mike, I guess you just kind of gave it to us straight, so if EPS is flat in a static scenario would that imply something closer to $5.10?", "Mike Bell ", "Mike, first of all, I would just emphasize that the -- there are number of different factors that are going to impact EPS not just the net interest revenue and not just the market interest rate. I would simply making the comment that the arithmetic that we were talking about earlier did take the conservative end of a handful of different assumptions. So flat EPS year-over-year would certainly not be by best estimate although I would respect you, Mike, if you pick your own views on both interest rates as well as how much we are going to exceed expense growth with fee revenue growth in 2015.", "Mike Mayo", "So I guess slide 18 the main point is that lower rates for a lot longer really hurt your NIR and there is not a whole lot you can do about that, so --?", "Mike Bell ", "Well, I mean certainly that's the case, Mike. And we did talk about that in detail at our Investor Day a year ago. And I am sure we will be talking about it at the upcoming Investor Day. We talked about if interest rate stayed static that we would expect the net interest margin to continue to grind down, a fair amount lower versus where it is today, all of those numbers if you recall excluded excess deposits which have grown -- it is a little different issue. But in terms of what would we do in that kind of environment. Number one is as we talked about this morning, we will look --we will continue to look for even more efficiency opportunities including as Jay talked about earlier, looking for opportunities to use IT to replace labor on a number of different fronts. We think that's good for clients and then good for our shareholders. And then ultimately if we really believe that interest rates would stay at this level forever particularly given the capital and liquidity rules, we have to over time look more holistically at pricing. And ensure that our client relationships in totality in that kind of environment are enabling add a quick return for our shareholders. ", "Mike Mayo", "So the idea of the capital for labor swap, Jay, you've spoken about the movement to the digital enterprise. Can you talk about this next phase of State Street and the investments that you are making and when you can potentially see some of those payoffs, since that would seem to help out expenses over the medium to long term?", "Jay Hooley", "Yes, happy to, Mike, and when we do have going internally to digital enterprise as a broad based organizational effort to digitize our environment which is I think going to be critical not only to drive efficiency but if I think about some of our most attractive perspective future product sales, most likely revolve around our ability to aggregate real time information for our customers for risk management and another services. So I would put us in a little bit of transitional period between IT and Ops Transformation and the digital enterprise. And in 2014 and a little bit in 2015, one of the critical elements to getting there being more reliant on technology is to make sure we complete hardened our technology environment, internally we use the word building resilient so that it is practically impossible for our technology to go down. Once we are more of reliant on technology less on labor, you can't have technology that fails where if you have higher labor content, it is ability to recover, so we are investing in that infrastructure, but as we get there, every process within the organization is getting examined for how we can improve the process itself. And then how we can apply technology to replace labor. And I would say that, Mike, that's not just for the operational area. If you look at the finance area or just an example on our support group, that organization is going through that same thing. So we don't know what the future hold, we don't know when rates will start to rise, but we are not waiting for that. We are anticipating that it is going to be a slow environment for some years to come. And therefore we are driving efficiencies in every corner of the place. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Beatty with BofA Merrill Lynch.", "Adam Beatty", "Good morning. I have two questions about asset management, so I guess I will ask them both at once. The first concerns the fixed income rebalancing that you saw in Asia and just I guess in one sense it's a positive data point for rate rises, but just what you are seeing across the complex. Do you anticipate or see in smaller fashion similar types of activity? And also and maybe more importantly, globally do you see different investor behavior across regions, maybe based on some of the currency volatility? The other question I had was about more specifically about ETFs -- I see impressive asset growth there -- and where you see opportunities there, particularly maybe in the retirement space and 401(k) platforms. Thank you.", "Jay Hooley", "Sure. Bunch of questions there, Adam. Let me take a swing at it. You saw -- I gave you a breakdown of our net $7 billon and net new assets under management and highlighted a $20 billion fixed income, client that laughed I would say that was certainly one off and we would hope as the client rebalances to pick up something on the equity side in time but there is little transition going on there. If you look at our asset management business, it is anchored in the passive/beta, smart beta space not exclusively but primarily and delivered through various vehicles, you mentioned ETF. When we look at where flows are coming from these days. I think beyond SSGA [ph] you see broadly a broad move into scientific or actively managed funds. Not just passive but active or passive with an active bend on it, some call it smart data, that's the term that we use. We see that as a worldwide phenomenon. It is happening everywhere. It is delivered through various vehicles. We think ETF is a preferred vehicle given a natural efficiency both tax and otherwise if delivering diversified investment. So we've made a considerable effort into expanding our ETF business not just from the standpoint of product, which we do by ourselves and I think we are the only large ETF provider that engages other managers, Blackstone, the DoubleLine, and MFS in an active equity sub advisory relationship. But we've also built out since as you probably know ETFs are largely bought through intermediaries, we built out our wholesaling force in the US and increasingly in Europe on the continent. So I would say both passive and alternatives are two big themes that we see globally. And on the alternative side well as an asset manager we don't play that. We are active, they should expect on the asset servicing side for servicing passive both hedge private equity and real estate. Last point I would make which is more of a servicing comment but it brings an interesting side light, is that in the US but trending across the globe these mutual funds that take on alternative element to them, with not only service those but that has been big source of our enhanced custody growth. So I would say broadly passive and alternative and ETF is the preferred vehicle for distribution.", "Adam Beatty", "So it sounds like some real synergy between the asset management and the custody?", "Jay Hooley", "Absolutely.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steven Wharton with JPMorgan.", "Steven Wharton", "Hi, guys. I just had a question on the rate outlook. You are actually, in some ways to me, somewhat conservative. I recognize that the forward curve expectations have shifted outwards, so you have this first Fed rate rise starting in December. But I was just kind of wondering if the Fed has indicated, which I know could change, that they may move as soon as this summer. The dot plot keeps moving around of course. But if, for example, the Fed moved say sometime in June or July or even in August or September and you ended the year closer to maybe 50 or 75 basis points on the Fed funds rate, can you give me a sense of the benefit that might accrue to the NII forecast and the rising rate scenario?", "Mike Bell ", "Sure. Steven, it is Mike. I appreciate you are right, your comments and I think importantly the answer to your question would be predicated on how quickly do we see the benefit of the market expecting that sooner Fed fund administer great hike, how quickly do we see that show up for example in one month and three month LIBOR. So it is caveated on that. Historically, we've seen one month and three month LIBOR increase in advance of the administered great as the market starts to price that in. But that's really the heavy dependency. I would characterize it is as round numbers, think of it as approximately $60 million of potential benefit in 2015. If in fact we got a mid year kind of increase rather than the December that we had expected, again as long as-- I mean that would really suggest that we would be seeing probably as early as March or certainly by April, the increase in the LIBOR rate. So that's the dependency.", "Steven Wharton", "So the $60 million would be -- is that per 25 basis points or is that in aggregate?", "Mike Bell ", "Well, I was just trying to answer your question in aggregate which I heard it as if we would get in the first Fed fund increase at mid year then we get a second increase in Q4, what do I think the overall impact would that be on NIR for full year 2015 relative to the expectations that we share with you on the slide. ", "Steven Wharton", "Okay. So that basically implies roughly two rates rise with a little bit of market rate impact ahead of it?", "Mike Bell ", "Correct. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "Hi, thanks. I had a quick question on the potential long-term debt issuance in 2015. Looking right now you have about $10 billion of long-term debt on the balance sheet and I am assuming that is being done in preparation for TLAC or NSFR. Can you give us a sense of how much that could grow? Are you looking at it as a percentage of RWA, or how much are you going to add potentially in 2015?", "Mike Bell ", "Sure, Brian. It's Mike. Yes, there is uncertainty around where TLAC is going specifically what kind of proposed rule will the Fed issue around TLAC. And that was really the main driver of the comment that I was making. So at this point I would not try to size it. Obviously, as we know more we will communicate more -- at this point I wouldn't try to size the potential issue and some long-term debt size, I just think there are too many uncertainties in terms of where those rules are ultimately going to go. ", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "You mean that you won't issue until you see the rules; is that the way to interpret that?", "Mike Bell ", "Well, I just think there are number of difference considerations on whether we would issue or not in 2015, not the least that which would market condition, so I'd rather not try to give you a specific forecast on long-term debt. But I was acknowledging the point that you made which is accurate that if TLAC came out from the Fed and particularly if it was more conservative than then Basel rule that might encourage us to do more rather less in 2015. ", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "Okay. Then just my second question was on the preferred issuance. It sounded like there was some optionality in that as well, meaning it is not included within your CCAR plans so you are not required to issue it. So is there a scenario where you could see yourself not having to issue preferred?", "Mike Bell ", "I'd obviously prefer not to talk about CCAR submission at this point. Is there a scenario that I could imagine where we didn't issue the $750 million of additional preferred? Sure, but I think that it is unlikely. I think it is more likely than not that we will issue the additional $750 million. Again, timing to be determined but I think it is more likely than not.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. ", "Jim Mitchell", "Hey, good morning. Mike, can you just help us understand, given that you are assuming a flat rate environment, flat balance sheet, what are the drivers of the $100 million variance in the NII? And then secondarily, if we are assuming a flat rate environment as we have seen over the past couple years, you have had pretty steady strong deposit growth. Is there a reason why we wouldn't or shouldn't assume more deposit growth in 2015 if we have a flat rate environment?", "Mike Bell ", "Sure, Jim. First in terms of the NII forecast for 2015, when you talk about the $100 million, you are talking about the difference between 2014 actual and the mid --", "Jim Mitchell", "Oh, no, I'm sorry. The range between the low end and the high end, sorry.", "Mike Bell ", "I understand, thank you. Well, first of all, it actually links to your deposit growth point. It is not lost on us that particularly we've seen substantial deposit growth over the course of 2014. Unfortunately, mainly that has been in the category of excess deposits which means that we've turned around and put that deposit growth with the central banks and earned a very, very small interest margin on that. And so deposit growth would be an example of uncertainty in our forecast for 2015, hence the other wide range. I'd also add to the point that we may see this divergence in 2015 by geography. So that was the thinking that was a part of that that range as well. They will be mixes in the change of -- in our portfolio and again there are just so many different moving parts here, Jim that I thought particularly given that we are so early in the year, that kind of width of range makes sense. And then your question on the deposit growth. Given the pressure that the growth particularly in excess deposits puts on our capital ratios and therefore would potentially put on the need to issue additional pref longer term, I would hope that we would not have and we would expect that we would not have the kind of growth in excess deposits over the course of 2015 that we had over 2014. I think net-net that would be a negative because again even if it evolves those excess deposit came in the US, they get placed with the central bank here currently earnings 25 basis points, that's not helpful economically with today's interest rate environment and with today's capital liquidity rules. ", "Jim Mitchell", "No, fair. So just to follow-up on your discussion there, the range is sort of dependent on deposit level. So is the upper end of the range assuming some deposit growth, or you mean it is flat and the low end of the range is assuming some deposit runoff?", "Mike Bell ", "Yes, obviously, Jim, there are a lot of different factors that the deposit would be a piece of it. But I just think, again where our spread going to go in 2015, what kind of portfolio opportunities do we have in 2015, how do the rules get and answer to one of the earlier question, I think it was Brennan's that -- where is the final interpretation of the operational deposit rules for LCR come out, there are just a lot of different uncertainties that could push at either or up down.", "Jim Mitchell", "Fair enough. And just one last question just on the prior discussion you have had a couple of times around at the low end that implies flat earnings. Was that discussion, and maybe I missed it, reflecting or contemplating lower share count from the buyback or not, when you think about flat earnings at the low end?", "Mike Bell ", "Yes. I'd rather not get into share count and forecast just given that, that would imply certain things about CCAR but I would just simply try to point out that the our view is that we are going to have EPS growth in 2015. We obviously recognized the risk factors and we try to be very transparent about the pluses and minuses. I think most importantly I think the things that we can most control, we feel good about what we are going to execute on for 2015.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Good morning. If I think about capital ratios declining a little bit, the GSIB surcharge potentially stepping up from 100 basis points to 150 basis points, then just conceptually how do you think about the right proportion of earnings that you should be returning to shareholders? Not so much thinking about this year, but just going forward, given that there is some growth in the business, how long can you keep giving everything back before you have to start retaining something?", "Mike Bell ", "Sure, Geoff, it is Mike. First, I think they are really two different questions embedded in your question there. One is the GSIB buffer. I would emphasize that my comment on it, it potentially increasing is based upon our interpretation of the Fed's proposed rule and in particular that our non operational deposits get picked up on to our interpretation, our non operational deposits get picked up in what they are characterizing as short -term wholesale funding despite the fact that those dollars are literally placed with the central bank which we view as the epitome of a risk free transaction. And we view it as the antithesis of a hot money kind of risk. So GSIB buffer, we will certainly put in the common letter and we would hope that reason would ultimately prevail there. So I think it's way too early to attribute a change in philosophy or anything, a change in game plan related to that. I think your question on-- more importantly which we will talk about some more at our Investor Day in February is our longer-term plans around capital management. And in a nutshell, Geoff, our game plan has not changed there which is that we would expect to return -- if you think about our overall ROE, we would expect to payout a portion of that in common stock dividends, a portion of it would need to be retained to fund a growing balance sheet over time, but that again assuming that we limit the growth in the required capital from a growing balance sheet to small single digit number so that provides ample opportunity over the long haul for share repurchase and using that as a vehicle to return capital to shareholders.", "Operator", "We have time for one final question. Your final question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. ", "Gerard Cassidy", "Thank you. Good morning, guys. You mentioned that with the negative deposit rates at the European Central Bank and other central banks customers are starting to pull out some deposits. Others are paying those fees. Can you guys give us some color on the sensitivity analyses you might be doing; if those numbers become more negative at the central banks, how many more customers may decide to leave rather than paying the fees? And then would you shrink the balance sheet accordingly? And as part of that, I heard in response to some answers about the amount of fees you received in the fourth quarter was $3 million. And I didn't know if that was just for the month of December which, Jay, you mentioned that is when you started to charge and then, Mike, you said that was for the full fourth quarter. So is it a $9 million run rate or is it just $3 million?", "Jay Hooley", "Gerard, let me start that one and Mike can jump in maybe on the $3 million question. It is probably too early to tell as to what the sensitivity, at what price balances find different homes. But as you rightly point out it is -- to me one of the most important elements of what we are doing by charging for euro deposits, is trying to determine or establish at what price deposit stay versus go. And if you carry that forward that would be a pretty powerful weapon for us with regard to having some control is probably a too stronger word but some ability to influence excess deposit which obviously have big consequences for the capital that we hold. So early days, we've only been added for a couple of months but we are spending a lot of time at the individual client level trying to understand deposit behavior, trying to understand what alternatives there are and what point a price causes somebody to move because we think it has pretty important implications far beyond charging for euro deposits.", "Mike Bell ", "And, Gerard, it is Mike, just to add on your question on the timing. So we did start charging for deposits in December. So the $3 million all came in December, it was reported in net interest revenue at this point and so again think of it as on approximately $30 billion, 15 basis points on an annual basis, one month worth is the $3 million. ", "Gerard Cassidy", "Great. Then as a follow-up question can you give us some color on the loan portfolio? Obviously on an average basis it is almost $18 billion; that is up nicely from the beginning of the year. The color I am interested in, are there any big energy credits in there? Are you part of any syndicates that you have energy exposure in that portfolio?", "Mike Bell ", "The short answer is no, Gerard. ", "Operator", "I would now like to turn it back over to management for closing remarks.", "Jay Hooley", "Thanks, Stephanie. I'll be brief. Thanks for your attention and questions this morning. Hopefully, we look forward to seeing all of you on February 25 in New York City.

Good morning everyone and thank you all for joining us. On our call today are CEO Jay Hooley, who\u2019ll speak first, then Mike Bell, our CFO will take you through our first quarter 2015 earnings slide presentation which is available to download in the investor relation section of our website at www.statestreet.com.

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change.", "Now, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Hooley", "Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. I\u2019m pleased with our first quarter 2015 results, which reflect strong fee revenue growth over first quarter 2014, continued momentum of our core business, and our focus on managing expenses. We continue to prioritize returning capital to our shareholders. During the first quarter of 2015, we completed the final phase of our $1.7 billion common stock purchase program announced in March of 2014 with the purchase of 6.3 million of our common stock. In addition, our board of directors approved $1.8 billion common stock purchase program following the Federal Reserve board\u2019s 2015 CCAR process. ", "Our 2015 capital plan also includes a proposed increase on our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.34 per share starting in the second quarter of 2015, which our board will consider in May. ", "Now I would like to provide a brief overview of economic and market developments and how our business was affected. The first quarter was characterized by further monetary policy easing in several jurisdictions outside the US. Some of the moves were anticipated, but a few were not. Not only have these policy changes tended to support global equity markets, they have also contributed to higher volatility, particularly in the fixed income and foreign exchange markets. Recent weekly US economic data and Federal Reserve board members public commentary, have brought into question expectations for the timing and pace of interest rate increases in the US later this year. ", "However, the wave of global monetary easing by major central banks outside of the US has reinforced the trend of diverging monetary policies and continues to fuel the broad appreciation of the US dollar. Combined with ongoing political uncertainties across Europe, managed as well as floating exchange rates are being significantly pressured. Both the Russian and Brazilian Central Banks abandoned their intervention programs, while the Swiss National Bank abandoned its cap on the Swiss Franc Euro rate and moved interest rates deeper into negative territory. In addition the Central Banks in Australia and Canada also reduced interest rates to help their economies absorb lower commodity prices. These actions spurred an increase in FX volatility. ", "Monetary policy easing also impacted the fixed income markets in the first quarter. The ECB\u2019s announced an expanded asset purchase program, was larger and longer lasting than anticipated. Combined with the Swiss National Bank\u2019s moves, a significant and growing share of European sovereign bonds now have negative yields, which in turn is helping suppress yields around the globe. Together, these trends impact our business in several meaningful ways. First and most significantly, the low interest rate environment continues to negatively impact our net interest revenue and net interest margin as our higher yielding portfolio investments mature or experience pre-payments and then those funds are reinvested in lower yielding investments. ", "Also, amidst the various Central Bank actions and changes to various market structures, we continue to experience high levels of deposits. As you know, we recently imposed charges for holding Euro deposits, which compensates us for the use of our balance sheet in a negative rate environment. We have also began a comprehensive program to further reduce our excess deposits, given the negative effect of these deposits on our capital ratios to better align our and customers\u2019 interests in the management of our level of deposits, given the new regulatory requirements. Second, our foreign exchange trading revenue was quite strong in the first quarter and we benefited from the higher volatility in the foreign exchange markets relative to Q1 2014 and Q4 2014. Our broad range of foreign exchange trading platforms continue to serve us well. ", "Finally, our first quarter 2015 fees avenue was negatively impacted by the strengthening US dollar, which was mostly offset by the favorable impact on first quarter 2015 expenses. Excluding these impacts, our core business performed well, benefiting from both the current relationships and continued expense discipline. ", "Now I\u2019d like to discuss our asset servicing and asset management business. Our focus on developing and delivering solutions to serve clients\u2019 evolving needs, continues to position us well against global growth trends. Our first quarter 2015 net asset servicing wins totaled $215 billion, and importantly these wins are across sectors and geographies. New assets to be serviced that remain to be installed in future periods totaled $336 billion at March 31 and we continue to see deep and diverse pipelines. ", "In our asset management business, we experienced net outflows of $38 billion during the first quarter of 2015, driven by net outflows of $27 billion from ETFs, reflecting the first quarter seasonal outflows from our S&P 500 ETFs, $8 billion from institutional mandates and $3 billion from cash products. Outflows were driven primarily from lower yielding products -- lower revenue yielding products as evidenced by asset management revenues for the first quarter of 2015 being up from the first and fourth quarters of 2014, excluding the impact of a stronger US dollar. ", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike who will review our financial performance for the first quarter and after that we\u2019ll take your questions. Mike?", "Mike Bell", "Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our operating basis results, I\u2019ll comment on a non-operating charge included in our 1Q \u201915 GAAP basis results. We recorded an after-tax charge of $150 million, or $0.36 a share for 1Q \u201915 to increase our legal accrual associated with indirect foreign exchange matters. This accrual pertains to indirect FX matters which we\u2019ve disclosed over the past few years, and it reflects our intention to seek to resolve the outstanding claims asserted in the United States by federal governmental entities and civil litigants. It is possible that we will not be able to reach any settlement of these matters and the cost of any resolution could materially exceed our accrual. Our current efforts, even if successful, may not address all of our potential legal exposure arising out of these activities and other claims, which may be material, could be asserted against us. As I am sure you can appreciate, settlement discussions are confidential, and we are not able to make more specific comments on these matters at this time. ", "Now please turn to page seven in the slide presentation where I\u2019ll begin a discussion of our 1Q \u201915 operating basis results. Operating basis EPS for 1Q \u201915 increased to $1.17 per share from $0.99 in 1Q \u201914 and decreased from $1.37 in 4Q \u201914. Our first quarter results in 2014 and 2015 included the seasonal effect of deferred incentive compensation for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes. Compared to 1Q \u201914, EPS growth of 18% was driven by strong fee revenue growth, well controlled expenses, a favorable effective tax rate and the impact of our common stock repurchase program. ", "Operating basis total revenue increased 5%, with associated total fee revenue increasing approximately 7% from 1Q\u201914, while operating basis total expenses increased 1% from 1Q \u201914. Our operating basis effective tax rate for 1Q \u201915 was 28.4%, which is lower than our expectation for the full year. ", "On the capital front, in 1Q \u201915, we purchased approximately $470 million on our common stock, completing our March 2014 common stock repurchase program. In addition, we announced a new common stock repurchase program of up to $1.8 billion, and subject to approval by our board of directors, a planned increase of our quarterly common stock dividend, for 2Q 2015 to $0.34 a share. ", "Slide eight shows we delivered strong 1Q \u201915 operating basis EPS growth over 1Q 2014. Primary drivers included strong fee revenue growth and the impact of our common stock share repurchases. ", "Turning to slide nine, I\u2019ll now discuss additional details of our operating basis revenue for 1Q, 2015 and notable variances to 1Q \u201914 and 4Q \u201914. First I would note that the stronger US dollar adversely impacted total fee revenue by approximately $83 million compared to 1Q 2014 and $46 million compared to 4Q 2014. Net interest revenue was also negatively impacted by the stronger US dollar by approximately $14 million compared to 1Q \u201914 and by $7 million compared to 4Q \u201914. Compared to the year ago quarter, all fee revenue lines increased, with the strength in FX trading in particular supporting the 7% total fee revenue growth from 1Q \u201914. ", "Servicing fees were up from 1Q \u201914, primarily due to net new business and stronger US equity markets, partially offset by the impact of the stronger US dollar. Management fees increased 3% from 1Q \u201914, primarily due to net new business and stronger US equity markets partially offset by the impact of the stronger US dollar. In addition, 1Q 2015 included money market fee waivers of approximately $11 million. ", "Total trading services revenue in 1Q \u201915 increased significantly from 1Q\u201914 and 4Q '14 due to higher foreign exchange trading revenue, reflecting higher volatility in volumes. Securities finance revenue increased approximately 20% compared to 1Q \u201914, primarily due to increased new business and enhanced custody and higher volumes. Processing fees and other revenue were flat with Q1 2014 and decreased from Q4 \u201814 primarily due to lower earnings from joint ventures and lower revenue associated with tax advantaged investments. ", "Moving to slide 10, as you can see, our operating basis net interest revenue and net interest margin continue to be challenged in the prolonged low interest rate environment. NIR decreased from Q4 \u201814 primarily due to a one-time loan repayment in Q4 \u201814 and the impact of lower market interest rates, partially offset by higher deposit levels. We continue to expect 2015 NIR to perform within the scenarios we communicated at our Investor Day. For your reference, we\u2019ve provided those slides in the appendix of the slide presentation along with the primary drivers and assumption underlying those scenarios. ", "To remind you, the first scenario assumes interest rates remains static and deposits remain level with 2014 year end levels. Under this scenario, we expect operating basis net interest revenue for 2015 to be in the range on $2.07 billion to $2.17 billion. The second scenario we presented to you assumes that administered interest rates will begin to increase later this year. Under this scenario, we expect short term market interest rates to increase in advance of the increase in administered rates. We estimate that operating basis 2015 net interest revenue in this scenario to be in the range of $2.15 billion to $2.25 billion. ", "And before discussing 1Q 2015 expenses, please note that we continue to target our operating basis total fee revenue growth to outpace our operating basis expense growth by at least 200 basis points for the full year 2015 relative to 2014. This assumes that we achieve our operating basis total fee growth object of 4% to 7% in 2015. ", "Moving to slide 11, you can see on the top of the slide there were some notable expenses affecting 1Q 2015 results. The stronger US dollar benefited total expenses by approximately $77 million compared to 1Q 2014 and $39 million compared to 4Q 2014. In addition, 1Q 2015 compensation and employee benefits, those expenses increased from 4Q 2014 primarily due to an incremental $137 million associated with seasonal deferred incentive compensation for retirement eligible employee and payroll taxes. ", "Lastly, other expenses included $20 million in securities processing costs and an additional $8 million for a new bank levy in Europe. Other expenses increased from the year ago quarter primarily due to additional required regulatory costs and higher securities processing costs. Compared to 4Q 2014, other expenses decreased, primarily due to the non-recurrence of a number of 4Q 2014 other expenses and lower professional services costs. ", "Turning to slide 12, I'll provide a brief overview of our March 31, 2015 balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to evolve as we respond to regulatory changes, including the liquidity rules. Our liquidity coverage ratio is currently above 100%. In addition, the investment portfolio maintained a higher credit quality profile and our duration was in line with the prior quarter. Lastly, the after-tax unrealized mark-to-market gain as of March 31, 2015 was $699 million, which improved from year end, primarily due to a decline in interest rates and title credit spreads. ", "Now turn to slide 13 to review our capital position. As you can see, we remain well capitalized which has enabled us to accomplish a top priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. As of March 31, 2015, our fully phased-in capital ratios have declined modestly relative to year end. The decrease in the common equity tier 1 ratio under the Basel III fully phased in advanced and standardized approaches, which principally due to the Q1 2015 charge associated with foreign matters. The fully phased in holding company supplementing leverage ratio, decreased from 4Q 2014, principally due to a higher average balance sheet as of March 31, 2015 and the 1Q 2015 charge associated with foreign exchange matters. We are comfortable we have the levers that will enable us to be in compliance with the supplementary leverage ratio requirements in advance of the January 1, 2018 effective date. ", "Returning capital to shareholders continues to be a top prior as evidenced by the capital actions included in your CCAR 2015 capital plan. As we communicated at our Investor Day, leverage ratios continue to be our near term binding constraint and this was further highlighted by our DFAST 2015 and CCAR 2015 results. This constraint has been driven by the growth in our balance sheet, primarily as the result of higher client deposits. ", "While operational deposits are integral to the overall service that we provide our custody clients, growth in excess deposits has pressured our capital ratios and we\u2019ve began a program designed to reduce the level of excess deposits on our balance sheet. For example starting in April, we increased the rate we are charging for Euro deposits. Based upon our discussions with clients, we are also developing other initiatives that appropriately balance our clients\u2019 needs with our economic and regulatory objectives. Overall, we are targeting a net reduction in excess deposits over the remainder of the year. In addition, we continue to plan our capital action carefully and as previously disclosed, we plan to issue approximately $750 million of preferred equity in 2015. ", "In summary, our 1Q 2015 results were driven by strong fee revenue, well controlled expenses and a favorable effective tax rate. We continue to focus our key priorities of delivering value-added solutions to our clients, investing in growth initiatives, diligently managing expenses and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to expect 2015 total operating basis fee revenue to increase 4% to 7% compared to full year 2014 and we continue to target our operating basis total fee revenue growth to outpace our operating basis expense growth by at least 200 basis points for the full year 2015 relative to 2014. We expect NIR headwinds are like to continue as illustrated within the scenarios we communicated at our Investor Day. Lastly, we continue to expect our operating basis effective tax rate to be approximately 30% to 32% for the full year 2015.", "And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Jay", "Jay Hooley", " Thank Mike. Brandy, we are now -- Mike and I are now available to handle questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Shirr from Evercare ISI", "Glenn Schorr", "Hi, thanks very much. I guess the balance sheet is up 9 % thereabouts year on year, so it\u2019s good for supporting net interest income while the NIM has its issues. But as you mentioned, it impacts the capital and SLR. So curious to on how you\u2019re balancing that. And then related question is I noticed that mortgages and asset backs had declined the most somewhere between 10% and 25%. Is that just straight runoff or is that a purposeful decline to impact the capital ratios as well? Thanks", "Jay Hooley", "Glenn, let me start and then Mike will comment on the balance sheet construction. This issue of growing deposits and the pressure on our capital ratios, let me just tease out for a minute how we\u2019re approaching that because I think it's important. We are working with our customers. We\u2019ve had series of discussions. So we\u2019ve brought out into the open the concern we have is somewhat ironically the clients, particularly in the asset management segment, have the same issues. SEC and other regulatory agencies are forcing them to do more liquidity stress testing on their portfolios, which is one of the causes for excess deposits ending up on our balance sheet. ", "We have -- we\u2019ve developed some tools just recently through our global exchange business, portfolio stress testing tools that we\u2019ve been sharing with our costumers so that as they look at their liquidity needs, it can be done more scientifically. We are working with them to want to understand their liquidity needs and we think from that will come a reduction in their liquidity needs, which will reduce the deposits that end up on our balance sheet. I point that out because I think it's as more durable and sustainable approach than just forcing down excess deposits. ", "I also think the other thing that is in play here obviously is at some interest rate level, we want these deposits. So what we are really trying to unearth what deposits are truly excess, not needed for the liquidity needs of the fund and deposits that would likely run off anyway in a different interest rate environment. That\u2019s a little bit of where we are in our deposit strategy. Based on that, as Mike pointed out, we would expect our excess deposits to go down between now and end of year, but you might comment, Mike on the portfolio construction.", "Mike Bell", "Sure, absolutely. Good morning, Glenn. Glenn, first, regarding the overall balance sheet and then moving into the portfolio. Regarding the overall balance sheet, we published at the end of first quarter an SLR on a fully phased in basis at the bank of 4.8%. And as we\u2019ve talked about previously, we do expect to be able to manage the levers between now and the 1/1/18 effective date to get that 4.8% up to at least 6%. And as Jay talked about, some of that will come from the excess deposits leaving us. Some of it will come from some financial engineering that we can do between the bank and the holding company and some of it we would expect to meet through pref issuance, including the $750 million that we have slated for 2015. Your arithmetic is accurate. I would just point out that we continue to feel good about the levers that we have in front of us. ", "On the specific question on the balance sheet, the short answer is that the runoff in the mortgage backs and asset backs are in fact by design. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not lost on you that the regulatory environment now, specifically the combination of the LCR and the SLR converge to basically encourage us to move towards more of a barbell kind of approach so that as an example we\u2019re holding more U.S treasuries, more Central Bank deposits than we\u2019ve done historically. At the other end it\u2019s not huge, but we have for example a modestly larger loan book, including leveraged loans in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range. As a result, in the new environment, the piece of the portfolio that becomes then less valuable from a net return on capital standpoint tends to be the mortgage backs and asset backs that you described. So we would expect that as we over time move to more of this barbell kind of approach, that those would be the assets that are most likely to run off.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Josh Cohen", "Good morning guys. This is actually Josh in place for Ken. What was the impact from activity levels on the servicing business this quarter?", "Mike Bell", "Josh, it\u2019s Mike. Regarding the GS fees, they were down a little bit relative to Q4. It was not huge, but they were down modestly Q4 to Q1.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.", "Ashley Serrao", "So on the excess deposit reduction, can you just help us think about the size of these deposits and what yields these are carried at and invested in right now?", "Mike Bell", "Ashley, good morning. It\u2019s Mike. Regarding the deposits, first of all we estimate at on average in Q1, that our excess deposits were approximately $54 billion. And on average, those are earning in the -- again on average something in the high teens so call it 15 to 20 basis points of spread on those deposits. So if you back that out of our overall interest earning assets, you would see that the 101 basis point NIM would be a combination of high teens on the excess deposits and then something in the high 120s in terms of the core net interest margin on the remainder.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Luke Montgomery with Bernstein Research.", "Luke Montgomery", "I was wondering if you could give a sense of what the year over year expense growth would've been excluding FX translation. I think obviously the reported numbers look pretty good, but maybe you could speak more to the core execution on expense containment. And then what was the impact of FX translation on revenues and net income?", "Mike Bell", "Sure Luke. It\u2019s Mike. Regarding your first question on expenses, so the reported expense number on an operating basis was up 1.3% on a year over year basis and again that\u2019s Q1 2015 to Q1 2014. If we take out the $77 million that I noted in my prepared remarks on the impact of the currency translation, it would say that the expenses would have been up 5.4% on a constant currency basis. And as you can imagine, that\u2019s roughly offset. Not completely offset, but roughly offset by a similar impact on fees. So the impact on fee revenue year over year was approximately $83 million of headwind, Q1 2015 to Q1 2014. And then the impact incremental to that from net interest revenue of the stronger US dollar was approximately $40 million. So $40 million Q1 2015 to Q1 2014. So if you take the $40 million of negative impact on NIR and take in the $6 million delta between the impact on fees and impact on expenses, that would say about $20 million was the headwind to earnings from the currency translation. So relative to a constant currency calculation so call that a little less than $0.04 a share.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Blostein", "Good morning everybody. So on the -- just taking a step back just a bigger picture I guess on the operating leverage, you guys had delivered pretty nice operating margin expansion year over year despite the currency headwinds. It looks like up in about 200 plus basis points year over year. But in your outlook for the full-year again for the whole Company your outlook remains kind of no operating leverage assuming rates stay at current levels, which increasingly feels like it will be the case. So I guess my question is, is the reason for not coming out with a little bit more optimistic guidance for the full year on the operating leverage a function of look, we don't know where FX trading is going to go and that's really been the main driver? Or is there something else we need to account for in the back half of the year that could take some of that upside out of the run rate?", "Mike Bell", "Sure Alex. It\u2019s Mike. First, you\u2019re absolutely right. No change in the full year outlook relative to what we had just talked about 60 days or so ago at the Investor Day. Basically that\u2019s because at this point we really wouldn\u2019t over weight a single quarter. For example we think it\u2019s unlikely that the FX trading revenue will continue at the pace that it did in Q1. Generally the conditions for FX have been good, but I wouldn\u2019t characterize the first quarter rates which were exceptionally strong as being the new run rate going forward. So that\u2019s really the main punchline is no change in the underlying outlook, which again we view, Alex as being favorable with 4% to 7% fee revenue despite currency headwinds of somewhere between 200 and 300 basis points. That would say 7% to 10% fee revenue growth on a constant currency basis. We view that as a positive result. ", "And as we talked about at the Investor Day with at least 200 basis points of daylight between fee revenue and expense growth, we view that as a real positive step forward in terms of productivity. Again even a bigger step forward than we took for full year 2014 relative to 2013. So again in terms of the items we can control, we feel good about the outlook. Obviously we cannot control all the market interest rates. As you noted correctly, that remains a headwind. We also acknowledge that the tax rate is likely to be higher for 2015, in fact higher than what it was in first quarter. That would be another headwind that is not truly within our control. Again we feel good about the outlook and do not feel like it made sense at this point to change it.", "Operator", "Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank, please go ahead, sir.", "Brian Bedell", "On the investment servicing like, Mike can you tell us with the dollar amount of the FX impact is 4Q to 1Q? And then Jay maybe the amount to be installed from the new custody wins at the end of the first quarter? And then maybe just an update on your enhanced custody efforts within securities lending as well.", "Mike Bell", "Good morning, Brian. In terms of the Q4 to Q1 roll forward, GS fees were negatively impacted by currency translation by approximately $27 million. So it would have been essentially flattish Q4 to Q1 without the currency translation. Jay?", "Jay Hooley", "Yeah, let me pick up and I\u2019d just remind you, Brian that 2014 to 2013 service fees were up some 9%. So we don\u2019t look at a single quarter as being terribly informative. The $336 billion of committed not yet installed, hard to characterize it any one way. It\u2019s a real mix of from traditional to offshore alternatives. No single big deals. It\u2019s not an 80/20 so that\u2019s good. It should feather in nicely over the next couple of quarters would be our expectation. On the enhanced custody, which drove a good deal of our period over period securities lending growth, we continue to see great interest in that product and it\u2019s coming from I would say some smaller products coming from new relationships. More of it is coming from expanding existing relationships and we find with the continued changing landscape in the investment bank world with prime brokers that enhanced custody continues to be a very attractive product. So we would anticipate that product to continue to growth and probably dominate the incremental growth in the securities lending line for some time to come.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.", "Vivek Juneja", "Jay, I have a question for you just stepping away from earnings a little bit. Looking at your proxy when I look at the ROE targets for long-term incentive comp plans for management, you're using a 9% ROE target for this year and you earned 9.8% last year. So I'm trying to understand the rationale for the target that's being used being lower than last year and what to imply from that.", "Jay Hooley", "Sure, Vivek. As you know, I can comment on it, but that would be the board and the executive comp committee that sets those targets. I think what\u2019s notable about that target is that it continues to move up. It doesn\u2019t have upside beyond the 9%. It does have downside at the 9%. I think it\u2019s fair to say that the board and executive comp committee continue to calibrate that number up, but are also mindful of the continued variation with regard to capital and some of the things that we\u2019re working through. So the expectation that that would move closer to 12% to 15% target over time, but for now the board is most comfortable with targeting that at 9%.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.", "Jim Mitchell", "Good morning. Just want to \u2013 Jay, I think in the past you've talked about how emerging market equities can have maybe a little bit of an outsized impact on fee rates. Obviously emerging markets over the last month or so has had a very strong run. Think up 9% so far in April. Is it fair to assume that can still have a positive impact on fee rates in the second quarter if it's sustained? Or is it not just market appreciation, we also have to see flows? Just if you can just give us any kind of red box to think about this impact going forward if it's sustained?", "Jay Hooley", "Sure. Happy to, Jim and your observation is on target, which is emerging market asset growth is a good thing proportionally as it relates to our asset growth and service fee revenue. You\u2019re also right that the last month has been very constructive for emerging markets growth and we would expect that if that continues, that would be a positive helper to the service fee line. Less influential, but important as well is the transaction volume that is associated with that. Transaction volume was a little soft in the first quarter, which is part of the drag on the service fee growth period over period. Again I\u2019d expect that if we see sustained upward movement in emerging markets the transaction growth will flow from that. So both positive towards the service fee growth.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck", "Good morning. Jay, you announced a new head of the SSGA business. I wondered if you could give us a few words on expectations and maybe speak within that to the commentary in the press about focus on fixed income ETFs.", "Jay Hooley", "Sure. We did announce, Betsy that Ron O'Hanley will be replacing the retiring Scott Powers. Scott will retire sometime mid this year and Ron is on board as of now. Ron, many of you would know, previously was at Bank of New York Mellon running the asset management, wealth management practice and then was President of Fidelity most recently. I\u2019ve known Ron as a customer, as an industry associate through the years and when Scott informed me that he wanted to retire, I began a conversation with Ron. That conversation was largely around SSGA\u2019s positon, its strategy, what I thought the opportunities were with that and I found Ron to be similar minded with regard to how we viewed the SSGA opportunity. Scott and Ron worked together for some years in a past life. So that makes the transition even smoother as they work together. ", "So with Ron on board, my expectation is that obviously with a new person, you look at strategy, but I would expect more tweaks to the adjustment as opposed to overhauls. I think what Ron and I find attractive about the SSGA franchise is its global nature, its institutional relationships and its end product areas, most notably ETFs and passive that continue to generate proportionally higher flows than the traditional active asset categories. I would say Ron loves the ETF franchise. He\u2019s a big believer in asset allocation overlays across ETFs for use in intermediary channels, institutional channels. The fixed income ETF which you referenced is also an area that we have been building out, but there\u2019s more to do. So I think that Ron coming on board, I expect that the transition will be smooth. He\u2019ll bring some new ideas to the mix, but fundamentally we have a similar view of how we can best leverage the SSGA franchise going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Mike Mayo", "Hi, you guys are batting cleanup this quarter among the trust banks. Year-over-year operating leverage is a little bit more negative than your peers. And so I'm just wondering from your perspective why do you think that's the case? Is it, one, maybe the mix? Maybe it's just the impact of Europe for more equities. Would it be two, maybe the stage of your strategy? I know you are investing a lot in the digital enterprise. Maybe you could get some ins and outs from that. Or third, you think you\u2019re not executing as well as you'd like? Thanks.", "Jay Hooley", "We don\u2019t think it\u2019s the third, Mike. I would say it\u2019s -- and you should expect as do you, we compare ourselves to our peers and we try not to focus on a single quarter. We think over longer periods that our performance has been good, if not better in most categories. I do think we look at this as a long term game where as you know we are continuing to drive product development which is creating innovation and topline growth. We think that we\u2019re best positioned in some of the faster growing asset classes, alternatives, ETFs, offshore funds. And so we don\u2019t sit back and ignore investments in those categories. So we\u2019re continuing to drive investment. On the other hand, you referenced the digital enterprise. We also, we\u2019d like to see improved environmental factors that could cause us to return to days of old. ", "We\u2019re not expecting that. So we\u2019re continuing to drive efficiency in the core operations. The digital enterprise does have some investment associated with it. It\u2019s designed to make us the low cost producer in some of those commodity activities that we generate. If you were to say what\u2019s the investment that\u2019s going into that, it\u2019s continuing to drive straight through processing, continuing to enhance the private cloud, moving more applications to the private cloud. Some of the new products that we\u2019ve introduced recently, I referenced the portfolio liquidity stress test tool which was built in the cloud fairly rapidly given the need. ", "TruCross which is a buy side to buy side foreign exchange platform which we introduced in the last quarter and a half also has those same characteristics. So we\u2019re trying to build for the long term, which means driving those unit costs down, being the lost cost producer in the core base line activities while continuing to invest in those products that continue to differentiate us in what we think are some of the more attractive segments of the investment services business. So as opposed to outperforming in a quarter, we would rather outperform over time and we think we\u2019re positioned to do that.", "Operator", "Brennan Hawken with UBS, your question please.", "Brennan Hawken", "Good morning. So it appears as though the seasonality in the SPDR ETFs is becoming more pronounced over the last few years. Does this concern you at any way and does it create any kind of constraints on your capabilities whether they be operational or capital markets oriented? And is there anything going on there that might be problematic or that you might want to adjust through your sales processes?", "Jay Hooley", "Yeah, Brennan. Let me pick that up. I think the broad answer is no. your observation is accurate which is the SPDR S&P 500 is actively used for portfolio positioning. So it spikes, ebbs and flows at quarter end and beginning of the following period. As you expect, S&P highly liquid, so we don\u2019t worry about any operational issues related to the increased volumes going through the SPDR S&P 500 ETF. So really no, we don\u2019t worry about it. I think if you look at, I mentioned the negative flows to SSGA which were dominated by the S&P 500 which, while an attractive productive product, has relatively low revenues associated with it. ", "If you look at our currency adjusted performance for SSGA, it was 2% revenues quarter over quarter and 7% year over year. So I think while the big ETFs have high velocity to them, the revenue impact is relatively small. And as I\u2019ve said for several quarters, our focus is more on generating more differentiated, higher revenue producing ETFs. So just in the quarter we introduced seven new ETFs in SSGA. Maybe the most notable was the one with double line which is a total return ETF which has very attractive revenues associated with it and got off to a good start. So no real concern on the high velocity of the S&P 500 ETFs focused on leveraging that ETF business to produce more differentiated products with high revenue per asset mix.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Hello there. Thank you for taking the question. On the comments you made around not seeing the first quarter for first quarter revenues in terms of FX trading as a run rate, is that because you think that volatility moves down a bit of first-quarter level if you look at the indices? Or is it more because some of the dislocation around the Swiss franc and QE kicking in in Europe just created wider spreads on FX trades that aren't going to be sustainable?", "Jay Hooley", "Yeah. Let me pick that up, Jeff. Mike can comment if he has anything to add. More the latter. I think if you look at volatility, there was a real spike in the first quarter. You mentioned the Swiss National Bank de-peg. It was just a highly volatile quarter that was very conducive to foreign exchange volatility. We don\u2019t see that event obviously repeating itself, but we\u2019re very constructive overall on general volatility going forward and the positive effect it would have on our foreign exchange business. Volatility has gone up for three quarters if you look at the underlying drivers. I keep referencing the divergence of monetary policy. We began the year thinking that UK, US, Australia and the Canadians might begin to tighten. ", "The Australians and Canadians have gone the other way, but I\u2019d say the US and the UK are still on the mode of heading towards a policy tightening that monetary divergence is very constructive for foreign exchange volatility. So we think that there were exceptions in the first quarter which won\u2019t repeat, but overall very constructive on foreign exchange volatility going forward. I\u2019d also add that I think if you look at foreign exchange in the first quarter roughly 6%, 7% volume growth, both across platform and not platform business. We\u2019ve seen higher volume growth leading into this quarter which have driven the outperformance. So we will continue to expect we\u2019d see good volume growth and the volatility to persist, just not at the level that we saw in that first quarter. Mike?", "Mike Bell", "No, that\u2019s perfect, Jay.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "And just in terms of the overall impact on profitability of the FX revenues, is it fair to assume there is very little expense that goes against them maybe a little bit of comp, but not very much and most of it is just dropping to the bottom line?", "Mike Bell", "Yes, Jeff. It\u2019s Mike. That\u2019s a fair assessment of the profitability of the high margin FX trading business.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Adam Beatty with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Adam Beatty", "Good morning. A follow-up on asset management, specifically multi-asset class solutions which I think is a relatively small but promising category. It looks like you've had some outflows there lately. Have there been certain products or maybe client mandates driving the outflows? And maybe more importantly, what's your plan for the category in the latest outlook?", "Jay Hooley", "Let me take that, Adam. The outflows which are categorized in the institutional bucket were almost all from a single target date fund rebalance. So it was just helping a client rebalanced the target date. Very constructive on solutions and solutions has many meanings in the asset management industry I would say. For us, we\u2019ve made a big push on the 401(k) target date fund category where we\u2019ve had several new mandates and we have several promising prospects. But solutions also exist at a broader level where occasionally we\u2019ll compete frequently for institutional mandates where somebody will put out a mandate and ask you to come up with your best ideas to deliver against that set of assets. ", "So it comes back a little bit to my comment that Betsy brought up in my discussion with Ron O'Hanley around using asset allocation as one of the key levers in driving our asset management business both at the target date fund, at the intermediary level where increasingly intermediaries are looking for solutions oftentimes derived out of ETFs, as well as at the big institutional bucket. So we think we have a lot of the right asset classes in the right chassis as in ETFs and we also believe we bring a lot of expertise with regard to asset allocation knowledge. So bringing those things together is one of the most important thrusts for SSGA going forward. ", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Thank you. Good morning Mike. Good morning Jay. You pointed out, Mike, that you're mixing your assets a little differently because of the SLR and different capital ratios and you've added to your loan book. And I recognized the loan book as a percentage of assets is not very significant for you folks. It's less than your two competitors of course. But can you share with us on the leverage loans where do you think that may go on a go-forward basis? And your total loan growth was about 14% on a year-over-year basis. Should we expect that kind of growth to continue for the rest of the year?", "Mike Bell", "Sure, Gerard. It\u2019s Mike. Regarding leverage loans specifically, I would expect that that will remain a relatively small part of the overall balance sheet. So at this point we have a total asset there of $2.7 billion. I would expect that we\u2019ll probably have some growth over time relative to that $2.7 billion, but I think it\u2019s unlikely that it would grow that it would get to the point where it was say double that number. I think that\u2019s highly unlikely for the foreseeable future. So again it is a nice complement to the derisking that we\u2019ve had to do as Glenn had asked about derisking moving out of mortgage back and asset backs into treasuries. ", "It gives us a little bit of an offset relative to that, but not a huge part of our overall balance sheet. The rest of the loan book primarily relates to loans that we\u2019ve made in support of our client relationships, specifically for example loans to 40 Act funds would be an example. Again under the new regulatory expectations, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have a significant amount of growth in that business simply because those tend to be relatively tight spread loans. And again in an environment where the SLRs are binding constraint, that\u2019s a challenge. So I would not say that we would expect a huge growth in the loan book really for the remainder of 2015.", "Operator", "Your final question is from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "I just had a quick question on regulatory and compliance costs. You mentioned previously that they were going to be up year on year and first quarter you said that they were up. But if I think about it from the first quarter to the fourth quarter, are they going to go up from the first quarter or is that $300 million run rate in the other expenses a good run rate for that line item?", "Mike Bell", "Brian, it\u2019s Mike. First, I think what\u2019s most important really of course is the full year outlook and I\u2019ve made the comments around the full year outlook on expense growth relative to fee growth a couple of times. I think that\u2019s the most important thing is to look at the overall expense levels as opposed to just a single line item like other operating expenses. Nevertheless in answer to your direct question, I do expect that we\u2019ll see an increase in other operating expenses over the course of 2015. Again that category tends to be somewhat lumpy, but it\u2019s typically driven by a combination of regulatory compliance spending as well as legal expenses. I do expect that those will be higher than the levels that we saw in Q1 which were seasonally low.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time.", "Jay Hooley", "Okay, Brandy. Thank you and thanks to everyone for participating on the call today. We look forward to speaking to you during the second quarter call which will happen in July.

Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today are Chairman CEO, Jay Hooley, who\u2019ll speak first, then Mike Bell, our CFO will take you through our second quarter 2015 earnings slide presentation which is available for download in the investor relation section of our Web site at www.statestreet.com.

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change.", "Now, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Hooley", "Thanks Anthony and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter 2015 results reflect the strength of our core business as evidenced by 4% growth in service fees compared to the first quarter of 2015 and the benefit of the seasonal increase in securities finance activity. Net interest revenue in the second of 2015 continued to experience pressure as resulted the ongoing low interest rate environment. Overall we remain on track for the growth rate of operating basis fee revenue to exceed the growth rate of operating basis expenses by at least 200 basis points in 2015.", "We remained focused on returning capital to our shareholders. During the second quarter of 2015 we purchased approximately 350 million of our common stock and have approximately $1.45 billion remaining on our March 15th, common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase of $1.8 billion of our common stock through June 30, 2016. We also increased our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.34 per share in the second quarter of 2015.", "Now I would like to provide a brief overview of economic and market developments and how our business is affected. Europe has been a major source of marketing stability in the recent past. First modest signs of recovery against the backdrop of zero or even negative yield contributed to the sharpest rise in European bond yield since the resolution of the European debt crisis back in 2010. European equity markets responded by giving back half of the year-to-date gains from the peak of May 21st with some recoveries more recently.", "The European debt crisis is still of course very much with us in the form of Greece and has monopolized the headlines from much of the past few weeks. The uncertainty as to whether a deal with Greece could first be reached and now implemented has helped to push investors to move assets away from emerging markets and also contributed to increased foreign exchange volatility and volumes compared to the second quarter of 2014.", "However volatility in FX market was lower than first quarter 2015. Not all the risk in global markets has been driven by Europe, Chinese equities fell by more than 30% from the peak giving back more than half of the gains for the year and it's concerned about the growth in China. Although recently government [intervention] has provided some support to equity markets there. Combined these significant disruptions drove market down in June and into July and have reduced risk appetite. Despite these international risks our view of divergence in 2015 still holds as we see easing of monetary policy outside the U.S. but we still expect to see tightening in the U.S.", "This led to a much stronger U.S. dollar so far in 2015. Much of the initial change occurred in a first quarter 2015 in anticipation of U.S. tightening and the US dollar has generally moved sideways since then as the markets are waiting to see when tightening might actually start in the U.S. Together these events and trends impact our business in several meaningful ways. First and most significantly, the low interest rate environment continues to negatively impact our net interest revenue and net interest margin as a higher yielding portfolio investments mature or experience pre-payments and then those funds are reinvested in lower yielding investments.", "Second, amidst the various Central Bank actions and changes to various market structures, we continue to experience high levels of deposits. As you know, we imposed charges for holding Euro deposits in the fourth quarter 2014 with a number of increases in the charges so far this year. We are continuing to have discussions with our clients regarding excess deposits given the negative effect of these deposits on our capital.", "Third, the stronger U.S. dollar has slowed the growth of our servicing fee revenue relative to 2014. However it's important to note that excluding the impact of the stronger US dollar our core business performed well benefiting from growth in our client relationships. Furthermore towards the end of second quarter 2015 we start a number of significant market disruptions which reduced risk appetite.", "Now I'd like to discuss asset servicing and asset management businesses. Demonstrating a continuing priority to provide solutions to our clients we added a 143 billion of new servicing commitments during the second quarter. Importantly these wins were broadly diversified across sectors and geographies. U.S. to be serviced that remained to be installed in Q2 period totaled $174 billion at June 30 and we continue to see deep and diverse pipeline.", "Our asset management business experienced net outflows of $65 billion during the second quarter of 2015, driven primarily by net outflows of $36 billion from institutional passive equity, 17 billion from ETF primarily institutionally oriented market index funds and 17 billion from cash products.", "The significant drivers of passive equity outflows were included rebalancing and cash need by some of our clients due to lower commodity prices. Despite the net asset outflows the impact on net new business revenues were relatively minimal because much of the redemptions were priced lower than the net contributions we received in the quarter. Our asset management business continues to be innovative and has launched 45 new products in the first six months of 2015.", "OneLine is off to a fast start is despite a double line total return taxable ETF which is an active fixed income ETF launched in partnership with DoubleLine, it's attracted 800 million in net flows post launch which ranks as the second most successful ETF launched in the U.S. this year.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Mike who'll review our financial performance for the second quarter and after that Mike and I will be open to take your call.", "Mike Bell", "Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our operating basis results, I\u2019ll comment on a non-operating charge included in our 2Q '15 GAAP basis results. We recorded an after-tax charge of $156 million, or $0.37 a share in 2Q '15 to increase our legal accrual associated with indirect foreign exchange matters. Although we believe these recorded legal accruals will address the financial demands associated with the previously disclosed claims and active investigations regarding our indirect foreign exchange business asserted in the United States by governmental entities and civil litigants.", "Significant non financial terms remain outstanding and settlement agreements have not been finalized. Consequently there can be no assurance that we will enter into these settlements that the cost of the new settlements or other resolutions of any such matters will not materially exceed our accruals or that other potentially material claims related to our indirect foreign exchange business will not be asserted against us. As I'm sure you can appreciate settlement discussions are confidential and we're not able to make more specific comments on these matters at this time.", "Now refer to Slide 7 for discussion of our 2Q '15 operating business results and from the six months ended June 30, 2015 which I'll refer to as year-to-date. By way of summary 2Q '15 results were driven by strong servicing fees and the seasonal increase in securities finance revenue offset by lower FX trading revenue and continued pressure on NIR. Year-to-date EPS increased approximately 7% compared to the year ago period. Total revenue increased 3.3% from the year ago period reflecting strength in core servicing and management fees. Trading services revenue and securities finance, partially offset by lower NIR and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.", "Compared to the year ago period year-to-date fee revenues were negatively impacted by approximately a $149 million from the stronger U.S. dollar, largely offset by a similar benefit in total expenses. Our operating basis effective tax rate for 2Q '15 was 29.6% which is lower than our current expectation for the full year. The first half of 2015 operating basis effective tax rate of 29.1% is also lower than our current full year 2015 expectations primarily due to some one-time items in the first half of 2015 and the timing of our tax advantage investments.", "We continue to expect the operating basis tax rate to average within a range of 30% to 32% over the course of the full year. On the capital front in 2Q 2015 we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 a share and purchased approximately $350 million of our common stock. In addition we issued $750 million of preferred stock during 2Q 2015 with the first semiannual dividend to be paid in the third quarter of 2015.", "On Slide 8, year-to-date fee revenue increased 5.1% while expenses increased 2.4% versus a year-ago. Importantly on a constant currency basis year-to-date fee revenue increased 8.8%. We continue to make progress against our targets for operating basis total fee revenue growth to outpace operating basis expense growth by at least 200 basis points for the full year 2015 relative to 2014.", "Turning now to Slide 10, I'll discuss additional details of our operating basis revenue for 2Q '15. First I would note that the stronger U.S. dollar adversely impacted total fee revenue by approximately $71 million as compared to 2Q '14 with a similar benefit to total expenses. Net interest revenue was adversely impacted by the strong U.S. dollar by approximately $17 million compared to 2Q '14. Foreign currency translation did not materially affect sequential quarterly results.", "Servicing fees were up from 2Q '14 primarily due to net new business and stronger U.S. equity markets partially offset by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. On a constant currency basis servicing fees were up approximately 7% compared to the year-ago period. Management fees increased modestly relative to the year-ago primarily due to higher U.S. equity markets and net new business partially offset by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. On a constant currency basis management fees increased approximately 6% compared to the year-ago period.", "Total trading services revenue increased from 2Q 2014 due to higher FX trading revenue reflecting higher volatility in volumes. Compared to 1Q '15 FX trading revenue decreased due to lower volatility. Securities finance revenue increased from 2Q '14 primarily due to new business in enhanced custody and was higher than 1Q '15 reflecting the seasonal increase of revenues in this business which tends to peak in the second quarter. Processing fees and other revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue associated with tax evasion investments.", "Moving now to Slide 11. You can see our operating basis net interest revenue and net interest margin continue to be challenged in the prolonged low interest rate environment. Operating basis in IR decreased from 2Q '14 primarily due to lower market interest rates partially offset by higher client deposits. ", "Now let's turn to Slide 12 to review 2Q '15 operating basis expenses. Total operating basis expenses increased 3.5% compared to 2Q 2014. As a reminder 1Q '15 expenses included an incremental $137 million associated with the seasonal deferred incentive compensation for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes. Compared to the 2Q 2014 result compensation and benefits expenses increased modestly reflecting increased cost to support to business and regulatory initiatives mostly offset by the benefit of the stronger U.S. dollar.", "Transaction processing service expenses increased primarily due to higher volumes. Occupancy expenses decreased from 1Q '15 reflecting certain one-time positive items in 2Q '15 for 3Q '15 we expect occupancy expenses to increase as the beneficial items of 2Q '15 are unlikely to repeat. Other operating expenses increased sequentially and from the year-ago quarter primarily due to additional regulatory and compliance costs.", "Turning now to Slide 13. I will provide a brief overview of our June 30, 2015 balance sheet. During 2Q '15 we took several actions to move towards our balance sheet optimization and regulatory compliance objectives. The impact included a small increase in the duration of our investment portfolio assets.", "Now turn to Slide 14 to review our capital position. As you can see we remained well capitalized which has enabled us to accomplishing top priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. At June 30th, our common equity Tier 1 ratios under the Basal III fully phased in standardized approach increased from March 31st principally due to lower credit risk. Under the fully phased and advanced approach our common equity Tier 1 ratios remained relatively unchanged from March 31st. ", "The fully phased in holding company supplementary leverage ratio increased from 1Q '15 primarily due to the issuance of $750 million of preferred stock in 2Q '15. On Monday Federal Reserve issued the final [GSIP] rule which contains the methodology used to determine the capital surcharge for the eight systematically important U.S. Banks. The Federal Reserve's estimate for State Street indicates a surcharge of 1.5% and this is consistent with our discussion of the potential impact of the proposed rule during our investor day this past February.", "The primary driver of the higher surcharge under the final rule is a level of non-operational deposits from clients which rule classifies short-term wholesale funds. Now that the rule is final we'll incorporate the surcharge into our balance sheet and capital optimization efforts. Since excess deposits on the primary driver on the higher surcharge this final rule increases the importance of our objective to materially reduce these excess deposits.", "Now I'll guess the question likely we are on investors and analyst minds and that is how is our program tracking to reduce the level of excess deposits or our balance sheet. We continue to have discussions with our largest clients regarding the implications for our balance sheet associated with excess deposits and to work together to identify solutions. Although these discussions were constructive our average excess deposits in 2Q '15 did increase as the external factors driving these balances did not abate.", "We continue to take actions appropriate for each market for example in Europe we've increased the rate we are charging for Euro deposits. So overall we're targeting a net reduction in excess deposits over the remainder of the year from the 2Q '15 levels.", "Turning now to Slide 15, we continue to maintain our outlook for the full year 2015. Despite the weaker Euro exchange rate we continue to expect 2015 total operating basis fee revenue to increase 4% to 7% compared to full year 2014. We also continue to target our operating basis total fee revenue growth to outpace our operating basis expense growth by at least 200 basis points for the full year 2015 relative to 2104. Regarding NIR we expect full year 2015 operating basis NIR to be between $2.16 billion and $2.22 billion. The range assumes that the Fed increases rates in December of 2015. The administered rates do not change in Europe and client deposits will decline over the remainder of the year from their 2Q '15 levels.", "We expect to the year at the lower-end of the range as there are no rate increases in the U.S. Lastly we continue to expect our operating basis effective tax rate to be approximately 30% to 32% for the full year of 2015. Since our 2015 year-to-date tax rate was 29.1%, we expect the operating basis effective tax rate for the back half of 2015 to be in the range of 32% to 34%. ", "So in summary our 2Q '15 results were driven by positive momentum in servicing fees and securities finance seasonality offset by softer FX trading revenue and continued pressure on net interest revenue. We continue to focus on our key priorities in delivering value-added solutions to our clients, investing in growth initiatives, diligently managing expenses and returning capital to shareholders. And with that I'll turn the call back to Jay.", "Jay Hooley", "Thanks Mike and I have nothing further to say, Holly so we can open the call up to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. I'll now introduce to our first caller. Your first caller's name is Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.", "Ashley Serrao", "How you thinking about the duration of your portfolio and capacity to extend and like a 50% of your portfolio now being fixed which is the highest it has been in the while and only 1 billion of purchases in 2Q which is a lowest as it's been in a while.", "Mike Bell", "So, good morning Ashley it's Mike. First of all there is been no change in our overall philosophy Ashley and that is that as it relates to the investment portfolio we continue to invest through the cycle. We continue to have the same type of ALM kinds of risk management practices that we've had in the past. Related to your specific question around the durations, yes it is the case that the -- we can sell in particular some floating rate ABS securities into queue and as a result what's left in the portfolio doesn't have longer average duration but again importantly the overall duration of the assets out of our balance sheet did not change materially quarter-over-quarter. As those -- we did have a higher amount left in cash at the end of the quarter. So again I would expect that there would be no material change over the remainder of the year in terms of our philosophy but we will continue to make these tactical changes to work towards balance sheet optimization particularly under the new regulatory requirements.", "Ashley Serrao", "So does this also mean that the -- that the time line that you provided at analyst day for NIM to reset to higher levels remains unchanged.", "Mike Bell", "That is correct Ashley. At this time no change to those longer-term expectations. So obviously there is a lot going on in the environment in terms of how long will it take to get there between market interest rates and the regulatory environment but no change at this point in terms of our long-term expectations.", "Ashley Serrao", "Final question here. Can you just give us an update on your efforts to bolster your European ETF business? And also to drive a focus on return on capital from a compensation standpoint?", "Jay Hooley", "Let me start that one Ashley, the ETF business is present in North America, Europe and Asia although as you I think pointed out we\u2019re much more heavy in the U.S. than in Europe and we've been focusing on the European ETF business. It's been really in two dimensions, one is adding distribution wholesalers that largely sell into the private bank and banking networks on the continent in Europe that\u2019s going well. We've made several hires over the course of the last six months. So from a standpoint of feet on the ground distribution we continue to ramp up. Actually the second place that our efforts are going is in the product development side which is a kind of a two key elements of successfully to add franchise. And as I noted in my comments 45 new products introduced so far this year, some portion of those are in Europe. So I would say the effort is underway, we think it's a robust opportunity for us, one of the key opportunities for SSGA.", "Your second question Ashley was our efforts to improve our return on equity?", "Ashley Serrao", "First from a compensation standpoint, when you look at new business?", "Jay Hooley", "Look at new business, I'm still not sure I got the source of the question. Let me try. Maybe you are referring to is that recently as return on capital has been a more prominent part of how you look at us and how we look at our business. We've turned to looking at return on capital from a customer standpoint and we will have by the end of the year, I think our top 200 customers all calculated out with regards to what the return on capital is, and those statistics end up with client relationship people and their challenge is to improve that return on capital. And I think the closer we get that to our top customers the better shot we have at rebalancing mix whether it's product mix or client profitability in order to drive improved return on capital for initially that 200 customers. And we think between what we\u2019re doing at the top of the house principally on the balance sheet and in excess deposits and then what we\u2019re doing with those 200 customers that\u2019s the right blend of strategies in order to make sure that we consistently improve our return on equity over time.", "Mike Bell", "Ashley it's Mike I would just add two other points. One is we have incorporated that same discipline in terms of looking at returns at the client level on prospected new business as well. So it is both a new business initiative as well as the existing customers that the Jay described. And the second point I would do is just to reinforce something that Jay said and that is in the near-term the most important thing we can do to improve the company's ROE is to reduce the non-operational deposits and or get those price that they are going to stay on the balance sheet get those price to pay for the required capital that\u2019s associated in, and I can assure that the entire management team is aligned around that effort.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.", "Glenn Schorr", "Curious, on Slide 24 you gave us the ex-currency impact on both revenue season and expenses. I guess my question is with the operating expenses up 7.4% year-on-year ex-currency, a lot of that\u2019s driven by the other line and that\u2019s legal and regulatory. Are you able to pars that out on what\u2019s legal and what\u2019s regulatory because obviously going forward we\u2019re going to just be able to strip out what\u2019s the bottom-line there is a lot of moving parts here. Fees we get are still growing, currencies impacting but it seems like expenses is just still keeping pace with the revenues.", "Mike Bell", "Sure Glenn its Mike. It is the case that the major driver on the year-over-year increase in other operating expenses is the regulatory compliance expenses. And in particular the outside consulting expenses we had communicated to you at Q1 that we thought those were seasonally low and they have certainly rebounded here at Q2. Basically the work that we have underway right now is number one, over time to reduce those outside consulting expenses by completing the projects, completing and getting up to fully acceptable regulatory expectations but also second over time replacing those outside consultants with full time staff.", "And so I do expect that we will see a reduction in the second half of the year in terms of the other operating expenses related to both of those, I would rather at this not put a precise number on it because it depends upon a number of factors not the least of which is our success rate in terms of hiring full time staff to replace these people. But it is the case of the big driver is the regulatory compliance expenses. Now I would point out just to be completely balanced that we're still on track to meet our full year expectation and that is to have fee revenue growth outpace our overall expense growth by at least 200 basis points. And we view that as a positive accomplishment in this environment. As I've described to you before that's a better result than we had in that metric in 2014 so again in light of the regulatory situation we view that as a positive step forward.", "Glenn Schorr", "Just one other follow up. On the securities finance revenue is up I guess 5%, a lot of it is new business and the environment. I'm just curious, what's enhanced custody and if you're seeing any pressures on either rates, spreads or fee splits?", "Mike Bell", "Sure Glenn, in terms of enhanced custody, enhanced custody was a little less than a third of the securities finance revenue in Q2 so specifically was $48 million of revenue out of a 155 in Q2. In terms of the spreads and fee splits I would say no material change in that environment. I would note that the seasonal trade was in fact less valuable than it's been in prior years. So there wasn't as much benefit from seasonality given the European economic situation. So that in fact was a modest headwind in Q2 versus what it's been in prior years.", "Glenn Schorr", "Just a tiny follow up on the expense commentary we just had. Does that mean the second half on the other line stays at this level given that you know you're still building out the BSAML systems and things like that, should we look for that to on the year-on-year basis still grow but on an absolute dollar basis be level?", "Mike Bell", "Glenn, relative to Q2, I would expect the other operating expenses to be lower in Q3 and Q4 subject to the caveat that that does, it does assume that number one we are effective in executing the initiatives that we have on the table right now. And number two, that we are successful in hiring additional full time staff to replace those outside consulting expenses. And again neither of those are trivial but my expectation at this point is that 338 will not be the run rate going forward to the second half of the year that it would be something lower.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Ken Usdin", "Mike if I could ask you a question about balance sheet leverage on deposits. First of all can you try to help us understand how much you're going to try to move off the balance sheet on those excess deposits? What kind of effect do you think you can have on the leverage ratio and whether the impact of those deposit outflows is reflected in your outlook for NIR?", "Mike Bell", "Sure Ken, good morning. First on the on your specific question on how much do we expect to get off the balance sheet. At this point Ken I'd really prefer not to put a precise number on it, we are in the midst of client communications as we speak and it is a sensitive issue. So we're really looking for a win-win with our clients. I mean just to give a couple of examples, several of our 40 Act fund clients for example are feeling more pressured to hold more liquidity as a result of their own regulatory pressure.", "So again it's not just a question of basically demanding that that liquidity comes off. So instead we're really looking for the win-win there. Another example would be in Europe where certainly with all the turmoil going on economically there we have been viewed as a safe haven by several of our important clients now we're obviously charging more for European deposits than we were earlier this year and we recognize that given the economics of having to issue additional prefs to ultimately pay for these deposits that ultimately we need to earn something in the 60 to 70 basis point range of interest margin to pay for the prefs. It is important either to charge enough to make the economics work or to get the deposits off the balance sheet. And the latter we think could occur either through us charging more or through finding a different win-win with our clients or in fact we think it will naturally happen as interest rates rise. So again I at this point really not commit to a number but I'd rather tell you that we are expecting a reduction in deposit levels in the second half of the year.", "As it relates to your question around NIR what I would remind you is that on average right now for excess deposits we estimate that we're earning a spread in the high teens. So based on that you could conclude that a $10 billion drop in our average excess deposits would reduce near term NIR by $4 million to $5 million in a quarter. And that is built into the updated NIR range that I gave you in the prepared remarks. So I'd rather not give you a specific number but that is the thinking that is in the overall range.", "Ken Usdin", "And then just as a quick follow-up. How do we understand the go, no-go decision on timing and magnitude preferred potential?", "Mike Bell", "Sure, Ken regarding prefs, it really will depend upon a number of things including the overall environment and will include our success rate; both that we're seeing to date but also our expected continued success rate on reducing the level of non-operational deposits. It will include our analysis of our balance sheet for the next CCAR period which is Q4 of this calendar year. So again I'm confident that we could issues prefs if we need to but at this point I would not tell you that we've drawn specific conclusions on a pref insurance plan.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.", "Brian Bedell", "Maybe just on the excess deposits. Can you just give us some number of what they currently are or what the range that you view for excess deposits and then the deposit levels in Europe and UK.", "Mike Bell", "Regarding our current level of excess deposits if we look at Q2 average in particular we estimate that our Q2 average excess deposits were approximately $62 billion which is an increase relative to Q1 of approximately 8 billion. Now importantly I would add for completeness, please remember here that the LCR rules are now in effect and therefore because of our interpretation of those rules and the regulatory expectations related to those rules. Some of the deposits that we've historically thought of as operational deposits don\u2019t in fact qualify under the LCR to be operational deposits.", "So specifically for example, our hedge fund clients and private equity clients just as part of their normal operations is part of us being the custody service provider. We have viewed those historically as operational deposits but there is specifically excluded under the LCR regulations to be included as those. So the round number is 20 billion deposits from those are clients, a portion of those need to be ultimately added to the 62 billion as we calculate LCR over the future. So it's another example of the regulatory environment forcing us to be more conservative than we've done historically.", "So again 62 under our traditional method and let me -- look at this as TBD, as the LCR further unfolds. As it relates to your question around European deposits we did see an increase in deposits in Europe, specifically Q2 average European deposits were $40.5 billion. So call that 36 billion to 37 billion of Euro balance and that was up about 4$.5 billion. relative to the Q1 average levels.", "Jay Hooley", "Brian, just to give you a little -- this is Jay, maybe provide a little bit of nuance color. I was just in Europe a few weeks and I was directly involved in some of these discussions with customers and we're for the major customers who have meaningful excess balance. We're speaking to all of them and I would say a couple of things that to me you're encouraging, I'm convinced we'll make headwind against those. I don\u2019t how much, but when -- but one day we acknowledge the issue, it's a broad based issue. There's even some pressure on the European Banks finally to shed some of these deposits as well. So it's become a more broad based issue.", "I think the discussions -- I reading to some creative alternatives for suites and another approaches to move these deposits off and Mike mentioned that average quarter-to-quarter we've actually seen some progress in some of these specific customers. So, it helps so we're out in front of it, I think the discussions are going well. I think we'll find ourselves with lower excess deposits we end the year. It's hard to say how much.", "Brian Bedell", "And the period ended up much higher but we should probably ignore the -- sincerity and the period numbers that we are assuming. Your idea has really has the direction of the deposit good [ones] and for an average basis is it correct?", "Mike Bell", "That is correct -- we typically see spikes at quarter end but I think the average is more relevant because in fact the capital ratios for example our calculated based on the average.", "Brian Bedell", "And then great just my follow up would be as you were talking before about to look into top 200 customers and trying to assess the return on capital from assessments and then I think you also mentioned you're using this framework for new business and maybe either Jay or Mike you could comment on -- I know banking Europe -- that large middle office deal with Euro that something in the -- you would typically win since you're by far the leader in middle office. How maybe you could frame sort of the view on assessing that for new customers in the go forward dynamic of middle office whether you think you might be more competitive or more disciplined going forward? ", "Jay Hooley", "So I think broadly Brian when you put the return on capital and on a prospective customer, the places that get accentuated are things like any loans that we might have, securities lending particularly indemnified REPO within the product set from services to foreign exchange to securities lending to fund accounting they all have slightly different return on equity calculation. So by looking at it through a return on capital lens you do get a more holistic view. I would say relative to middle-office it's really a profitability equation. It doesn't draw any capital necessarily it's really-- can you drive sufficient profitability in order to make a middle-office deal make sense in the construct of a piece of a larger relationship.", "So I deal with probably more as a traditional accounting and custody relationship as far as its return characteristics but the key component is can you money? As you know we have -- we think it's over 10 trillion in assets that we administer in the middle-office and have been have at this for 15 years maybe. We've learned a lot through the 15 years about what makes us a successful middle-office deal. And for me it's largely about the complexity factor whether it involves lift outs, the degree of customization on the system side. So we continue to have handful of middle-office prospects out there and we look pretty closely at whether or not we can make them a creative rate return over the reasonable period of time.", "Brian Bedell", "And so you are still favorable on this business I assume.", "Jay Hooley", "Yes. And I would say just from a broader trend basis Brian you have no doubt heard more than you probably want to hear about us on our regulatory compliance challenge here it's hitting asset managers, it's hitting asset owners and so middle-office will continue to be a very important incremental product that we sell. We just need to make sure that it's done well with good pricing discipline.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Luke Montgomery with Bernstein Research.", "Luke Montgomery", "Another stab at the securities portfolio, I know you have been realigning the mix of securities for the LCR and then fine tuning the balance sheet overall for the SLR. But in dollar terms what\u2019s driving the shrinkage of the portfolio and should we expect that to continue? Is that part of managing the overall duration of the balance sheet?", "Mike Bell", "Sure, Luke its Mike. First in terms of what\u2019s driving our optimization work, I would really put it in the three different buckets. The first is that, overall we want to improve our capital ratios and then includes the risk based ratios as well as the leverage ratios. Second, we\u2019re looking to improve our mark-to-market sensitivity as measured at the next CCAR cycle, so that\u2019s a consideration and then third of course is the meeting the heightened liquidity expectation. So specifically if we look at for example the sale of our folding rate ABS that\u2019s a good example where we\u2019re getting a relatively low printed spread that we viewed it as having a relatively high mark-to-market sensitivity during the CCAR cycle and of course it doesn't count as HQ away. So that would be an example of something to shrink.", "I would not characterize the changes in the securities portfolio as part of an overall change in the duration of the assets on our balance sheet, as I said in one of the earlier answers the overall duration of the assets of our balance sheet did not change materially sequentially. So in fact what we did was we decreased the folding ABS securities which meant that the remaining duration of the remaining portfolio got longer, but that money for the most part is sitting in cash. I would expect that we would be deploying over the second half of the year round number is approximately 5 billion that at June 30th was sitting in cash. So I would not expect that, again it's based on whole lot of different factors but I would not expect additional shrinkage in the overall investment portfolio in dollar terms over the remainder of the year. But again importantly it is optimization is somewhat of the rubik's cube there is a lot of different consideration.", "So it will be work that we\u2019ll continue to for a while.", "Luke Montgomery", "This is the fourth quarter in a row you provisioned for legal contingencies; I know you can't talk about particulars but just any sense of how far along you are on the need for further provisioning. I don't take this as combative but you excluded from operating basis results, but it's getting to the point of kind of usual or unusual or recurring non-recurring and I think it has an impact in your capital ratio. So any help there will be helpful.", "Jay Hooley", "Let me take a cut at that Lukas, JV. This is the provision relates to the indirect foreign exchange issue that predates 2010 just to put a box around it. And as you noted over the last couple of quarters we've been taking incremental provisions. We believe that we've reached financial terms with the counterparties that we have this deal with. What we haven't done is complete the terms and conditions of the agreement and specific language. We would expect that not only financially but relative to all the agreements that we can reach a conclusion shortly and that we can put this behind us. So I don't know if that helps but we hope that this is from a financial standpoint the end of that issue.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck", "Two follow ups, one on just what you're going through Jay, I noticed there was an update to the operational risk model and you know that putting the pieces together it seems like that's probably due to the fact that you're close to an end in FX charges, is that an accurate read across?", "Mike Bell", "Betsy its Mike. It is the case that we did update the operational risk capital model as we typically do once a year, that was updated in Q2 and that was part of the divergence between the improvements on the standardized approach risk based capital ratios and the advanced approach risk based capital ratios. However that is not driven by our own FX settlement discussions, it's driven by a number of other factors including what the industry experience has been historically.", "Betsy Graseck", "And then is the conclusion when you do conclude the FX legal situation there's no further update to the risk model, the operational risk model.", "Mike Bell", "Betsy, the operational risk model in particular has a lot of different moving parts so I wouldn't try to speculate on future updates to that level. But I would remind you that at this point our binding constraint tends to be the standardized approach and I would expect that to be the case for a while.", "Betsy Graseck", "And then just separately follow up on the non-operating deposits. I guess I'm wondering if we could get a little bit of color Jay from the kind of things that clients could do with you to potentially either reduce or bring on, I'm not sure if this is what you're referring to, but bring on new business that would enable you to potentially change some of the definitions from non operating to operating. For example if it's a broad set of businesses that their folks are doing with you.", "Jay Hooley", "Yes, no, it's really less the latter Betsy, it was, let me just give you a few things. One, I think I mentioned this last call and Mike referenced the SEC is very focused around you know liquidity management and 40 Act and the broader based asset management world and we've introduced a pretty sophisticated tool that allows asset managers to stress their liquidity and so the one way we're helping is we're helping them optimize their own liquidity stress testing which sometimes adds to their liquidity sometimes reduces their liquidity needs. But with regard to the conversations it's usually around can we sweep some of the deposits, can we use repo facility. It gets into that level of how do we move deposits out of pure cash which end up on our balance sheet.", "And there are handful of approaches and depending on the customer and their view of required liquidity in capital we have different outlets. Probably the most important thing that I would leave you with is these are constructive conversations where you know our customers as we would help them, they're looking to help us so it's not contentious it's just how can we do, how can we move these deposits and do it on a sustainable basis. So at period ends we tend to get spikes in deposits we want to manage those down but we're really looking for some more durable sustainable solutions which will allow us to manage these things and control them over time.", "The last point I would make is that you know pricing has always, usually a pretty good way to create behavior and in Europe around the Euro we've introduced pricing, I think we've moved it up three times, it feels like we're reaching that point of equilibrium where it has a cost associated with using our balance sheet and therefore our customers are more sensitive to the cost so we're thinking about not only cost on a ongoing basis but also think about kind of surge pricing that you know if deposits were to go past a certain point the cost of using our balance sheet would go up by a lot and so those discussions and those mechanisms are starting to give us, one we're having better conversations and I think that we are you know likely to improve our situation with regard to excess deposits.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Mike Mayo", "Hi. Can you just reconcile two thoughts on the one end you are the port in the storm, your source are strength in Europe, your earnings assets were up 3% every three months, and on the other end, NIR declined and you expect that to perhaps go lower. Is that all due to the excess deposit issue or is there something else going on to?", "Mike Bell", "So Mike its Mike. Related to Europe, yeah it is the case that we are viewed as a safe haven in Europe and that certainly is a significant contributor to the increase in the deposit base that we saw in Q2 relative to Q1. I mean another issue though is just that the lack of good alternatives for our European clients which relates to your second point and that is that the interest rate environment they are generally along with the credit environment is not particularly attractive. So there is downward pressure on our own NIR related to the assets that back the European deposits. One another point I would note, Jay was talking earlier about a specific client discussions in Europe, I would note that where we've had additional success with some clients in Europe relates to encouraging them through discussions but also with the implied lever of pricing to move out of cash deposits on our balance sheet into for example short-term government bonds and I would expect that over time we'll see more of that movement in Europe for all the reasons that I just mentioned.", "Mike Mayo", "I mean your peers also had earnings asset growth but NIR was higher whereas Euro was down. Is it relates just the degree that you are in Europe that's the difference? Or anything else?", "Mike Bell", "Yes, again Mike I don\u2019t like to really speculate on our competitive results. My interpretation of the comparison that you are drawing here is more from the starting point as oppose to some fundamental difference in mix. And therefore our outlook has really remained relatively unchanged throughout this year in terms of NIR. And I -- it's for all the reasons that we've talked about. We expect that excess deposits to come off in addition until we do get a meaningful improvement in market interest rates. We're going to continue to be negatively impacted by this grind of the turnover in our portfolio. Those dynamics have not changed.", "Mike Mayo", "And that you lowered your NIR upper end of your range just a little bit. Is that right?", "Mike Bell", "That\u2019s correct, that's mainly driven by our view now that it is unlikely that the Bank of England will raise rates in August. If you recall that was one of the assumptions that we had applied in the rising interest rate scenario at the Investor Day. We think that is unlikely to happen at least in August and that\u2019s really the primary reason for the drop in the very upper end of the positive -- environment range.", "Mike Mayo", "And last one, NIR, so you have 62 billion of excess deposits you plan on reducing that. That reduction is in the updated NIR guidance. You're just not telling us how much excess deposit reduction you expect to have for competitive end client?", "Mike Mayo", "That is correct Mike and again we have a range built in there as you can imagine because we don\u2019t have a crystal ball and exactly how much they're going to decline but we do have a decline build in there.", "Operator", "Your next will come from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Blostein", "Question for you on expenses. So, maybe just there is a couple of moving pieces obviously, but help us understand how we should I guess think about dollar terms for the back half of the year given the fact that second quarter expense growth was a little bit 20 basis points year-over-year versus the revenue growth which is obviously below kind of your 200 basis points. I get the fact on a year-to-date basis you guys are still looking pretty good. But just kind of curious to see where is their flexibility in the model on the expense front into the back half of the year to help you achieve that 200 basis points plus?", "Mike Mayo", "Sure, I mean the short answer is that it really does depend upon a handful of important factors. One is of course the overall level of net new business that we add in the second half of the year that will directly tie the level of expense that we need to add to service that additional revenues that would be one. Second as I mentioned earlier we do have work underway on the existing regulatory initiatives to work to replace outside consulting expenses with full time staff to the extent of possible and so our success rate there will be a key factor.", "And then lastly, importantly we are looking at some additional expense actions literally as we speak and I would expect to be in a position to provide a more public update at our Q3 earnings call but we are looking at some additional expense actions to see what else can be done improve the overall productivity level beyond the regulatory piece that I mentioned.", "Alex Blostein", "And I guess the comments you guys are making around replacing consultants for full-time staff. When you go through the analysis on and are much spending on consultant versus how much it would cost you bringing in full-time headcount. What\u2019s the net benefit to pretax earnings from doing so?", "Mike Mayo", "I'd really prefer not to try to give you a specific number at this point. Again it's fair to say that we do have some of that benefit built into our overall second half of the year expectations but I'd rather prefer -- rather not disaggregate specific number from our overall thinking.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.", "Jim Mitchell", "Just a quick follow-up I's sorry to be the dead horse on the balance sheet, but ABS was down 7 billion period end that\u2019s a pretty significant increase versus the sort of 2 billion a quarter that you have been doing in the prior year so is that are we getting closer to the end of the rebalancing for the LCR or is there still lot more to do in the ABS side. I am just trying to get a sense of as the NIM compression going to start to be slow a little bit if that is done?", "Mike Bell", "Jim its Mike. First, at this point I expect that it is unlikely that we would have another material transaction that would shrink the ABS portfolio along the lines of what we did in Q2. I think that\u2019s unlikely to happen in the second half of the year. But as I mentioned this optimization work is going to go on for a while. So I wouldn't at this point foreclose the additional actions for example in 2016 along those lines. Again remember that you've got these longer-term objectives it's not just the 2015 objective, we've got these longer-term objectives of strengthening our overall capital ratios and reducing the mark-to-market sensitivities that impact CCAR from as part of just our overall ROE improvement both of those objectives are important and really are somewhat separate from the near-term needs for LCR compliance.", "Jim Mitchell", "But can you give us any help on timing and amount of additional mix shift?", "Mike Bell", "Again Jim I think that the mix shift will continue for several quarters, and again importantly that is factored into the NIR range that we gave in our prepared remarks.", "Jim Mitchell", "And then maybe just a quick follow-up with the guidelines from the Fed and they said SLR will not be part of the next CCAR. Does that some of the pressure off in terms of give you more time to think about how entire potentially higher interest rates effects deposits and takes the pressure off on the comfort side, can you give it another year to see how things progress or do you still have to kind of build in a glide path.", "Mike Bell", "Jim you are absolutely right that was helpful to us probably to helpful to others as well that the NPR that was released around the 2016 CCAR indicated that SLR would not be part of the process for this year that is in fact helpful. I would point out though that tier 1 leverage was to constraint at this past CCAR and that remains an important consideration for the next CCA, so it's certainly means to that it's still very important that we pay attention to the non-operational deposits as it relates to the capital for next year and any potential pref issuance in particular.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Adam Beatty with Bank of America.", "Adam Beatty", "Question on the pipeline and backlog in asset servicing, it looks like the backlog were to be installed came down somewhat in the quarter. Does that create kind of a natural bias for higher servicing revenue subject of course to markets and currencies and also looks like the win rate ticked down a little bit do you expect that to normalize?", "Jay Hooley", "Sure, let me take that one, this is Jay. On the pipeline more broadly nothing really has changed its robust, its diverse, there is activity I just gone through over the last six weeks I've been on all continents and visited 15 different offices and there is a lot of activity that I think is stimulated by constrained environment compliance and regulatory. So pipelines are solid. For the quarter we committed I think it was 143 billion and massive, that was a little low relative to what we've been running probably last couple of years we've been in the 200 billion to 300 billion range. I wouldn't read into it, I think just some other stuff this timing.", "So no read through there. With regard to I think at the beginning of your question, we've got 174 billion I think that sounds right of assets that has committed that have not yet installed and I'm looking around the table, I think that\u2019s about where we've been historically. So the relationship between pipeline, kind of a funnel what we win and how we implement seems pretty steady. I would say in the 174 and in the 143 there aren\u2019t big lumpy two year implantations, which will delay revenue, so we should expect a pretty steady stream of service fee revenue that would trickle out of those kind of few factors.", "Mike Bell", "Adam its Mike, the only other thing I would add is you noted our GS revenue was strong in the quarter relative to both Q1 as well as a year ago and certainly we've gotten good contribution, we got contribution in Q2 from the net new business piece of it.", "Adam Beatty", "Also, on the asset management in terms of some of the redemptions in past, we've heard a couple of times this quarter about international and sovereign clients maybe having some liquidity needs based on lower commodity prices. What's your outlook on that given where things are right now and given what you're hearing from your clients? Is there a potential for an additional draw down there or is that pretty much over in?", "Jay Hooley", "I think that if you look at oil prices as probably maybe the biggest single driver of that, you know the, I don't know what your outlook for you know, crude is but it feels to me like was an adjustment from over a $100 a barrel to $50 a barrel as opposed to months and time kind of adjustment. So I wouldn't expect there would be big additional outflows, I don't know I mean I think it's unlikely oil will go lower and therefore it feels more like a one-time adjustment versus something that we're going to see every quarter.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.", "Brennan Hawken", "So first question on FX, revenues looked light versus peers and just wanted to, I don\u2019t know whether there's a connection here but we saw the FX revenues come in a bit late and then we continue to see these FX charges ratchet and the discussion is ongoing. Is it possible that there's a connection there?", "Jay Hooley", "No, no connection at all Bren, you know if you look at -- we track as you'd expect pretty closely the indirect FX, the direct FX, the platform FX and all pretty steady as she goes, I think the -- you know it's hard to make any judgment on a quarter, I think if back at Investor Day I don't know if you recall this, but we showed our FX performance in absolute terms versus the near end peers both electronic and directly traded and it's quite a bit higher than on an absolute basis. And I think if you stretch back over a couple two or three quarters and look at trends you would see our FX performance is good as if not better than the peers.", "So nothing really in the quarter and certainly no connection between these litigation discussions which are historical and our customers understand that, have had no influence on indirect FX which is where if it had influence it would have influence.", "Brennan Hawken", "And then maybe a bit more of a broad or strategic question on expenses. You know certainly this is not easy times for large financial services companies and GSIBs but you could argue that higher regulatory expense pressure is not really environmental but now it's just part of the new operating landscape rather than being a transient factor. And I know you referenced that you're looking to do a few things, later in the year, so clearly that's not lost on you but you know, I sense from conversations with investors that there's increasing frustration on a lack of push on the expense front. The revenue kind of is what it is, expenses are bit more in your control, why is it, can you help us understand why there hasn't been more movement on the expense front.", "Jay Hooley", "Yes, let me start that one and then Mike can maybe jump in. So first off I agree with your point of view that the regulatory compliance is a structural shift and I think most firms are trying to deal with the immediacy and then the ongoing nature of, how no idea comply with these things but how do you comply with these things in a highly automated way which is the kind of way we would look at anything at State Street.", "So we've got a combination of addressing that with you know manpower, consultants, individuals but ultimately want to apply technology and drive down the cost of complying not only for ourselves but as a service to our customers. But let me just introduce another front which is maybe what the comment that Mike made few cycles ago. You know we went through the five year IT and Ops transformation plan and I think it was, it set us up nicely. You've heard me talk about the fact that we\u2019ve had great core discipline around core systems, we haven't drifted to multiple systems and we\u2019ve taken those common systems and improved the processes and we've leveraged work sites, China, Poland at all, we continue to do that. There's an ongoing opportunity now that we've moved in that direction to continue to apply technology to replace labor and so you know part of what has underpinned the last year have been the regulatory and compliance cost offset by some of the operational improvements that we're making which is really a fine technology to reduce labor.", "There is much more opportunity to do more there, so what we're thinking about is the way to accelerate some of that activity to do more assistance to accelerate the minimization of the labor content and the work output, if I can say that way. And we view that and we have viewed that as something that's ongoing because we don\u2019t believe among that the regulatory compliance pressure lets up and we don\u2019t know when the top line environment gets better.", "So the thing we can control is the expenses, so we've in the background been continuing to invest in technology to improve our operational efficiency but the question is can we do more; can we accelerate some of that activity. If that helps?", "Operator", "And our last question will come from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Starting with some of the regulatory type issues that is being going on with BSA, AML and then with the Wells notice but you received I think relating to still lobbying around the pensions business. Are those having any impact on growth and that new generation you kind of have to focus a bit more internally rather than externally and going out and winning new business?", "Jay Hooley", "Yes, fair question Geoffrey. I would say no, pretty directly the AML, BSA activity is -- we were criticized for not having the level of process that the regulators expected and wanted us to have so we have -- and we've been at this for 18 months. It's a pretty segregated activity that we're conducting country-by-country, business-by-business and so it's pretty content, it's got project plans, it's managed separately from the business line. So I really don\u2019t think this going hinder our ability to grow the revenue line and on the Wells notice reference which again is kind of pre 2012 reference to acquisition of pension retirement plans using consultants and again we are working through that. We've got a different point of view than others on that but it doesn\u2019t, it hasn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t affect any revenue generation.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "And then just a quick follow up on something you said earlier. You mentioned the [GSIP] buffers as a fact that it feeds into the walk around non-operational deposits. Is it all that to come down from 150 bps to 100 bps and so how much you need to do get yourself into the lower bucket?", "Mike Bell", "Geoffrey, its Mike. There are a number of different nuances with the final rule that just came out on Monday. So I think it's a little bit early to give you a specific number but it's not lost of us that the increased excess deposits over the last couple of years is the single biggest factor driving our [GSIP] surcharge up and therefore I just -- it's a really -- it increases what was already a priority. It increases the importance of reducing those.", "Now again, some of that will happen from our actions. We think some of that will happen naturally as market interest rates rise but it does increase the importance of that work. I think it's the most important thing I wouldn\u2019t leave you for this way. I think that a 150 basis points [GSIP] surcharge by itself is manageable but again there are -- number one, we would obviously like to have reduce the as the piece that's related to the excess deposits and just more of an incentive to get that accomplish.", "Jay Hooley", "And just to be clear for everybody on the call that it's our expectation as if we do that and 150 or whatever it is vary. So there will be recalibration of that. So there is a motivation incentive to draw deposits down.", "Operator", "Thank you and that was our final question. I'll turn the conference call back over to management for closing remarks.", "Jay Hooley", "Yes Holly just a quick thanks to everybody for their attention and we look forward to speaking you after the third quarter. Thanks.", "Operator", "Once again we'd like to thank you for your participation on today's State Street's conference call.

Ostler - SVP & Global Head-Global Investor Relations", "Thanks, Stephanie. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today are Chairman and CEO, Jay Hooley, who will speak first. Then Mike Bell, our CFO, will take you through our third quarter 2015 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. During the Q&A, please limit your questions to two questions and then requeue.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include operating basis and other measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our 3Q 2015 slide presentation.", "In addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors, such as those factors referenced in our discussion today in our 3Q 2015 slide presentation under the heading, Forward-Looking Statements, and in our SEC filings, including the risk factors section of our 2014 Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change.", "For those of you planning ahead, please note that we expect to release our earnings in the fourth Wednesday of the month, following each quarter-end, starting in 2016. This is a change from the current practice of the fourth Friday of the month, following each quarter-end. This is due to how the calendar works in 2016 and 2017. As a result, we currently expect to release our 4Q 2015 results on Wednesday, January 27, 2016.", "Additionally, please save the date for our 2016 Investor Day, which is currently scheduled for Wednesday, February 24, at the Mandarin Hotel in New York City.", "Now, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, everyone. Our performance in the third quarter was impacted by the sharp decline in global equity markets, including a more pronounced decline in emerging markets. While I'm not pleased with the negative effect on our earnings during the quarter, I do believe that over the long-term our relatively higher exposure to global equities in emerging markets will benefit us.", "In light of the continued challenging environment, we are accelerating our multiyear plan to further digitize our operating environment and create cost efficiencies. The plan follows on our successful Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. We are targeting savings that are in the range of approximately $500 million when fully implemented over a four- to five-year timeframe, which is similar to the duration of our recently completed Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. Mike will provide additional details on our plan in his comments.", "As many aspects of the new regulatory landscape are taking shape, we're moving aggressively to position ourselves to comply. An example of this during the quarter was the significant progress we made in decreasing excess deposits on our balance sheet. Despite the market environment during the third quarter, we were able to advance our core business, growing operating basis fee revenue by 4% and 1%, compared to the nine months and quarter ending September 30, 2014, respectively and adding $141 billion of new servicing commitments during the third quarter.", "We continue to emphasize returning capital to our shareholders. During the third quarter of 2015, we purchased approximately $350 million of our common stock and at quarter-end had approximately $1.1 billion remaining on our March 2015 common stock purchase program, authorizing the share of up to $1.8 billion of our common stock through June 30, 2016.", "Now, I'd like to provide a brief overview of economic and market developments and how our business is affected. Concerns about global growth became more acute in the third quarter of 2015 with declines in emerging market growth rates, notably China, further degradation in commodity prices, and even the previously solid economic performance in the U.S. showing signs of hesitation. Equity markets became more correlated as a result.", "Gyrations in Chinese equity markets, which had been ignored earlier in the year, began to impact markets more broadly. Global equity markets posted their worst quarter since the third quarter of 2011, which was exacerbated by double-digit depreciation in many emerging market currencies, reflecting investment outflows from those markets. A modicum of calm has recently returned in October following the Federal Reserve's September decision to not raise interest rates amid weaker global conditions and accompanying financial stress. With the risk of deflation returning, investors now question whether U.S. monetary policy tightening will begin at all this year.", "Together these events and trends impact our business in several meaningful ways. First, the lower equity markets have caused our assets under custody and administration and assets under management to decrease. This decline in assets combined with the associated risk-off sentiment has resulted in lower fee revenue. Second, the low interest rate environment continues to negatively impact our net interest revenue and net interest margin. This is in part driven by our higher-yielding portfolio investments maturing or experiencing prepayments. And then those funds being reinvested in lower-yielding investments.", "Now, I'd like to discuss our Asset Servicing and Asset Management business. We added $141 billion of new servicing commitments during the quarter across all sectors and geographies. New assets to be serviced that remain to be installed in future periods totaled $195 billion at September 30. And we continue to see deep and diverse pipelines.", "Our Asset Management business experienced net outflows of $29 billion during the third quarter of 2015, driven primarily by net outflows of $42 billion from institutional mandates, partially offset by $10 billion of inflows to ETFs. The significant drivers of passive equity outflows include rebalancing and cash needs of some of our clients due to lower commodity prices, which is a continuation of a trend that we saw in the second quarter, as well as an expected redemption from one large client.", "The SPDR DoubleLine Total Return Tactical ETF, which is an active equity income ETF launched in partnership with DoubleLine, has gained further momentum. It has attracted $1.2 billion in net flows post-launch and now ranks as the most successful ETF launched in the U.S. this year. Additionally during the third quarter, we launched another 13 new ETFs, bringing our year-to-date new launches to 22.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike, who'll review our financial performance for the third quarter, and then we will open the call to all of your questions. Mike?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our operating basis results, I will comment on significant items, which affected our third quarter 2015 GAAP basis results as highlighted on slide four.", "First, we recorded an after-tax charge of $47 million related to severance for targeted staff reductions. This measure was taken to better calibrate the company's expenses to the current environment and will involve a gross and net worldwide reduction of approximately 600 and 200 positions respectively. We expect these staff reductions to be completed by the end of 2016 with projected expense savings of $50 million with approximately 75% of the savings to positively impact 2016 results.", "Second, we recorded an after-tax gain of $49 million from the sale of commercial real estate acquired as a result of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. And lastly, we recorded a tax benefit of $59 million related to a reduction of an Italian deferred tax liability as a consequence of our European legal entity restructuring activities.", "Now, I'll refer to slide seven for a discussion of our operating basis results for 3Q 2015 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which I'll refer to as year-to-date. The 3Q 2015 results primarily reflect the challenges from the declining global equity markets and persistently low market interest rates, as well as the seasonal decline in securities finance in comparison to the second quarter. 3Q 2015 EPS of $1.16 decreased from 2Q 2015 and from the year-ago quarter. Year-to-date EPS decreased slightly compared to the same period a year ago.", "Importantly, compared to the year-ago period, year-to-date total fee revenue increased 3.7%. 3Q 2015 total fee revenue increased 1% from the third quarter of 2014 and decreased 3% from 2Q 2015, primarily reflecting the adverse market conditions. Compared to the year-ago period, year-to-date fee revenue was negatively impacted by $212 million from the stronger U.S. dollar, largely offset by a similar benefit in total expenses.", "Regarding capital, in 3Q 2015, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 a share and purchased approximately $350 million of our common stock. Lastly, we're pleased that we made progress on a key priority to reduce the level of deposits on our balance sheet.", "So moving to slide eight, year-to-date fee revenue increased 3.7%, while expenses increased 2.8% versus a year ago. On a constant-currency basis, year-to-date fee revenue increased 7.2%.", "Turning to slide 10, I'll discuss additional details of our operating basis revenue for 3Q 2015. Servicing fees were down from 3Q 2014, primarily due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and lower international equity markets, partially offset by net new business and higher transaction volumes.", "While the EAFE equity index was down approximately 7%, our 3Q 2015 servicing fees were particularly impacted by the 15% sequential decline in emerging-market average daily levels. We estimate that approximately 10% of our servicing fees are tied to emerging markets.", "3Q 2015 management fees decreased relative to a year ago, primarily due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, lower performance fees and lower international equity markets. Total trading services revenue in 3Q 2015 increased from 3Q 2014 due to the higher foreign exchange trading revenue, reflecting higher volatility in volumes. And compared to 2Q 2015, trading services revenue increased due to higher direct foreign exchange trading revenue.", "Securities finance revenue increased from 3Q 2014, primarily due to new business in enhanced custody, and was lower than 2Q 2015 reflecting seasonality. Processing fees and other revenue increased from the year-ago period and sequentially, primarily due to the impact of certain valuation adjustments and higher revenue from bank-owned life insurance.", "Moving now to slide 11, as you can see, our operating basis net interest revenue continued to be pressured due to the prolonged low interest rate environment and our success in the third quarter in reducing client deposits. The decline in deposits during the third quarter largely occurred towards the end of the quarter, thus explaining the smaller decline in the average deposit balances quarter-over-quarter versus the period end balances quarter-over-quarter.", "Now, let's turn to slide 12 to review third quarter 2015 operating basis expenses. Total operating basis expenses decreased slightly from 2Q 2015. Other expenses included a recovery from certain Lehman Brothers claims, which was largely offset by a single securities processing loss of $38 million, which resulted in total securities processing costs for 3Q 2015 of $41 million. This loss was a specific event, and we've evaluated its nature and are implementing control enhancements to mitigate recurrence.", "Compared to the third quarter of 2014, compensation and benefits expenses increased, reflecting increased costs for new hires to support new business and regulatory initiatives, partially offset by the benefit of the stronger U.S. dollar and lower incentive compensation expense.", "Information systems and communications expenses increased over both periods, reflecting increased cost to support new business and additional data center capacity. Other expenses increased from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to higher professional services fees, including costs to support regulatory initiatives, as well as higher securities processing costs, partially offset by the third quarter 2015 Lehman recovery and lower charitable contributions.", "Turning to slide 13. We note that we continue to reposition our balance sheet. The size of the average investment portfolio decreased by approximately $9 billion from June 30 of 2015. The majority of the decrease was related to the sale of lower-yielding MBS and ABS, partially offset by the increase in U.S. treasuries.", "Now, I'll turn to slide 14 to review our capital position. As you can see, our capital ratios remained strong, which has enabled us to accomplish a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock purchases. At September 30, our common equity Tier 1 ratio under the Basel III fully phased-in standardized approach increased from June 30, principally due to lower credit risk. The fully phased-in holding company supplementary leverage ratio increased to 5.4% on a fully phased-in basis, principally due to our success in reducing client deposits.", "Now, I'll address a question that's likely on investors' and analysts' minds, and that's to provide an update on our efforts to reduce client deposits including the total reduction level that we're targeting. Throughout third quarter 2015, we engaged in productive discussions with clients regarding the implications for our balance sheet associated with excess deposits. While overall deposits declined approximately $44 billion during the quarter, some of that reflected a lower deposit spike at the third quarter end. Importantly, excluding the deposit spikes at quarter-end, we estimate that our balances were $30 billion to $35 billion lower at the end of the third quarter relative to the second quarter, and we view this deposit reduction effort as successful.", "Nevertheless, it's also important to recognize that the external environment can impact deposit levels in the future. And our average fourth quarter balance sheet will be the starting point for our 2016 CCAR submission. In addition, as interest rates increase, we also expect to see further declines in client deposits.", "Turning to slide 15, I'll update you on where we stand regarding our financial outlook for 2015. Primarily due to the third quarter 2015 steep decline in equity markets, particularly in emerging markets, we likely will fall below the previously communicated 4% to 7% growth of operating basis fees in 2015. The continued strength of the U.S. dollar has contributed to downward pressure on fee revenue growth as well.", "Given the weakness in fee revenue, it will be more challenging for us to grow 2015 operating basis total fee revenue at least 200 basis points above the 2015 growth of operating basis expenses. While this quarter's severance action will have an immaterial impact on operating basis expenses within 4Q 2015, overall we do expect that 4Q 2015 operating basis expenses will be lower than 3Q 2015 levels.", "For full-year 2015 operating basis net interest revenue, we currently expect to be near the lower end of our previously communicated range of $2.16 billion to $2.22 billion. Our expectation to be near the lower end of the range primarily reflects both the successful effort in reducing excess deposits and continued low market interest rates.", "Now, I'd like to add some additional detail to Jay's comments on the next stage of our transformation program to digitize our enterprise. To be clear, our objectives are twofold. First, we intend to make further significant reductions in our cost structure. And second, we plan to digitize our interfaces with our clients in order to deliver more value.", "We've decided to accelerate the next stage of this work through the execution of a formal multiyear plan along the lines of the recently completed and successful Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. While we are still finalizing the details of this second phase of work, we anticipate targeting at least $500 million of annual expense savings when fully implemented.", "Importantly, the program will likely involve restructuring costs and investments to fully implement the plan and capture the savings, just as the business ops and information technology transformation program did. The specific timeframe and other parameters are still under development and we look forward to providing a further update on our 4Q 2015 earnings call and review of the detail at our Investor Day on February 24, 2016.", "And with that, I'll turn it back to Jay.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Mike. And, Stephanie, we are now available to open the line to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Your first question is from the line of Luke Montgomery with Bernstein Research.", "Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hey. Good morning. I think last quarter you gave or \u2013 are you declined to give a target on the amount of excess deposits you hope to shed, but you did say you had a range in mind. Was the decline within that range? And what does that indicate about your potential need for incremental preferred issuance? And then I think you said deposits declined $35 billion adjusted for the lower quarter end spike, so where do excess deposits stand now?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. Luke, it's Mike. First of all, one clarification before answering your specific question and that is that we estimate that the deposits if you exclude the quarter end spike were actually down $30 billion to $35 billion. So something in that range of $30 billion to $35 billion rather than explicitly $35 billion. But to answer the main part of your question, first, specifically, yes we're pleased with the progress that we made. We did in fact hit the objective that we had for full year 2015 as of the point in time into the quarter \u2013 third quarter 2015.", "Now, I would point out in reference to your pref question, the main priority we're focused on here is positioning for the next CCAR. So the 2016 CCAR will likely be our near-term binding constraint and will likely be the most important factor in terms of pref issuance in the near-term. And if you recall our CCAR results from the last go-round, the Tier 1 leverage was our binding constraint and it's likely to be our binding constraint again. So as you can imagine, very helpful to reduce deposits by $30 billion to $35 billion in terms of meeting the near term Tier 1 leverage target.", "So in terms of your specific question on the prefs, I do expect that in first quarter of 2016, we'll look at a number of different factors. We'll look at the parameters of the CCAR test. We'll look at the balance sheet for the average fourth quarter 2015 because remember it's not the September 30 balance sheet. It's the average balance sheet over fourth quarter 2015 that's going to be so important in terms of the next CCAR. So, again, maintaining the lower level through fourth quarter is a high priority. But basically, we'll look at all of those things in 2016 and then make some decisions on any pref issuance plans for 2016.", "Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And, Luke, let me just if I can since I know excess deposits such \u2013 is a meaningful question and issue in your minds. Let me just open that, widen that question a little bit. We've been on at least a year journey with our customers. And I think what's transpired through that is that, one, we've developed a very accurate sense of what's operational and what's excess. We define who the outliers are, we've engaged in conversation around those discussions. We have helped customers facilitate transition to money funds out of treasury products. And we've used fees in order to encourage the right behavior.", "And so regardless of whether we're at where we want to be in the fourth quarter, what's to me more important is that the dialogue is clear and open and we found a lever that is in charging fees on excess deposits, which I believe will allow us to control excess deposits and manage the size of our balance sheet more proactively going forward.", "Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks. And then you provided, I think, a very detailed model-friendly plan with the first phase of the business transformation initiative. I think you said that's forthcoming, but at this point, are you prepared to speak to any detail? What is multiyear plan mean? Will the savings be frontend or backend loaded? Do you anticipate a bottom-line impact? Or is this just offsetting the growth rate of expenses?", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Let me start that, Luke, and Mike can weigh in. As you recall, the business ops and IT transformation program we set milestones and timelines to demonstrate to you that we were getting the saves that we anticipated getting, and we would anticipate a similar kind of layout going forward. We don't have \u2013 we have that detail internally but we haven't translated it into something that we can clearly articulate to you. But let me just again wind that one back because, I think, it will be the source of probably a series of questions during this morning's call. Business Operations and IT Transformation largely created standardization, centralization and we took advantage of lower labor costs.", "If you look at business ops and IT transformation, I equate it to 70% of the benefit was gained from, I would say, process improvement and labor cost arbitrage, 30% technology. Now that we've taken that first step, what we announced today is something that we have been planning, but the new news is that we've accelerated given the difficult environment. And largely it involves digitizing that interface for the customers, so everything comes into us electronically.", "And then from an end-to-end basis, as information flows into us on the front end, it flows all the way through our systems without human intervention, and then out the other side for data analytics purposes. So in this next phase, I think the mix is more like 70% or 80% technology-enabled automation, and 20% or 30% process and/or labor arbitrage. So I think \u2013 I'll hand it over to Mike in a minute, but we will, beginning fourth-quarter call and then more extensively at the February 24 Investor Meeting, walk you through the plans, the details, the milestones and what you should look to us for on a periodic basis for updates. Mike, do you want to add anything to that?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, it was a complete answer, Jay. The only piece, Luke, I would add is we are working through the details here, so this would be the pacing details. This would be the details around the required investments and likely charges. I know that several of you are going to be interested in what does this mean for full-year 2016? So it's really \u2013 that level of detail is what I'd, as Jay said, we're working through those specifics right now in the format that I know you're interested in. So that's the piece that'll be forthcoming at fourth quarter and also at the February Investor Day.", "Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.", "Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI", "Hi, there. I guess just a follow-up to that is the markets can move up and down and as we've seen already in October, markets are up 8% to10%. So curious on a sidebar, how much do you think of the weakness in third quarter you might already have recouped some of that benefit in October if markets stayed here?", "And then the second part of it is much more important is similar to Luke's, how much of it falls to the bottom line. Should we be, is an easier question or harder question to ask you, where should margins be for your business? In other words, down to 28.9% is below where you've been historically with these various cost programs, ops and IT and now this one. Is there a goal to be riding at a certain level? Like how are you going to measure profitability for yourselves in the next couple of years?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, Glenn. It's Mike. Good morning. First on your first question on the markets, it's certainly a positive that markets have rebounded month-to-date here in October. I would point out just for completeness that emerging markets now are pretty close on a month-to-date basis back to the third quarter average. They had really dipped in late September, and what's particularly important to us is the average over the whole quarter. So I would \u2013 I'd hesitate to try to claim any kind of victory based on the first three weeks of October, and obviously we've got another couple months to go. But I would agree with you that it's certainly been helpful to see the equity market positive news on the first three weeks of the month. Jay, do you want to talk about the?", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, let me attempt to take that one on, Glenn. The digitization plan which we're announcing today of approximately $500 million in savings over a four year to five year period should obviously help our ongoing goal of annual operating leverage. And all else equal, will improve the margin. If everything else was held steady, the margin would improve. We all know that markets are markets and rates are rates and we don't always control that, so in addition to demonstrating for you that this change will improve the margin, the other thing that we look at, probably more importantly internally, is we look at unit costs.", "When you apply technology to a manual process, we've got excruciating detail around the unit cost of all of the activities that we conduct and when you apply technology and reduce labor, couple things happen. One, you improve quality of the customers, you reduce risk, the operating risk that we talk about today. If you're automating, you're not going to have that kind of stuff. And importantly to all of us here, it reduced costs. So for me, it's looking at the unit costs and making sure that we're reducing those unit costs steadily over time. But again, everything else held constant, the margin should improve.", "Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI", "Understood. And it is a small thing, but is the $50 million in annualized savings from the head count actions you took part of the $500 million, or is that a separate?", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "That is separate. That is explicit to this quarters actions we took. The $500 million is incremental to the $50 million.", "Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI", "Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Hi, thanks. Good morning. First question, Mike, for you on the NII front. So on an ex-rates basis, if we're at the kind of low end of the $2.16 billion, we're exiting the year just above maybe $510 million on NII in that circumstance. I think \u2013 I guess if you could just help us understand as you look ahead on an ex-rates basis when would you anticipate NII starting to stabilize out? I know the NIM will be a function as we saw this quarter of the excess deposit flows here and there, but when you're thinking about net interest revenue dollars, how do you start to think about seeing that through on an ex-rates basis?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, Ken. Good morning. First of all, it's largely dependent, Ken, as you can imagine, on what happens in terms of market interest rates, which will be tied very closely to what the Fed does in the near-term in terms of potentially increasing the administered rate.", "To focus on two different scenarios, if you'll recall at our Investor Day, we had said, look, if you exclude the excess deposits and assume that the Fed funds rate would ultimately get back to 2% and the U.S. Treasury at 10 years would get back to 3.5%, we would expect that the NIM, again, importantly, excluding the excess deposits, would be in the range of 150 basis points to 160 basis points approximately four years after the Fed stopped increasing those rates.", "Now again, there's a lot of assumptions in there, and all things equal, of course. But that gives you a sense that it could take a while, but it could be a meaningful increase because that 150 basis points to 160 basis points would compare to something in the low 120s basis points today on that same basis. So again, a fair amount of upside that would way more than offset the loss of the NIR from the excess deposits.", "Conversely, that low 120s basis points could fall to something like 95 basis points to 100 basis points, if you recall at the Investor Day presentation, if interest rates stayed static. So again, unfortunately, a fair amount of downside if rates stay exactly where they are. So it is a relatively unpredictable period, Ken, so I think it would be fair to say in net, it's too early to give you a specific thoughts around calendar year 2016, but in net, there could be continued grind if we don't get help on market interest rates, but we could get help over time if we could get some help there.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. One follow-up on expenses. You're asked about this a lot, just underlying regulatory cost inflation, which has been a big burden of this year. Again, aside from the program, the $50 million to $500 million, what's your line of sight to at least seeing kind of the core rate of growth of expenses starting to slow, or are we still on the upward escalation part of that part of the spend?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, Ken. The way I think about it is in really a couple of different pieces. First of all, I would remind you that we're in a service business, so as we add additional net new business, as we have for 2015, I would expect that we'd have to add expenses to service that revenue. But obviously, we expect to get positive operating leverage on that additional revenue. So net-net, the revenue more than pays for the additional expenses.", "You're absolutely right, the burden that we have faced here in 2015 and also in 2014 was related to the regulatory and related priorities, and that expense came both in terms of adding full-time staff but also outside consultants. As we've talked to you about before, we do anticipate in Q4 and also in 2016 making more progress on replacing those outside consultants, which are very expensive, with additional full-time staff. And just as we've gotten better in terms of process improvement on these priorities, I think we get more efficient and smarter at how we're spending the money.", "So again, that's been upward pressure in 2014 and 2015. I think we'll be more productive in 2016. I still would anticipate, I wouldn't put a number on it at this point, that 2016 regulatory expenses would be higher than where they ended up for 2015 just based on the overall environment and the higher regulatory expectations worldwide. But I don't think we'll see the magnitude of increase and certainly we're working through the budgeting process to try to limit that year-over-year increase to something less than what it's been here in 2015.", "And then the only last comment I'd make and then see if Jay, wants to add anything is around we will continue to make additional efficiencies. We've made progress on that in 2015. The severance charge that we're announcing today is obviously, another near-term step, and then as we've laid out today, the significant focus on this multiyear plan to get the next tranche of the transformation savings.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, I don't have anything to add, Ken.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Jay.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning.", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Morning.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "I just wanted to dig in a little bit to the deposit strategy and I think it's great that you were able to bring the deposits down. I just wondered, you mentioned client conversations. We've seen the front end of the curve in the auctions and treasuries, go for zero rates. So I'm guessing that's part of the strategy to increase, move deposits or excess cash out maybe to the treasury market. But I'm just wondering what other kinds of discussions or conversations you're having? And how much did the pricing change that you discussed last call impact your success? And do you see pricing continuing from here to have a positive impact on your balances?", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Let me take that one up, Betsy. As I referenced before, this is, I think, probably the most important thing we did was had an extended conversation with customers making sure they understood through our eyes what was excess and what was more burdensome from the capital return standpoint. Once we got there, the customers, they get it. They understand the capital pressure. So it was really then more a matter of what's the execution plan. We had some vehicles within State Street that we're able to utilize to offload or relieve some of those excess deposits. They also chose to use other vehicles.", "I think the pricing, which I would say in Europe ratchet up three or four times and the U.S. less so, was us feeling our way to determine at what level of cost to the customer for excess deposits, it created the right behavior. So the most important thing was transparency and openness of discussion, facilitating and helping them with alternative strategies for excess deposits, and then reinforcing that with the pricing mechanism, which I think ultimately that combination of things leaves us in a place where our customers appreciate and understand what we're going through and are trying to help us solve the overall issue. And leaves us with, I think, a mechanism in place, i.e. pricing, that should allow us to, within reason, manage the size of our balance sheet.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "And do you feel like this is the beginning and there's a lot more to go? Or that you worked really hard, obviously, on this for a while, so you've optimized as much as you think you can optimize with your clients at this stage?", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think I would say that, importantly, what we've done is establish some, I'll use the word control or some ability to influence those deposits. And as Mike mentioned, we set our target, which we achieved that target. I think going forward, the size of the deposit base and the burden on the balance sheet will be dictated by CCAR or other internal processes, our view of rates. So we think we're in a pretty good place right now not only from a standpoint of where deposits are but reiterating the importance of how we got there.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Right. So you're not really looking for that much more shrinkage from here?", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Not at this point.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Right. Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC", "All right. Good morning.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Morning.", "Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC", "So I just want to summarize what I think I heard. You're missing your targets for operating leverage and fee growth for 2015. There's a lot of reasons: lower rates, lower markets, lower dollar, lower EM, and higher regulatory costs. And part of the solution is to accelerate the plan to digitalize the operation. So if my understanding is correct, why a total of perhaps five years from now to get the benefits from the plan? I understand you won't tell us all the details until January, but we're talking I guess, the end of 2020 for some of these benefits. And can you reassure us that you guys have a sense of urgency after having less than ideal operating leverage this year?", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Let me start that, Mike, and then Mike can jump in if he chooses. I'd separate those two comments. I mean they're broadly related, but we set out a 4% to 7% revenue growth rate and 200 basis points at the beginning of the year, conditioned upon a certain set of market and rate environment. And as Mike reported, we haven't thrown in the towel on the 200 basis points. I guess that's important to say that we have probably a realistic view of the fourth quarter from a market standpoint. And we believe it's going to be pretty challenging to get to the bottom end of that 4% to 7% growth range. But we are turning over every rock in the fourth quarter to attempt to hit that 200 basis points. We're just saying it looks like a stretch as I sit here today.", "Related but separately, you know as well as anybody the business ops and IT journey that we went on, and I think you have an appreciation of the foundation that set for us. Digitization is the next logical step in that journey. And we had the digitization plan, but in light of the continued downward pressure on the environment, I've decided that we're going to accelerate that forward, we're going to put more emphasis, more resources on it and get to that $500 million quicker than we would have had we not. When 70% of the improvement is technology-driven, there is some gate for how quickly you can go but what we're saying is we are going to make it the highest priority in the organization to accelerate that plan. And we think that it will have the attended benefits of cost, which we're all interested in. But it's also going to accelerate our ability to deliver data analytics products to our customers as we streamline the internal data flow within the organization, reduce risk, and reduce operating loss.", "I think what we're saying is tough third quarter based on the environment, haven't given up on our goals for 2015, but given our overall outlook for the environment, we're moving forward a plan that we had in place anyway to accelerate our ability to reduce costs. Mike, do you want to add anything?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, Mike, I would just add that, remember, this is built off of the backbone of the IT and ops transformation program, which I think everybody would view as being very successful. That also was a multiyear plan but the fact that we were able to meet the interim as well as the full program objectives there, gives us a lot of confidence that we can do the same for this next tranche.", "Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC", "And then just one short follow-up. On page three of your slide, it says long-term shareholder value and it gives long-term goals, certainly not for this environment. Might you have to reconsider those long-term goals at some point?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, Mike, I would say that we'll certainly each year continue to look at the long-term expectations that we have for this business. For now, certainly \u2013 and we went through this, if you recall, at our last Investor Day, we do believe that those goals are achievable as long as in particular that we get some help in terms of a return to more normal interest rates and the other items that we talked about at \u2013 backing those goals back in February.", "Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.", "James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning. Just maybe a quick question on the SLR. As you pointed out, a lot of the deposit declines came at the end of the quarter. So as we look to 4Q, since the SLR denominator is based on an average, if I do the math right, based on your indications, does that add \u2013 should we expect that that adds, all else being equal, around it seems like maybe 40 basis points to the SLR next quarter?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, Jim, it's Mike. Yeah, certainly your arithmetic is in the ballpark. I would remind you that the \u2013 that implies that we continue in terms of those, the lower levels of deposit through the entirety of the average of fourth quarter, and also that nothing else materially changes. But again, subject to those caveats, your arithmetic is on the money. We'll get the benefit of the drop in the deposits in September, we'll get the full benefit of that in Q4 as long as it's maintained.", "James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. So when we think about the conversation around preferred, you're reticent to kind of say that it's off the table, it's just because you don't know how it progresses from here. If we see another spike in the balance sheet, that might be a different discussion, but given that you could be getting much closer to 6%, it seems like there's a clear guide path to above 6% over the next couple of years. Is that a fair comment?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Jim, yeah, I'd split it up into two pieces. First, your comments are fair as it relates to the SLR, and in fact, we've said all along that we are confident that we're going to be in compliance with SLR, which doesn't kick in until 1/1/2018, and that we'll be on a glide path to get there. So, yes, I continue to feel positive about our longer-term compliance with SLR.", "I would reinforce, though, Jim, what I said earlier, and that is near-term, the most important binding constraint is not the SLR, it's the upcoming CCAR test, and specifically based on our experience last year, it's the Tier 1 leverage calculation in the upcoming CCAR that's likely to be our near-term binding constraint.", "And I'm sure, that's going to be impacted by our Q4 balance sheet, but it's also going to be impacted by the parameters of the CCAR test. We don't know what those are yet, obviously, and we'll have to investigate those parameters and put it through our own capital management modeling.", "So there are just a lot of other things that \u2013 beyond the longer-term SLR compliance that could go into a decision in 2016 around prefs, and I just, I \u2013 not knowing those parameters, I can't say definitively, but obviously we plan to give an update here in \u2013 at the beginning of 2016.", "James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.", "Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning, folks.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Morning.", "Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Jay, just to take a step back on the business ops transformation program and your digitization program, just big picture, I guess, moving from the former program where you certainly had a technological lead versus your peers, and then to this program, is this something that in your mind was an evolution that you thought would have to happen even several years back, or is it more in a response to an increasingly competitive environment?", "Of course, BNY advanced their technological move a couple of years back, post the integration of Mellon, and just trying to get a sense of the competitive environment that's causing this versus how you feel about your leadership position?", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, let me give that a shot, Brian. The \u2013 I think it represents the inevitable endgame for this business, which is increasingly what we do even though we value some of the operational activities and pricing that we do at the end of the day. The value that the customer sees is the information and analytics that gets derived from all of the data and accounting that we do internally here. And that is impeded today for everybody by multiple systems, breaks, handoffs, reconciliations which causes an inherent delay in the information which lessens its usability. So not far into the future, I think we end up being the organization that delivers upstream analytics to portfolio managers, to risk managers, to compliance managers that provide that real-time insight into the information we hold on behalf of our customers. So that's where the puck's going.", "I think everybody is grappling with this in different ways. We have the good fortune, you could say good fortune or good management, to begin with common systems. And so the common systems that we had going into the business opts and IT transformation program allowed us to look at the common processes, which are many, go through a lean or Six Sigma type analysis, optimize those processes, form centers of excellence, leverage places like Poland, China, India for a low-cost location. And that's where we are today. So we run common systems. We've got common processes. The next leg of that is to automate from an end to end basis when a trade comes into the organization, all the way through and out the back end. How that marries up with where the puck's going is that if you can do that, then that information becomes real-time \u2013 all the processing that goes on and the information we deliver back up to front offices of our customers \u2013 is much more valuable than it is today.", "And if you were to visit with any asset owner, any asset manager, and ask them what's on their top three list of challenges today, it's aggregating data on a real-time basis for insights, for portfolio management, risk management, and compliance. And we aim to be the organization to get there. And you can't get there unless you take these steps that I just outlined. And I would say from a standpoint of where we are from a leadership standpoint, common systems, common processes, leveraging emerging markets all over the world. And the next big step is to digitize end-to-end those activities. I think we're out in front of everybody with regard to that. And I think we've got the right vision and view. And this is just saying we're going to further accelerate the execution to make sure that we deliver on an organization that's better situated for where the future opportunities are, and an organization that will continue to be a cost leader from a standpoint of those core activities that we conduct.", "Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. That's great color. Thanks very much for that. And then, Mike, just some couple of clarifications. Just your comments around the 120 basis point NIM, excluding excess deposits. What type of an environment do you need to get to that? And if you could just comment again. I think I may have missed this. The actual excess deposit level you have now, now that you've got $30 billion to $35 billion off. And then on regulatory expenses, you mentioned the pace slowing in 2016 versus 2015 you think. What was the increase in regulatory costs in 2015 so far versus 2014? Thanks.", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, Brian. It's Mike. First of all, related to the net interest margin, the low 120s basis points, Brian, that I was mentioning in answer to the earlier question is approximately where we are right now. So we reported an overall NIM of 95 basis points. If we strip out the excess deposits and some other near-term items on the balance sheets like higher CD levels and look at, instead, the net interest margin on what we believe to be the long-term balance sheet, which includes the operational deposits and, again, more normal levels, we basically calculate a NIM today in the low 120s basis points.", "And as I was answering earlier, I think, to Ken's question, that could grind down further by, say, another 25 basis points or so. Or it could increase further or another 30 basis points, 35 basis points or so, depending upon where market interest rates go over the next few years.", "So your second question was around the excess deposits. On our historical method for calculating excess deposits, which we've given you now for the last couple of years. We estimate that our average excess deposits dropped for average Q3 versus Q2 by approximately $16 billion. So a drop from $62 billion on average at Q2 to $46 billion on average for Q3. But much like what Jim Mitchell was asking about, we would expect if the deposit level simply stay where they are today, that would drop further in Q4 because we will pick up in Q4 the full average.", "Now I cannot emphasize enough, Brian, that that does assume that there is no significant change in the external environment, and we are very sensitive to the fact, for example, that the last time there was a debt crisis we saw a huge inflow of deposits. So there is certainly other factors out in the environment that could change that. But basically, if nothing else changed in the quarter relative to where things are today, we would see another similar type of drop in the excess deposits in Q4.", "And then your last question around the regulatory expenses. We declined giving a specific number, Brian, because I just think there is so much art rather than science that goes into estimating all in regulatory expenses. Obviously we track very closely very specific regulatory initiatives like CCAR compliance, but we know that there's upward pressure throughout the organization in terms of first line of defense, second line of defense, corporate audit et cetera, that are \u2013 at least largely a function of the higher regulatory expectations worldwide. So I'd prefer not to give a specific number there.", "Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Good. That's great color. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.", "Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. Good morning, everybody.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Morning.", "Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "So another one on the expense program I guess. May be taken another way, but I guess the challenge that a lot of investors have with a lot of these cost initiatives is that when you look at a point-to-point from the time you guys have announced the original program, call it 2010 through the end of last year at least, you know, expenses are up 20%. Granted, the revenues grew as well, but I think it will help us understand what is the embedded core expense growth in your view that is reasonable for you to have in today's current regulatory environment in order to achieve your organic growth goals. Is it 3%, is it 5%, just to kind of get us somewhere, you know, help us better assess how much of an ultimate bottom-line impact we could have from this program? Thanks.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Let me start that, Alex. This is Jay. Reflecting on your math from where we ended up the last program, I think the winds we've been sailing into have largely been regulatory expenditures and the grinding down of interest rates, which have affected net interest revenue I think. I don't have the math in front of me. And I think if you took those away, then you know \u2013 so we would \u2013 you know you can take your own view on where we are on the rate cycle. As Mike indicated, we think we are at least bending the curve on the regulatory cost growth going forward. And if you isolated those two things, it's the operating leverage thing again, and the service business, you are always doing new things for customers, some of that requires expense to do that. But I would point to operating leverage and/or, if you are able to hold those other variables constant, margin improvement. But, Mike, what would you...?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, I would add, Alex, that first of all Jay is right. If you adjust for the higher regulatory expenses and the lower net interest revenue from the grind in interest rates we have in fact expanded margins along the lines of, actually a little more than the $625 million that we reported as IT and ops transformation. So the only piece I would add to Jay's answer is that I think importantly, Alex, is the relationship between the fee revenue and the expenses. So, and we've talked about this before. In an environment where fees are growing at 5% say, and again, there's some help from markets in there, there's some help from flows in there, there's some help from market-driven revenues like FX trading revenues. Then we do in fact expect to have that outpace our expenses in a normal period of time.", "Obviously, that is measured over a longer period of time than just one quarter in any given quarter. For example, Q3 was a good example of that where there is a sharp contraction in markets, particularly like we saw in emerging market equity levels then that relationship won't always hold. But again given the success also we had with the first IT and ops transformation program, I would hope that we built credibility with you in terms of our ability to translate these kinds of programs into our overall margins all things equal.", "Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. So just to paraphrase, more normal environment the operating leverage on the core business ex-rates. We should still think about in that 200 basis point spread and then layer on the savings on top of that?", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I wouldn't quite jump to the 200 basis points because again, I think that was a 2015 objective. Which did include by the way some productivity benefits, which have helped us offset some of the upward pressure on regulatory expenses.", "Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got you. Okay. And then, Jay, just a question for you on the excess deposits again. You alluded to some levers outside of just price increases. Any way to specify, I guess, what those were and the magnitude of the benefit that you guys got from those additional levers when it comes to the $30 billion, $35 billion number?", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Alex, I would say that, I mean, if you would call them levers it's probably three things. Its full transparency with customers with specificity around our objective, which translating into from a customer standpoint, they don't always know what excess is. So by putting some point targets that we're trying to solve for is point one. Point two is, second set of levers is what buckets do they have or we have to shed some of these deposits. So some of those are our buckets whether it's money funds, some of those are their buckets whether moving into treasuries or other vehicles.", "And then the third part of the package is making sure that there's a fee incentive, which reinforces the right behavior that was not dropped on someone, but was introduced in a very measured way over time. So that the customer has the ability to help us manage our collective issue and I say that's the story. And I think going out at the way we went at it, I think was the right way to go at it. And it's more likely to create a more sustained outcome.", "Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Understood. Thanks so much for taking the questions.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Adam Beatty with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate the detail on emerging markets exposure and the asset servicing business. Another area of the market that had challenges has been energy and commodities. So I just want to get your thoughts, maybe not specific figures around areas of the business where there's asset servicing or asset management that might be exposed to energy and commodities. And whether that's had an impact so far? Thanks.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I guess the only thing that I can think of, Adam, maybe by the nature of my hesitation here is it's not much. But I think about commodities and in particular, oil and some sovereign well funds that have downward pressure based on a $45 to $50 a barrel oil pricing and the need to continually fund ongoing operations. That's probably the place that it binds mostly. And I would say it's a discrete set of customers and important, but I'd say in the overall scheme of things, our exposure to commodity prices directly is not that material.", "Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you, Jay. These days not much a pretty good answer there. Turning to asset management and the growth of that business, you've introduced a lot of new ETF products. Just wanted to get a sense of which market segments and channels you're targeting to gain share. And maybe an update on the overall strategic plan with Ron O'Hanley at SSGA? Thanks.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Let me start with ETFs and then I'll broaden it out. Our ETF strategy is, you know, we've come from a place where most of our \u2013 originally our business was more institutionally oriented and we're moving to a more retail oriented business, which requires that you hire wholesalers in those country and intermediaries in Europe in order to distribute that product. And we've made pretty big investments over the last 18 months to 24 months to increase our distribution salesforce in the U.S. And we're doing something similar in Europe. So the strategy is multifold. One, it's to \u2013 in addition to the institutional world orient towards the retail world, and with that, bulk up our distribution. And that distribution would be to financial planners, advisors, broker-dealers, private banks.", "And then the other leg of the strategy is really around on the product side. So you noted in the beginning of your comment that we've introduced quite a few products. The orientation of the new products that we're bringing to market have the characteristic of less pure beta, more involved strategies and therefore higher fees. So the one that I spiked out in my comments was the product we did with DoubleLine. We have several other products, one with Blackstone, bank loan fund. So we're orienting towards maybe more sophisticated and higher-yielding products.", "And the last point I would make is we have been open and continue to be open to package somebody else's investment expertise in our ETF structuring here and distributed through the distribution force that I just mentioned. I guess if I broaden the question out, the other main emphasis of the SSGA's strategy that I would put a bright light on is the whole solutions world, which for us 401(k) has been a big area of success over the last couple of years. Ron has a big history on that. And even more broadly just Packaging Solutions for not only institutional, but the retail world, And we think with our combination of beta in many flavors, ETF's vehicles, that we're well positioned to succeed in both the ETF and the solutions world.", "Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "That's great detail. Much appreciated.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.", "Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Good morning. Jay, I just wanted to shift the conversation to your third pillar of your long-term plan. How will you be investing for growth during this program? Are you able to size the data and analytics opportunity you noted today? And are there any other revenue opportunities that could emerge from 2016 digitization plan?", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I appreciate the question. Broadly, we have been \u2013 even though we don't talk about it a lot on these calls. We haven't lost our way with regard to continuing to invest in things that will be the future growth drivers of the business. The one I like to point to, enhanced custody. Four years or five years ago, a vision that took a couple of years for it to incubate. And now, as you know, it's driving most of the growth in our securities lending business. That's one example. There are several examples around.", "But if I go to the third pillar of the strategy, the data and analytics business, which we launched I think two years ago now. There are several strategies that we're focused on there. At the core, it's this data aggregation piece. So if we're dealing with an asset manager or an asset owner, the ability to aggregate up data not only our own data but data from other sources through a data warehouse, cleanse it, make sure that it's available real-time, is the foundational stage of that business.", "And then on the back of that, risk tools. We recently introduced a stress testing tool for fund products where it's really a big data application where we see subscription and redemption history. We know the characteristics of the underlying funds. We can predict or allow a customer to predict how much liquidity is required given the likelihood of redemptions.", "Interestingly, the SEC and increasingly the other regulators are leaning into the asset management industry to get more sophisticated about liquidity stress testing and fund products. So that converges nicely with that. That's just one example Ashley, but it's clear as day to me that the future is going to be defined by who wins that space, who can digitize their data and who can develop those analytic products that are the value-add to customers in addition to all the custody and operational activities that we conduct.", "Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. Thanks for the color there. And then, Mike, as you intensify efforts to reduce these deposits, apart from NII, should we be thinking about any other revenue impact as clients adjust? And then also, how are you addressing the $20 billion or so nonoperational hedge fund deposits?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, Ashley. First, on the revenue side, at this point, and I acknowledge that things can change in the future, at this point, I don't expect other second order impact from the deposit actions other than the lost NIR on the excess deposits themselves. So at this point, again, we're not expecting, for example, to lose client relationships over this. Although, again, it's something we're very sensitive to and that's why we've taken the measured approach that we have.", "And as it relates to the hedge fund and private equity deposits, as we've talked about before, while historically, a chunk of those have \u2013 we've considered to be operational deposits because they are in fact a part of the normal operations and part of the custody relationship. And we do believe to be sticky, they don't count under the LCR rules as being operational deposits.", "So a portion of those we've seen decline, so a portion of the excess deposits for those clients are included in the deposit reduction that I've mentioned. But as you would expect, a portion have remained sticky, and we do expect that they will remain sticky going forward. And we'll continue to look at the all-in economics of those relationships, but expect them to be sticky.", "Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. I guess final question: does this in any way change your view of alternative asset servicing and attractiveness of that business?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No, it does not. But we view that as a very attractive segment.", "Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Jay and Mike, I just want to follow up on Alex's question, so the whole thought process of can we see this benefit come to the bottom line. You talked about the fact that \u2013 Alex mentioned the revenue is up as much as expense is up, and you talked about the fact that you were hurt by NIM, but rates are coming down, which is fair.", "But on the other hand, Jay, you also have a huge benefit from equity markets. I mean, if you look from 2010 onwards, your S&P 500 went from 1,250 to, even just go to the end of second quarter, over 2,000. Your NASDAQ almost doubled from 2,500-plus. So if we don't have that kind of huge market tailwind, should we still like \u2013 should we be able to expect to see this? And on the expense side, while you \u2013 obviously, regulatory expenses were a surprise. There is businesses \u2013 investment costs that have to go in too. So could you add some more color to that?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Vivek, it's Mike. First of all, you're asking the kinds of levels of detail that we intend to cover as part of our Investor Day presentation, and I suspect we'll give some overview on the Q4 call. So I just think it's better laying out the entire plan to then talk about some of the specifics around things like equity market help or the market interest rate environment. I think that's better handled over the course of a multi-hour Investor Day than on this call.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And Jay, how much of this digitization \u2013 since you're doing \u2013 this is coming over five years. How much of this is more what I would think of as business as usual because the world is changing, we're going to more passive assets, more ETFs from active, and so this is just needed given that you've got obviously, lower fees coming on the other side, as opposed to just given that it's such a long timeframe? How much of that is more that \u2013 whatever's coming anyway that you had to...", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I \u2013 in some respects, Vivek, it doesn't matter the asset type, the asset class, the geography. To me, it's really reflective of this pretty cumbersome western world financial landscape that we've created. What we're talking about enhances the value of a passive fund, an alternative fund, a private equity fund. If we can move things through here without human touch it benefits everybody. To the point of \u2013 this is where the world is going. Not just financial services. Everybody's looking to digitize their environment and it's hard to do.", "And I think that \u2013 I think we have a huge benefit and that we're a large global company, but we've laid the foundation long ago, common systems, common processes to get there first and this, today's announcement is really a reflection of needing to pull it in so that we can get there first because of the, somewhat, the environment which puts pressure on cost. So I think it has the intended benefit of cost saves at the same time, it accelerates our product strategy and should make us more valuable counterparty to our customers.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your final question is from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP", "Hi. It's Geoff Elliott from Autonomous Research. Thank you for taking the question. The singular event that you talked about driving up processing expenses, what was that?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I'd rather not go into a huge amount of detail, but it's fair to say that we did have a processing error related to a significant once in many, many years, maybe a decades kind of class action situation. And so as a result, of course, we reimbursed the funds that were impacted so that it was our loss, not theirs.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And, Geoffrey, I'd just say that the losses or gains get extreme scrutiny around here, not just to \u2013 there are two things to figure out what happened but also to make sure that it can happen again. And so we take great pride in our record of low operating losses. So when an event like this happens, we turned the place upside down to make sure that everybody understands what happened and why it won't happen again.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP", "And then on the $500 million, I know you're still kind of working through the fine detail, but can you just explain how you get to that number? Is it a bottom-up exercise? Is it a top-down exercise? Just to kind of get some comfort around the ability to deliver on that without giving us all of the information you're going to work through at the Investor Day.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Geoffrey, this is Jay and Mike can add to this. It is very much a bottoms-up exercise. We have hundreds of people and hundreds of work streams that are looking at \u2013 I'll take the simple one, when an electronic trade comes in, that end-to-end process how many breaks are there in it, what technology needs to be applied, what process needs to change in order to affect what outcome. We have measured the breaks, the outcomes, the cost saves, the people, the systems, so it's in a lot of detail. And very much bottoms-up. You can't just dictate top-down a number and expect that people are going to figure it out. So we've spent the better part of a year in doing the analysis that leads to today's announcement. Mike, you want to add anything?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, Geoff, what I would add is that remember this does build off the backbone of the IT and ops transformation program. So one of the infrastructures that was created as part of that is as we move to, for example centers of excellence and as we did the detailed process improvement at work from that program. As Jay indicated, we got very specific, very granular on our unit cost for providing different services along the chain. And as Jay indicated, the $500 million stems from a review of those different links in the chain, if you will, and how much we expect to save through critically applying additional technology to those various links. Again, the piece that is specifically we're going to focus on over the next three months will be the pacing and sequencing.", "So again, I know several of you are interested in, well what does that mean for 2016? And that is work that we need to do some additional vetting around. And then there will also be some additional investment cost, restructuring programs et cetera that we've got some additional detail to build up as well.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "That does conclude the Q&A session for today's conference. I will turn the call back over to Jay for any further statements or closing remarks.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, thanks, Stephanie. I'd want to thank, everybody, for their questions and attention today, and we look forward to speaking with you after the fourth quarter. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you.

This call may not be recorded for rebroadcast or distribution in whole or in part without the express written authorization from the State Street Corporation. The only authorized broadcast on this call will be housed on the State Street Web site.", "Now, I would like to introduce Anthony Ostler, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at State Street.", "Anthony Ostler", "Thanks, Therese. Good morning and thank you all for joining us.", "On our call today are Chairman and CEO, Jay Hooley will speak first. Then, Mike Bell, our CFO will take you through our first quarter 2016 earnings by presentation which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our Web site, www.statestreet.com. Afterwards we will be happy to take questions. During the Q&A, please limit your questions to 2 questions and then requeue.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include operating basis and other measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measures are available in the appendix to our 1Q 2016 slide presentation.", "In addition today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements, actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors such as those factors referenced in our discussion today, in our 1Q 2016 slide presentation under the heading, forward-looking statements and in our SEC filings including the risk factor section of our 2015 Form 10-K.", "Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. As with the past couple of quarters, we have instituted a new pattern of releasing our financial results on the fourth Wednesday of the month following each quarter end. As such, we expect to hold our second quarter earnings call on Wednesday, July 27 2016.", "Now, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Hooley", "Thanks, Anthony and good morning, everyone.", "Despite the challenging environment, I'm pleased with the progress we've made during the quarter on the five strategic priorities I outlined for you at our Investor Day in February. These priorities will help us to transform State Street, compete in the new environment and deliver value in the short-term. As a reminder, these priorities are, one, to become a digital leader in financial services, to drive growth from our core franchise, to invest in new products that will enhance revenue and drive differentiation, increased our focus on expense management and leverage our strong capital position to continue to return capital to shareholders.", "As you can see on Slide 4 of the slide deck, we've outlined for you highlights of our progress so far this year against those five priorities. First, on becoming a digital leader in financial services. We are investing in becoming a digital leader in financial services through State Street Beacon; our journey to digitize core processes will deliver an enhanced client experience and generate $550 million in annual pretax net run rate expense savings by the end of 2020.", "Our clients are already begin to see the results of our investments through faster and more consistent delivery of services impacting our clients operations and driving improved ranking within distribution channels. We are also actively engaged in evaluating new technologies such as block-chain.", "We remain on track to achieve State Street Beacon related annualized run rate savings of $100 million by the end of this year. That amount will be reflected in our 2017 results. As we indicated could be the case at our Investor Day, we did take a pretax restructuring charge of $97 million in the first quarter related to Beacon.", "Second, we expect our core franchise to continue to deliver growth given our leading positions and attractive markets. Although our first quarter fee revenue reflects a challenging market environment experienced at the beginning of the year, we are encouraged by the signs of stability in March and the strength of our pipeline across the firm.", "The first quarter included new asset servicing wins of approximately $264 billion, but approximately $400 billion of service commitments remaining at quarter end to be installed from current and prior periods.", "I want to highlight when that our Global Services Group in Asia Pacific recently finalized. In early March, we were selected to be the master custodian for Australia's third largest superannuation fund, First State Super. This new relationship will also extend into globe markets and our global exchange businesses. Of note, State Street now services four of the seven largest superfund and what is the high-growth sector for us in Australia.", "I'm also pleased to say that our asset management business has inflows of $13 billion with expected annualized net new revenue of $11 million during the quarter providing the strongest quarterly net flow in annualized revenue results since the fourth quarter of 2014. That activity was driven primarily by $7 billion of inflows into ETFs and $11 billion of inflows into cash products.", "Third, we believe continuous investment in new products and solutions will enhance revenue and drive differentiation. Our recent agreement to acquire GE Asset Management supports our strategy to invest in higher growth and return businesses. GE Asset Management significantly enhances our position in the outsourced CIO market, which is one of the faster growing segments of the asset management business.", "Additionally, GE Asset Management expands SSGAs alternative capabilities, while enhancing our active equity and fixed income teams, which broadened the solution sets we can provide to our combined client base. Most importantly, GE Asset Management is a high-quality organization with strong cultural alignment with SSGA and this transaction is an endorsement of our ongoing and strong long-term relationship with GE.", "We expect this acquisition to be accretive in the first 12 months of operation. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate products that are not meeting our strategic or financial expectations. We made the decision during the quarter to exit our futures clearing business, at the beginning of the second quarter we completed the sale of the WM/Reuters branded foreign exchange benchmark business to Thomson Reuters. These and other ongoing return on capital actions are aimed at improving our efficiency, strategic focus and ROE over the medium to long-term.", "Innovation is a critical differentiator in the competitive ETF segment and a key focus for SSGA. Our SSGA, our spider ETF business introduced 13 new funds during the quarter including the SSGA gender diversity ETF. She is the first self indexed ETF, and its development was inspired by CalSTRS efforts to move the needle on gender diversity in corporate America and seeks to track performance of the SSGA gender diversity index which comprises large -- U.S. large cap companies with the highest levels within their sectors of gender diversity on their Board of Directors and in their senior leadership.", "Fourth, we are increasing our focus on expense management. Our results this quarter reflect our commitment to manage expenses with first quarter operating expenses flat compared to the same period a year ago and also flat excluding the seasonal impact of equity compensation for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.", "We continue to make expense discipline core to our culture encouraging employees to embrace and owners mindset and identify ways we can reduce cost across the enterprise looking at everything from travel to consultant spend.", "As I noted earlier, State Street Beacon is contributing to our expense management efforts and we are on track to generate at least $100 million in annualized pretax net run rate expense savings this year from the program.", "And fifth, we're leveraging our strong capital position to continue to return capital to shareholders. Our first quarter 2016 common stock dividend was $0.34 per share and we purchased approximately $325 million of our common stock. We expect to repurchase up to $390 million of our common stock in 2Q 2016.", "As I've just reviewed for you, we will continue to focus our attention and effort in 2016 on our strategic priorities. We expect this will allow us to generate positive fee revenue growth and to achieve our objective of generating positive fee basis operating leverage this year relative to 2016.", "Two weeks ago, the Fed Reserve and FDIC released their review of our July 2015 RRP submission. Both the Federal Reserve and the FDIC noted that we have made improvements over our prior plans, but determined that our 2015 resolution plan is not credible. While disappointed with the findings, we are committed to addressing the issues and enhancing our resolution plan as our business and regulatory requirements evolve.", "We've had ongoing communications with the regulator and are focused on addressing all the deficiencies jointly identified by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC by October 1, 2016.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike, who'll review our financial performance for the first quarter and then we'll both be available to take your questions.", "Mike Bell", "Thank you, Jay. Good morning, everyone.", "This morning before I start my review of our operating basis results, I like to note that our GAAP basis results for the first quarter included pretax restructuring costs of $97 million related to State Street Beacon including the exit of our Futures Clearing Business.", "Now turn to Slide 8 in the slide presentation for a summary of our operating basis results for 1Q 2016. 1Q 2016 results reflect softness in our fee revenue primarily driven by lower global equity markets, partially offset by strong expense control. Operating basis EPS for 1Q 2016 decreased to $0.98 a share from $1.16 in 1Q 2015 and decreased from $1.21 in 4Q 2015.", "Our first quarter results in 2015 and 2016 included the seasonal effect of deferred incentive comp for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes. Importantly, total expenses were approximately flat compared to the year ago quarter. And excluding the noted seasonal retirement eligible expenses and payroll taxes, total expenses were approximately flat compared to 4Q 2015. Regarding capital in 1Q 2016, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 a share and purchased approximately $325 million of our common stock.", "Moving now to Slide 9, 1Q 2016 fee revenue decreased 3.6% while expenses were approximately flat versus a year ago. Weakness in global equity markets and elevated 1Q 2015 FX revenue resulting from the Swiss National Bank actions at that time contributed to the decrease in fee revenue relative to the year ago quarter.", "I'll now turn to Slide 11 for a review of our 1Q 2016 operating basis revenues. Servicing fees decreased from the year ago quarter primarily due to the lower global equity markets and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar partially offset by net new business. The decrease in the international equity markets particularly in emerging markets negatively impacted first quarter servicing fees. Compared to the year ago quarter, average daily values for the Morgan Stanley Emerging Market Index decreased 22%, while the EAFE Equity Index was down approximately 12%.", "Management fees decreased relative to a year ago reflecting global equity markets and net outflows partially offset by lower money market fee waivers. Foreign exchange revenue decreased from the strong market activity in 1Q 2015 due to lower volatility in volumes nevertheless that increase relative to 4Q 2015.", "Securities finance revenue increased from 1Q 2015 and 4Q 2015, the increase over both periods reflects increased revenue from both enhanced custody and agency lending. Compared to 4Q 2015 processing and other revenue decreased reflecting lower equity earnings from joint ventures and lower revenues associated with tax advantaged investments.", "Moving to Slide 12, I would note that our operating basis, 1Q 2016 net interest revenue benefited from the higher Fed funds rate and disciplined liability pricing. Debt interest revenue decreased from a year ago primarily driven by the successful reduction in the size of our balance sheet.", "Now let's turn to Slide 13 to review 1Q 2016 operating basis expenses. Importantly total operating basis expenses were well-controlled in 1Q 2016 and were approximately flat relative to 1Q 2015 a notable accomplishment. Compensation and employee benefits were impacted by the seasonal deferred incentive compensation for the retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes, demonstrating solid expense control the other expense category decreased significantly as compared to both 1Q 2015 and 4Q 2015. Compared to 4Q 2015 over other expense were driven lower professional services fees and travel expenses as well as the settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015.", "Now, turn to Slide 15 to review our capital position. As you can see our capital ratios remain strong, which has enabled us to accomplish a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock purchases. Compared to December 31, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased under the Basel III fully phased in advanced approach and remained approximately flat under the standardized approach.", "Importantly, the March 31 fully phased and supplementary leverage ratio at the bank increased to 6.2% primarily due to an increase in Tier 1 capital. We repurchased $325 million of common stock in 1Q 2016 and expect to repurchase up to $390 million in 2Q 2016, this will put us approximately $65 million below our gross share repurchase program of $1.83 billion. The $65 million difference represents the reduction in our 1Q 2016 equity compensation for our employees relative to what we've expected at the time our capital plan was approved. The net repurchased amount is therefore consistent with the capital plan.", "Moving on to the next Slide. Let me briefly discuss our agreement to acquire GE asset management. What remains a top priority to return capital to shareholders through common stock repurchase and dividends, we also are focused on allocating capital to higher growth and return businesses. The agreement to acquire GE Asset Management reflects this plan. The purchase price is $435 million subject to adjustments with up to an additional $50 million tied to incremental opportunities with GE.", "Excluding merger and integration charges, the transaction is expected to be accretive to operating basis EPS for the first 12-month period following the close of the transaction and we're targeting a client asset retention rate of at least 90%. Importantly, the acquisition will significantly enhance State Street's position in the fast growing outsourced chief investment officer market.", "Moving to Slide 17, I will now provide an update to our 2016 financial outlook. Despite the pressure on global equity markets in the first quarter, we are encouraged that the environment improved in March. Importantly, compared to January and February, servicing and management fees improved in March.", "On the expense front, we continue to expect operating basis expense growth of up to 2% for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015 with variability across quarters. We also continue to expect to generate positive fee operating leverage relative to 2015. Please note my comments related to our 2016 outlook exclude any potential impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management. Also, we're on track to generate at least $100 million in estimated annual pretax net run rate expense savings from State Street Beacon by the end of 2016.", "Now as a reminder, upward pressure on regulatory and compliance cost is expected to continue throughout 2016. However, we expect the growth rate to be lower than full year 2015 relative to 2014. We also expect expense growth to be affected by the volume of new business as well as continued investments. In addition, we continue to have two scenarios for 2016 net interest revenue largely consistent with prior communications. The first scenario assumes market interest rates remain static at March 2016 levels. Under this scenario, we expect full year 2016 NIR to be in a range of approximately $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion.", "The second scenario assumes administered rates in the U.S. increased 25 basis points in both June and December and correspondingly market rates to trend higher from 2016 levels. Under this scenario, we expect full year 2016 NIR to be in a range of approximately $2.1 billion $2.2 billion. We continue to expect the 2016 operating basis tax rate to be 30% to 32%. And lastly, I would emphasize, that returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends remains a priority.", "Our 2016 capital plan remains subject to the results of the 2016 CCAR process including a review from the Federal Reserve Board.", "In summary, although the revenue environment remains challenging as reflected in 1Q 2016 results, we are encouraged that fee revenue gained momentum in March and we remain focused on prudently managing expenses and providing solutions to our clients. Let me turn the call back over to Jay.", "Jay Hooley", "Thanks Mike. Therese, we are now available to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ashley Serrao [Credit Suisse].", "Ashley Serrao", "Good morning.", "Jay Hooley", "Good morning.", "Ashley Serrao", "First question just on expenses and Beacon, I'm curious what the run rate benefit to 1Q results was?", "Mike Bell", "Ashley, good morning, it's Mike. In Q1 as compared to Q4, so on a sequential basis, we had net savings of approximately $7 million. And we had noted that the Investor Day that we did expect a fair amount of spending for Beacon and we had that but as I said the net savings in Q1 was approximately $7 million sequentially.", "Ashley Serrao", "Okay, so still fairly early innings there. Okay. And just two, and if I look at net interest revenue this quarter and the sequential jump in NIM, what drove the increasing yields on the other asset bucket?", "Mike Bell", "I would point to a couple of things. And I wouldn't characterize it, Ashley, as just the impact on the other asset bucket, but there were a couple of things that broadly helped us. First of all, as we've discussed before, we have a significant amount of our balance sheet that is in floating rate assets. So that's a combination of the Central Bank deposits that we have here in the U.S. That includes the floating rate securities in the securities portfolio about half of the floating rate securities are in U.S., so that's approximately $18 billion.", "And then, we also, our loans tend to be also a floating rate asset. So basically the floating rate assets in our balance sheet increased, as you would expect, based upon the increase in short-term market interest rates.", "In addition, we also were able to capture a wider spread on client repo and we also saw increased netting for repos. So those two things combined increased what you see on the average rates earned and paid page that increased significantly the average rate for the assets that are in the repo securities category.", "Ad then, in the other interest earning asset line that you specifically ask about, that's our enhanced custody asset and basically that just reflects the market rate increase as a result of short-term rates being higher.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin [Jefferies].", "Ken Usdin", "Thanks. Just -- one more follow-up on the NII front then Mike. So, do you normalize for some of those helpers because if I take what you're saying about that and just think about the fact that you've left the -- without rate band unchanged, it would seem that even to get down to that high-end of that X rate span, you're talking about more like a 5, 10 type of net interest income run rate. So, can you just kind of help us just walk through how much of that first quarter goes away, and then, the other typical pushes and pulls in terms of any lingering yield compression versus balance sheet shrinkage we should be thinking about.", "Mike Bell", "Sure, absolutely. Ken, good morning. The couple of things that we expect in the static rate scenario, Ken, the couple of things that we expect to put downward pressure on our NIR under the static scenario would be number one, the grind in the fixed rate portion of the portfolio. So I mentioned that approximately $36 billion of our portfolio is floating rate about half of that is in the U.S. that benefited from the short-term rate hike. About half of that is outside the U.S., which obviously did not benefit from the short-term rate hike. But in the fixed rate category, which is approximately $66 billion of the portfolio, we're seeing this grind where the rate on the investments that are maturing is approximately 100 to 150 basis points higher than the new fixed rate investments that we're making with the proceeds from those maturities. So that grind over the course of the year is a negative.", "And as we talked about before, in Europe, the situation is still relatively negative in that not only are the short-term interest rates negative with the ECB, but in addition to that because of the quantitative easing program over there, spreads are really teeny as well. So, the grind in the portfolio in Europe as well is putting downward pressure. So in the static rates scenario, we would expect those to be the big drivers of the lower NIR in the next several quarters. If instead though, we get a couple more Fed fund hikes, we wouldn't expect them to be quite as accretive as what we saw in first quarter, but obviously, we would expect it to be net-net helpful as we get a higher rate on the floating rate assets that I mentioned in response to Ashley's question.", "Ken Usdin", "Great. Thanks Mike. And just a second question on expenses. Great start on the flat year-over-year, but you're also keeping up to 2% full year into your point about the compliance builds and also the volatility quarter-to-quarter. We are also implying that expenses do have a distinct upward trail from here? Because it would seem like you are on a better trajectory. Why couldn't you do better than that 2% guidance you had given us at Investor Day?", "Mike Bell", "Yes. First, Ken, I appreciate the compliment on the first quarter results. We are really pleased with that. And as we talked about at the Investor Day, we continue to look at really every signal area of expenses. And I think we did a particularly good job in Q1 at reducing the outside consulting expenses, some of it regulatory, cost some of it not regulatory. We reduced travel expenses significantly in Q1. But, I do expect that there'll be a march up in regulatory expenses in Q2, Q3, Q4 as a result of dealing with the higher expectations.", "Now, having said that, we'll continue to look at every area of expense. As Jay talked about, project Beacon continued to be on track for the expected $100 million savings for the full year. But, again, between the regulatory costs and net new business that we expect to be coming onboard that will need expense to service. We thought it made sense to stick with the -- to say up to 2% on expense growth. And obviously, a lot of where we'll end up will also relate to where the fee revenue ends up as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr [Evercore].", "Glenn Schorr", "Hi. Thanks very much. Two business questions. First one is on enhanced custody and agency lending. You mentioned the wider spreads, or I should say the growth in the higher short-term rates. But, curious on just overall balances in progress of the business, it seems to be growing fast. You talked about it in the past, but what are the goals in terms of how much you want to grow at and what risk -- let me rephrase that, what capital charges go along with growing that business?", "Jay Hooley", "Glenn, let me start that one. You've seen not just this quarter, but progressive quarter's good performance, out performance in securities lending. And you're right this quarter was a combination of agency and enhanced custody. I would say over a longer cycle, it's really been enhanced custody that has driven the disproportionate growth. And we expect that will continue. That continues to be high demand in our -- not only hedge, but in our traditional client base to use enhanced custody as opposed to some of the traditional means of credit. And we don't see much limitation. I'd say most of the business growth that we're seeing quarter-to-quarter it is existing clients doing more credit extension with us. So, we built out the product, I think I mentioned last quarter. We're building it out in Europe and Asia as we would do normally for all of our products. The ability to net the securities lending back against the broader portfolio makes it an attractive proposition from a capital standpoint. So net-net, we've seen continued demand. We don't see much in the way of capacity constraints and we think we've figured out how to make this attractive from return on capital standpoint.", "Glenn Schorr", "ROE better than the overall company's ROE, I'm just curious if it's driving -- you ever increasing capital ratios or that's just all regulatory\u2026", "Jay Hooley", "Glenn, it's a little bit less, but I would say steadily improving over the last couple of years.", "Glenn Schorr", "Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks, Jay.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Alex Blostein [Goldman Sachs].", "Alex Blostein", "Good morning, guys. Question on the Living Will issue from a couple weeks ago. You know, what do you guys as far as the next steps go, what do you expect to do to address the issues especially when it comes to the capital concern that came out of their statement? And do anticipate this to have any impact on CCAR for you guys, whether probably not so much in the quantitative piece but more on the qualitative?", "Mike Bell", "Sure. Good morning, Alex, it's Mike. First of all, I don't view the capital piece, the capital item that was noted as a deficiency as being a significant problem for us to deal with. And I do not expect at this point in time that that would have an impact on CCAR. And obviously, Fed will make the judgments that they'll make, but I have no indication at this point that that would have a negative impact.", "So, really what we're focused on now is better understanding the regulatory expectations both for the October 1 deliverable as well as the submission next July 1. And so that more broadly is what we are focus on. And as Jay indicated in his prepared remarks, we are certainly committed to doing everything in our power to meeting their expectations.", "Alex Blostein", "Got you. And then, Jay, follow up for you on the GE acquisition. You guys talked about pretty robust growth, I guess in that business. But my understanding is that something like 90% or so, CIO versus GE pension assets that are obviously sticky there. But I not sure how growth those are. So give us a sense of what the organic growth has been in that business prior to your acquisition, and then maybe what you guys anticipate to see from again the organic growth part of the business?", "Jay Hooley", "Sure. Happy to take that one up, Alex. As you point out, a good deal of the assets are GE assets, both their pension which is how the whole thing got started, outsourcing the CIO function of GE's pension assets. But they've also been successful in attracting some other big names in the outsourced CIO marketplace. So I think that if you just look at that segment of the market particularly against an environment were rates are likely to be low for a protracted period of time. We think that's a growth market. And we think by kind of unshackling GE from GE and making it part of the State Street that will be more attractive provider of services in the outsourced CIO market. So they've had some growth on their own, we've also had some growth. By combining it we think we can grow at a faster rate. So that's core to the growth opportunity.", "But also core of the growth opportunity is, you've heard us talk before about a natural place where we play very effectively in the asset management world is in solutions. And whether it's a target date fund or outsourced CIO or many other versions of solutions. And we had a little bit of a deficit in several asset classes particularly alternatives. And so again, by taking our natural solutions capabilities and enhancing it with some of GE's very credible asset management components in the alternatives, real estate, private equity and hedge, all three, we think we can accelerate our solutions growth.", "So it's really taking, I'd say a very high-quality and stable asset management organization and bedding at State Street and true synergies of the revenue side. And the OCIO and solutions segments of the market.", "Alex Blostein", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell [Buckingham Research].", "Jim Mitchell", "Hey, good morning. Maybe, you could talk a little bit about euro deposits. It sounds like you raised the fee charged on those. Have you seen any runoff that's material or is it a little too early to tell we see that in the second quarter. How do we think about your clients' reaction to raising rates?", "Mike Bell", "Sure, Jim. Good morning, it's Mike.", "Jim Mitchell", "Good morning.", "Mike Bell", "We did as you suggested, we did increase the rate that we are charging for euro deposits. We did see approximately $2 billion of run-off on average Q1 versus Q4. The discussions with clients are ongoing. I would say at this point, it feels like a relatively well-managed situation, but it's something that we're obviously paying close attention to given the challenging conditions in Europe.", "Jay Hooley", "Hey Jim, let me just chip in something. I would say on this whole charging for negative rates, we were market leaders in that. And as I look across the landscape, we're not alone anymore. So whether it's the U.S. banks, the European banks, the environment has shifted to be supportive of this activity. So I think that helps from a standpoint of being able to raise rates and retain the deposits that we want.", "Jim Mitchell", "Right. And so it seems like deposits have held in a little bit better than maybe you expect it. Is that part of the upside we see in NII this quarter relative to your full year forecast?", "Jay Hooley", "Jim, I would characterize it as they are pretty much tracking with what we expected.", "Jim Mitchell", "Okay. And if I could just ask one on the Tier 1 capital at the bank, it seems like you downstream some capital there. Is that true? How is that accomplished to boost the Tier 1 on the SLR bank?", "Mike Bell", "Sure. In terms of just administratively how we did it, we basically just retained some earnings at the bank as opposed to dividending that from the bank to the HoldCo. But as we've talked about in the past, Jim, we do recognize that we've got some flexibility in terms of what assets we hold at the HoldCo versus what we have at the bank. So this was really normal management in line with our plan to be sure that we were above 6% in time for 118. Obviously, the fact that the balance sheet got smaller as well was also helpful in that regard.", "Jim Mitchell", "Right. Okay, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Bedell [Deutsche Bank].", "Brian Bedell", "Hi. Good morning, folks.", "Jay Hooley", "Good morning, Brian.", "Brian Bedell", "Mike, just to circle back on the securities repo line, the yield going from 236 to 586, it's about -- looks like around $30 million sequential increase. Can you just explain that dynamic again and what you would expect the normalized rate to be in the second quarter on that?", "Mike Bell", "Sure, Brian. Well, first of all, I wouldn't focus as much on the 586 as I would on just the overall contribution from that line item. But again, first talk about the change in the numerator. As we talked about in one of the earlier questions, we did earn a higher spread, a wider spread on client repo in the first quarter. Basically, as short-term market interest rates increased, we were able to capture that in our margin. The thing that makes the average rate jump as much as it did though, is that we also expanded netting in the quarter.", "So as a result, we actually had expanded activity for our clients in the quarter, but we were able to net more of it. So the average balance you see there dropped by about $0.5 billion or about 16% sequentially. But it was -- that was really from the netting. So the overall activity expanded. The spreads expanded, but as a result, the average balance been dropped.", "I wouldn't say, I think that was a combination of good management and good market conditions. And I would expect that market conditions will remain relatively good in the near-term, but it's something certainly we can't guarantee and it's something that we manage and monitor everyday.", "Brian Bedell", "It seem as though $30 million, you would view as somewhat or that $30 million increase, you would view as somewhat sustainable or would you see that river back somewhat?", "Mike Bell", "I think that, again, time will tell Brian. I don't have a perfect crystal ball. But, I would expect that perhaps the majority of the sequential increase in those spreads should be sustained over the next couple of quarters. But again, it will be depending upon market conditions.", "Brian Bedell", "Okay, great. And then, maybe Jay, if you want to comment a little bit about the typical dividend arbitrage season and in Europe there's been some discussion of curtailing that. Are you seeing the same type of activity that you typically see in securities lending and FX trading coming into the second quarter or do you expect that to be a little bit strange?", "Jay Hooley", "Brian you point out second quarter is a seasonal peak for us with regard to the dividend activity. It's been a lot of attention on that over the last couple of years. So, we probably see some slight diminishment from what we've seen in past. I don't think it's material, but probably not quite at the peak it's been in past years because of all the attention that trade has received.", "Brian Bedell", "Great, thank you. I'll get back in the queue for some follow-ups. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes Betsy Graseck [Morgan Stanley].", "Betsy Graseck", "I just wanted to begin on two things. One was on the Beacon project, you indicated the restructuring charge of $97 million this quarter. Obviously, a net savings this quarter of $7 million. I know you're investing $500 million, you're investing $40 million to get a $500 million benefit over five years, but could you give us a sense to how we should think about the investment and the space as we go through the rest of this year? Because I thought it was front-end loaded? So I just wanted to make sure I have the numbers right there.", "Mike Bell", "Sure, Betsy. It's Mike. I do expect that both the benefits as well as the investments that we're making in project Beacon will both steadily increase over the course of 2016. I do expect that the net benefit will increase each of those three quarters. On the other hand, as I mentioned earlier, I also do expect to see some upward pressure on regulatory cost. So again, that's several moving parts, but I would think in Beacon in particular as both investments continuing to increase and savings continuing to increase.", "Betsy Graseck", "And all of the $97 million in investment was largely in severance and I'm assuming that's the -- kind of below the net line number. You're not anticipating any investments in the Beacon project to be in operating expenses are you?", "Mike Bell", "Yes. We are Betsy. In fact, we did see investments in that area in operating expenses that was both in compensation, but it's also in the information systems line. And again, I would expect to see additional spending in the information systems line over the course of 2016.", "Betsy Graseck", "And then, on your slide, you indicated, obviously that strategic priority to be a digital leader in financial services. Could you just break apart a little bit the one-liner you have there actively testing new technologies such as block-chain? Could you give us a sense as to what you are doing there?", "Jay Hooley", "Happy to do that, Betsy. This is Jay. Block-chain as we see, it's appropriately a lot of attention and I think it's -- to me it's synonymous with digitization generally. I think if I would've put some perspective on -- put into perspective Beacon and block-chain, I would say that Beacon is our effort internally to digitize within the four walls of State Street. I think that importantly, the whole developed markets, financial services infrastructure needs to be digitized and that's going to require standardization between firms and between activities. So that's really where I see block-chain being most relevant.", "We have internally within our Beacon effort, we've got I think it's four, maybe five pilots going on to use block-chain as a means to digitize within State Street, linked to other firms. So let me give you the best example, maybe be the most easily explained example. Bank loan processing has been an activity that State Street has developed a significant share of the market and processing a bank loan requires many intermediaries to come together in a common ledger to exchange information. So we have a pilot going on in our bank loan processing group where we're using block-chain. And we've got agreement from all the counterparties to participate in a block-chain pilot around bank loan processing.", "So what that would do is take an activity where there's process improvements and technology that we need to do internally within State Street, but it would extend it to other counterparties. So we've got several of those going on which we think could be helpful to us. I think that probably the bigger comment I would make is that we'll digitize our own environment, but it will require standards across the industry and again, block-chain maybe one of those. We are participating in a group called R3. I think there's up to 16 banking institutions that are trying to figure out what the application -- what the best applications are to use block-chain in order to create standards inter-company, inter-industry.", "And so I think we're going to absolutely do what we need to do to digitize our environment. I think the home run here is, if we can get some standards developed around how we will interoperate from a digital standpoint and I think block-chain could be, if it's not block-chain it will be something else, one of the standards that emerged that allow the interoperability at a digital level in the whole industry. I don't know if that confuses or helps, but that's how I view it. We can control, we can control that's what we're doing with Beacon. But in order for this really to work, the industry needs to digitize. Block-chain\u2026", "Betsy Graseck", "That's helpful, it's just a question of, is it a product by product and what kind of timeframe do you see to potentially take something like the pilot that you're working on to either have a go or no go decision with some benefits to you.", "Jay Hooley", "Yes. I guess is, it's product by product at this point. And so bank loans is one of those products, one of those services. I'd be surprised if within a year we don't know whether it would be the right answer to that issue. And I think as with many things, if we get a bunch of financial institutions to converge around a problem and use a new tool. if successful, it will grow from there. And I think it's got a decent chance of succeeding. But, it'll be one of many solutions versus the silver bullet.", "Betsy Graseck", "Yes. Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Adam Beatty [Bank of America].", "Adam Beatty", "Good morning. I have a question about product strategies and ETFs. Appreciate the details earlier. It seems like State Street and others have come out with some fairly niche offerings recently. And the question is with a lot of the big indexes and exposures already being covered including by some State Street products, is that the feature of ETF innovation kind of like television where there is 300 channels, where everybody can see exactly what they want? Or if that's not the whole story, how does that fit into your overall product strategy? Thanks.", "Jay Hooley", "I think I appreciate the question, Adam I just remind you that our ETF strategy is really two tracks. One is to continue to build out the distribution, which we're doing in the U.S. and also Europe. And then to your point, it's enhancing the product. And I'd say, a lot of the basic beta strategies have been consumed in an ETF product. But then, you get to the next level of customized indexes. So the SHE index that I described in our prepared comments is using a -- is developing a strategy and developed in this case, this is the first time we have self indexed. So we built the index, back tested it, and then, packaged it in an ETF. You'll see more and more of that happening. In fact, we are not the only ones doing that I think in the broad beta and ETF space that's a theme.", "The other thing I would say is that I would point to maybe the partnership we have with DoubleLine where they're taking active fixed income strategies. They are the manager, who are packaging it in the ETF and disturbing it. And I think you're going to see more and more encroachment into traditional products basis and I come a little short because I'm not quite sold yet, you'll take active equity products, for instance, and wrap it in an ETF, but others would take the other side of that argument.", "So I don't really see much limitation for investment strategies being able to be wrapped and packaged in an ETF structure and distributed to both institutions and the retail market space. So we have, I would say that SSGA has deployed kind of an open platform strategy where if we can create the index in the case of SHE, manufacture and distribute, then we will. But if there's an interesting investment idea outside of SSGA, we're willing to discuss packaging and distributing which we've done not just with DoubleLine but with Nuveen, MFS and several other firms. Hope that helps.", "Adam Beatty", "Yes, it does Thank you very much, Jay. And then, a question on the OCIO business in the context of asset servicing, how much synergy -- revenue synergy would you expect in terms of asset servicing, and if so in what areas? Is it possible that the GE acquisition benefits from being housed from that standpoint in an organization like State Street ?", "Jay Hooley", "Yes. I think it's a good question. And one of the reasons we have a 25-year-old relationship with GE is, we've been the back end of the front end OCIO business that GE has run over these years. So I think that as I mentioned before, the Outsourcing of the Chief Investment Officer function for these defined benefit plans is likely to be a growing opportunity, growth opportunity. You're already seeing it today. The fact that we can go in and not only offer the front office expertise of how to run these plans, how to speak the language of DB to trustees and other customer facing, pension organizations, but also be able to fully integrate the back office complete with asset servicing, middle office securities lending everything that goes with it, is all relevant here. So I see the more OCIO business we get it should naturally bring all the middle and back office business with it.", "Adam Beatty", "Excellent. Thanks again.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.", "Brennan Hawken", "Hey, good morning. Just one quick follow-up at this point. The decline in other expenses, I think the implication was that you had some benefit here. I think you weighed out the consultant expenses coming down but the reason why the guy didn't go up is because you've got some upward pressure pending from potential Living Will spend and such. Am I paraphrasing that correctly? Am I reading through your comments right or should you, can you clarify please?", "Mike Bell", "Brennan, it's Mike. I think those are fair comments, but I wouldn't limit the upward regulatory cost pressure to just the Living Wills. I think it's broader than that. But other than that your comment is very fair.", "Brennan Hawken", "Okay. And then, is there a way to unpack the other expense result here that was better than expected and how much independently you think might be sustainable beyond then the pending upward pressure from here? Is there a way to think about that separately?", "Mike Bell", "Well, I would just remind you that we're still guiding to up to 2% overall expense growth year-over-year excluding the acquisition of GE Asset Management. So the fact that that's the case, says to me that we are going to manage expenses really in aggregate. And obviously, our preferred route would be to continue to build in-house capabilities, hire full-time people to manage and run these regulatory and compliance activities and rely less and less on outside consultants. And so if we continue to be successful in that area, then I think that line item will likely run below last year's. But again, it really is a question of managing those priorities in aggregate as opposed to just focusing on one line item.", "Brennan Hawken", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.", "Jay Hooley", "Vivek?", "Operator", "It looks like Vivek withdrew his question. Your next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "Yes. Thanks and good morning. Quick question on the GE Asset Management, and I know you gave guidance as to what the expected accretion to be for one year and also you want to retain 90% with regards to the AUM. But, we would assume that the one-year is just because that's when the lockup period is, for those assets or is there a longer lockup on the assets being acquired?", "Mike Bell", "Brian, I wouldn't relate the two. Basically, we're focused on the first 12 months because we wanted to give you a time period at which we expect this to be accretive to EPS. And so that really is irrespective of any kind of lockup period with the GE plan.", "Jay Hooley", "And I'd add, Brian that our expectation is that the 90% plus business that we retained will have a long life to it.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "So I guess asked differently, when does the lockup period end?", "Mike Bell", "There is not a contractual lockup period. Basically we're confident that we can continue to meet the GE pension plans needs and that's what we will be focused on.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "Okay. Thanks. And then, just a second question. What's the impact on the revenues from the exit of the Futures Clearing business, I guess what's the impact on the pretax margin as well?", "Mike Bell", "Sure. So Brian, the SCM business earned $9 million in fees in full year 2015. And the expenses were greater than that but we are part of the overall savings that I talked about earlier in terms of Beacon. So I wouldn't be more specific at this point.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. On the resolution plan, could you talk about what you need to do their and how much of that is simply around changing the plan versus how much is around making changes in the way business is structured, the amounts of liquidity that you hold, how capital is allocated between different types of fees and so on?", "Mike Bell", "So, Geoff, it's Mike. I would say it is early days to be real specific on the actions that will -- it will take to ultimately meet the regulatory expectations. You saw the same information that we did in terms of the keeper that lays out expectations for July 1, 2017 submission. And I think we'll be in ongoing dialogue with both the Federal Reserve as well as the FDIC over the next at least 12 months to make sure that we specifically understand them.", "So I think it's going to be a combination of all the things that you just described there's likely to be some additional infrastructure to be built. Some of it will be additional modeling capabilities. Some of it will be additional monitoring capabilities and also as you correctly indicated, I would expect to see additional legal entity simplification over time as well. But I really think it's a little bit too early to try to be specific until we have more ongoing dialogue with both groups.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Thank you. And then, just to follow-up on the previous question on the not being a contractual lockup on the GE Asset Management assets, why not -- had a thought that when your acquiring a manager and the vast majority of the assets are in-house, that would be absolutely critical to making sure you don't just get the one-year accretion, but the accretion, three, four, five, 10 years out?", "Jay Hooley", "I would say, Geoff it's a pension plan, so it has a list of restrictions. If you look at SSG, probably the biggest segment that they manage for our pension plans and they do that and as long as they are fulfilling their return expectations, it's unlikely that that changes. And so, GE has been managing this plan for a long time. These are -- we see in our business, the OCIO market very sticky assets. So I don't frankly view it as -- I view it as not a concern at all as long as we do what we are being asked to do, which we do everyday for many customers around the world, then we think these assets will be with us for a time. And the fact that we are going to combine it with our business gives us more scale and expertise and it will make us the more attractive counterparty for other pension plans that want to outsource that. I view it as a stable, sticky series of assets with some capabilities we don't have today that will allow us to grow the base.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Thank you.", "Jay Hooley", "Great.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Thank you. Can you guys share with us on the new business when it's on the net asset servicing side of about $264 billion, what percentage of that was the first State Super Australia win? And then second, what's the pipeline work for the second quarter?", "Jay Hooley", "Let me take that one Gerard. I can't give you a First State Super, but what I would tell you is that of $264 billion a little bit unusually, 50% of that came from Asia Pacific. So we've been running more probably 60/40 U.S., non-U.S for this quarter, was more 70:30, 30% being U.S., 70% non-U.S. So good progress in Asia Pacific , really anchored in not only Australia which I highlighted, but we've also seen some movement in Japan where we've seen the first outsourcing of investment trust funds, something we've been pursuing for a long time. So that's the first question.", "The second, pipelines are quite full. I think that, I said this before, but if you look at the asset owner and maybe more specifically, the asset management segment, between difficulty and achieving above benchmark returns to increasing regulatory pressure, we've never seen the demand for things like middle office outsourcing that we have on our plate right now. And importantly, in that particular product, there's a willingness to accept standardized services. So I feel very good about the pipeline, not only from a geographic standpoint, but across, in particular asset managers, but asset service -- asset owners as well.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Thank you. And then, maybe Mike, when we look at your average balance sheet that give us in the supplement on Page 11. I noticed that the interest-bearing deposits in the United States, the yield on that or the cost, I should say to you guys, jumped from 23 basis points to 40 basis points. And then, quite a bit different than some of your peers. What caused it to jump up that much?", "Mike Bell", "Sure, Gerard. First of all, the main driver in that category is actually the cost of our wholesale CDs. So we have approximately $15 billion on average of wholesale CD balances in Q1. And those moved with LIBOR rates. And so that's the driver of the sequential increase there. If we strip those out and just at what the interest-bearing DDA that was pretty close to flat sequentially. So it's really the wholesale CDs.", "Gerard Cassidy", "And the CDs as a percentage of the total that you just gave us, is that consistent with those prior periods? Or is it a greater percentage today than it was in those prior periods?", "Mike Bell", "It's probably a slightly smaller percentage today at $15 billion. We use the wholesale CDs as a management tool around liquidity and those balances were actually a little bit higher in 2015. I remember the rates were lower because LIBOR was lower in 2015 than what it is in Q1 2016.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.", "Vivek Juneja", "Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of things. Firstly, Mike, just following up on the question you're talking about on the repo market, you said majority of the increasing spreads can be sustained in the next couple of quarters? Can you give us a little more color on what's going on in that market structurally that's causing this widening in spreads and that will sustain it?", "Mike Bell", "Sure, Vivek. I mean really it's a combination of the fact that short-term interest rates have obviously gone up with the Fed fund hike. And it's also just a function of supply and demand. And so we will monitor those conditions carefully, but I see nothing that would suggest that that's going to evaporate here in Q2. So again, it's something that we will pay close attention to.", "Vivek Juneja", "Okay. Thanks. Just shifting gears, Jay, to look at your asset management business, if I look at the operating margin in the fourth quarter was 13%, and if I look at full year asset management margin was 19 and change, 15% for the fourth quarter and 19 in change, the really low margin compared to peers. You talked a little bit about specifically that business what you can do to first even moving things like ETF, what you can do to accelerate the operating margin improvement and why so far behind peers?", "Jay Hooley", "Sure, Vivek. I'm happy to take that. We're not pleased with the margin in the SSGA business, I think I said that before. And we do think by reorienting around the strategic priorities that we laid out back in February which are anchored in ETF solutions, OCIO as an additional category that we're getting the right level of focus and investing at the right amount in order to drive really top-line and also create more efficiency through the focus. And I think that if you look over an extended period of time, you would have seen we've hit a trough with regard to returns. And I feel like the investments that we've been making are starting to create some traction. And I look at ETFs and really solutions as being the cornerstone of that.", "In addition to some of the positioning we have in markets outside the U.S., again, I would look to those same two cornerstone elements. So we're working on it. We think we're making the right investments. I think focus is important. SSGA in some respects does not have a lot of pure comps given what it does. And we're trying to be very good at a couple of things and do them well globally. And I think we're on the right track.", "Vivek Juneja", "And do you think it will be sooner in SSGA in terms of -- you're not talking about overall company operating margin improvement, do you see SSGA doing same timeframe or sooner, Jay, compared to the servicing business?", "Jay Hooley", "I got two views on that Vivek. One is, yes, sooner, because we're making proportionally more investments than the SSGA business. And I think, you also need to come back to one of the comments we made around the GE acquisition. As we look at our different businesses within State Street and look at returns, SSGA has disproportionately higher return as does a businesslike Global Exchange. So as we look at investing in areas that we think have natural growth upside and in addition would be accretive to our return on equity, we are going to proportionally lead in that direction.", "And so I think for those reasons, I would expect that you would see SSGA improve sooner than the rest of the franchise.", "Vivek Juneja", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Okay. Thank you. And our final question comes from Brian Bedell, it's a follow-up question with Deutsche Bank.", "Brian Bedell", "The assets under administration looks like there was a significant decline in the pension product area from $5.5 trillion to $5.2 trillion. I was just wondering what drove that?", "Mike Bell", "Nothing, specific Brian. It's really the negative impact of markets that's the big driver there.", "Brian Bedell", "On the pension side okay. The 6% drop linked quarter, was it all market related?", "Mike Bell", "I wouldn't say all market related. I don't have that desegregation right at my finger tips. But the main drop in the AUA was in fact from markets.", "Jay Hooley", "Nothing going on from a loss business standpoint.", "Brian Bedell", "Okay. That's what I was getting at. Yes. Okay, great. And thanks for that. And then just tax rate guidance, this would imply that would be towards the higher end for the next three quarters given it was 29% for 1Q. Is that fair?", "Mike Bell", "Yes. I think that's fair Brian. First of all, the operating tax rate that we provide is heavily impacted by tax advantaged investments. And so just based on the seasonal pattern of tax advantage investments, we tend to see the pattern that you're describing. So nothing particularly surprising there and we experienced a similar pattern in 2015.", "Brian Bedell", "Got it. And just as lastly the -- you talked about the Futures Clearing business, but the impact of the Reuters business, was doing that two times in Reuters and is that suppose to the FX trading line or is that in a different line from the revenue side?", "Mike Bell", "That's in the -- let's say it's in the other -- it's in the fees line item in brokerage and other fees line item.", "Brian Bedell", "Okay. Is that -- can you size that just for modeling?", "Mike Bell", "I don't have that rate at my finger tips. It's relatively small. We can follow-up with you offline on that one Brian.", "Brian Bedell", "Yes. Perfect. Thank you. Thanks a lot guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And that was our final question.", "Jay Hooley", "Thanks, Therese, and thanks everybody for joining us this morning. We look forward to talking with everybody at the end of the second quarter.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

State Street's conference call is copyrighted and all rights are reserved.

Ostler - Senior Vice President, Global Head Investor Relations", "Thanks, Jennifer. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our Chairman and CEO, Jay Hooley, will speak first. Then, Mike Bell, our CFO, will take you through our second quarter 2016 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. During the Q&A, please limit your questions to two questions and then re-queue.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include operating basis and other measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our 2Q 2016 slide presentation.", "In addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors, such as those factors referenced in our discussion today; in our 2Q 2016 slide presentation under the heading Forward-Looking Statements; and in our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our 2015 Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them, even if our views change.", "As with the past couple of quarters, we have instituted a new pattern of releasing our financial results on the fourth Wednesday of the month following each quarter end. As such, we expect to hold our third quarter earnings call on Wednesday, October 26, 2016.", "Now, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Anthony. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our strong second quarter results which reflect strong fee growth compared to the first quarter driven by growth in our core asset servicing and asset management fees and the seasonal uptick in securities finance.", "Demand remains strong across our global client base as demonstrated by new servicing commitments of $750 billion in the quarter. Importantly, these results also reflect our success in implementing our multi-year digital transformation program, State Street Beacon, which is delivering savings and efficiencies as well as new product innovations for our clients.", "As you may have seen in the news today, we announced that we have negotiated a series of agreements subject to final approval that we expect to resolve all pending litigation and regulatory matters in the U.S. related to our indirect foreign exchange business. We're pleased to put this litigation behind us. Matters of this nature can drain both time and resources, so where possible and appropriate we feel it is in our and our clients' interest to pursue settlements. Our previously established reserve will be sufficient to cover all the cost associated with these agreements.", "I'd now like to turn your attention to slide five of our slide deck, as I want to highlight for you a number of developments this quarter that helped us make substantive progress against our 2016 strategic priorities. In support of our objective to become a digital leader in financial services we advanced a number of State Street Beacon initiatives. In the first half of 2016 we successfully digitized a significant portion of platforms that enable straight through processing of client transactions end-to-end. Some of the early successes here include faster cycle times, with end-of-day net asset values being delivered 20 to 30 minutes earlier and reduction of manual transactions.", "Our fund administration digitization prototype is underway and expected to be rolled out to clients in the early fall. Our focus on driving growth from the core franchise resulted in asset servicing wins of approximately $750 billion in the quarter. This included the appointment of \u2013 by Deka Bank and Allianz Global Investors to provide a range of investment services for $538 billion in assets and the appointment as custodian and outsourcing partner for Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Company's Japanese investment trust business. Our new business yet to be installed now stands at over $1 trillion.", "We experienced outflows of $35 billion during the quarter in our asset management business driven mostly by passive equities and reflective of official institution clients redirecting assets in response to economic conditions. Importantly these outflows are primarily in our low fee-based institutional products.", "We continue to generate new business in our higher yielding product lines such as GLD, which is our gold ETF, active equity, multi-asset and institutional. For example, in the second quarter we launched 15 new ETFs at an average total expense ratio of 37 basis points. This is reflected in our favorable management fee revenues for the second quarter of 2016 and our outlook for management fee revenue growth remains positive for the second half of the year.", "We continue to invest in support of our overall strategy and earlier this month on July 1 we successfully completed our acquisition of GE Asset Management. This transaction is a key step in our plan to invest in higher growth return businesses. It's also an important part of SSGA's continued evolution as a premier provider of solutions to clients. GE Asset Management has significant asset management capabilities including active management, alternative and outsourced Chief Investment Officer capabilities.", "With our focus on expense management we have reduced expenses both on a year-over-year and year-to-date basis compared to the same period in 2015. State Street Beacon has been a key factor in this progress and is ahead of our original schedule. In fact, we're now expected to generate at least $140 million in annualized pre-tax expense savings in 2016.", "We continue to prioritize returning capital to our shareholders. During the second quarter of 2016, we executed the final phase of our common stock purchase program announced in March 2015. Earlier this month, our Board of Directors approved a new $1.4 billion common stock purchase program following the Federal Reserve's 2016 CCAR process. Our 2016 capital plan also includes an increase of approximately 12% in our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.38 per share, starting in the third quarter of 2016 subject to Board of Directors approval.", "We'll continue to focus our attention and effort in 2016 on our strategic priorities. We expect this will allow us to generate positive fee revenue growth and to achieve our objective to generate positive fee basis operating leverage this year relative to 2015.", "Moving to slide number six, I'd like to discuss the opportunities presented in Europe and our strong franchise there. Despite the Brexit vote and the remaining uncertainty, Europe and the UK represent a significant opportunity for us. For instance, Europe is 35% of the world's assets under management and is expected to grow by approximately 30% by 2020. Slow GDP growth and a weak economic outlook reinforce high savings rates while lower interest rates are driving a search for yield that pushes funds out of deposits into other investments such as mutual funds and cross-border investments. In addition to Brexit, other trends that we're seeing are that regulatory changes and cost pressures are creating client demand for complex outsourcing services.", "We have a deep and diversified presence in Europe, as we have nearly 11,000 employees in 12 European countries. 20% of those employees are in the UK with the majority being situated in nine European countries under our recently consolidated international bank which is based in Germany. Given this presence we have an organizational structure that gives us the potential to offer both passportable EU products and services tailored to European markets.", "We're well-positioned to support our clients and gain new clients regardless of the jurisdiction. We are the leader in offshore servicing and grew our offshore assets under administration by 70% over the last three years while growing market share. We provide support of the global fund distribution of regulated products called UCITS in more than 70 countries worldwide. Similarly, we're the industry leader in ETF servicing with over 60% European ETF assets under administration market share.", "Not including the impact of lower market interest rates, our short and long term outlook for our European business has not materially changed post the EU referendum vote. We believe the post EU referendum vote winners will be the firms with strength in offshore, in the UK and in pan-European fund structures, and an on-the-ground presence in key domestic markets, and demonstrated ability to partner with clients to navigate complexity. We believe State Street is well-positioned in these areas to take advantage of the short and long term growth opportunities in Europe and the U.K.", "Now let me turn the call over to Mike who will review our financial performance for the second quarter and then we'll turn to your questions. Mike?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Jay and good morning, everyone. This morning before I start my review of our operating basis results, I would like to note that our GAAP basis results for the second quarter include two notable items. First on April 1, 2016 we sold the WM/Reuters branded foreign exchange benchmark business to Thomson Reuters resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $53 million.", "Second, we recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $58 million that reflects an increase in our reserve related to our previously disclosed review of amounts we invoice clients for certain expenses.", "Now refer to slide seven in the slide presentation for a discussion of our operating basis results for 2Q 2016, and for the six months ended June 30, 2016, which I'll refer to as year-to-date.", "By way of summary, 2Q 2016 results were driven by both strong sequential fee revenue growth and expense management. Operating basis EPS for 2Q 2016 increased to $1.46 per share from $1.36 in 2Q 2015 and increased from 1Q 2016, which included the impact from seasonality associated with retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes.", "Year-to-date EPS decreased 3% compared to the same period a year ago driven by a decrease in year-to-date fee revenue primarily due to lower equity markets as well as lower net interest revenue, partially offset by share repurchases and lower expenses. Importantly, 2Q 2016 total expenses decreased compared to the year ago quarter, resulting in an expansion in pre-tax margin to 31.5% in 2Q 2016.", "The first half of 2016 operating basis effective tax rate of 27.9% is lower than our current expectation for the full year 2016 of 30% to 32% primarily due to the timing of our tax advantaged investments.", "Regarding capital, in 2Q 2016 we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 a share and purchased $390 million of our common stock.", "Moving to slide nine, I want to highlight the strong positive fee operating leverage in 2Q 2016 compared to the year ago quarter. Strong progress in 2Q 2016, particularly on the expense front, positions us to continue to expect operating basis fee revenue growth to outpace operating basis expense growth for full year 2016 relative to 2015 under current conditions and excluding the GE Asset Management acquisition.", "I'll now turn to slide 11 for a review of our 2Q 2016 operating basis revenues. Servicing fees decreased from the year ago quarter, primarily due to lower equity markets, and increased relative to 1Q 2016, due to net new business and higher global equity markets. Compared to the year ago quarter, the decrease in international equity markets, particularly in emerging markets, negatively impacted servicing fees. Average daily values for the MSCI Emerging Market Index decreased 19%, while the EAFE Equity Index was down approximately 14% relative to a year ago.", "Management fees decreased relative to a year ago, also reflecting lower equity markets. Foreign exchange revenue decreased from 2Q 2015, due to lower volumes. Securities finance revenue was up slightly from 2Q 2015, primarily reflecting continued growth in enhanced custody, mostly offset by a lower seasonal benefit compared to the year ago quarter.", "Moving now to slide 12, I would note that our operating basis net interest revenue has benefited from a higher Fed Funds rate at the end of 4Q 2015, as well as disciplined liability pricing.", "Net interest revenue decreased from 2Q 2015, primarily driven by the reduction in size of our balance sheet, partially offset by liability pricing discipline.", "Now let's turn to slide 13 to review 2Q 2016 operating basis expenses. Importantly, total operating basis expenses were well-controlled in 2Q 2016, decreasing approximately 3% from 2Q 2015. 2Q 2016 expenses were nearly flat with 1Q 2016 when excluding the 1Q 2016 seasonal deferred compensation expense of $122 million for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes. Compared to 2Q 2015, compensation and employee benefit expenses increased modestly, primarily due to increased costs to support regulatory initiatives and net new business, mostly offset by State Street Beacon savings. Importantly, other expenses decreased from 2Q 2015, driven by a significant reduction in professional services cost.", "We now move to slide 15 to review our capital highlights. Our capital ratios remain strong, which has enabled us to deliver on a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. Compared to March 31, our common equity Tier 1 ratio decreased under the fully-phased in standardized approach, primarily driven by an increase in risk-weighted assets, generated by the FX volatility late in the quarter following the Brexit vote. The June 30 fully-phased in supplementary leverage ratio at the Corp increased to 6.1%, and the bank increased to 6.3%, primarily due to the preferred stock issuance in the second quarter. Please note that the capital impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management will be reflected in our third quarter 2016 capital ratios, and our estimate of this impact is noted on slide 16.", "We repurchased $390 million of common stock in 2Q 2016, under our prior common stock purchase program, announced in March of 2015. And importantly, our capital actions included in our 2016 CCAR capital plan demonstrated our focus to return value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.", "Moving on now to the next slide, let me briefly discuss our acquisition of GE Asset Management. The acquisition of GE Asset Management supports our plan to allocate capital to higher growth and return businesses. The purchase price was $435 million, subject to adjustments, with up to $50 million tied to incremental opportunities with GE. Excluding merger and integration cost, the transaction is expected to be accretive to operating basis EPS for the first full 12-month period as of July 1, 2016.", "Moving to slide 17, I'll now provide an update to our 2016 financial outlook. Please note that all of my comments relating to our 2016 outlook exclude any potential impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management. Relative to the first quarter, second quarter results reflected strong fee revenue growth and well-controlled expenses. Importantly, we continue to target positive fee operating leverage for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015, assuming current market conditions.", "Included in our expectation, to generate positive fee operating leverage is modest operating basis fee revenue growth for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015. Importantly, on the expense front, we now expect operating basis expenses to be approximately flat for full year 2016 relative to full year 2015.", "Included in our expectation of flat operating basis expenses for full year 2016 is upward pressure on regulatory and compliance costs and expenses related to the installation of new business for the second half of 2016.", "Contributing to the success in managing expenses has been the execution of State Street Beacon, our multi-year program to create cost efficiencies and to digitize our business. We now expect State Street Beacon to deliver at least $140 million in estimated annual pre-tax fiscal savings in 2016.", "Moving on to net interest revenue, for full year 2016 we currently expect operating basis NIR to modestly exceed the high end of our static scenario of $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion. This assumes U.S. interest rates remain static and some additional central bank easing occurs outside the U.S.", "So in summary, we're very pleased with the 2Q 2016 results, as sequential quarterly growth in fee revenue and strong expense control positions us well to achieve our 2016 financial objectives. Now let me turn the call over to Jay.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Mike. And Jennifer, we're now available to open the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question will come from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.", "Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Good morning, Jay and Mike.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Jay, I was just hoping you could share what the client reception has been so far to the digitization program and then, as you maybe look out a year or two, what do you think you will be able to do with this program in terms of servicing clients versus where you are today?", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Appreciate the question, Ashley. The Beacon effort as you know, is designed to improve straight-through processing, so clean up a lot of the handoffs and the inefficiencies. But importantly, when you do that, the impact it has on clients can be pretty dramatic. So one of the examples that I referenced in my prepared remarks, I just push out a little bit. One of the things that we do in huge volume is, at the end of the day produce a net asset value based on the workings of the day in the daily fund business where we have a pretty significant position globally, and the production of that net asset value is critical from a timing standpoint, and once you get that, that feeds downstream distribution systems, it feeds newspapers and other communication vehicles.", "We have seen through the most recent improvements in Beacon that we've been able to pull back that time of producing a net asset value 20 minutes to 30 minutes, which on an hour and a half window is significant. So our clients, who are ultimately concerned about satisfying their distribution systems, when we can deliver that 30 minutes early it gives everybody in the chain more time to react. It might seem mundane but to our clients it's a huge win.", "I'd say secondly, we experienced in the first quarter a 20% reduction in the number of reconciliations that we do within the company. And again, that just improves not only cost but accuracy and how data flows back to our clients.", "I think to your question ultimately, our vision or end game in this is not only to achieve the savings that are prescribed by Beacon but to the extent that we can digitize our internal environment and make it real-time to our clients, the ability to get information intraday, whether it's cash positions, whether it's risk management data, that's really where we're going with this and when we established Global Exchange a few years ago, that was done in order to take the benefit digitizing our internal production environment and start to provide information and analytic services to our clients, not just back office, but middle and front office as well. And in parallel, Global Exchange is introducing some exciting new products that give clients intraday access and insights to what's going on in their portfolio, all enabled by our ability through Beacon to digitize our internal environment. So, you've heard me say before, to me it is the next big thing in this business and we're making good progress.", "Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Great. Thank you for all the color there. And maybe a question for Mike as well. Appreciate the NII guidance, but can you just walk through your thoughts on what your liability pricing initiatives are likely to do to the balance sheet and just anything we should be mindful of in terms of accelerated refis and impact on NIM?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, Ashley. So first of all, I'd say from a liability pricing standpoint, we're really pleased with the success that we've had for the first six months of 2016. And at this point, I anticipate that that would continue into the second half of 2016. Specifically, we did increase the amount that we're charging for deposits, for example, in Europe when the ECB cut rates further in March. Obviously it's anybody's guess where the ECB will go from here, so it's a situation that we're watching carefully. But I would anticipate that we would look to move \u2013 at least in the near term, I would expect that we would move in lock-step with further changes with the ECB. So it's a situation that we're monitoring but I don't expect any change at this point from the pattern that we had good success with in the first half of the year. So as a result, I would expect that overall, the deposit levels that we saw in Q2 are likely to remain probably pretty close to that level over the remainder of the year. But again, it's a situation that's pretty fluid and one that we're watching pretty carefully.", "Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Great. Thank you for the color and congrats on the quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks, good morning. Mike, I was wondering if you could follow-up on your comments about the expenses. The Other line again, $255 million or so, really great control and a meaningful decline year-over-year. You mentioned professional services fees, but I guess I'd just ask you to walk us through, like is this a new run rate, are a lot of your professional services fees that you've kind of had to spend on in the past done and kind of the moving parts within your expense outlook, you mentioned some of the investments but I think that's the real delta into peoples' expectations thanks.", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Okay. Thanks, Ken. First of all, I appreciate the positive commentary on Q2 and I think those comments are well-deserved. I think, start off broadly and then go to your specific question. We feel really good, Ken, about the job that we've done managing expenses in the first half of 2016 and primarily I would focus on two areas that we've talked about previously. The first, as you accurately pointed out, we have done a good job at replacing a significant amount of the outside consulting expend with full time employees. And that's a real good trade economically, and we also expect that that will build a more sustainable infrastructure going forward. So we're real pleased around that.", "Second, we're obviously real pleased with our success to-date here around project Beacon and as I alluded to in my comments, we were able to accelerate some of the savings for 2016 around project Beacon, specifically, we moved faster on management spans and layers than we had previously planned. We also captured more of the savings through the increase in straight-through processing that Jay described. So I think we've done a good job on all those fronts for the first half of the year. There are some specific areas that we expect upward pressure on expenses in the second half of the year, and there are three specifically, Ken, that I would highlight here. The first is, we're \u2013 we have known new business in the global servicing business and we will obviously staff to service that new business. And that includes for example, the Allianz business that we've talked about publicly. So that would be an example.", "Now, specifically tying that to your Other operating expense question, we will actually have some expenses in the Other operating expense category because part of that arrangement includes a transition services agreement. It's basically a lift-out deal and so we have some transition service expenses that will show up in the second half of the year in Other operating expenses related to that particular piece of new business. So that's one.", "Second, while I really feel good about what we've done in terms of managing regulatory spending, we are going to see some upward pressure in the second half of the year around regulatory spending, particularly as it relates to the recovery and resolution planning that's gotten so much press here. There's an October 1 deliverable that we're very focused on. There's also a July 1, 2017 deliverable that we're very focused on and that will inevitably push up the level of regulatory spend in the second half of the year.", "And then just for completeness, I would add that while we accelerated some Beacon savings into the second quarter, I do expect that we'll accelerate some Beacon investments in the second half of the year. So from a net-net standpoint, I would expect Beacon to entail additional spending in the second half of the year as compared to the second quarter run rate.", "Now, all of that needs to be thought about, Ken, in the context of positive fee operating leverage for the full year. We are absolutely as a management team riveted on achieving that for the full year. So for example, if the fee revenue environment looked softer than it is right now, we'd have to look even harder at expenses in the second half of the year.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Great color, Mike. And just to follow-up, two of the legacy issues that you spoke to in the press release, the FX seems like that's now behind and also does this client billing true-up, on a GAAP basis, does that put that issue behind now as well?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So first of all on the FX piece, it does resolve the U.S. litigation that we have. And we continue to expect that the overall accrual that we have set up, which is $585 million, will be sufficient for all known issues. But again, it was the U.S. piece in particular that we feel real pleased putting behind us with this announcement.", "On the billing piece, Ken, the main point that I would make there is that at this point, we've completed our calculations at the client level. And I cannot emphasize enough that was just an extraordinary amount of detail going back, invoices over 18 years, literally millions of invoices at the client level. And our previous calculation had been in aggregate. So this refinement caused the update to the accrual. And I mean at this point, we're confident in the calculations we've done at the client level. But we're now \u2013 the next step is really now underway as we speak, which is we're now reviewing this detail with the impacted clients. And that's really the next step ahead of us and again, in putting this prior-year issue behind us.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Thanks for color, Mike.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.", "James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Hey, good morning. Maybe just a quick question on the living will, one of your peers discussed that changing to a single point of entry could increase expenses and higher long term debt costs. Is that a similar issue for you or how should we think about that for you guys?", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Jim, this is Jay. That's not a similar issue for us. We have pursued a single point of entry strategy from the beginning and continue to pursue that. So for us, it's more about absorbing the input from the Fed and the FDIC and marching to it. As Mike mentioned, the October date, and importantly, there's even more work to be done for the July, 2017 date but we have a pretty clear mandate for what we need to do and it's a matter of executing against that. So, no big shifts in strategy with regard to resolution.", "James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. That's really helpful. And then when we think about \u2013 the second question on the Deka Bank onboarding, it sounds like that's happening reasonably quickly. Is that the right conclusion? And when we look at the impact on expenses is that half of the growth? How do we think about the impact on your guidance of flat when you're tracking down in the first half?", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Let me start that one, Jim, and just give you a little bit more color on the Deka and Allianz Global Investors business. It's a large transaction as you could probably figure out from the size of the assets that we'll be servicing. One major component of it, which will be enabled beginning in the third quarter, is a large fund accounting operation, which spans Germany and Luxembourg, which adds to our Luxembourg leadership position, and creates a leadership position for us in Germany, which we think is a key marketplace. So we will take it over beginning of the third quarter. Revenues and expenses will go with that. As Mike mentioned, not unusual for a deal like this. Initially, we'll take it over intact as a transition agreement, and then we'll evolve it to our systems, and that will happen towards the end of the year. So that's a little bit of color on Deka and Allianz Global Investors. And, Mike, proportionality to the expenses?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. Jim, It's Mike. So, I'd really prefer not to get into specific numbers around client-specific arrangements, but I think it's fair to say, Jim, that it's part of the overall upward pressure that I mentioned in my prepared remarks around operating expenses for the second half of the year, relative to Q2. Some of it is to support net new business, including the Deka Allianz win. Second would include the upward pressure, given what we need to do around RRP. And then, third is the additional Beacon investments. I'd rather not get into more detail. But I think it's fair to say, on the net new business, that we expect that to help fee revenue for the second half of the year, as well as be an area that we spend some money to service. So that's all thought of as we gave you the updated outlook for full year 2016.", "James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay, right. So it sounds like the revenue is coming in coincidental with the expenses. So that's great. Thanks.", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Correct.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey, guys. Good morning. A couple of cleanup questions again around expenses. So the $140 million of Beacon savings this year relative to I guess, $100 million that you guys talked about in the past, is that just simply the faction (35:21) of timing or the size? In other words, did this take away from some of the savings we should think about for next year or the size of the ultimate savings got \u2013 was increased in your view?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So Alex, its Mike. At this point, we're still maintaining the $550 million net savings target for the full program. So I would suggest that you think about this as accelerating it into 2016. Now, I would note that we have not changed our outlook for 2017, so we still expect that increment to remain intact. So, therefore, you could deduce it's the savings in the out-years that are being brought up, some brought into 2017 and then some of the 2017 and beyond into 2016. Particularly around the areas that I mentioned, the improvement in the straight-through processing and the reduction in management spans and layers.", "Again, this will be a program, Alex, that I suspect we'll continue to give you updates over the next several years. So, stay tuned. The main point I'd reinforce is, really are doing a nice job in terms of executing on this program, and I would expect that to continue.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got you. And then a quick follow-up around the GE deal, and how we should think about it in near term, as well as longer term. So, I think you gave us the dollars in terms of revenue, so I was wondering if you could give us the expenses for the back half of the year that's going to come in with this deal. And then I guess, more importantly, as we think about this business phasing into State Street, what are the cost savings that you expect to realize from integrating it?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, Alex. Let me first reinforce the numbers that we talked about in the slide presentation. So, overall, for the first 12 months of the arrangement, so July 1, 2016 through June 30 of 2017, we expect the overall revenue contribution to be in the range of $270 million to $300 million. And while we haven't given you the specific expenses associated with it, given that we indicated that we expect this to be accretive in terms of overall EPS, and you can also look at the cost of the prefs that we issued in second quarter to essentially fund it, you can get a pretty good estimate of the first 12-month financial expectations for the overall arrangement.", "In terms of the Q3 contribution, we expect that the revenue for Q3 will be approximately $60 million, and we expect the contribution to pre-tax earnings, if we exclude the merger and integration cost, to be a modest positive. So think of it as something in the less than $5 million contribution here for Q3.", "So, in terms of where we go from Q3 to the following three quarters, I would note that we expect the expense synergies to really begin to materialize in Q4 and then ramp up further in Q1 and Q2 of 2017. And then, from a revenue perspective, we do expect to grow that $60 million in third quarter to something higher than that number in the first and second quarters of 2017, which is what gets you from a, call it a $240 million annualized number, in Q3, to something in the $270 million to $300 million range for the first full 12 months.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. And this $5 million number, that's net of the pref cost?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Oh, no. That's truly just the contribution of the business organization itself, and it's actually a little less than $5 million. So think of it as a modest contribution. But again, importantly, we are highly confident in our ability to get synergies through the combination of this organization, which is really terrific. I mean, 270 terrific employees, a little over 100 institutional clients, a fair number of them are actually overlapped with State Street's client base in the past. So, again, we're really jazzed up about the synergies here.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And Alex, just a footnote. We had set a 90% client retention rate. We achieved 95%, which was not shocking, but positive given what our expectations were.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Yeah, yeah. Understood. Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.", "Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi, good morning, folks.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Mike, thanks for all the expense detail. That's real helpful. Maybe, is it possible to talk a little bit about the trajectory of the Beacon saves? The $140 million, maybe if you can talk about the exit run rate in fourth quarter, or actually, the actual fourth quarter run rate of savings. And then as we go into 2017 for the $125 million, how you see that running through 2017. And then, I know it's early, but, essentially, it sounds like you're pulling some of the expense saves in from the outer years, so should we expect this project to be completed potentially by 2020?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So, let's see, a number of questions there, Brian. First of all, let me give you an important data point here. On a year-to-date basis, our Beacon saves for year-to-date 2016, relative to the same year-to-date period in 2015, was approximately $75 million. So, essentially, I mean, if you doubled that, you'd get to $150 million. And, basically, that syncs up with the point that I was making, that we expect now the full-year savings to be approximately $140 million for full-year 2016, versus full-year 2015 starting point. So you can conclude from that arithmetic that we expect some additional net spending on Beacon as we invest in particularly some IT areas in the second half of the year, as compared to the quarter two expense base.", "So, from a run rate standpoint, I think you can think of it as we'll be leaving full year 2016 at something pretty close to our current expenses. And again, a little bit higher net Beacon spending pushing that. So the savings number for the full year being a little bit less than what you'd get if you doubled the year-to-date savings number.", "Again, in terms of 2017, I'm sure we'll provide additional updates between now and the beginning of 2017. I think the main point is that we still expect the 2017 savings to be on top of the $140 million of savings that we expect to achieve in full year 2016. So, it should give you confidence that the pace here is actually accelerated. And I wouldn't, at this point, try to either change the $550 million full program target, or to change the end date. But, again, it's something that I'm sure we'll continue to give you updates on in the future.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay, that's helpful. And then, maybe to follow-up, on the net interest revenue outlook, can you just talk about what you're assuming there for the long \u2013 let's say for the 10-year Treasury yield, and whether you think there is any potential for raising any long term debt in conjunction with the resolution planning?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Okay. So, Brian, in terms of the net interest revenue, I believe, if my recollection is right this morning, I think the 10-year is at about 1.55%. And so, what we've assumed in the updated NIR forecast that we gave you is static rates in the U.S., and then, likely some easing by the Bank of England, probably in August. And so, it's really the combination of the grind in the portfolio, as the existing portfolio rolls over and gets reinvested at lower rates, coupled with this likely easing in the UK, are obviously factors that are putting some negative pressure on the second half of the year net interest revenue.", "As it relates \u2013 actually, one other data point, before I forget it, in the Q2, we did note on slide 12 of the slide deck that we did have \u2013 it was actually four discrete securities prepay. So it was unscheduled redemptions in Q2. That contributed $5 million of positive NIR in Q2. We don't expect that to repeat in Q3 and Q4. So if you're really \u2013 if you're doing the modeling, I would suggest you sort of start with a $541 million rather than a $546 million. Again, just, it will help the modeling make more sense.", "Your last question around the debt. I don't expect at this point to have to issue additional long term debt just because of the RRP. Again, we're working on a longer term capital plan that does ultimately include compliance with the proposed TLAC requirements. Now, again, TLAC, at this point, is a proposal, not a final rule. But as it relates specifically to your point around RRP, I don't anticipate having to issue long term debt just because of RRP. But again, the whole RRP situation is a pretty fluid one, as you can imagine.", "Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Right. Okay, that's helpful. I'll get back in the queue for a couple of follow-ups. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Adam Beatty with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you and good morning, I wanted to ask about the positive mix shift in asset management fees. And, obviously, there have been some outflows and some other factors that State Street doesn't necessarily control. But wanted to get your thoughts on the strategy there. You noted that you're introducing a suite of products that have pretty good fees associated with them. How much can you kind of target a positive mix shift, and how do you go about doing that with your products and your clients? And should we expect a run rate on that, or perhaps even more leverage? Thank you.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, thanks. Let me pick that one up. So first point is that, in the quarter, we had $35 billion of outflows, mostly passive equities and separate accounts and not ETFs. And I would say the other theme, which I referenced, is sovereign wealth funds, mostly oil-based sovereign wealth funds, looking to reallocate. We have been focused for some time on introducing new products that have higher yields to them from a standpoint of the fees and, more particularly, the management fees, and we've had good success with that. I referenced some of the new ETFs we brought out. That's a continuation on a theme. I'd also add that GLD, the gold fund, is probably more of a product for the times. But we've had great traction in our active quant equity products, which are doing nice from a performance standpoint, and therefore, the flows are coming in nicely, high-fee products, from our standpoint, the multi-asset class.", "And so, I would say it's been a conscious effort for the last, I would say, 18 months to 24 months, to focus on those higher-fee products. And I think we're making headway. If you look at the first quarter and the management fee growth of almost 5%, some of that's market, but some of it is a reflection of the mix shift. And as we sit mid-year looking towards rest of year, we expect to continue to see growth in the asset management business. Mostly based on introducing higher yielding products and getting positive flows into those products. I think that the commoditized end of our world tends to move with markets and other events. As you know, we have the largest ETF in SPY, the S&P 500, which trades pretty actively. But our strategy consciously is to move to the higher end of the product spectrum.", "Last point I would make, Adam, is that the GE Asset Management business is a really big add in supporting that strategy. And that not only do we think we have a great opportunity to compete in the outsourced CIO marketplace, given what GE brings, but GE brings a mix of more active products, high fee products that can be sold as standalone. But even more importantly, as part of a bundled mix to provide solutions, whether it's in a 401(k) setting, outsourced CIO, or other elements of the risk spectrum.", "Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Jay. I really appreciate that. That's great color. Also wanted to ask about the slide on Europe and the opportunities there, which was interesting so soon post-Brexit. And thinking about the competition there, both sort of U.S. domiciled and European domiciled, what would you say are the one or two biggest advantages that State Street has versus the competition, and maybe one or two of the bigger challenges? Thanks.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Let me pick that up, Adam. I think my Brexit-related comments, the only caveat I would make is that to the extent that Brexit and the EU bring down global growth or broad-based interest rates, that's outside of this commentary. But if you look at Brexit and our European strategy, we have a different business. So our business is driven by asset pools. Both pension, insurance and investment asset pools. So, if you think about managing and servicing assets, that's the starting point.", "We've seen, in the last couple years, as the Eurozone has had increasing economic pressure, savings rates go up. Savings rates continue to be pretty high in countries like Germany, Italy, France, and those products increasingly are not only growing, the asset pools are growing, but the assets are moving out of banks into investment products. So the environment there is quite good generally.", "Enter Brexit. Tremendous uncertainty about what Brexit means and how the UK will ultimately disentangle from the EU, and I'm sure it will take a long time for that to unwind. But from my standpoint, if you look at it through investment products, there are several structures that exist in Europe. And importantly, in Europe, as opposed to the U.S., which is one homogeneous market, Europe, you've got 20 different markets. And so, the notion of passporting or creating product in one domicile and being able to sell it across the Eurozone, is critical to success for an asset manager in Europe. And so it's likely, and there are some product structures, Oeics, SICAVs, UCIT. Oeics, for example, are created in the UK and they're passportable to the Eurozone. To the extent that the break between the UK and the Eurozone results in folks having to transition Oeics to things like SICAVs, then we're there to do that. We're the largest provider of these services across 11 different markets.", "Significantly, I think the big winners will be the offshore centers. Luxembourg and probably, more importantly, Ireland, who have been the winners in the last couple years with regard to flows. So that's kind of the landscape. That's why we view the Brexit event to be neutral, if not positive, given that we have the most comprehensive set of services across the most markets in Europe.", "From a competitive standpoint, when we acquired Deutsche Bank's business some years ago, it really catapulted us into leading positions in Germany, Ireland, the Intesa Sanpaolo deal gave us a leading presence in Italy. We've always been in the UK. We've built out our Luxembourg presence. So there's nobody near us with regard to servicing investment products, with the most geography covered across the most asset classes.", "I would say, secondarily, that the U.S. firms probably are more competent in the offshore centers of Lux and Dublin than the European providers would be. There's a couple of European providers that can provide Pan-European servicing, but pretty limited. So I would say we are at the top of that pyramid. Some of our U.S. competitors have component parts of the European puzzle, but nobody has as comprehensive a servicing capability as we do in Europe. Hence, the enthusiasm.", "Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Very nice. Thank you. Look forward to updates in the future. Thanks again.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS.", "Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC", "Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just one quick one on revenue here first. So, it looked like your servicing fee rate ticked up here this quarter. I know you guys commented on new business wins. So, is it right to assume that that rate and that sort of fee level would be sustainable and it's just a mix shift given some of the wins that are there this quarter?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Brennan, it's Mike, as we've talked about before, there are a number of things that can impact that calculation that you described. So I would \u2013 and actually in particular, the net new business has been positive here for a while. And as I talked about in the prepared remarks, we expect net new business to add to overall GS fees in the second half of the year relative to the Q2 run rate. But I wouldn't \u2013 again, please remember that only approximately 60% of the GS fee revenue is driven on basis points on assets. So, swings in the market, for example, can play havoc with the ratio that you're referencing.", "Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC", "Yeah, I get it, but it's the only way we basically have to model your revenue. So that's what we're left to do in the valley of the blind. But anyway, that's fine. I appreciate the commentary. And then one more clarification point also on the expense front. Seems like you had indicated some upward regulatory spend in your comments, Mike, and so was just curious about how that was going to manifest itself in the P&L. It seemed like you all had gotten some success in shifting some of that professional services spend up to comp. And so, are you saying that we might see a little bit of an uplift from the 2Q levels in professional services or is that rather going to come through on the comp line?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, Brennan, First, I appreciate the compliment and we have had good success making that change that you described. I do expect that there will be a little bit of upward pressure on the comp and employee benefit line from the regulatory expenses but I think the majority will likely show up in other operating expenses, particularly given the very tight time frames that we're dealing with around the resolution and recovery planning in particular. I mean the October 1 deadline is very real, obviously, rapidly approaching, and as Jay indicated, the July 1, 2017 one is very meaningful as well. So for both of those reasons, I would expect that outside consulting expense will increase in Q3 and Q4.", "Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC", "Sure, but that would probably then just follow the same pattern that you all were able to execute in \u2013 over the longer term once you get past the near term deadlines, shifting that into a sort of lower priced but comp-oriented mix down the road is that a reasonable assumption?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "That's a very fair assumption, Brennan. Absolutely.", "Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP", "Thanks for taking my questions. Jay and Mike, I had a bigger question if you kind of back up a little bit. This quarter feels like one of the things we've been looking for is an inflection point in some processes and pressures that you've been kind of working your way through. Mike, I got two for you and I got two for Jay. When you look at, Mike, the efficiency, you've been investing in the efficiency, how far along do you feel like we are? Are we getting to that point where the benefits are going to outweigh the investments? And then also on the balance sheet restructure, we've been in that for a couple of years which really started with the liquidity coverage ratio and capital requirements. Have we kind of come through that because we're starting to see NIR starting to grow again. So have we kind of gone through the inflection point on those two things?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, Marty. Let me take both of those. First, from an efficiency standpoint, sure, I feel very positive that in the first half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015, project Beacon generated $75 million of net savings. Now, we invested in there, but the point is, it contributed $75 million of net savings. And so I \u2013 yeah, I do believe that project Beacon has already shown that it's accretive in the near term.", "In addition, I would point to the success \u2013 as we've talked about with several of the other analysts, the success we've had in moving the regulatory expense to lesser expensive full-time employees rather than expensive outside consultants. I think that's also an important inflection point that has helped us.", "Now it doesn't mean that there isn't upward pressure on regulatory expense, particularly around RRP. But I do think that we've shown that we are executing on the plan that we had previously communicated which is to make that shift which ultimately saves us money.", "On the balance sheet restructuring, I do feel positive about where the balance sheet is positioned. I mean, I don't think we have to look any further than the results of the last CCAR that are now public to note that our mark-to-market sensitivity under the severely adverse scenario is quite a bit better than what it had done previously. And so that was an important step forward for us from a balance sheet restructuring. At this point, we're fully compliant with the LCR rules. So, yeah, I feel good about all of that.", "Now again, the one area that hasn't hit an inflection point yet is really market interest rates. I mean, maybe the Fed will increase again in the reasonable near future. But the \u2013 outside of the U.S., it's still been moving in a negative position. So that's the area that I would say we haven't yet hit the inflection point but I'd like to believe at least in the U.S., maybe that could come sooner rather than later.", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP", "Then, Jay, when we look at the ability to take the cloud, we've invested in since building out the new resources and information, we're talking about those new products, you seem more confident in that but as we're talking about that in terms of generate some revenues from those newer services that we're going to get from the data out of the cloud. And then also, you are guiding a transition from building out your ETFs to really now putting in GE and becoming more active management, higher fees, so is that transition starting to kind of go through an inflection point that you can start to see some build-out?", "And then, Jay, just overall, State Street's gone through periods in the past where you've had to go through these transitions. It set the stage for very good performance after you went through these inflection points. Just if you would kind of comment on how your thoughts would be compared to past inflection points that we've seen.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Happy to do that, Marty. Yeah, I do think this is an inflection point. I think you started out with a cloud and Beacon and that is critically important from a standpoint of managing cost in a difficult environment, but even more important relative to continuing to differentiate our services, vis-a-vis the competitors and the interest of what clients are looking for today. So the first point I would make is that some of our successes in the marketplace are not only a reflection of us producing better capabilities, better products, information-based services, but it's also a reflection of the pressure that our clients are feeling in a low return environment to outsource more work. So I would put that in the inflection point transition bucket too. I don't see that slowing down anytime soon, so whether it's a mutual fund manager moving to outsource middle office or in the alternatives world moving from hedge, now private equity and real estate, there's a surge to outsource those things. So I think it's a convergence of more outsourcing driven by the environment and our client base based on our continued ability to differentiate our product sets and compete effectively at good pricing to win new business. I think that's a trend that we're likely to continue to see and the cloud and Beacon is right at the center of that because this business trades more and more on the ability to provide analytics and information and insight from the processing work that we do, and that's going to continue. The other thing I could add is the regulatory pressure on our clients again is forcing both of those things to happen.", "I think similarly in the world of asset management, we have been on a journey the last couple of years, to transition, I wouldn't say completely pivot, but transition our business to maintaining those core products that we have but building out our ETF distribution capabilities in the U.S. and Europe, investing in higher-yielding products. I think the GE acquisition potentially is an inflection point for us. In the world of solutions, which is a huge opportunity for everybody in asset management, you need to have enough asset classes and competencies to be able to mix them together to create outcomes, and GE just provides an enormous new set of capabilities for us to compete more effectively in that world. And so, I would say it's ETFs, it's not necessarily single asset class products that we'll deliver to the marketplace, but this notion of solutions is going to continue to be a key theme in the asset management world, and I think we're well positioned and the GE transaction just puts us over the top with regard to capabilities that we can leverage across our global institutional distribution system to continue to grow.", "So I do feel like we're passing through a period here where we're getting our costs better aligned for the realities of today. We're moving digitally which is where the future is going to be with regard to the clients' needs, and I'd say asset management is going through a similar transition.", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi, good morning.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "I had a question on the NIM, you were able to keep that essentially flat Q on Q, and while yields came down a bit, cost of funds came down more. I'm just wondering on the cost of funds side, you had some nice decline in the non-U.S. transaction accounts and I know you've been charging depositors non-operating charges. But I'm wondering what happened in the quarter that enabled a pretty big step down in the non-U.S. transaction accounts?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, Betsy. It's Mike. Two items that would I highlight around that line item on our average rates earned and paid page. Two points impacted that favorably for the quarter. First of all, as you correctly pointed out, we did increase the amount of what we're charging for deposits at a greater pace than the cut, for example, in the ECB rate. So that helped that line item in particular, Q2 versus Q1, the greater amount that we were charging for European deposits in particular.", "Second though, it's a little bit of a funny nuance. We do have in any given quarter decisions to make around whether we swap the non-U.S. deposits into U.S. dollars and put them with the Fed or whether in fact we leave them outside the U.S. at central banks abroad. In particular, for a variety of technical reasons, we swapped less to U.S. dollars in Q2 than we had in Q1. And so what that meant was, the FX swap costs that we normally run through that line, that was a \u2013 there was a smaller charge for that in Q2 versus Q1.", "So it had a similar impact on the asset side as it did on the liability side, so no net impact to the NIM. And in fact you can see the decline in the interest bearing deposits with banks line item that is essentially the partial offset to that. But from an economic standpoint, the piece that I would focus on is the more disciplined liability pricing, particularly outside the U.S.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, and is there more room for that to run from here?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, obviously it's a situation that we're monitoring very carefully. At this point, I don't expect that we would see even greater daylight for example in EMEA between what we are charging for deposits and for example the ECB rate. But again, it's a situation that we'll monitor carefully and if the ECB moves more negative, it's something that we'd have to look at carefully.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, I just ask because you mentioned there was a couple of small, but one-timers in realizing some gains in the first \u2013 in the second quarter, so as those roll off you've got some opportunity to squeeze liability cost to keep NIM flat in 3Q?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, again, first of all, I would take that $5 million out. You see that in the ABS line, those were four discrete prepayments that I do not expect to repeat in Q3. So I would calculate the NIM with that $5 million out of there. And in terms of Q3 and Q4 outlook for NIM, unfortunately, the two main known-knowns are the likely reduction in the Bank of England rate and then just the continued grind in the portfolio as it rolls over if rates stay static. So, I'd say at least near term there is more near term downward pressure on NIM. But that's factored into the points that I made in the prepared remarks and the fact that we expect to be probably modestly above the upper end of the $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion range.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.", "Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "I just have one quick question, or maybe two here. So, you had some peers that were talking about looking to lower non-operational deposits still. But given you just went through a program of lowering non-operational deposits and looked relatively healthy for the SLR and also for CCAR, would you look to actually, if you had the opportunity to expand the balance sheet further if you saw some more chances to add deposits here at this point in time?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Brian, it's Mike, at this point we really feel very positive about the size of the balance sheet and the success that we've had over the last five quarters in managing downward the overall level of excess deposits. So, they were up very modestly Q2 versus Q1 on average, but I don't at this point feel pressure to reduce those further in the second half of the year. And, with any good fortune here maybe in 2017 we'll get some additional Fed Fund increases, maybe even in December and that would probably reduce them further on their own without explicit action. But it's something obviously we monitor very carefully, and particularly in situations where there's potentially a flight to quality, it's something that we'd have to watch very carefully. But at this point, we're really comfortable with the overall size of the balance sheet and the level of excess deposits here in Q2.", "Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. And was there any fee waivers left in the second quarter? I know it's not a big deal for you, but just curious.", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No, nothing meaningful.", "Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP", "Hello. Thank you for taking the question. Can you give us an update on the search for the new CFO?", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, I'll give you a quick one, Geoff, which it's progressing nicely and I would expect in pretty short order, we would have something to report, so we're getting near the end of the process and I'm pleased with the way the process is going.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP", "Then, you clearly went through a similar exercise two years or three years ago, can you just explain where your focus this time is maybe a bit different from where it was in the past?", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I'd say we're looking for a world-class CFO of a financial institution, and fortunately the \u2013 what I've found, and you never know, but in this case it's encouraging, is that the State Street brand still has enormous pull in the marketplace. I think people like our story, like our prospects for moving through this regulatory environment. Like the growth story, so we're going to have good choices.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, Jay. Good morning, Mike.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hello?", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Gerard.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good morning. Sorry about that. That's okay, and it's been a long call, I know. Mike, can you share with us in the investment securities book, your yield held up well in the quarter and I noticed some of the pieces you gave us, the yields fell for example in the mortgage backed area. But in the asset backed securities area, you had a nice pop in the yield in that portfolio. Can you share with us what was purchased in there or how are you maintaining that 1.92% yield for the entire portfolio?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, so let's see, a couple of different questions in there, Gerard. First, as I mentioned a couple times, we did have four specific securities that were in the asset backed securities category prepay in the second quarter, and the result of those four discrete securities prepaying in total, was a one-time boost to NIR in Q2 of $5 million. So I would urge you to wash that $5 million out of the ABS number. So if you do that, the 1.43% yield for ABS that you see on the average rates page would in fact be closer to flat with the 1.32% from the quarter before it.", "If you take that piece out, the main factors are the things that we've talked about, which are on the positive side, we've continued to do a very good job of liability pricing discipline and in fact, got some benefit from the higher level of charging for deposits in \u2013 for the euro deposits in particular. Going the other way though, was in fact the impact of the continued grind, where the maturing fixed rate assets tend to mature at a rate lower than the new fixed rate investment. So again, it's a moving picture, obviously, but I'd first wash out the $5 million and then those \u2013 the two points that I just made are the main factors for the quarter.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great, and is it safe to assume the duration really hasn't changed much in that securities portfolio?", "Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, it has not changed materially. There has certainly been no material change in our philosophy there, Gerard. So again, it will fluctuate up and down in any given quarter but I wouldn't \u2013 we invest through the cycle, no change in philosophy.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great. Then, Jay, obviously on your Investor Day you guys have given us the data to support a number of your number one rankings in the businesses you're in, whether it's in the middle market \u2013 middle office outsourcing or U.S. mutual fund accounting. A number of number one rankings. Then since the beginning of 2014, if our calculations are right, it looks like you've won about over $2.5 trillion of assets under custody new business. Then I go to your slide four in today's slide deck, which is a great slide, and I look at the servicing fees from the middle of 2014 through today and there's been no growth. Can you share with us what's going on with that business? Again, considering you're doing so well in winning new business, you're a dominant player, what's causing it not to grow?", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, I would say you've got to decompose the components, Gerard, and I would say your lead-in was completely accurate and appropriate, in that we are, I would say, disproportionately winning our share of the new business in the marketplace. And whether it's number one in ETFs, where we have close to a 70% share or U.S. mutual funds, where I referenced the offshore domiciles of Luxembourg and Dublin, on and on.", "What \u2013 the other things that move the needle on that service fee line would be flows and over the period of time that you've referenced, there have been outward flows in some higher yielding products like mutual funds, upward flows in ETFs. You have seen a retrenchment generally from emerging markets which have higher versus lower fees when you get to more traditional asset classes. So, I would say the effect of markets flows and new business are the ingredients which drive that line. And the part I'm most confident about is the new business, the flows we really don't control, but when they move from higher-yielding fee categories to lower-yielding and when they move from products that might be higher revenue products to lower revenue products, we don't influence that, and obviously the markets.", "So, I would say we think long-term that we are best positioned in those markets that will continue to grow. Things fluctuate over periods of quarters and years. But for us it's making sure that we continue to position against the most attractive clients in the segment and the most attractive segments and making sure that consistent with the Investor Day, that we're keeping our expenses in line, so that we can maintain our margin. And as the environment becomes more favorable for some of those products that I referenced, then we would assume that that would flow to the bottom line. We take a long view.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thank you. Appreciate the color.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I will now turn the conference back to management for their closing remarks.", "Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Jennifer, and thanks, everybody, for your time and attention today. We look forward to speaking with you at the end of the third quarter.

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them, even if our views change.", "As with the past few quarters, we are continuing with the new pattern of releasing our financial results on the fourth Wednesday of the month following each quarter end. As such, we expect to hold our fourth quarter earnings call on Wednesday, January 25, 2017.", "Now, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Joseph Hooley", "Thanks, Anthony. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our performance in 3Q '16 and our ability to deliver positive fee operating leverage for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Our results reflect continued momentum in fee revenue and our ongoing commitment to expense management. Our new business results remain strong with $1.3 trillion in new assets servicing commitments year-to-date including $212 billion in the third quarter.", "We're making good progress in the implementation of State Street Beacon, our multi-year program to digitize our business, deliver significant value and innovation for our clients and lower expenses across the organization. Importantly, through the execution of State Street Beacon we are differentiating our capabilities by providing enhanced analytics and insights to our clients to help manage their enterprise data and enhance their operational performance and risk management. The integration of our recent acquisition of GE Asset Management is going well with over 260 employees successfully on-boarded and client retention exceeding our objectives. This acquisition extends SSGA's core investment management and alternatives capabilities, and enhances the value add solutions to our clients.", "I'll turn your attention to Slide number 5 to highlight our continued progress against our 2016 strategic priorities. We continue to advance our objective to become a digital leader in financial services to execution of State Street Beacon. Throughout the third quarter of 2016 we continue to improve client service and advanced our goal of creating a digitally enabled platform to improve the breath of product offerings and efficiency. Our platform is providing data quicker, better and with more transparency than ever before. For example, we have delivered a number of new solutions including net asset value oversight, creating more line of sight into the composition of a fund's net asset value at the end of the day, and enhanced asset owner strategy providing support to asset onus as they in-source asset management in enterprise pricing web which prices our clients' funds faster than ever before.", "We also have a solution to meet the new SEC modernization rules that were finalized early in October, and we are already seeing strong interest from our clients. In terms of driving growth from our core franchise, we continue to achieve strong asset servicing wins with approximately $212 billion in the quarter. Our new business is yet to be installed at quarter-end; it was just over $500 billion. An example of our efforts to build on existing relationships is that we were recently appointed by our long-standing client PIMCO to provide investment manager services outsourcing in support of $1.55 trillion in assets. Separately and a mandate that we have one pending final contract negotiations, PIMCO has selected State Street to provide accounting custody, fund administration, and transfer agency services for an additional $140 billion in offshore funds which is a high growth market segment.", "State Street's industry leading offshore fund services business, an operating platform with key considerations and PIMCO's decision to consolidate their business with State Street. In our asset management business, we continue to generate new business in our higher yielding product lines with $12 billion in 3Q '16 ETF net inflows. We did experience overall outflows of $36 billion during the quarter, driven primarily by reductions of the cash invested in securities lending, and also money market reform making prime funds less appealing for certain investors, as well as institutional net outflows. Importantly, these outflows were primarily in our lower-based fee institutional products.", "Separately, our State Street Global Exchange Group recently launched State Street Media Stats, a quantitative investment insights tool that draws from digital media and other large consumer data sets. This platform allows clients to quickly and efficiently collect large volumes of data, analyze it, and assess impact on the price risk and liquidity of individual assets. We have now achieved positive fee operating leverage for the first three quarters of 2016 relative to the same period of 2015. State Street Beacon has been a key factor in this progress and is ahead of our original schedule for 2016. We now expect to generate at least $165 million in estimated annual pre-tax expense savings in 2016 with a full effect felt in 2017.", "Returning capital to our shareholders remains a strong priority and we declared quarterly common stock dividends per share of $0.38 in 3Q '16, an increase of 12% over 2Q '16. We also bought back $325 million in common stock. We are focusing our attention and efforts on these strategic priorities which we expect will allow us to generate positive fee revenue growth and to achieve our objective to generate positive fee basis operating leverage this year relative to 2015. And we would also like to let you know that in line with many of our peers that we will not be hosting in Investor Day in 2017 given our focus on executing our multi-year strategy that we laid out during our 2016 Investor Day. We expect to provide a detailed update at our 2018 event and of course we'll provide updates on progress as we always do each quarter.", "Before I turn the call over to Mike, I want to note our announcement in September of the appointment of our new CFO; Eric Aboaf. Eric will join us in mid-December. He served as the CFO at Citizens and prior to that spent a dozen years at Citi, including the last six as Treasurer. Eric brings a wide range of expertise in global banking regulation, treasury, and finance to the role of CFO which he will assume in March of 2017. We truly appreciate Mike's hard work and efforts through the transition and he will continue to be our CFO through the end of 2016 fiscal reporting. We look forward to having Eric join the team to further execute the finance and treasury initiatives in support of our strategic priorities.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Mike who will review our financial performance for the third quarter, and then we'll both be available to take your questions. Mike?", "Michael Bell", "Thank you, Jay, and good morning everyone. This morning before I start my review of our operating basis results, I'd like to note that our GAAP basis results for the third quarter include two notable items; first, on July 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of GE asset management. Third quarter results included estimated revenue of $65 million, estimated ordinary business expenses of $57 million and approximately $29 million of acquisition-related costs. Second, we reported a pre-tax charge of approximately $42 million related to previously disclosed investigations by U.S. governmental agencies concerning our U.K. transition management business in 2010 and 2011.", "Now refer to Slide 6 in the slide presentation for a discussion of our operating basis results for 3Q '16 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 which I'll refer to as year-to-date. 3Q '16 results reflect continued success managing our expenses and generating fee revenue growth. Operating basis EPS for 3Q '16 increased to $1.35 per share from $1.15 in 3Q '15 and decreased from 2Q '16 which included the benefit from seasonality associated with securities finance. Year-to-date EPS increased 3% compared to the same period a year ago driven by a decrease in expenses and additional share repurchases.", "Notably 3Q '16 pre-tax margin increased 190 basis points to 30.7% from 28.8% in the year ago period primarily reflecting strong expense management, particularly the continued execution of State Street Beacon, our multi-year program to create cost efficiencies and to digitize our business. On the capital front, in 3Q '16 we declared a common stock dividend of $0.38 a share representing an increase of 12%, and we purchased $325 million of our common stock.", "Moving to Slide 7, we're pleased to achieve significant positive fee operating leverage in 3Q '16 compared to 3Q '15. In addition, as you can see on Slide 8, continued progress in managing expenses has resulted in slight year-to-date positive fee operating leverage compared to the year ago period.", "Now turn to Slide 9 for review of our 3Q '16 operating basis revenues; servicing fees increased from the year ago quarter and from 2Q '16 primarily due to net new business. Measurement fees increased from 3Q '15 and 2Q '16 primarily reflecting the contribution from the GE asset management acquisition. Foreign exchange revenue decreased from 3Q '15, primarily due to lower volatility and client-related volumes. Securities finance revenue increased from 3Q '15 primarily reflecting growth in enhanced custody and higher spreads in our agency business. Processing fees and other revenue increase from 3Q '15 due to higher revenue associated with tax evasion investments.", "Moving to Slide 10, net interest revenue decrease from 2Q '16 primarily reflecting lower investment portfolio yields, a temporary increase in wholesale funding in 3Q '16 and small number of discrete security prepayments in 2Q '16.", "Now let's turn to Slide 11 to review 3Q '16 operating basis expenses. Notably expense control continued in 3Q '16, primarily reflecting strong progress for our State Street Beacon program and effective management of our other operating expenses. Excluding the impact from GE asset management, total operating basis expenses decreased from the year-ago quarter driven by Beacon-related savings and a significant reduction in professional services costs, partially offset by higher regulatory expenses and cost of supporting our business.", "And then move to Slide 13 to review our capital highlights. Our capital ratios remained strong which has enabled us to deliver on a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. Compared to June 30, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased under the fully faced in standardized and advanced approach, primarily driven by lower risk weighted assets, partially offset by the acquisition of GE asset management. The September 30 fully phased in supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation and at the bank decreased modestly, primarily due to the GE asset management acquisition. We repurchased $325 million of common stock in 3Q '16 and our common stock purchase program announced in July of 2016.", "Moving on to the next slide, I'll briefly discuss our recently completed acquisition of GE asset management. The acquisition of GE asset management supports our plan to allocate capital to higher growth and return businesses. In 3Q '16 GE asset management contributed $65 million in estimated operating basis revenue and $57 million in estimated operating basis expenses. We continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to operating basis EPS for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 2016. We expect 4Q '16 fee revenue and expenses from the acquired business to be similar to 3Q '16 levels. Importantly, as the integration progresses we expect further revenue growth and expense synergies in the first half of 2017.", "Moving to Slide 15, I'll update you on where we stand regarding our financial outlook. Please note that all of my comments relating to 4Q '16 and full year 2016 outlook exclude the impact from the acquisition of GE asset management. 3Q '16 results reflected strong expense management, as well as fee revenue growth. We expect 4Q '16 results to support our target to achieve positive fee operating leverage for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015 assuming current market conditions. We now expect operating basis fee revenue growth for full year 2016 to be approximately flat versus full year 2015. We expect full year 2016 operating basis expenses to be slightly lower relative to full year 2015; and 4Q '16 operating basis expenses to be slightly higher than 3Q '16 as we increase investments in State Street Beacon and are expected to incur regulatory related expenses.", "Importantly, we now expect to deliver through the execution of State Street Beacon, at least a $165 million in estimated annual pre-tax savings for full year 2016.", "Moving on to net interest revenue; we expect 4Q '16 operating basis NIR to be slightly lower than 3Q '16. And for full year NIR to exceed the high-end of our prior full year 2016 static scenario of $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion.", "In summary, we're pleased as the third quarter positions us well to achieve our 2016 financial objectives.", "And now, let me turn the call back over to Jay.", "Joseph Hooley", "Thanks, Mike. And Amy, we're now available for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.", "Glenn Schorr", "First question is, is the 165 up from 140 for the full year. Should we think of that as a pull-forward of 2017 Beacon-related costs or is that incremental cost found throughout the process?", "Michael Bell", "Glenn, I would characterize it is a general acceleration in savings, I mean we're still targeting $550 million for the total program but importantly, the $125 billion of savings that we expect for 2017 has not changed. So I really think of it as an overall acceleration, probably some '18 and '19 savings coming into '17 and then some of the '17 savings coming into '16. But importantly at this point, we haven't changed the 550.", "Glenn Schorr", "No problem, we'll still take it. And then in terms of the -- just a lot of moving parts here, so any color would be great. You have decent asset under custody growth but the servicing fee was up 1%. Can we talk about the dynamics of the asset, the type of business you're at because you're winning new business but what's rolling off and what kind of fee compression we're seeing underneath the covers?", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes, let me start that one Glenn. So you're right, the AUC quarter-to-quarter was up pretty nicely, the service fees are up 1%. I'd encourage you not to look at just a quarter, I think if you look at full year, we're up 5% which seems kind of in line with our assets over revenue metric that we use. But I'd say in the third quarter specifically, we were -- you had markets mixed, if or down, domestic markets up, the strong dollar pushed back a little bit on service fees. So that's -- as opposed to 1%, if you look three quarters to-date, the 5% I think is probably a better reflection. The business that we're winning as is typically the case is all over the place.", "Year-to-date, the EMEA business, largely Europe, has contributed over 50% of the new business wins. Highlighted by -- we talked earlier in the year about the Allianz win and then more recently the PIMCO deal which is a big deal, $140 billion of offshore assets in a place that -- because of Brexit and other things I think will continue to see growth in those offshore domiciles of blocks. And in Dublin, I guess the one other point I might make from a highlight standpoint as you've seen some trail-off in the hedge fund performance, so we've seen some outflows in hedge funds; my view is that that's more likely cyclical, I think performance recently has improved, I suspect the flows may have backed the other way.", "But the money is going to go somewhere so we've seen more money move to other alternative categories, private equity, real estate which we view as a positive situation from the standpoint of opportunity. So pretty well balanced globally, little bit more of an emphasis on the U.K., on the European markets given some big deals. And a little bit of mix out of hedge but moving to some of the other alternative asset classes is how I kind of characterize the story.", "Glenn Schorr", "Great. Between is the 140 PIMCO included in the 212 for the quarter of new wins?", "Joseph Hooley", "No.", "Glenn Schorr", "Okay, great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.", "Ashley Serrao", "Good morning. Jay, did the asset management consolidation has been a theme and you've been active at GE. And it looks like segment margins are moving in the right direction but when you think about the future of the investment franchise, do you think you had the right mix of active passive products or the right European footprint? And would you look to add more capabilities via M&A?", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes, Ashley, let me -- I would say that the GE acquisition was a big step forward and providing a more diversified and frankly, active oriented asset classes, not only in traditional equities in fixed income but also in the alternative classes. So that was the biggest gap that we had and I think we've nicely filled that gap, you've heard from Mike's commentary that we're off to a good start with GE asset management. I think where we've got a pretty decent balance when you look at our passive which still dominates the AUMs in the active business; increasingly we're investing as we talk about in ETFs and we had a good ETF quarter, not just ETFs but higher revenue yielding ETFs which is I think what drove the 5% year-to-date and the 5% quarter-to-quarter revenue uptick.", "Multi-asset class solutions was another category where solutions generally -- but we can combine passive and active strategies to produce outcomes. It was also a good statement in the third quarter, we had good uptick and flows in the multi-asset class. So I don't -- from an asset class coverage standpoint Ashley, I think we're -- there weren't any huge gaps. Again, I think GE is a -- plugs a big gap and we have high expectations that the GE Group who have good track records and a lot of their strategies can be leveraged against the distribution prowess of State Street.", "I would say that -- the other last point I would make is that from a geographical standpoint, we're still focused on ETFs in Europe and I would say that's an unfolding story as we build up some of the distribution into the private banks and continue to enhance the product line up but your starting point was the consolidation in the asset management industry and I happen to think that we're probably at -- we're at the beginning of that phase and the end but we feel pretty good with regard to the competencies that we have to compete active, passive and solutions market, globally.", "Ashley Serrao", "Okay, thanks for all the color there. And Mike can you talk about tactical usage of wholesale funding in 3Q? Just walk us through the puts and takes for your 4Q net interest revenue guidance please?", "Michael Bell", "Sure. So Ashley first in terms of a wholesale funding, we did expand our use of wholesale funding in 3Q relative to 2Q by approximately $2.5 billion and we did that basically to accelerate some of the CD issuances that we otherwise would have had in 4Q under a normal operating environment, just given all the uncertainty in the turbulence. As a result of our money market reform, we just thought it was prudent to go ahead and essentially advance finance the -- with higher levels of wholesale CDs in the 3Q. And so that cost us obviously some NIR but we expect that to be really relatively temporary because I would expect to get back to normal in 4Q.", "So as we think about the role forward from 3Q to 4Q, it really -- Ashley it's mainly the story that we've talked about previously, we -- the portfolio turnover particularly in Europe continues to see maturing securities at higher yields than what we're able to reinvest those funds in at today, and so as a result of that grind in the rates we would expect to see modestly lower NIR in 4Q versus 3Q. There are lot of moving parts in any given -- in a given quarter but those are really the headlines.", "Ashley Serrao", "Okay, thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawkins with UBS.", "Brennan Hawken", "Good morning, thanks for taking the question. So just a question on Beacon for next year, I know Glenn touched on it but just to dig a little deeper, initially I think that the profile for cost savings on the program was to show an increase in 2017 versus the savings you initially expected in 2016. Normally when these programs are devised, the second year -- it works out better than the first. Why shouldn't investors believe that that general profile and trajectory would remain intact despite -- and the idea that you had better savings this year would only lead to even better results next year.", "Michael Bell", "Sure, Brennan, it's Mike. In terms of a Beacon, first off, maybe just stepping back from your question for just a second; I would emphasize -- I really feel like we've done a very good job in terms of project Beacon, not just on the expense side but also some of the improvements that have helped our overall service levels for our clients. So overall, we're feeling really good about the program at this point. In terms of your question specifically around the savings, the net savings in 2017 versus 2016, at this point Brennan we expect that there will be a continued uptick in investments that we're making around Beacon and we believe that those investments will pay-off handsomely in 2018, 2019, 2020; but as a result of accelerating some of the savings into 2016 and given just a track record that we're on right now, we think it's also a good idea to work to accelerate some of the investment so that includes investments in IT, development spending, testing, infrastructure all things that we believe will position us with even more confidence for 2018 and beyond savings.", "Brennan Hawken", "Okay, great. So in that number and there is a lot going on beneath the surface.", "Michael Bell", "That's exactly, right.", "Brennan Hawken", "Thanks, Mike. And then a follow-up, pointing back a little bit, when we think about the pressure that's expected to come to bear on -- particularly for the asset management business, the broker sold active side and your clients therefore deal well. Is there a way that you are adjusting your services or offerings or positioning yourself to provide further and more enhanced support for those clients as they work their way through this significant changed and how can you basically make sure you're well positioned to capitalize on potential opportunities as they come out.", "Michael Bell", "Yes, Brennan, let me handle this -- handle that question and I'll take in two dimensions. I'll first take it from an asset management dimension which maybe was where you were initially headed but from a fiduciary rule the impact of that on product and distribution, I think it leads to a more model based product and as Jay just recently in last couple weeks announced a distribution agreement with RBC where they are using -- we've got an investment and a robo advisor which will use the robo advisor to provide asset allocation among ETFs sold through the RBC distribution channel. So I think that model which in this case happens to be sponsored by SSGA is one of the things that you'll see going forward given the impact of the fiduciary rule. I think if you flip over to the asset servicing side, the fact that we have invested heavily in the ETF servicing platform to provide a lot of online metrics to not only authorized participants but to distributors position us well as ETFs and other more were quantitative model driven products are packaged in order to satisfy the needs of the fiduciary rule.", "I think you could also say and this isn't a direct link, but the work we're doing in Beacon, which has the effect and we're already seeing some of this from a service provider standpoint of giving our clients kind of full transparency into the calculation of net asset values and all the things that result, and end of day pricing for a product, or a group of products. I think it vantage the distributors from a standpoint of being able to pull out -- all that together in a timely manner in order to price products at the end of the day. So, I would say in sum that would be on the servicing side, I think ETF and other quantitative model different products will be a key contributor to how distribution, really how a product evolves to suit the fiduciary rule.", "And I think some of the work we're doing in Beacon the speed, the turnaround, the transparency of pricing will also advantage the product manufacturers, who are key clients in order to provide effective packaging of product, to meet the new fiduciary role. ", "Brennan Hawken", "Great, thanks for all that color. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Ken Usdin", "Hi, thanks to morning. might be a little bit of a subtlety but seems like a slight change in your outlook for full year fees, kind of coming in more flattish than modestly higher and you had a really good quarter in aggregate, so I am just wondering is there something that we should be thinking about third the fourth or just -- or some little conservative as built-in given the macro environment. ", "Michael Bell ", "Yes Ken, its Mike. It's really the latter, a couple things. And again I view these as very minor tweaks as opposed to anything not wholesale, but if I look at the macro environment for a second, the currency impact particularly in the U.K. is a headwind for the rest of the year, as compared to where it was earlier in the year pre-Brexit. So, as an example; the pound based revenue that we have is approximately 8% of our overall revenue, we get some benefit obviously on the expense side of that but the -- if I just focus on the fee revenue the weakness in the pound hurts the translation to it to U.S. dollars. Second, as Jay talked about a minute ago there continues to be some risk off in the environment, and just even looking at some of the mix change for example from the outflows from hedge funds, is a mild headwind for example for the AIS fees. ", "And then, I look at the SVP 500 this morning. I think it was at 21.43 and that's off from where it's been, so again can I really view these as tweaks hopefully three months from now we'll look back and say it's it was conservative but that's the that's the base -- the basic thinking.", "Ken Usdin", "Okay, thanks Mike. And then similar question on the expense side cost came in pretty good again. Can you help us understand how much of that Beacon 1.65 was already in the third quarter run rate as opposed to yet lingering pieces yet to come, and the type of magnitude of third the fourth quarter step up that you're expecting under the surface again, I know you get a little help there on the FX side, so just helping us understand the moving parts there too, thanks. ", "Michael Bell ", "Sure. No absolutely. So you Ken, first of all on expenses the beacon savings we really have at this point captured the beacon savings that we expect for 2016-run rate. So as an example we expect net investments in fourth quarter of 2016 to exceed the additional savings that will get in in 4Q 2016, now as I talked about earlier we expect those investments to pay-off very well in 2017, 2018, 2019 particularly in 2018, 2019 so we think given our track record. We think that\u2019s very shareholder friendly to make those investments at that level.", "Round numbers can -- we\u2019re looking at approximately $10 million of additional investment spending for beacon 4Q versus 3Q. So it's not huge but it's enough to potentially move the needle, and the other piece that just continues to be an area of pressure, is the regulatory expense, particularly the RRP spending to be focused on for the July 1, 2017 submission continues to be material. But I think if we step back from the details in your questions, I would come back to the fact that I think we've done a very good job at managing expenses overall for the full year.", "Project Beacon obviously has been a big piece of that but also just clamping down, on all of the areas and we're real pleased to be in a position to say that we expect a full year expenses to be below that, of 2015 XGE.", "Ken Usdin", "And Mike, just one quick follow up on the last point there, just do you think that's an achievable goal to look forward to again on the operating basis X.G.E type of thing, to try to keep that cost outlook a slightest possible as you look forward.", "Michael Bell ", "Yes, Ken I think -- First I'd say it's a little bit early to be giving 2017 expectations, but I think it's fair to say to your underlying point that regardless of the environment; expense management is going to be a very, very high priority for us next year. And again as I said I'm in this difficult environment to be able to achieve positive fee operating leverage for the first nine months is a really good -- a really good accomplishment. And next year we've got the Beacon 1.25, we expect to get some additional benefit from replacing the outside consultants with FTE's, which is a positive economic parade's, we will get some extra benefit from that in 2017. We continue to focus on the margin target that we talked about back at the Investor Day of 31% for 2018, and we were really -- we continued to rivet on that. So I would say too early to give you specifics we'll give you more in three months but those are the areas that we're really focused on. ", "Ken Usdin", "Okay, thanks a lot Mike.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from one of Jim Mitchell from Buckingham Research.", "Jim Mitchell ", "Good morning. Maybe you could talk a little bit about in this stress test, you're finding the leverage ratio -- Troll [ph] had a speech where he talked about in the future stress test, maybe proposing keeping market based on assets flat. How could you help with that for you in the stress to be -- It's so easy for us in the outside to see the moving parts inter our quarter, so, is it fair to think that could be a material help in future C-course.", "Michael Bell ", "Jim, its Mike. First of all a couple things broadly and then come back to your specific question. The first your cruel speech and the in the P.R. that came out that day at this point it is simply a proposed rule, so I think until things get finalized. I wouldn't I overweight them too much, but what you're underline point is an important one. Yes, keeping the balance sheet flat as opposed to the previous Fed modeling which had the balance sheet growing, under the stress scenario is particularly helpful to us, because C-car leverage rather than the risk based ratios, has been our binding constraint historically. So again I don't expect that will be a lot of impact on the next C-car because it sounded like most of the impact would come into play beginning with 2018 C-car, but that's certainly a helpful item and some of the other potential changes, which impact the riskiest capital ratios, again would likely have less impact on us because the Tier 1 leverage has been a binding constraint. But I'd say it's early Jim, it's a positive but it's also it's an early days positive at this point. ", "Jim Mitchell ", "Okay, fair. Just on an outlook on NIL with a rate hike potentially in December; how should we think about that in fact over the following 12-months, any thoughts?", "Joseph Hooley", "Sure, Jim. Well first of all, a rate hike if I just isolate on that causal factor first, I would expect a rate hike to be helpful, to be accretive for us. I mean I would expect it will probably keep less of the benefit from the next Fed funds rate hike that we got from the last one, which almost all of it accrued to -- so I think will probably have some modest increase on the liability side for our clients, but I do expect net to be accretive. First of all, it obviously helps us with our foreign [ph] rate securities here in the U.S. It helps us with our loan book; which is mostly floating rate; it helps us with obviously the central bank deposits. And so all of that I would expect to be greater than the impact on the client deposit rates. ", "The other piece just to be balanced though, it would likely translate to a little bit higher wholesale CD costs and also our senior debt significant portion of that is floating rate. So it's not all gravy but it would definitely expected to be accretive. Just to be balanced though. That's -- your question was focused on the U.S. As I mentioned earlier we do continued to see the negative impact of the portfolio turnover in Europe, the combination of negative rates, and also depressed spreads because of QE over there. So we want to balance that out and in obviously as we talked beginning in January about 2017 outlook, will get some perspective on that. ", "Jim Mitchell", "Okay, great thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.", "Brian Bedell", "Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Jay, maybe if I can ask about middle office business, I mean do you see at this through stage of the game, where we're moving into a more competitive environment for active asset managers. Essentially more outsourcing of net Office asset managers, I guess you could you expect more big contracts coming from large asset managers and it's huge. and then it sounds like Bank of New York is also getting a little bit more aggressive obviously with the TRO-DO [ph] and also on even within their more standardized, if you could sort of differentiate yourself in that space and talk about whether you think just change and the growth outlook and in pricing dynamics in net office.", "Joseph Hooley", "Sure Brian, let me take that. The short answer is yes, as there is more pressure on returns which translates into more downward pressure on the asset management industry and there's been an acceleration I caught in the last couple of years towards outsourcing more. And some of the deals that we spoke about, being probably the most prominent one is anchored in not only back office but middle office. I would say we've -- we're probably seeing more demand for more comprehensive solutions than I can recall in the past several years, and I think it's a direct result of your comment. So I do see middle office, back office, comprehensive outsourcing deals, transfer agency and more and more coming at us in a bundled way, or even in the form of and I say that PIMCO and Allianz are separate transactions, both reflect consolidation of more work with a single provider.", "So I think all that's in play and all that should accrue to our benefit. If I isolate a middle office for a minute, you're familiar with the league tables. We have over 10 trillion in metal office assets that we support on our technology, and like most of the activities that we conduct in the servicing business scale matters. So it was over ten trillion and in scale, we have the ability to drive down unit cost, we have the ability with best disproportionally in our unit in our middle office platform. So I take you back to Beacon, which is as we automate create more straight through processing as we on the back of the middle office, have a data GX aggregation product. The scale should provide a significant advantage for us. I think product for product we compare very favorably from a middle office capability and standpoint, because of the breadth of services that we support.", "And I do think and I'm going to this is a pivot if you go from middle office to what the next frontier, it\u2019s who is going to win the data aggregation war. And we've got just short of 10 clients who are committed to us, to allow us to be the data aggregator not just for the information that we hold in our back and middle office, but for all their other custodian activities as well. And to me that ties directly into beacon but the long game here is if you can be the date aggregator you get the preferred look at data and analytics capabilities, we referenced a few in my prepared comments.", "A drift on your question, but I think it's a good one which is there is continued and there will be ongoing pressure in the asset management industry, all of which should position us to provide more services, knowing more services but more value added services as we were up to the data aggregation and Global Exchange level. ", "Brian Bedell", "Okay, that\u2019s actually good follow on. Maybe just one more mid Office and then on the data aggregation and that would be in mid office you mentioned using scale as a competitive advantage. Would you think that would translate into lower pricing for the industry -- you feel you can compete more on price rather than improve the margins in a business that you can question, and the you just mentioned on and on data aggregation and I guess I usually ask you to sort Investor Day about the revenue potential impact for that. So, I don't know if you can give better data if you provide any sort of big picture idea about whether you do think there will be some revenue traction in 2017, from the data aggregation initiative.", "Joseph Hooley", "Sure. So let me take the first one, first middle office pricing scale effect, margin question. I think that convinced that because of the scale we have, we have lower unit cost to perform in the middle office, we've done a good job of standardizing that. But we don't sell it that way. I mean what we sell is middle office deal is usually transplanting something that's done internally to an outsourced model, so we're selling the value not the price advantage, and I think that people that's that evaluate our middle office they view it against their own in-house capabilities, and they view us making the investment in technology; usually in more contemporary platforms to be a big advantage. So I say the scale of fact is to our advantage. We work hard not to lead with price but yet lead with value and preserve the margins and the point is obvious, but as the asset management industries under pressure, we're feeling that pressure too.", "So the ability to differentiate and show collectively how we can provide a more effective, a more efficient model when we combine our customers front office, our middle back etc. is really the way we look at that. With regard to data aggregation and global exchange; I think it's a slow building opportunity, The I'll just pause on data aggregation for a minute, the more you do it the very you get the greater advantage you have which is once we wired together not only our digital back and middle office but we start to wire other custodians back in middle office. There's a huge advantage to somebody bringing business to us, because we've already pre-wired those relationships and so we're making a pretty big investment and what we call data G.X. which is the aggregation layer of information not just for State Street, but for other institutions. ", "I think that you've seen some of the media stats and other data, and analytics products that sit on top of that. And I think that's when you really start to see some revenue momentum. So, I'd say it's a slow burn but a steady upward bias on the revenue side and as we get into 2017 we'll see if we can find a way to provide some dimension around that for you. ", "Brian Bedell", "That would be great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Blostein ", "Good morning. I want to follow-up on the asset management, just a couple questions. So, I guess just on GE business, clearly the margins are pretty low. I guess like in a low teen's right now. As you guys think about integrating this business, what are you guess the margins can -- I guess ultimately go to? That\u2019s part a, and I guess part B. I recall when you announced the deal there was a piece of business that hasn't closed as part of the transaction, maybe an update on kind of where that revenue stands and one of the probability of that revenue chunk kind of coming in over the next few quarters as well.", "Joseph Hooley", "Let me take that, Alex. As you point out that GE Asset Management margins at the beginning are not what we'd like to see and part of the synergy opportunities which is inherent in the deal, and which is late likely to unfold over the next two or three quarters, should get that margin at least up to where SSGA is but we have margin aspirations that far exceed what SSG is today and that's part of -- Part of that mix that leads to the 31% and 33% margin targets out in 2018 and 2020. So I think that at least the first couple of steps that are well-understood and we're well on our way and I have high confidence that what would achieve those synergy opportunities. With regard to the incremental GE business, other GE affiliates that we could bring into the mix, making great progress. Huge and helpful support by GE and I suspect that we will bring most of that incremental opportunity into this next; which is our office and CIO kind of business, which is just makes us bigger and more impactful in that segment.", "Alex Blostein ", "Yes, make sense. And then Mike, quick question for you on the balance sheet or really around the deposit pricing; you guys have been able to successfully flex from us on last couple quarters, stepping down a little bit, I guess again in 3Q, how much room I guess is there to continue to charge for deposits outside the U.S. because an thinking been helping you guys off on a cost.", "Michael Bell", "Sure Alex, we'll first appreciate as the kudos and you're absolutely right. I think we've done a very good job of that in 2016 and say a couple things, first this continues to be a work in process and as we look at 2017, as I mentioned earlier on the headwinds that we have overall for NIR is the portfolio turnover particularly in Europe with the negative rates and the very well credit spreads, that the grind is truly material for NIR for 2017. So one of the things that we're looking at is, what can we offset that by additional actions on the liability of pricing side, and I would say at this point we're simply looking at various options not the point at this point, ready to announce some additional actions but that is an area that we're keenly focused on.", "And then second, obviously if the ECB cuts further, we have to look harder ourselves at following at least any document that the E.C.B. would make, so early days of this, but this continues to be a huge area focus for us, Alex, both here in Boston as well as our R&M [ph] management team.", "Alex Blostein ", "All right, thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible].", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi can you talk about the CFO transition, you're 30% done with Beacon, 70% more to go and you have one CFO passing the baton to another CFO. In the midst of a major restructuring and digitization program, and also I wasn't clear, so Mike, will be leaving December, and then you have a new CFO. Coming in March or just can you explain how that handoff works.", "Joseph Hooley", "Sure, happy to do that. Mike, first let me talk about the baton handoff. Eric Aboaf joined mid-December, and so, he will observe the year-end close, Mike will be with us through year-end through the close of the 2016 books. And then Mike will transition out, Eric will be on board. I might take this opportunity just to talk just for a minute about Eric's background, I think you know some of it, but he, in his most recent six years with Citi, he was the treasurer of the before that, but like an equivalent period ran the financial planning and analysis part of Citi, and within that also oversaw the custody business. So importantly, he is -- he comes to us not just with the financial expertise but with very direct experience in the asset servicing business. With regard to your opening point Mike the beacon activity, well, Mike certainly reports on it and has some visibility to what it was largely centered in the operating environment.", "So Mike Rogers who's the President's Chief Operating Officer is really on point with most of the Beacon activity, some of that would affect the corporate support groups, but it's primarily in the-- asset servicing custody middle office back office, so I would see no blip in transition, and we only hope that Eric with his knowledge of this business might bring a fresh set of eyes and new insights to what more we can do. And I think to an earlier point, and you've seen it this year we started out with a plan for Beacon we accelerate that plan, and nobody here is expecting the sun to shin on the environment, so we are working hard to find new opportunities in order to accelerate beacon, expand beacon and I would hope that Eric would be nothing, but a fresh set of eyes to see what things you might have missed.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And just one follow up year-to-date pretax operating margin of 29% is flat year over year and it's below some of your peers, and I know your target is 33%, so in simple terms like if you're explaining it, your elevator pitch, why and how can a margin improvement 29% to 33%?", "Michael Bell", "Mike, it's simply through the probably the execution of a project Beacon, I mean we do expect the expense saves from Project Beacon to drop to the bottom line, and ultimately by the combination of the program in year 2020, to be at that 33%, I would also suggest to you that you have an even earlier milestone to what can\u2019t give that we're focused on the 31% margin in 2018, so they'll be a report card coming up on that Mike, quite a bit sooner.", "Joseph Hooley", "And let me not lose the opportunity to, I know with, in this -- with this audience in this discussion we tend to focus on the cost effective Beacon, but I can't overstate enough how impactful it is when our clients start to see the impact of better data, better information, they now have transparency into how we make the sausage with regard to the net asset value calculation. When your client start to see the positive impact of this effort, it just energizes everybody to go faster do more, and we've started to see that just in the last couple quarters.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck", "Hi, good morning, a couple questions on the balance sheet, just wanted to understand if you feel like there's any opportunity to be pulling down non-operating deposits from here, or have you done everything that you think you need to do on that side, just thinking about the balance sheet side and how you think it\u2019s going to reject over the next couple quarters.", "Michael Bell ", "Sure Betsy, its Mike. I think it\u2019s fair to say that particularly with money market reform and the turbulence there, that there is likely to be some upward pressure on non-operational deposit levels in in Q4. Now I feel good is we were back in 2015 we did a really good job at managing that mainly focused on client pricing and really just working with clients to figure out other alternatives for them, but that's an area where you know there's certainly the potential for upward pressure. Beyond that I really would go back to some of the earlier discussion around Europe. I think that's the area that we're also focused on in terms of tighter ability pricing, some of that may also push down excess deposits which would be just fine. But the liability pricing in Europe will also be a high priority for us over the next several months.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay, then we obviously had one rate hike, we're expecting another one in the not distant future, as these rates have gone up. Is there anything that you can point to suggest that maybe some of your non- operating deposits should be classified as operating, because you talk us through what the timeframe is and the fact pattern that you need to see in order to do that. I am asking a question with the background of trying to understand if theirs is an opportunity to a potential extent duration the securities book can pick up some that way over the coming quarters. ", "Joseph Hooley", "Sure. So Betsy, first it's early days but we do have work under way, and really it's an ongoing initiative not a onetime episodic event, to look at and carefully characterize our deposits, as operational or non-operational. I would expect that work will continue through 2017, and at this point I would expect that we'll probably get some benefit as a result of that. This points way too early; I wouldn't try to quantify the NRI benefit for you, or the overall level of deposits but I do think that's an area of the upside opportunity.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay, but new change to construction investments at this stage?", "Joseph Hooley", "Not at this point and certainly no change in philosophy, and if in fact we didn't see the some of the deposits that historically been characterized as non-operational, if we saw them being more sticky then that's something we would certainly look at it at that point time.", "Betsy Graseck", "All right, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.", "Gerard Cassidy ", "Thank you. Good morning. Jay, can he share with us the -- obviously the GE deal is close now on stage three historically over the years has done acquisitions. What are you seeing in terms of the outlook not asking if you're going to do a deal next quarter, but can you give us some color of what's going on in terms of potential further acquisitions that either in custody or Asset Management. ", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes, Gerard. I would say we just came through a cycle of three-year strategic planning with the board and acquisitions weren't a big part of that conversation, so I would say that [indiscernible] this is unlikely the little A is more likely. And when I think of places where we could perhaps use little help on, and it's probably more the product side. The two places I land would be an asset management, and not contrary to my earlier point, I think we've got a pretty comprehensive set of capabilities and asset management but if there was a team or there are a couple of narrow gaps in the asset classes, that could be in scope.", "And then the other big place that I would talk about potentially growth or expansion through acquisition would be in the business that we call Global Exchange, which I referenced earlier in the data aggregation and the more importantly on top of that, data analytics business or the data analytics opportunities which I think is significant. It is a real battleground for a number of different financial firms. It would be my expectation that we would; if you take data analytics and first and separate those two things the data is the one part, and I think in some respects is the harder part, which is aggregating and providing real time data insights to the front office, but on top of that is analytics; whether it's risk analytics, whether it's some of the things we do with Big Data. ", "I could see smallish acquisitions on the data analytics side, which would it take advantage of the data position we have to provide more robust analytics. So those would be the two places that potentially we would be advantaged by smallish acquisitions versus organic development. I don't see in a pure cussedness basis to state the obvious. ", "Gerard Cassidy", "Okay, if the pure custody and episodic event happened where is some of these large portfolio came up with no interest or you would have to always consider something like that. ", "Joseph Hooley", "I think that two things I would say; one I think that the regulatory hurdle would be high for the big asset servicing firms, to be further concentrated in the in the custody business. And then I would also say that traditionally whether it was the Deutsche Bank acquisition or IBT or even in Sao Paolo [ph], it filled the gap to reach a Bank in Europe and Tesa [ph] in Italy; and I don't see real gaps, if I look at our geographic coverage. we'd love to be doing more in China or India we\u2019re all over it acquisitions not likely the way to get there. Other than that we're pretty well developed and most of the markets that would be attractive asset servicing markets, and if you look at them -- looked at through a product lines, Gerard, I think if you look at a fall away from beta where we have over 60% share on the ETF servicing to the traditional asset classes to the alternatives. ", "Again we're pretty well positioned. Now we think there's a meaningful opportunity in the real estate asset class, which is going to brimming with assets to do more outsourcing there, but so, I just don't see -- I don't see big gaps and I think it would be a high hurdle for a regulatory standpoint.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Great. And then shifting to the balance sheet; Mike, I know the securities portfolio to watch your senior secured bank loans as you show on page 12, the $3.5 billion portfolio that you have, can you give us a flavor for where you see that going over the next 12-months, relative to this balance sheet, is a going to grow or stay that size. And second, what do you guys assuming for through the cycle loss rate from that portfolio. ", "Michael Bell ", "So Gerard, first in terms of the overall loss size; again no change in an overall law philosophy, so I would expect that our leverage loan block would continue to be a relatively small portion of the overall balance sheet, perhaps modest growth from where it is today. We have a yield on that block currently of approximately 3.7%. So it's an attractive book, and at this point we've had and would of very good credit experience there. I feel like we're doing a good job of under-running and managing the credits there. But I really wouldn't put it just point Gerard, a long term expectation out there again, I would expect to beat the overall portfolio averages, given our credit underwriting and our bias towards being at the higher end of the scale, so at this point I wouldn't try to put a long term estimate on it, but it's something that will continue to manage and we're very sensitive to the changes in the credit cycle. ", "Gerard Cassidy", "Thank you, appreciate the answer.", "Operator", "Your next question comes Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan.", "Vivek Juneja ", "Hi, I have a couple of question, especially on servicing, I'm going to go back to the first question if I look on page 12 of your supplement. And I look at year-to-date '16 versus year-to-date '15; servicing fees are down 1.1%, sometime to reconcile that with the earlier comment and even if I adjust that for the FX fee revenue, let's assume we give all of that tip to servicing, it's basically flattish year-to-date '16 versus year-to-date '15 and I'm comparing that with your AUCA 3Q '16 versus 3Q '15; it's up 7% and in fact if I do similar rough FX adjustment, probably up 8%. So can you help explain; A) but year-to-date you're down 1.1% in your operating servicing fee revenues; why that application, why such a big gap versus your AUCA?", "Michael Bell ", "Sure Vivek, its Mike. First of all, a couple things are very important here. Number one, as we talked about earlier, we've seen a challenging change in the business mix here in 2016, relative to 2015. It was talked about this on prior calls. We've seen for example more pressure on emerging markets than what we've seen here in the in the U.S. And so basically the impact of seeing rotation from emerging markets for example, to the developed markets particularly the U.S. is a real negative impact on the ratios that you're looking at there. ", "Second, as we talked about earlier we've seen some outflows in terms of hedge funds in particular, not all hedge funds but certainly that's been a negative in terms of our overall AIS revenue, and as we talked about previously our AIS revenue also tends to be a higher unit revenue per asset service, than the other books of businesses. And then on top of that, if you do adjust for the currency and markets, that really is the story; all the more reason that I would strongly suggest you look at the overall margins on the business as opposed to looking at the ratios relative to assets because that the -- all the factors that I just mentioned play havoc with those ratios, particularly if you're looking at it in a short-term period.", "Vivek Juneja ", "Okay, got it. So it's a higher fee businesses that are really facing more. It's a mix shift there.", "Michael Bell ", "And importantly, you know, obviously we don't have a crystal ball in the future but as Jay talked about earlier we do expect over the long haul to get some help from things like additional outsourcing opportunities for private equity funds, as well as real estate funds; that would actually help the mix over the over the long-term. In addition, I think it's fair to say that -- over the long-term we think emerging markets is in fact a very good place to be in and ultimately we would expect that the -- we'll see some rotation back there and we'll see some help on the currency side there relative to what has been a challenging environment; certainly caught over the last year.", "Vivek Juneja ", "Okay, got it. ETF fees could either -- if you will talk a little bit about what you're seeing on EPS pricing as when more talk about so much your competitor is cutting pricing on those?", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes Vivek, let me take that. This is Jay. There has been and I think that we were part of that the next several quarters ago when adjusted some of the fees and some of our -- I call it commoditized type ETFs. We continue to focus our efforts on introducing ETFs that are more differentiated and therefore have a better revenue characteristics to them. So we don't foresee although we always look at whether or not it makes sense for us to adjust fees in order to gain volume but again this is isn't the more commoditized market. I think they will continue to be put pressure in those commoditized one. Mike, I don't know if we have a ETF yield for the third quarter; the $12 billion ETF?", "Michael Bell", "I don't have that off my head Jay, we can certainly with IR follow-up on that.", "Joseph Hooley", "We can get you that, Mike gave you a sense of -- close to 10 basis points would be the yield on the ETF flows in the third quarter, just to give you some sense.", "Vivek Juneja ", "Great, and that thanks early, is the key driven last quarter or two after you sort of cleaned up the pricing couple of quarter go?", "Michael Bell", "Yes, I think those -- I think it is fairly sticky other than keep in mind spy which is the big S&P500, it can be -- can act like a trading security, particularly around quarter end. So if I isolate that I would agree with your comment, it's been pretty steady.", "Vivek Juneja ", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "Just a quick question on the GE deal and potential expenses that you're looking for in the first half of '17? Can you just maybe outline not the number -- I know you won't give that but where you expect to see expenses coming from? I know you mentioned before that there were enough services client already but so I would imagine expenses there is just personnel or where else to be coming from?", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes, let me start that Brian, and then Mike can jump in. You know I think that if you look at the GE asset management deal, whenever you combine two asset management deals you should expect a fair amount of synergy in the course and the core -- corporate support kind of activities and so that's one big bucket of opportunity. But another would be that while GE brought some capabilities that were not robust at SSGA, namely the alternatives; there were some alternatives at SSGA and maybe more importantly, they also brought a pretty significant fundamental equity and fixed income set of capabilities. And shortly after the announcement we announced a reorganization which brought those groups together; so there is a fair amount of synergy just tied up and when you take your fundamental equity business at SSGA combine it with GE and get synergies off that.", "So I would say from the corporate support areas, and also in the different asset classes where -- in many cases SSGA had some capabilities, just not as robust as the GE asset management. Would you add anything to that Mike?", "Michael Bell", "Yes, the only thing I would add Jay; and Brian, to your question is -- while we haven't given you specific synergy numbers. I would remind you that we funded the GE acquisition through the prep issuance and as a result of expecting that the overall transaction will be -- we expect to be accretive in the first full 12-months beginning of July 1, 2016. You can basically conclude that the earnings contribution we expect from the organization including the synergies that Jay just mentioned would be more than sufficient to pay for the cost of the prep. So that at least gives you a way to size what we're expecting from the expense synergies and the additional revenue that Jay mentioned earlier.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "Okay, great. And then just one quick one; I know you mentioned the ops servicing space a couple different times here; here is a source of fee pressure, but are you seeing greater pressure than what the overall industry is with regards to the redemption in the overall performance? I mean it's basically down X percent, are you seeing something a multitude above that?", "Joseph Hooley", "No, I would say now and probably even a little less, were anchored in some of the bigger, more institutional names; and I say they have weathered the storm a little bit better than the rest of the industries. And we also -- it's a point of view but I think if you look at performance, performance recently has improved and so I suspect this is not a secular but rather a cyclical trend where assets flow in and out.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "Okay, great, thanks.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Hello, thank you for taking the question. On the GE asset management acquisitions, what you talk about that before it sounded like you were expecting a ramp up in expenses and synergies to get started in 4Q and now it sounds like 4Q, the contribution is going to be similar to the third quarter and then the ramp up happens more next year. So I just wondered if there has been any changes the way you're thinking around that timing there?", "Michael Bell", "Geoff, its Mike. No particular change, we do expect to see some incremental benefit in Q4 from the organizational changes that Jay mentioned a minute ago. The main point here is just to emphasize that we expect the bulk of the expense and revenue synergies to really kick in Q1 of '17.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Great, thank you.", "Joseph Hooley", "Thank you, Amy; and thank you everyone for joining us on the call. We look forward to speaking with you in January when we discuss the fourth quarter results. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's conference.

Ostler - State Street Corp.", "Thanks, Hope. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our Chairman and CEO, Jay Hooley, will speak first. Then, Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our first quarter 2017 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. During the Q&A, please limit your questions to two questions and then re-queue.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include operating-basis and other measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measures are available in the appendix to our 1Q 2017 slide presentation.", "In addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors, such as those factors referenced in our discussion today, in our 1Q 2017 slide presentation under the heading Forward-Looking Statements, and in our SEC filings including the Risk Factors section of our 2016 Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change.", "Now, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "Thanks, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter 2017 results reflect our business momentum across asset servicing and asset management. Strong fee revenue growth coupled with expense control and good progress against our strategic priorities drove significant positive fee operating leverage.", "On an operating-basis, we increased return on equity by 200 basis points and our earnings per share by 23% from the first quarter last year. Our new business traction is solid, as we continue to invest in our technology and systems, benefiting customers and investors, and our pipeline remained strong.", "We continue to see strong trends for asset managers to consolidate providers as a way to create efficiencies and improve information needs. Recent mandates would support this trend. We believe State Street has the unique advantage of being able to service complex and global assets on an integrated service platform. This coupled with our investment in technology and digitizing our processes enables us to extract meaningful data and insights for our clients that they would be hard-pressed to obtain anywhere else.", "We see two other secular growth trends that play to our strengths. The shift towards passive investing is increasing business given our 55% plus share of ETF servicing, and the expansion of international asset managers with multijurisdictional offshore funds is buoying our international growth given our global capabilities.", "These advantages are illustrated by our 11% increase in assets under custody and administration versus the first quarter of 2016, reflecting strengthening markets, improved client flows and the contribution of our new business wins over the past year. As Eric will lay out for you in more detail, based on the strong start to 2017, our outlook has improved modestly from our January 2017 outlook and remains within our previously disclosed ranges.", "Turning to slide number four, I'll now review our progress on our strategic priorities and some key achievements this year. We continue to drive growth from our core franchise, with new asset servicing wins of approximately $110 billion for the quarter, reflecting mandates from clients around the world. In our total new business yet to be installed at quarter-end was approximately $375 billion, which is above typical levels over the past two years. We also saw continued momentum in SSGA's ETFs, driven by flows and improving equity markets.", "State Street Beacon continues to progress with further investments and adoption of our technologies. We're also engaging with our clients to co-create and prototype solutions to meet their needs. Examples include some of our key clients' global adoption of accounting technologies, enabling a 20 to 30-minute improvement in the end-of-day delivery of net asset valuations to clients' distributors. We also continue to make investments in innovative solutions to address client needs across regulatory requirements, risk and analytics. Some examples include our solutions to meet the SEC Modernization reporting and liquidity risk management rules.", "Our DataGX solution that provides tools and analytics on client and third-party data continues to gain traction from asset owners globally to support their evolving needs. We launched the distribution of the GX Private Equity Index to approximately 300 global asset management clients to enable them to improve benchmark analysis of private equity performance. We're developing and launching new analytical tools to enable clients to better manage environmental, social and governance exposures, as these investment strategies continue to gain traction and importance. And lastly, as we showed at an investor conference in February, we have launched a pilot mobile app for chief risk officers to manage their exposures real-time.", "Now let me talk about SSGA. SSGA finished the quarter with $2.56 trillion in assets under management, a 4% increase from fourth quarter 2016 and a 12% increase from 1Q 2016. The majority of the growth from 1Q 2016 was driven by market appreciation, with an additional 5% of growth in the acquired GE Asset Management business, which is performing very well.", "SSGA achieved strong revenue gains during the quarter, driven in part by the momentum of our ETF strategies, which are benefiting from investments in distribution and product development, such as the SSGA SHE ETF launched last year to help increase visibility of the importance of gender diversity across corporate boards and management. And we're delighted by the overwhelming response to Fearless Girl, which demonstrates the power of fulfilling this objective.", "We continue to make good progress in the integration of the acquired GE Asset Management business. Notably, for the first nine months, we've achieved accretive operating-basis earnings.", "In closing, we remain committed to expense control, as reflected by our 1Q 2017 positive fee operating leverage of approximately 570 basis points and total operating leverage of approximately 220 basis points from 1Q 2016. And in 1Q 2017, through share repurchase and common share dividends, we returned approximately $665 million of capital to common shareholders, which was $150 million ahead of schedule.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Eric Aboaf, who moved into the CFO role at the end of February. Eric will review our financial performance for the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2017, after which we'll take your questions. Eric?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide 5 where I'll start my review of our first quarter 2017 operating-basis results, which supplement our GAAP results. As you can see, we have made a conscious effort this quarter to narrow the differences.", "Operating-basis EPS for 1Q 2017 increased to $1.21 per share, up 23% from 1Q 2016, reflecting higher equity markets, new business wins, continued expense discipline, and fewer shares outstanding. 1Q 2017 results reflect strong fee revenue growth over 1Q 2016 in both asset servicing and asset management.", "At the same time, we carefully managed the expenses with the help of State Street Beacon, delivering over a 5.5 percentage points of positive fee operating leverage over 1Q 2016. This includes 2.3 percentage points from the sale of BFDS/IFDS and the GE Asset Management acquisition.", "Slide 5 also highlights a few notable items that impacted both GAAP and operating-basis results this quarter. First, we recorded an after-tax gain related to the sale of BFDS/IFDS of $31 million, or $0.08 per share, as we continue to focus increasingly on our core business.", "Second, we took the opportunity to tactically reposition a portion of the investment portfolio for the current rate environment, which will improve NII going forward. That cost $32 million after-tax, or $0.08 per share.", "Third, our first quarter results in both 2016 and 2017 included the seasonal effect of deferred incentive compensation for retirement-eligible employees. All-in-all, pre-tax margin was up 1.7 percentage points and ROE was up 2 percentage points to 10.4% as compared to 1Q 2016.", "Now let me turn to slide 6 to briefly review growth of two key drivers of our businesses. AUCA increased 11% from 1Q 2016, driven by market appreciation, higher inflows in the U.S. from asset managers and ETFs, partially offset by the continued rotation out of hedge funds. Notably, we also experienced strong growth in Europe relating to both onshore and offshore markets. As compared to 4Q 2016, AUCA also saw a good step-up, which positions us well for the rest of the year.", "Turning to State Street Global Advisors, AUM increased 12% from 1Q 2016, driven by market appreciation and the impact of the acquired GE Asset Management operations, partially offset by some net outflows. We did see strong ETF inflows again, but we continued to expand our products array.", "Please turn to slide 7 where I'll review 1Q 2017 revenue compared to 1Q 2016. You'll also find detail in the appendix with a comparison to 4Q 2016. Servicing fees increased 4%, primarily due to higher equity markets and strong growth in net new business across the globe and across multiple client segments, partially offset by continued hedge fund outflows.", "As compared to 4Q 2016, we saw this momentum continuing. Management fees increased 41%, driven by the contribution of the acquired GE Asset Management business, higher equity markets and higher yielding ETF inflows. As compared to 4Q 2016, performance was strong as well.", "Trading services increased slightly relative to 1Q 2016 as a result of higher volumes in foreign exchange trading. Securities finance revenue decreased slightly from 1Q 2016, reflecting lower short-interest in equity markets during the quarter. Processing fees and other revenue increased primarily due to the BFDS sale and the absence of some FX swap costs. Please note that these FX swap costs are now in net interest income this quarter as they qualified for hedge accounting.", "Moving to slide 8, NIM was up 5 basis points from 1Q 2016. NII increased primarily reflecting higher market interest rates in the U.S. and disciplined liability pricing, partially offset by lower interest-earning asset and lower non-dollar investment portfolio yields. As compared to 4Q 2016, NIM was up 9 basis points, also due to higher rates and disciplined liability pricing, even after considering the additional FX swap costs now in interest expense.", "Now I'll turn to slide 9 to review expenses. 1Q 2017 expenses increased 6% in total from 1Q 2016, but half, or 3% of that, came from $51 million of GE Asset Management expenses. Compensation employee benefits is impacted in the first quarter of each year by seasonal deferred incentive compensation for retirement-eligible employees.", "Compared to 1Q 2016, the seasonal impact increased by $32 million, driven by a higher number of employees who fell within the retirement age window. Aside from this increase, we saw expected headwinds like annual merit increases, new business, onboarding costs, and technology investments, which were offset by savings from State Street Beacon. As compared to 4Q 2016, expenses were up only slightly, excluding this 1Q 2017 seasonal deferred incentive compensation expense and the 4Q 2016 acceleration of deferred cash awards.", "Let me now move to slide 10 to review our progress on State Street Beacon. Beacon remains on track to achieve $550 million in targeted program savings, including at least $140 million in 2017. But Beacon is also designed to enhance client solutions, reduce operational risk, and engage our teams throughout the enterprise.", "As Jay mentioned, we are striving towards a highly digitized environment, which has already been delivering tangible client benefits. Notably, Beacon is now driving innovation, such as our recently launched SEC Modernization products, which we expect can contribute to our top line revenue growth in the future.", "We're also mitigating risk and gaining efficiencies by automating controls and improving monitoring technology. And lastly, our Beacon program is now addressing opportunities across our enterprise. Our SSGA Beacon effort is focused on client experience, front-office optimization, and operational effectiveness, and we are tackling our corporate function costs as well.", "Now let's turn to slide 11 to review our balance sheet and capital position. We continue to maintain a high-quality balance sheet, including an investment portfolio with a well-constructed and diversified mix of securities. As I mentioned earlier, during 1Q 2017, we had the opportunities to make some tactical adjustments given market trends.", "On the capital front, our position remains strong, and it remains a key priority to return capital through share repurchases and dividends. We retired $523 million of common stock this quarter, which includes our quarterly plan plus consideration received as part of the BFDS/IFDS sale. We have $227 million remaining under our June 2016 common stock purchase program. As expected, our supplementary leverage ratio increased as we tighten the size of our balance sheet.", "Moving to slide 12, I'll update you on where we stand regarding our financial outlook. With a strong start to 2017 in hand, we remain focused on achieving our 2017 outlook, which has improved modestly from our January projection. Our priorities continue to be: driving top line growth in our core franchise by delivering solutions to our clients, prudently managing expenses as we execute on State Street Beacon, and returning capital to shareholders.", "There are three areas that I would like to highlight in the outlook. First, we now expect our 2017 operating-basis fee revenue to be at the middle to higher end of the 4% to 6% growth range, assuming the favorable market conditions continue to prevail.", "Second, our NII outlook now assumes a rising rate scenario, which anticipates that the Fed increases again in September. We now expect full year 2017 operating-basis NII to be at the upper end of our original $2.27 billion to $2.3 billion range. That said, we are carefully watching long rates.", "And third, we now expect our operating-basis tax rate to be at the lower end of the 30% to 32% target we communicated in January.", "Let me briefly touch on the second quarter of 2017 before turning the call back to Jay. We expect momentum in servicing fees to continue in 2Q 2017, driven by client flows and net new business. We expect trading services activity to continue to be muted, while expecting a seasonal uptick in securities finance. Neither the BFDS gain in fees nor the securities repositioning are expected to repeat. NIM should be up in the mid single-digits with the balance sheet down slightly, resulting in an increase in NII of several percent.", "In summary, we believe we are well-positioned to achieve our full year 2017 financial objectives.", "Now, let me turn the call back to Jay.", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "Thanks, Eric. Our long-term growth is being fueled by State Street Beacon and the way ahead. And after 225 years, we can step back and see what has made us successful. It's been our people, technology, insights, and experience combining to create enhanced asset intelligence for our clients. Our future success will be driven by these strengths and our ability to further differentiate ourselves by transforming the way data is utilized to provide additional capabilities to our global client base.", "Now, Hope, I'd like to open the call to investor questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to see if you could help us understand some of that push and pull between NII and the processing other. Eric, you didn't mention it in your forward commentary, so can you just walk us through, does that elevated processing and other result, ex the $30 million gain, now stay and then we see the direction change in NII? Or maybe you could just help us through understand that dynamic and what happens from here? Thanks.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Sure, Ken, it's Eric. Let me just take you through it so that you've got a good visibility. I think what you've seen us do this quarter as we designated the bulk of the FX swap activity that we've been doing for a number of quarters and years as economic hedges against the deposits. And as a result, those FX swap costs now sit in NII as opposed to in processing fees. I think that's a kind of \u2013 it's a natural way to report our NII and NIM. And our expectation is we'll continue to do that going forward and reflect them along those lines.", "I think if you're just looking for the numbers, I'm happy to share those with you. On a year-over-year basis, the swing was about 3 bps. On a quarter-over-quarter, it was about 5 bps. And now I think we've got a good path going forward.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "And just to confirm then, how do we think about that processing and other line, given \u2013 I think you mentioned lower energy credits and that's got some seasonality in it. So if we start at $152 million (20:30), is that now where we go from here?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "I think the \u2013 you really have to do two things on the processing and other line, which always have some volatility in it, right? One is you've got to take out the BFDS/IFDS gain, right? And then secondly, you've got to remove the 5 basis points worth of swap costs. That was about $25 million on the science (21:01) of our balance sheet and use that as the new baseline. I will remind you, there's always some volatility in that line, plus/minus some. So just keep an eye on that and look back over the past, I think it will give you a bit of an indication.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And if I could just ask one more just on the BlackRock you had \u2013 Jay had mentioned last quarter that he'd expected it to start to roll out in the second half. Can you just update us on timing of that? Is that still incorporated in your guidance and if it's changed at all? Thanks.", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "Sure, Ken. This is Jay. Happy to do that. The BlackRock transition will occur beginning in 2018, not 2017, and is likely to take several quarters to be completed.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.", "Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI", "Hi. How are you?", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "Good morning.", "Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI", "Question on deposit beta. I mean, it looks a little higher than what we've seen at some of the other companies. I'm just curious, is that just a function of client franchise and how you want to roll, or is there anything contractual that goes towards how the higher rates flow through on the liability side?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Glenn, it's Eric. Let me take that. The client beta is you have to actually \u2013 you have to look carefully at the average interest-earning schedule to decipher. This quarter, they were in the 20% to 25% range, which is I think what we've seen towards the start of a rate cycle in the past what we saw a year ago. The way to extract them from that average earning schedule is to take a look at the U.S. deposit costs, U.S. interest-bearing costs. You saw those nudge up about 6 basis points quarter-over-quarter, right, relative to a 25 basis point hike by the Fed.", "If you also look down at the total interest-bearing or the non-U.S. interest-bearing deposit costs, just remember, the swap costs affect that line, and so there'll be some noise there that you just have to account for.", "Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI", "I got that. Okay. And, I guess, this is an ongoing question. The revenue growth targets are obviously still in the 8% to 12% range. I think they were maybe 5% ex-GE, but the fees were better. It's more like 8%. But any way slice it, I think fees grow a little less than assets. Do you think of that as just like that's the world we live in, there's some fee compression, there's some mix shift, and we make it up on volume and give the operating leverage, they'll be happy.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "I think there is a fair number of themes you just covered in a short sentence, but I think you've got the gist of it. I think what you'll find is, as asset values increase, right \u2013 they were up, asset values year-over-year against our mix of equity and fixed income and all were up about 10%, for example \u2013 you'll naturally see just because of the denominator effect, the fee rate flowed down. So I think that's just part of the dynamic of the math, and then that's further impacted by mix.", "I think you are right, though. If you think about the buildup of revenue growth in an asset servicing business, it starts from how much asset appreciation do you expect year-over-year, right, and we've got the last 10, 20, 30 years to look at. You think about flows, right. Are you servicing asset managers who are bringing inflows as opposed to seeing net outflows. So that matters.", "You then add net new business, right. Are you gaining a point of market share or 2 points, like what the \u2013 how effective are you doing that. And, obviously, one of the reasons for that Beacon investment and the technology and the sophistication in the global offering we add is to push that in the right direction.", "There is always a little bit of pricing headwind. I think there is a little bit of pricing headwind in this business and every business that one operates in, but that's got to be made up. And then there is foreign exchange swings up and down. So those are kind of the \u2013 that's the algebra that I think we think about and, obviously, a number of those we can control. And that's how we're focused.", "Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI", "Awesome. Thanks, Eric. Appreciate it.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.", "Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to follow up on the question on deposit beta. So I appreciate what we've seen here so far. How are you feeling, though, on a go-forward basis? What's your sense for the gamma on the beta, so to speak? In other words, how should we think about trajectory of beta from here?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "I still remember that you asked about the gamma on beta. I think that's the second derivative, if I remember properly from my calculus days. I think it's a fair question. Betas have been relatively low by past historical standards. We saw 20% to 25% this quarter. We saw about that a year ago, though, it's hard to always calibrate the very first uptick.", "We expect this level again in second quarter, right, at least within that range, given what we see so far. I think what happens after that is the broader question \u2013 what happens if there is a hike in September, what happens with hikes next year \u2013 because we all know that betas for past cycles are in the 50%, 60% range. And the question is \u2013 will those repeat themselves and, if so, when.", "Obviously, the environment has changed, right? The money market fund and offering is weaker than it's been before, so that could be a positive for banks when you think about betas. On the other hand, there are always pressures the other way. So we'll see. But so far, we've seen I think healthy betas and kind of a good balance, and we expect that to play out for the next hike or two.", "Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC", "And sorry about the gamma there. I'm certainly \u2013 I talk too much to derivative traders, I guess. So, to paraphrase, you don't think there is going to be a significant change in the beta, albeit maybe a natural ramp, is that fair?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Yeah, that's fair. Given what we know today, I think that's our current expectation.", "Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC", "Terrific, terrific. Thank you very much. And then just curious if you could give some color on the outflows with the institutional business? What is it that you think is driving that? And maybe what adjustments you guys are looking to make to slow that trend? And your thoughts on the ETF flows versus maybe some of the large competitors that showed really pretty remarkable flow trends on the back of some price reductions?", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "Yeah, let me start that one, Brennan, and I'll invite Eric to jump in. A two-parter (28:51) question on the institutional outflows this quarter, it kind of continues the trend of mostly passive, largely equity, a little bit of sovereign wealth, but just general repositioning as well as a little bit of currency overlay also affected that institutional outflow. So that's a story that is an ongoing story.", "I think probably the better part of the story is the ETF flows, which were $12 billion net in the first quarter and were largely made up of sector funds SPY, which is the S&P 500, and we had good growth from EMEA. And I'd just remind you, a quarter is a quarter. But if you look over the past three quarters, our net flows were $12 billion in the first quarter, $36 billion in the fourth quarter, and $12 billion in the third quarter. So I think trends are important here, and we feel pretty good about the investments that we've made in the ETF franchise, both in product and distribution. And I would suggest that those investments are paying off, and we're seeing that. So we feel pretty good about the ETF positioning.", "Do you want to add anything?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Yeah, Brennan, I'd just add that from a financial standpoint, the outflows here were in very thin margin passive strategies. I think our overall fee rate in SSGA is about 6 basis points or so. These were a good bit below those. So there's always a bit of question when you have competitive bidding and so forth, as you want to keep low fee, low margin business. And you can imagine we also need to be a little bit disciplined there.", "I think the important news is that the inflows that came in with that ETF franchise are above those rates. And so in a way, we had a revenue uptick. And if you want to step back, asset under management \u2013 assets under management in the business were up 4% sequentially, revenue was up 6%. Why? Because we're actually trading up as part of our business expansion here.", "Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC", "Perfect. Thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey, Jay, good morning. Eric, good morning. A question for you guys \u2013 well, Eric, really for you on the balance sheet strategy. So the leverage ratio is in a pretty good place now. The size of the balance sheet came down quite meaningfully sequentially, and I think it kind of jives with your earlier comments that you kind of expect 5-ish percent I think decline for the full year.", "So I guess, A, should we take that as the balance sheet should be stable from now on? And, B, as you think about any other repositioning or securities remix (31:47) that you guys are thinking about on the balance sheet side just between the securities portfolio?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Sure. Let me start with the balance sheet side. I think you did see us bring it down consciously. The background there is, as you know, as a company, we began to tackle the size of the balance sheet almost two years ago now. I think we've done quite good work there.", "Second half last year, with some of the large inflows that we had disclosed (32:18) on the asset servicing side, those came with deposits, right, and so deposits started to float up. It took the size of our balance sheet up. And what you saw us do is effectively make sure that we digested those, some of those we cap. And then under the surface, you saw us do some optimization, right? We rolled down some of our treasury CD portfolio, that's down over two quarters by about $5 billion, $6 billion. So we're taking out some of the higher cost deposits as we manage and keep the balance sheet tight.", "Going forward, I think you're right. I think it's going to be flattish, maybe down a little bit, maybe flat. You never really know with our client inflows and outflows, so I want to be careful there. But I think we're comfortable with the step reduction that we took. And going forward, it will be a little more on the business-as-usual side.", "On the securities portfolio, that's exactly right. I think we saw an opportunity. We moved just a few billion out of our $100 billion of securities, and we feel pretty confident where we are, so we don't expect further adjustments in the near future.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. And then the second question. Jay, I think this one's for you. Just on the $375 billion of new business that's yet to be installed, any (33:45) fees associated with that? Or at least kind of, how does the fee rate on that book of business yet to be installed compares to your sort of overall blended fee rate on the installed business?", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "Yes, let me pick that one up, Alex. What I can tell you is that it is a little bit elevated, and it's elevated because the deals that we've been booking the last couple of quarters tend to be meatier, more complex deals, which you can infer from that higher-ish fee rates because it's back office, middle office. And, therefore, the chunkiness causes extended implementation lifecycle. So, I guess that's what I'd say about that.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. All right. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.", "Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thanks. Morning, folks. Eric, can you just talk about the assumptions that you have for the 4% to 6% fee growth in terms of market returns from, let's say, the end of the first quarter? And also FX volatility, I think that was still getting pressured here in April.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Yeah. I think the assumptions are in line with what we disclosed back in January. We're expecting several percentage point increase in underlying equity markets, I think, in line with general economic forecast. FX was kind of at the level of where we were in January. The only large swing we've seen so far is the British pound. So just \u2013 but that's a piece, not a large piece, but obviously a piece of our European revenues. So not a large swing there. So I'd sort of summarize as basic economic assumptions that you or we or others would have out there.", "Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay, great. And then, just to focus back on the balance sheet. You did mention you're keeping your eye on yield curve flattening. Can you give us a sense of some sensitivity to your 2017 net interest revenue outlook on that?", "And then also, if you can talk about the repurchase strategy that I think helped. It looks like to me the repo line was up about $12 million sequentially. I'm not sure if it was all due to that, how recurring do you think that could be? And then, any premium amortization decline in the quarter as well?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "All right. Let me just try to take through those \u2013 all fair questions. The back-end sensitivity, I think the best way to frame it is, we have that interest rate NII disclosure for 100 basis points up/down in our K. We also have the ramp, but the shock is probably the easiest one to talk through.", "If you remember, about 60% of our interest rate sensitivity is in the dollar book, the balance is in Europe. And then, of the dollar book sensitivity impact, the overall \u2013 about 80% of our sensitivity is at the front-end, about 20% at the back-end of the curve.", "So, I think it's the front-end rate hikes from the Fed that matter the most. But I think what you will see is, had rates stayed up in the 2.50%, 2.60%, 2.70% (37:15) range in the U.S. and U.S. markets, then that would have created a tailwind of NII for most bank portfolios, just given where they have been purchased at in the last few years.", "I think without that, you won't have a natural tailwind and so you can't count on that. And so, it's not a huge mover, but it's the kind of thing that we want to keep an eye on as we estimate and give outlooks on NII.", "Repurchase strategy \u2013 oh, the repo. The repo line is just the earnings on the repo book. Some of that \u2013 it's a pretty typical repo book. Some of that includes some repos that are designated under FIN 41 with netting, all that is, I think, well laid out in terms of balances and size in our K in the footnotes. I think it's footnotes 10, 11 or 12. You can find them. But that's recurring earnings, because it's effectively a matchbook of repos and reverses, and so that line will now, as rates have flowed up, will tend to recur.", "Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "And then premium amortization?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Premium amortization is not significant at this point in our book. I think it was down just slightly, but not enough to call out as a movement of NII or NIM this quarter.", "Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.", "James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Hey, good morning. First question, just there's been a lot of chatter on amending the SLR, perhaps removing some of the denominator, central bank cash or other things like that. How much \u2013 I mean, obviously, that would free you up to expand your balance sheet in deposits. Is there a lot of do you think pent-up, I guess, volume out there that you could put on? Because I would think the incremental profitability with no SLR impact could be pretty significant. Just trying to get a sense of what that deposit opportunity could be if they were to alter the SLR.", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "Jim, let me start and then I'll let Eric quickly jump in. I think that I agree with your point, which is there is a lot of discussion \u2013 even public discussion. I thought it was notable that when Governor Tarullo gave his ending speech a few weeks ago that he spiked out (39:53) custody bank excess deposit/SLR issue as something that was probably an unintended consequence. So I probably never felt better about the uniform view that excess deposits (40:11) leverage ratio was unintended and probably should be corrected over time. Not sure when it will be corrected in what form, whether they exclude the excess deposits or whether they ladder (40:24) adjust the leverage ratio. But I think the outlook is pretty good from the standpoint of getting some relief to be determined when and in what form.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Yeah. And let me \u2013 it's Eric. Let me just add to the tactical question. For the leverage ratio to be adjusted, there're obviously a number of different scenarios in which that could happen. I mean, we don't know. If it does get relaxed, certainly there is an opportunity to accept more deposits. I think there's certainly a lot of liquidity floating around the system, both here in the U.S. and in Europe. Obviously, the question is at what rate, and so we'd want to be judicious about that.", "There's also an ability to lighten our preferred level in the capital stack. We have call options on most of those tranches and so could adjust there. I think what I would point out, though, is certainly there's a question as to whether the rules get \u2013 to get adjusted but also how. Because, remember, the leverage ratio, it affects us as a bank on an SLR basis, right, under the SLR rules, but also the spot current leverage ratio impacts us in terms of CCAR and the CCAR ask. So there're kind of two different parts to the leverage ratio that matter.", "And then I'll also remind you just to be careful that if leverage is not a binding constraint for a bank, then at some point, RWA and CET1 is. And so there's a lot of moving parts here that we'd have the consider if there are some changes.", "James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Right. Absolutely. That's why I think deposit growth would probably be the better outcome versus CET1 running up against CET1. And maybe, Jay, a question on middle-office outsourcing outlook, it seems like your mutual fund clients have faced some pressure. Do you see those discussions picking up? And what's your kind of outlook on the pipeline for that since it is a little bit higher margin?", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "Yeah, Jim, there is enormous pressure, as has become very visible in the last year or so on the traditional long-only fund companies and so they're doing everything they can to get more efficient. And it has created an uptick \u2013 a significant uptick in not only deal flow, but the complexity of deal flow, meaning the middle-office. Gosh, I would get to at least an half of the mutual fund related activity today that's got a middle-office component.", "And even probably, more interestingly, it also has a data component to it. So there's DataGX, which is a fairly new offering for us where we act as the data integrator, taking the middle-office, not only the data that we have but data from other custodians. That product is surging too. So I think it's a natural consequence of more downward pressure on the investment management business generally. And we're in a pretty good place, given the product offering and the things that we're continuing to do, not only to help solve the middle-office issue, but edge our way into the front office with DataGX and other analytics products.", "James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. So you feel good about the pipeline?", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "I do.", "James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP", "Hello. Thank you for taking the question. Eric, you mentioned at the beginning of your remarks efforts to bring GAAP and operating earnings closer together. And clearly, you've made the change around discount accretion. But is there anything else you've done there or anything else you're thinking about doing?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Jeff, it's a good question. We've certainly had a history of the disclosures with GAAP and operating. I think there's some benefit to that, right, because they provide you a sense for the underlying business, especially the big program like Beacon, their restructuring charges that are important to note. I do think, though, that there's investor interest, there's analyst interest, and making sure we're as simple to understand as possible. I met with a number of you down in New York, here in Boston over the last couple of months, and that came through as some of the feedback that I picked up.", "So I think you saw us narrow down the number of lines. Discount accretion was all of $5 million, and so to kind of call it out as a separate line, I'd rather just tell you how much it is and incorporated in both results just to make all of our work easier. So I think you saw us take a step change this quarter. I think we'll continue to reevaluate during the course of the year. And, obviously, year-ends are a more natural time to make \u2013 to potentially make some more changes. But I'll be out there listening and seeing if there is some feedback one way or the other, and we'll take it from there.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Hi, Betsy.", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "Good morning.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. A couple of questions. One, a bit of a ticky-tacky one just on operating deposits versus non-operating deposits when we're talking about deposit beta highlighting there're some things that are different this time around, that's one of them. And just wanted to understand how far along you are in shrinking the non-operating deposits that you have?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Yeah, Betsy, it's Eric. I think part of the optimization that you saw us do over the course of the last quarter is obviously focused on the excess deposits or the non-operating deposits. I think those come in a couple of flavors, right? Some deposits by virtue of coming from financial institutions, and there is a very broad definition under the U.S. and Basel rules, all count as non-operating. I think you saw us a couple years back reduce those amounts, and we want to stay in a comfortable zone because those financial institutions, hedge funds, private equity funds, those are our natural clients we're servicing. And even though those don't count as sticky deposits, we may think they should, but they don't under the rules. We need to accommodate those and we'll continue to do that.", "So I think we've made some step changes there a year-and-a-half ago and are comfortable with the level. I think what we find is in the balance of our business, what happens is you have deposits and up to a point, they count as operating. And over that point, when they are above the kind of natural flows that you would expect them to cover, the rules require you to do some calculations or statistical analysis, designate a kind of a level for different types of clients based on their activities and the levels above that tend to be excess. Those are the ones that we've obviously spent more time trying to calibrate and adjust. It's not a science, but that's what we're focused and that's been the effort.", "I think, going forward, as I said, I think the balance sheet size is comfortable where it's at. We'd like to keep it flattish from here. I'm an ex-Treasurer. So I always say down a tick just to keep things tight, but we like where we are. We'll always do work, though, under the surface. And so we still have a wholesale CD book in the $8 billion to $9 billion range. If some good client deposits come in, I can bring that down. That would improve NIM because of the interest rate cost differential, and you'll see us take those kinds of actions if we can.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. That's great, Eric. And then just second thing. We talked a little bit about the SLR and the CET1. How do you think about the tangible equity to tangible assets ratio? If you didn't have these other constraints to consider, what do you think a good range is for running the bank on that measure?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "That's a good question, Betsy. And I've not actually spent a lot of time with that historic measure, probably because we have so many measures, whether it's SLR, fully phased-in SLR, we have CET1, we have Tier 1, we have advanced and standardized. And so, to be honest, my perspective is I expect some refinements on the current capital rules, but not so much that we could go back to some of those historic measures like TE to TA. I think that will just be an outgrowth of what the current rules are, to be honest.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Right. Got it. Okay. Hey, thanks a lot.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Eric, the first question for you. Can we talk a little about other operating costs? Normally, they seem to come down a little bit in the first quarter. Did not see as much of a decline linked quarter, in fact, year on year, and I recognize there is the GE acquisition partly, but it's up very sharply. So could you tell us what's going on with that line and why it's running a little higher than it has previously?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Sure. Other operating expense \u2013 and I think other folks on the call can find it on the supplement or the earnings report, it's up year-on-year really for two reasons. One is the GE sub-advisory fees actually get booked in that line and that was about \u2013 I think about half, a third to half of the uptick. The other is that there is some regulatory and insurance costs, right. There's FDIC, there is some of that equivalent in Europe, and I think there might even been some of those VAT taxes (51:20) and so forth that come through on the expense line.", "Quarter-on-quarter, what you did see is a reduction. The quarter-on-quarter reduction is down about 5%. And that was professional fees coming down, some of that is we've in-sourced more of regulatory activities, so you see that in a different line, as an example. But that was down sequentially.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "So, looking forward, any color on how we should think about that given that that's clearly running on a year-on-year basis much higher, presuming the sub-advisory fees are going to (52:02) regulatory, obviously, down from the fourth quarter, and same with the insurance.?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Yeah, I think that's fair. I think you can think of that line as flattish \u2013 within a range. I think there's some volatility. We've got some of our regulatory costs, but those at least \u2013 unless we hear more, right, from some of the supervisors, we expect those to continue, and some of those are good run-the-bank kind of activities. So I think relatively flattish going forward.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "A question for Jay. Jay, there was a comment in the release about hedge fund outflows having some impact. Can you give us an update on where you stand on that? What you're seeing in \u2013 since that's obviously an important client base for you folks, and you've been a leader in that one?", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "Sure. Happy to do that, Vivek. As you know, over the past probably 10 years, we have moved into the alternative administration space, both hedge, private equity, and real estate and, in fact, are a leader in that marketplace. And you also are well aware that the hedge fund industry has suffered many sequential quarters of outflows due to performance and other reasons. And so we would reflect some of that movement.", "And in the quarter, we continue to see outflows in hedge funds. And I would just suggest that we hope that turns, but we're not fully in control of that. But I'd also mention that that's just one dimension of our servicing complex. I could also point to a few other things, just to provide some balance. The long-only business \u2013 the traditional long-only business in the U.S. actually looked a little bit better. You've seen outflows for a long time. That kind of went to neutral in the past quarter, which we view as constructive. And then, just to give you a couple of other dimensions.", "Outside of the U.S., the offshore markets continue to run very fast, and we're the market leader in the offshore services, most of which are centered in Luxembourg and Dublin. And then just final point to that, just to give you kind of the highlights of the big movers. As money has moved out of hedge funds, we've seen it flow into private equity and real estate. And so, we've seen our private equity administration business pick up, and even real estate more recently, as the complexity of doing back-office for real estate assets is overwhelming some of the asset managers.", "So I would say I wouldn't focus overtly on just hedge funds. I think it's always a portfolio where some things are in favor, some things are out of favor. And I'd say, for now, hedge funds continue to look to be out of favor, which reflects on our \u2013 that component of our servicing fees.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks. And where are you on asset management? Since GE seems to have been well absorbed, any color on what you're thinking on that front now, and particularly from an acquisition standpoint?", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "Yeah, I would say \u2013 my broad comment about asset management is, we feel we focused our strategy more in ETFs and solutions, and we've been making investments. And I think the performance that you've seen this quarter and the last couple quarters is a reflection of that. So we feel good about the space that we've decided to compete in.", "And the GE Asset Management acquisition has exceeded expectations from a standpoint of getting everybody onboard and even having a little bit of \u2013 it's early days, but some uptick in new business. It's given us much more variety in our asset classes in order to fulfill our solutions business. And from an acquisition standpoint, Vivek, I would say there's probably some gaps, smaller gaps in our asset offering that, if we could fill them with a team or a small acquisition, we would entertain, but nothing more significant than that.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks, Jay.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.", "Steven Duong - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hi. This is actually Steve Duong in for Gerard's team. Thanks for taking our questions. Just regarding the BlackRock business that is being transferred to JPMorgan. Are there any deposits with that business? And if so, how much is going?", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "Yeah \u2013 go ahead.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Steve, it's Eric. There's a bit of deposits with every client that we have, and we'll certainly factor that in, and that's factored in our view of this year and next year.", "I will say, though, there are more deposits that tend to come our way than go. Our treasurer and our businesses do quite a bit of balancing between price and just active discussions with our servicing counterparties about how much they can leave with us. And so, if a little deposits flow out, let me tell you, there'll be other clients who want to leave deposits with us in a pretty simple exchange.", "Steven Duong - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Understood. Thank you. And just a second question regarding your dividend. What are you guys thinking about, just as far as a long-term dividend payout? Is something like a 40% fair?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Steve, it's Eric. I think that's a good question, and I'd kind of answer it in two ways. I think we're comfortable with the current level of dividends versus buyback. It gives us a good amount of flexibility in terms of the capital structure. We like the opportunity to have the mix that we have. And, obviously, that's all part of our CCAR ask that we submitted back in April.", "I think I'd also say that, as said has (58:50) become clear, that there isn't really a 30% dividend cap as a way to return capital to shareholders, we'll consider over time whether we want to make some adjustments, but that will be something we consider. But no, no new news to report at this point.", "Steven Duong - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great. Thanks for taking our questions.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.", "Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks. So just two quick questions really. You did mention on the new business yet to be installed that was coming in with higher fee rates than what you currently see across the company. Is that also the same for the BlackRock business that's going away? Is that a higher fee rate business as well?", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "Yeah. Let me just clarify that, Brian. What I described is that it's a higher \u2013 the $375 billion is a higher level of backlog to be installed than we have traditionally had. And connected to that, I mentioned that the reason for that is that they're bigger, meatier, more complex deals, therefore, they have a longer implementation timeframe. You can infer from that that there's more middle-office and complexity and so a higher fee rate. The BlackRock business is kind of standard kind of 1940 Act-ish straightforward common trust fund business, so a little simpler.", "Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. And then, was there any impact from the run rates from the sale of the BFDS business?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "There was not in this quarter. It's Eric. Brian, there's not in this quarter just because it was done at the end of the quarter. There'll be a small one, but it's fairly minor in the scheme of our revenues and certainly incorporated in our fee and revenue guidance that we've provided.", "Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing remarks.", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "Thanks, Hope. And I just want to thank everybody for their participation today and we look forward to speaking with you in July with the second quarter results. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Ostler - State Street Corp.", "Thanks, Victoria. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our Chairman and CEO, Jay Hooley, will speak first. Then, Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our second quarter 2017 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com.

During the Q&A, please limit your questions to two questions and then re-queue.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include operating-basis and other measures presented on a non-GAAP basis.

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change.", "Now, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "Thanks, Anthony. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our second quarter results, delivering a record level of quarterly earnings per share that reflect continued strength in global equity markets, as well as momentum in our asset management and asset servicing business. We also, for the first time, exceeded $31 trillion in assets under custody and administration this quarter, fueled by a combination of new business activity and higher equity markets.", "In June, we celebrated our 225th anniversary. We're proud to be in a rare category of companies whose success is measured not in years or decades, but in centuries. We've been able to achieve this success by focusing on our clients and on key markets, while delivering new solutions to address our clients' needs. We continue to invest and obtain long-term benefits from Beacon, which is core to the next phase of advancing State Street. We're making progress in digitizing our operations and providing new capabilities and information advantages to our clients.", "We continue to prioritize returning capital to our shareholders. In June, our Board of Directors approved a $1.4 billion common stock purchase program following the Federal Reserve's review of our capital plan under its 2017 CCAR process. Our 2017 capital plan also includes an increase of approximately 11% and our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.42 per share starting in the third quarter of 2017.", "Now turning to slide number four. I'd like to review our progress on our strategic priorities and some key achievements this quarter. We continued to deliver broad-based growth from our core franchise, with new asset servicing wins of approximately $135 billion for the quarter and our highest levels of assets under custody and administration at quarter end with growth of 12% from the second quarter 2016. Our total new business yet to be installed at quarter end was $370 billion, and our pipeline of new business opportunities remains robust. SSGA finished the quarter with $2.61 trillion in assets under management, a 13% increase from 2Q 2016. The majority of the growth from 2Q 2016 was driven by market appreciation, and 5% of the increase was from the acquired GE Asset Management business, which continues to support growth, including the win of the GE Alstom UK business.", "We completed the integration of the acquired GE Asset Management business in the second quarter, which had already turned accretive ahead of schedule in the first quarter. I'm also pleased to say that momentum in our Global Markets business continues. Our FX business, with its distinctive research and breadth of trading platforms, increased its ranking significantly according to Euromoney 2017 FX survey, as we were rated fifth with real money managers and hedge funds globally and that's up from seventh and 11th place, respectively, the year earlier.", "This increase in market share is reflected in the 13% growth in FX trading revenue from 2Q 2016. Beacon continues to advance with our investments in technology, next-generation platforms, enhancements to operational performance and connectivity across the enterprise and through the delivery of innovative solutions and insights to our clients. Eric will provide you some more detail on the progress that we're making with Beacon in a few minutes.", "We remain focused on providing clients with innovative solutions to address regulatory risk and analytic requirements, their investment needs and supporting the achievement of their growth objectives. Some examples of the benefits of our ongoing investments include solutions for regulatory reporting, risk analytics and collateral management and the broadening and deepening of our OCIO capabilities with the acquisition of GE Asset Management operations.", "We've also developed our Market Entry Solutions, which is an integrated value-added service that leverages our global presence and expertise to assist our clients with their global growth strategies. Our mission is to provide clients with information insight, access and partnership to support their global product development and distribution ambitions.", "So, in closing, we remain focused on achieving our financial goals as reflected by our year-over-year quarterly positive fee operating leverage of approximately 190 basis points and total operating leverage of over 270 basis points. This resulted in improving our pre-tax operating margin to over 33% for 2Q 2017 and helped us increase EPS 14% from 2Q 2016 and 18% in the first six months compared to 2016, while generating a return on equity of approximately 14% for the quarter and 12% in the first six months of 2017. All of these are on an operating basis.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Eric, who'll cover the financials and then we'll open the call to your questions.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Thank you, Jay, and good morning everyone. Please turn to slide 5 where I will start my review of our operating-basis results for second quarter 2017. EPS for 2Q 2017 increased to $1.67 per share, up 14% from 2Q 2016. 2Q 2017 results reflected continued momentum in fee revenue, driven by higher equity markets, new business wins and positive client flows, as well as growth within our markets businesses. 2Q 2017 results also reflected higher NII as a result of the rising interest rate environment, disciplined liability pricing and improved liability mix.", "We delivered approximately 2 percentage points of positive fee operating leverage and achieved a pre-tax margin of over 33%, up almost 2 percentage points. And importantly, ROE also improved to over 13%, up 1.4 percentage points.", "Now let me turn to slide six to briefly review growth of two key drivers. First, AUCA increased to record levels of $31 trillion, up 12% from 2Q 2016. Growth was driven by a combination of market appreciation and net new business and client flows. AUCA growth translated into strong revenue increases across our three geographies and spanned a broad range of products and client segments. As compared to 1Q 2017, both AUCA and revenues were up nicely.", "Second, at State Street Global Advisors, AUM increased 13% from 2Q 2016, driven by market appreciation and the impact of the acquired GE Asset Management operations and positive ETF flows, which were partially offset by continuing institutional net outflows.", "Please turn to slide 7 where I will focus on 2Q 2017 fee revenue results, which were up 9% relative to 2Q 2016. You'll also find detail in the appendix for the sequential quarter comparison. Servicing fees increased 4%, primarily due to higher global equity markets, new business installations and client activity on a year-over-year basis. While our wins were broad-based, we saw particular strength in EMEA, alternatives and middle-office outsourcing for asset managers.", "Management fees increased 38%, reflecting the contribution of the acquired GE Asset Management business and higher global equity markets on a year-over-year basis. On a sequential quarter basis, both servicing and management fees demonstrated solid growth, increasing 3 percentage points and 4 percentage points, respectively.", "Trading services increased relative to 2Q 2016, primarily reflecting gains in market share and increased activity in emerging markets, offset in part by lower volatility. Securities finance revenue increased from 2Q 2016, reflecting continued strength in enhanced custody.", "Processing fees and other revenue decreased from 2Q 2016, primarily reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange swap costs, which are primarily in NII this year. As a reminder, 1Q 2017 processing and other revenue included a $30 million gain related to the sale of BFDS/IFDS.", "Moving to slide 8, NIM was up 16 basis points from 2Q 2016, and NII was up 13% on a relatively flat balance sheet. Strength in NII was the result of higher market interest rates in the U.S., disciplined liability pricing and our continued focus on improving our liability mix, partially offset by a smaller investment portfolio.", "On a sequential basis, 2Q 2017 NII benefited from higher market rates as well as lower levels of wholesale CD funding. NIM was up 10 basis points sequentially, a portion of which was non-recurring, so we expect closer to a 3 to 5 basis point uptick in the third quarter, given the June Fed rate increase. Interest-bearing client deposit pay has remained relatively low, within a 20% to 25% range. And even with our disciplined pricing, we did see our deposits tick up sequentially, as clients continue to look for outlets for their U.S. dollar cash.", "Now I will turn to slide 9 to review second quarter expenses. 2Q 2017 expenses increased 7% in total from 2Q 2016, with approximately 3 percentage points of that increase related to the $51 million of expenses associated with the acquired GE Asset Management business. Excluding those acquisition-related expenses, compensation, employee benefits increased from the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting increased cost to support new business, incentive compensation and merit increases and regulatory initiatives, partially offset by Beacon savings.", "Information systems, transaction processing and occupancy costs increased modestly year-over-year and in line with new business and planned investments. Other expenses increased, primarily reflecting the costs associated with the acquired GE Asset Management business and higher regulatory and insurance expenses, partially offset by lower legal-related costs. 2Q 2017 GAAP results also included a pre-tax $62 million charge related to the restructuring associated with Beacon, which will provide benefits within the next five to six quarters.", "As compared to 1Q 2017, expenses decreased 5 percentage points, reflecting the 1Q 2017 seasonal deferred incentive compensation expense. Excluding this seasonal impact, sequential expenses increased 3 percentage points, reflecting net new business, merit increases and the timing of incentive compensation awards, partially offset by savings related to State Street Beacon.", "Let me now move to slides 10 and 11 to review our progress on State Street Beacon, as well as highlight the range of initiatives that enhance the client experience and increase operational efficiencies. Starting on slide 10, you can see four tangible benefits that are improving the client experience. First, we are leveraging our global scale to improve the speed and efficiency of key services, transaction processing, fund accounting and fund administration. Each of these three services has a detailed set of metrics that we track, a subset of which you can see on the right side of the slide. In particular, we are seeing strong benefits as we roll out and clients adopt our new technologies and tools.", "Second, we are upgrading our core platform architecture, integrating with new technologies and investing in IT capabilities. Third, we have made good progress expanding Beacon across the organization. Earlier this year, we launched effectiveness and efficiency initiatives in the corporate function and in SSGA, while we also centralized our procurement and real estate processes.", "Lastly, on the revenue side, we expect the development of innovative client business solutions, such as our recently-launched SEC Modernization product to result in incremental revenue, some of which we are already seeing in our sales pipeline.", "Turning to slide 11; Beacon remains on track to achieve $550 million in targeted program savings, including at least $140 million in 2017. On the left side of the slide, we show the year-over-year growth benefits and investment expense related to Beacon. You can see on the bottom row our previously-disclosed 2016 net savings, as well as our 2017 guidance to achieve at least $140 million. Each quarter, we carefully pace the level of investments to consider multiyear initiatives, support immediate opportunities and calibrate this to the external environment. The net benefit varies each quarter, and in 2Q 2017, we recognized approximately $25 million in year-over-year net expense savings.", "On the right side of the slide, we have broken out the growth savings by major categories that I just described. Approximately 70% of the projected growth savings in 2017 is a result of leveraging our scale and dispersing resources across our global platform. The balance comes from improving our technology and expanding Beacon deeper into the organization. Each year, the mix of benefits will change up or down as we identify opportunities for improvement.", "Now let's turn to slide 12 to review our balance sheet and capital position. We continue to maintain a high-quality balance sheet, including an investment portfolio with a well-structured and diversified mix of securities. Our capital and liquidity position remains strong. We repurchased $227 million of common stock in 2Q 2017, which completed our repurchase under our program announced in July of 2016.", "Our new capital actions announced just last month continue to demonstrate our commitment to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and higher dividends. While we were relatively pleased with our CCAR results, we are obviously digesting the detail as are other banks.", "We will carefully operate and optimize under the current rule. And of course, we are monitoring for potential developments. Let me briefly update you on LCR reporting requirements. We will begin to report our quarterly average LCR in August. On an average daily basis for 2Q 2017, our LCR is above the 100% standard as you'd expect.", "Moving to slide 13, I'll update you on where we stand regarding our financial outlook. In summary, we are very pleased with the year-to-date progress against our original 2017 outlook. Importantly, in 2Q 2017, we saw good revenue momentum; we continued to deliver a good operating leverage and our pre-tax margin expanded nicely. We remain focused on returning capital to shareholders, prudently managing expenses and executing on State Street Beacon, while driving growth in our core franchise.", "So based on the strong year-to-date results, let me provide an update to our 2017 outlook relative to 2016. First, we now expect fee revenue growth for the full year to be in the 6% to 7% range, assuming the present favorable market conditions continue to prevail throughout the remainder of the year and the U.S. dollar remains stable relative to major currencies.", "Second, we expect fee operating leverage to be towards the upper end of the 100 basis point to 200 basis point range that we communicated in January. On the expense front, we will continue to calibrate expenses against the revenue backdrop, but also in light of client installation requirements.", "Third, due to strong year-to-date NII performance, we expect 2017 NII to be within a range of $2.43 billion to $2.45 billion or an increase of approximately 12% to 13% from 2016 levels. Lastly, we continue to expect our tax rate to be at the lower end of the 30% to 32% target we communicated in January.", "Let me briefly touch on third quarter 2017 before turning the call back to Jay. We expect trading services revenue to be muted as activity usually slows in the summer, while securities finance revenue should decrease from the elevated seasonal levels experienced in 2Q. We expect NII to increase in 3Q 2017 due to the Fed's most recent move at the end of June, but not at the same magnitude as we saw from 1Q to 2Q. In summary, we believe we are well positioned to achieve these full-year 2017 financial objectives.", "Now, let me turn the call back to Jay.", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "Thanks, Eric. Victoria, we now like you to open the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.", "Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC", "Hi, how are you?", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "Good morning.", "Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC", "So the fee growth is great, even if you ex-out the GE acquisition. So it feels like there's a little bit better leverage to equity markets than the whole 10%, 2% rule of old. But I don't know if you could help with how much of that is just emerging market versus developed market growth and the fee differential there? I don't know if you've ever shared with us what the fee differential is, but good to see, nonetheless.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Glenn, it's Eric. Good question and let me give you the summary. It's really all of those elements, right? So you remember equity markets are up nicely in the low teens. Bond markets on the other hand are actually flat to down. In some cases, hedge funds markets, private equity are kind of mixed. So you kind of have to factor all that as you think about the AUCA growth. I think what we did see was actually a nice mix, both on the AUCA front in terms of growth and on the fee \u2013 services fee area in terms of growth. We saw a nice mix of some support from market appreciation, some nice contributions from flows. We've seen flows broadly distributed this quarter and this \u2013 for the first half of the year across Europe, U.S. mutual funds, ETFs, right, all those are flowing in positively given our clients and the market.", "And then net new business has been good. You see we continue to have wins in the marketplace. We still have a pipeline that we've been carrying that's $350 billion, $370 billion, $375 billion over the last couple of quarters, and that's getting implemented literally month-by-month. So it's really a combination of all the factors you described.", "Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC", "And is there a large fee differential EM versus developed markets? Or does that get bundled into a global client all-in fee?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "More and more it's bundled as a global client, right? We have clients that operate around the world. The fee discussions capture all their businesses. You have some differential between lower-volume emerging markets, but even those are more typically in the \u2013 are quite advanced economies these days, slightly different fee levels at bonds versus equities, ETFs versus mutual funds. I mean, there's a dispersion but I don't think it's as dramatic as it once was.", "Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC", "Appreciate that. The last little one on balance sheet, you alluded to but I look for a little more color. The rate paid on non-U.S. deposits went negative from positive, small numbers but went negative from positive, yet those deposits actually still grow. I'm just curious if you can give us a little more color on what drives that? Obviously, that's what you're talking about on your pricing discipline.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Yes. I think the \u2013 probably the best page to take a look at for folks is the supplemental information package, the page 13 where you see the average interest-earning balance sheet. I think you saw a couple of things. I think the international deposits, remember, have a component of swaps that are tagged against those that feature into NII, and so that's why you see the lumpiness from quarter-to-quarter. We actually pushed our international deposit pricing down a bp or two, just given the \u2013 our need to earn appropriate returns internationally, and also because we continue to see a nice inflow and willingness, almost the need from our clients to leave balances with us. They're doing that in euros, in sterling, in yen. They're doing that in dollars. And so, we've got high demand on, I think, for clients to leave cash with banks. They're \u2013 a lot of that, they're steering towards us, and we obviously have a limited capability to accept too much of that given the leverage ratio constraints that we need to keep in mind.", "Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC", "All right. Thank you for all that, Eric.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Hey, guys. Good morning. A couple of questions, I guess, in some of the buckets that they were particularly strong this quarter, and wanted to start, I guess, with the security lending. So nice uplift, it feel like seasonality has been softening over the last couple of years. So maybe, as you look at the sequential change, can you help us understand kind of what was the seasonal uplift this time around versus more kind of normal growth? And then, I guess, the more important question is, enhanced custody obviously continues to contribute here. Where do you guys still see the runway in that business, which, I guess, continues to be pretty strong?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Yeah. Alex, it's Eric. Let me start. I think, as you described, seasonality and traditional SEC lending a little lighter than it's been historically, but we've still seen a decent amount of seasonality. Part of that just might be where we are in the market cycle. Part of that is there's the usual dividend activity and so forth that you'd expect.", "On the enhanced custody side, I think, there we're actually seeing a continued pattern beyond seasonality of growth in revenues. Part of that is, we're serving more clients. Part of that is, we're going a little deeper with select clients. And so that \u2013 on \u2013 and that business was really a mix of both seasonality and growth on a year-over-year basis.", "And so, I think, you can kind of take a look at the year-on-year comparisons. That's a good proxy for a growth of the two businesses. The quarterly uptick, a little more seasonal. But we also have to remember, right, there's volatility in these businesses, they ebb and flow. And so, with a very strong quarter, we're quite pleased, but it will move up and down, and I think we all need to factor that in.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Sure. And then, just as far as some of the excitement around capital relief on the back of the treasury white paper. I'm sure you guys got a bunch of question on that, but with Tier 1 leverage being obviously the more binding constraint for you guys in CCAR, what is the latest that you guys hear in terms of the ratio being augmented to kind of calibrate closer to what SLR could potentially change to or just making broader adjustments to CCAR that would alleviate against some of the pressure points there. And I guess, if any of those things do happen, how should we think about the kind of newfound capital that you guys could either grow the balance sheet or return to shareholders?", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "Let me start that one, Alex. This is Jay. The \u2013 I thought the treasury report I'm sure everybody's gone through it by now was a pretty balanced report with regard to ways to recalibrate and fine-tune some of the Dodd-Frank and Volcker legislations. So, I think, it was a good framework. And hopefully, once we get some of these appointments with the Fed and other agencies, they'll start to attack that.", "For us, we have a pretty narrow set of concerns and issues. The most prominent one is the one you mentioned, which is the drag that excess deposits have on the leverage ratio. And that is prominent, not only in that report, but in all the conversations that I have with regulators. Everybody, I would say, acknowledges that, that was an unintended consequence of the regulations. So I think there's a real desire to fix it. The fix, the conversation around a fix is kind of two dimensional. One way to adjust the excess deposit issue for the trust banks would be simply to rescale the leverage ratio and that's one of the conversations out there so that you'd give the custody banks a little bit more headroom to accept these deposits. And at the same time, put in place some kind of a provision so that in a crisis or in a market event that we get relief from the leverage ratio. So that's one kind of conversation, which would tend to just deal with the trust bank issues of the leverage ratio.", "And then the broader thought out there is to reduce the denominator of the leverage ratio to accommodate central bank deposits, and that's, remember, that Bank of England took that approach in their leverage ratio. I'd say, and obviously that would treat not only the trust banks but the other, the rest of the banking industry as well. Those are the two paths that are being discussed. I think it's going to depend on, again, new appointments and getting people in place and figuring out what the best way to deal with it is. But I have very high confidence. I can't tell you when that the issue will be addressed because I think it's acknowledged in all circles that it was an unintended consequence of the regulations.", "With regard to the broader regulatory reform agenda, as I say, our needs, our issues are narrow. I think more broadly though if we get to extended cycles on the resolution and recovery plan, if in CCAR, they held the balance sheet flat, all that would be additive to not only the cost of complying with regulation, but as you rightly mentioned, freeing up capital within State Street. Eric, I don't know if you'd add anything to that.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Yes, I think we're quite pleased to just see some balanced discussions and reports coming out of Washington. We think even Governor Tarullo, as he wound up his tenure, I think was supportive of some of these changes, which are really in the bucket of unintended consequences that have come through. Jay covered several of them. Another one is on the Volcker rule. The Volcker rule in an unintended way captures the seeding of new mutual funds and other types of investments that an asset manager has and if that asset manager is held within a bank environment like our SSGA business, it's kind of, you're guilty until proven innocent that it's not propped trading when in fact, all you're doing is seeding a new investment or a new mutual fund. So we're optimistic that at multiple levels, there is an evolution here. We're certainly engaging with folks at multiple levels just to help articulate how to move the pendulum in a prudent way that gets us to where we should be.", "Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Got it. Great. Appreciate you guys taking the questions.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Hi. Good morning, guys. First question just on the operating fee leverage guidance, you're still calling for 100 to 200, and it looks like inclusive of SGA, it's more like more like 320s through the first half. So can you just talk us through, either what do you expect to change in that relationship in the second half? Or are you just continuing to have a conservative guide given always the uncertainty of the environment?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Ken, it's Eric. The answer is really the second part of that, of your question, which is we've got to be conservative, right. A year-and-a-half ago, no one thought the equity markets would swoon like they did, and that is always a risk notwithstanding the indices like VIX and so forth, are at all-time's low. But we know when things feel good is when you should be vigilant.", "I think we're also just trying to be conscious that as we have revenues, we also have an installation pipeline, as we have new wins that we're carrying that pipeline through. And part of what you're seeing us do is we actually have to start to onboard new clients, put people against that build-out infrastructure and technology to plug them in. And so, part of what we are trying to signal is, we absolutely will calibrate operating leverage in the 100 to 200 basis point range.", "We'd certainly \u2013 we've hinted that \u2013 or more than hinted, we'd like to be towards the upper end there, but we're mindful that, that the installation of those clients, especially those global clients who are particularly complex and have a broader set of offerings, take some energy and some spending. So we'll be disciplined here. I think we're very pleased with the first half, but we don't have any interest in resting on our laurels. And we know we need to maintain a pattern, a consistent pattern of positive operating leverage.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Got it. Okay. And then secondly, if I could just dive one depth further into the liability cost side. Can you just help us go that extra mile on the U.S. deposit cost? You mentioned the wholesale funding. How much of that was a helper from 50 basis points to go to 38%? And then on that non-U.S. side, can you help us understand the delta in the hedge, the $25 million last quarter, and what that went to this quarter? Thanks again, Eric.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Yeah. Let me do this at a couple levels to help answer your questions. So first, if you think about the 10 basis point uptick that we saw, I'd say 4 or 5 basis points of that this quarter was really market levels floating up, deposits which re-prices the asset side of the balance sheet, offset with disciplined pricing across both the U.S. and the international jurisdictions. So we saw good performance there.", "We then saw couple basis point tick down from, as we rolled off some of those wholesale CDs that I mentioned. And then there was a couple of basis points just from market dislocations. We saw the swap costs were a little lower this quarter than previously. That moves around with markets. It moves around with which currencies we're swapping. And so we had a little more of a tailwind than we would have expected. So those are the combinations.", "I think if you had decomposed the deposits, on a tactical basis, total U.S. deposit costs were down 12 basis points. The underlying is that the CDs drove actually a bit more than that, kind of 15 basis point, 16 basis point roll down, and U. S. deposit costs were up by just four. And when you compare that to a 25 basis points move of the Fed, that's a 20% deposit beta, which is kind of the zone we've been in. We've been signaling 20% to 25%. I think it's coming at the lower end of our range. On the international deposits, I did say earlier the underlying international deposits actually fell by a basis point in terms of cost. The rest of the movement is in the swap, the furnishing swap costs, which we've actually enumerated in the footnotes of page 13 back there if you want to just do the math.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Perfect, yes. Thanks for the color, Eric.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Hi, Betsy, go ahead.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Can you hear me?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Yes.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "All right, great. I just had a couple of follow-up questions. One was on, Eric, the LCR. You mentioned that starting in August regulatory reports are going to require that you disclose the LCR ratio in a composition, Eric. Could you just give us a sense as to what you've done to manage your position going into this announcement? And how you think about managing it as you're going to be disclosing this on a quarterly basis? And what you would recommend folks like us think about or look at as the numbers come out?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Sure. I think the demand on the LCR has certainly predated me. The team two, almost three years ago when the LCR kind of came of age and got finalized did a couple of things to drive compliance. First, we added some deposits to our underlying balance sheet, right, and some of that was in the form of wholesale CDs. And we did that because we needed that term structured that extended beyond the 30 days, 60 days, 90 days that you want to be at. I think secondly, the team then did some very good work to itemize their deposits and create clarity on which ones were operating versus excess and actually balance \u2013 rebalance that mix. And you saw the reduction almost two years ago, deposits of about $20 billion, $25 billion.", "And that was really driving out excess deposits but actually keeping or actually increasing over time those operating transactional deposit balances. And then what you've seen us do over time is we've continued that mix improvement, right, under the surface so that their operating deposits continue to trend upward. And that's given us the luxury to actually work down some of those wholesale CDs. So I think there has been a program in place here over a two to three-year timeframe to actually prepare. I think we feel like we've now been operating under the LCR rules for kind of three years, but the last year has been really on a BAU basis. And so I don't think it's going to change a lot of our management going forward. Those are the rules. The rules are the rules, and they're there for a good reason and we'll operate within them.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "So is there anything left in non-operating to wind down here?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Nothing that's terribly significant. There's always a little bit, and there's always an ongoing optimization that you do. We have a decent-sized alternatives accounting and fund administration business. That's with financial counterparties like hedge funds or private equity. And the Fed has deemed that as a 100% access. So we don't think that's right. We don't think the model support that, but \u2013 so we need to keep some amount of access for those clients and we'll do that. But there's no big step change that we expect.", "And in truth, the best thing to do from an LCR management standpoint is now to operate with a healthy LCR. But you don't want it to be neither too thin, nor to rich, right? If it's too rich, you're leaving money on the table and you can redeploy that into lending or securities. If it's too light, you're scraping by. And so I think there's a nice middle ground that we'd want to operate in.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, great. And then just lastly, on the guidance that you have for the NII for the full year, obviously part of that uplift is this quarter, and it looks like there's a bit of an uplift also from 3Q, 4Q, but maybe at a slower pace than 2Q's uplift. And my question is that just a function of being a little bit more conservative on the cost of funding given that some of the benefit this quarter came from what looks like swap market activity that maybe you're baking into the base case.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Yeah, I think the \u2013 that's the right way to think about it. We had a nice uptick from 4Q to 1Q, another nice uptick 1Q to 2Q. But I think the \u2013 you can't bank on a full 10 basis point sequential uptick, again even with the Fed, the rate rise, we think the underlying core in that 10 might have been 5 basis points, 6 basis points depending on how you count.", "Given that we have a little more of that now, we expect 2Q to 3Q uptick to be closer to 3 basis points to 5 basis points because some of it's already in the run rate. And that after that, we have to wait and see. There's been a lot of talk about deposit betas, where they'll go, when will begin to flow it upwards.", "That hasn't happened. We've had nice stability in our deposit betas. We've had nice stability in our deposit base, but I don't think any of us with bankers want to get out ahead of ourselves and predict what \u2013 exactly what they'll look like in 4Q and then into next year just yet.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Super. Thank you so much. Really appreciate the color.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Yeah.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.", "Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Let me just circle back on the NII outlook. What are your assumptions for \u2013 specifically for the rate backdrop in the second half in terms of Fed hikes and the tenure? And then I assume that you're still assuming like around a 25% deposit beta in the second half as well?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Brian, it's Eric. That's about right. So we've been at the 20% to 25% right now. We think that for this June hike, we'll be around that level, but you never know for sure. We expect the June rate hike to come through, and then potentially a December hike. But since it's so late in the year, that really won't have much of an effect on 4Q. So that's our interest rate forecast.", "I guess, what I would say is, if you step back, so far, deposits have performed well, I think, in this rising rate environment. I think part of that is that we remix the quality of the deposits and pushed out a lot of that access two years ago, and then we've been managing carefully over the last year to support that. And then partly because the deposits from the custody banks I think actually respond in a decent way. If you think about it, there's a hierarchy of response in deposits across different sectors, right? We all know that in retail, you have quite low deposit betas, and that's been shown for cycle after cycle. I think at the other book end in the corporate sector where you get corporate treasurers, they're actually quite willing to shop their money, especially because they keep them for cash management and earnings credit. They'll move that around. They are borrowing from banks, and they're quid pro quo sometimes is, hey, you've got to pay up on deposits.", "So I think the corporate sector and even high net worth tends to have a higher betas. And we're in the middle as a custody bank, right? We're doing with end-of-day cash, asset managers and pension funds who want to cover their transaction flows, who aren't really tempted to drawdown lines, right? That's not something that they look to do. And so I think the custody banks are in this middle ground between retail and corporate, and that's part of the reason why our deposits have responded well through the first couple rate hikes.", "Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. That's great way to characterize it. And then my follow-up question, also sticking with the balance sheet. If you can talk a little bit in more detail about the repurchase agreement financing that you've been doing? Specifically, I'm looking at the securities purchased under resale agreement line that revenue went from $46 million to $69 million in NII. It's about a third or so of your Q-on-Q NII increase and I think over half of your year-on-year NII increase. Can you just talk about how that business is going? How sustainable that is? What are you doing exactly to see that pretty remarkable improvement in revenue?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Yes. So that's the \u2013 we detailed that well in the footnote. That's the support of our clients in the FICC repo program. That's a clearinghouse for repo. We arranged those repo trades with clients. These are clients who have surplus cash. What they want is, they want to leave that cash but they want to get securities as collateral, right? So they're looking for a collateralized deposit in effect. We can effectively help them process that through the FICC clearinghouse. The FICC clearinghouse does well over $1 trillion of repo. And you see that we're facilitating on the order of $30 billion, $35 billion for clients. So, this is just part of the support that we have for asset managers and other types of custodial clients. It has been in place for a number of years and we're there facilitating in the marketplace in ways that they appreciate.", "Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Are you growing it based on client adoption of using that service that you're providing? Or do you think more of the growth is driven from the Fed hikes?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "The growth is just \u2013 the volumes are relatively stable. They're up a smidge, but it's \u2013 we do this as an accommodation as part of our business model. The rates are typically reverse repo rates, so those are just floating up in line with market reversed repo rates, general collateral.", "Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thanks for taking the questions.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.", "Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC", "Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a quick one on \u2013 again, on deposits. Sorry, it's the topic du jour here.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Popular.", "Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC", "Yeah, yeah, big focus, very active here this quarter. And when we think about non-operating deposits, could you just maybe update your outlook for those? And how fast you might think they could run off in this environment? How much might be like baseline operating need the business as usual type of balance? Thanks.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Yeah, Brennan, it's Eric. That's a \u2013 it's a fair question, but it's one where it's hard to answer definitively, right, because we are in a new environment. That said, you've seen \u2013 we've seen some kind of a gentle volatility around the levels that we're at, $42 billion, $43 billion, $44 billion, or $45 billion of non interest-bearing deposits. You've seen it tick up. It's ticked down. Year-over-year, it's flattish actually and quarter-over-quarter, it's down $2 billion.", "And the question we're wrestling with, are we beginning to see, and we probably are some transition from non interest-bearing to interest-bearing. But that's been predicted by our treasurers and every other treasurer on The Street. It feels like since the first rate hike, right. And so the $2 billion move, which is less than 5% of the non-interest bearing deposits this quarter, actually is less than what we expected. And so I think there will be some transition over the coming quarters. It's hard to predict how much it is, but it's all factored into our deposit betas.", "Remember, you're moving from effectively zero interest-bearing into what might be a stated rate. A stated rate for us as a bank is in the 10 to 15 basis points relative to a 25 basis point Fed hike that quarter. That's actually all factored into our deposit betas.", "And in fact, the way we characterize that is our deposit betas for interest-bearing deposits are 20% to 25%. When you factor in all the non interest-bearing deposits, those that are not moving and those that are maybe beginning to transition, the deposit beta in aggregate for total deposits is more like 15%. So it's factored in. I think we expect it to trend downwards, and we're certainly prepared and it's part of our overall outlook.", "Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. That's great. Thank you and your overall outlook actually, I think, includes some reduction in the interest-earning assets, 0% to 5% for the year. When we look at the 2Q balances versus in 4Q average, we're already down about 3% and I think 3.5% roughly. So is that right to imply that you guys expect the pace of decline in interest-earning assets to moderate here in the back half of the year? Thanks.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Brennan, if you can tell me when what will happen with surplus cash in the system, I can give you an answer to that. I think we continue just to see clients look for outlets for their cash, right? That's been happening ever since money market reform. The clients naturally come to their custodial bank to do that and they're doing that around the world. So the balance sheet is down, like you say, a couple of percent year-to-date. If we can hold that level, that would be good. If we can trend down a little more, that obviously gives us the room in the leverage ratio. But at the end of the day, we need to balance both how we want to ideally operate the balance sheet with being responsive to our clients because that's who we're here for.", "Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks so much for the color.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.", "James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Hey, good morning, guys. A quick question on CCAR. It seemed like you guys were hit by OCI as you moved quite a bit to held to maturity, some of the higher-quality securities to held to maturity didn't offset the potential losses, I guess, elsewhere. Is that going to change the way you approach it going forward, or do you stick with the plan as you have it now?", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "Jim, it's Eric. Let me give you a little perspective. I think overall, we were pleased with CCAR in the sense that we wanted to take the dividend up 11%. We wanted to return $1.4 billion of capital through buybacks and the review proved supportive of that. So I think we were pleased. I did say in my call text that we continue to look for transparency and try to understand the models because it's multiple models at the Fed. There are credit models that we were trying to make sure we understand. There are PPNR models, right, and sort of different levels of PPNR for different banks and then for different banks within the same kind of cluster or same category. And then like you say, there's the OCI models, which seem to move and create a larger stress than we expected.", "I think the first part of our reaction to CCAR is always just to manage our business and balance sheet carefully, right. And I say that in two ways. One is you're always trying to do your best with earnings. You give some of that back to shareholders, but some of that accretes on the balance sheet and you see our capital is up year-to-date.", "The second part of that is we're always trying to manage the balance sheet in a tight way. We talked about deposits and the balance sheet being tighter year-to-date. And part of that is because we want to run with a leverage ratio that's got the right levels. And you see that in 4Q 2016 on page 12 of our earnings deck, our leverage ratio was 6.5%. We're now at 7%. And what is that? That's actually the earnings accretion into the capital count as well as the tighter balance sheet, which has gotten us there. So just over the first six months of the year, we got 50 basis points more cushion when it comes to a step off.", "So that's where we're at. After that, we're always going to look at the models and ask questions around are there refinements that we could make on our mix of assets, mix of securities, et cetera. But I think you can expect us and every bank to be doing that.", "James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Right. Okay, well, thanks. And any update on the timing and impact from the movement of the custody assets to BlackRock? Thanks.", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "Yes, Jim, this is Jay. No, no update. Sometime in 2018, probably an elongated transition would be my best guess.", "James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Thanks guys. First question, just on the foreign exchange and the trading; you guys had a good quarter definitely versus peers and I know the platform is a bit different. But just what was maybe environmental driven versus strategically? It seems like there's more of a focus on growing that business than there has been, and so just over the next year or two years, where do you see that opportunity on that side of the business?", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "Sure, Mike, I'll start that. This is Jay. As you point out, we do have a different foreign exchange franchise than some of our peers and that it's pretty broad-based and it's supported by some pretty intriguing research. So I would say that we compete at a different level with regard to foreign exchange.", "I referenced in my comment, the Euromoney survey, I don't know if you're familiar with that, but it's the \u2013 kind of the go-to survey in the industry. And we moved up by quite a few paces \u2013 places in that survey, which to me means market share gain. And I think we've got a broad foreign-exchange offering.", "We added a number of new clients this quarter, which is not unusual. We to continue to add new clients. Environmentally, I'd say the global and EM trade helps. But I would say generally, gaining share, which has driven higher volumes, a little help by EM, and just broad-based participation across all aspects of the foreign exchange market.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "And Mike, it's Eric. I'd just add that the market share gains and kind of deepening our relationship with individual clients is what drives the kind of sustained year-on-year performance. The piece that's a little more volatile is whether you've got the flows going into EM and in to Europe and Asia like you did this quarter.", "I think that was a nice uptick, but that's not always going to happen. And so what we found is having a broad-based franchise, because that's what we are. We're well distributed around the world with these global clients, actually is the way to build this business sustainably over years and years.", "Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. That's helpful. And then, just a quick follow-up. On the asset management side, just given the outflows this quarter, I don't know if you can put some perspective on it in terms of just kind of industry trends and some of the pressures that we're seeing there, maybe on the equity side. But in terms of the \u2013 some of the other maybe buckets like alternatives, can you just \u2013 what was maybe some one-offs versus how do you see that business growing going forward?", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "Yes. Let me start out, Mike. I'll just decompose a little bit the flows and then make a few comments and invite Eric to make comments he wants. We had the flows of $28 billion, $22 billion of that was kind of institutional low-revenue outflows, the ETF story which is one that we've been focused on.", "The quarter was a little bit unkind to domestic equities and therefore, we saw almost $10 billion in outflows of our big spike, S&P 500 fund. Take that out, we had $5 billion in inflows. So I would say, if I step back, we weren't thrilled with the quarter. We thought it was a little disappointing.", "Over the last four quarters, our ETF flows have been at $56 billion net inflows. So a little softer on the ETF side, a little bit of it in environmental. We are \u2013 we continue to invest in distribution as well as new product introductions. We introduced nine new products in the second quarter, some in the smart beta space, which we think is an attractive and natural space for us. European ETF sales were good. It's a smaller market, but we really punched above our weight in Europe. So I would say that's kind of the broad-based commentary. The only other thing I would reference is if you look at the SSGA franchise, very global institutional ETF on a retail basis. We're focused on the ETF marketplace and also broadly solutions. And I referenced that we completed the GE Asset Management acquisition, which gives us a prominent position in the outsourced CIO marketplace.", "We were able to add some incremental business from GE, the Alstom business, and I think that just builds a little momentum in the outsourced pension space. We're also doing pretty well on the outsourced \u2013 or the solutions for retail 401 (k)s, target date funds. So I'd say, my summary would be not a particularly great quarter for SSGA. I think the trends are intact. Our focus on ETFs and solutions would be my summary.", "Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.", "And Mike, it's Eric, I'd just add. This is an attractive business for us. ETFs have good price realization relative to the overall price yield in asset management, and that's what's actually been supporting the revenues. And so incumbent upon us to predict \u2013 to continue to invest and make sure those investments bear fruit in ETFs, because not only in the U.S. but around the world, they're here to stay, we have to do is just pick our spots and make sure we do that in areas like smart beta or high-yield fixed income that are more fragmented where we feel like we can build share and the scale at pace to earn good returns.", "Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP", "Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I know you touched on this before, but the enhanced custody business really feels like it's becoming a pretty meaningful driver of securities finance. So, can you elaborate a bit on how meaningful that is in terms of the overall securities finance contribution and the growth and where you'd like to get it to?", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "Sure. I'll start that, Geoffrey. You are right to pick up on that. We've seen steady and consistent growth in our enhanced custody business. I think this quarter it approached 50% of the overall revenues. And as I say, that's been steadily climbing. And I think it's a business that plays right into some of the capital constraints that traditional prime brokers have. And as our clients take on enhanced custody, they tend to deepen relationships over time, pretty stable, pretty steady. So I would see that business continuing to gain share in the credit intermediation space for funds.", "Some of that is in the kind of the long, short type portfolio is probably where it's most prominent. But good business, I think we were a clear innovator four or five years ago and we're now reaping the benefits of that investment.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP", "And apart from the traditional prime brokers, is there any other competition there?", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "No, I'd say that's the typical competition. It's \u2013 you see funds diversifying their credit exposure, which is how we pick up business, new funds being created. No, it's mostly the prime brokers are the other alternative.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP", "Thank you.", "Operator", "There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jay for any closing remarks.", "Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.", "Thanks, Victoria, and thanks everybody for participating this morning.

On our call today, our Chairman and CEO, Jay Hooley, will speak first. Then, Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our Third quarter 2017 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com.

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change.", "Now, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Joseph Hooley", "Good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks, I'd like to take a moment to thank Anthony Ostler, who has moved into a business line role and also to welcome to State Street our new Head of IR, Ilene Fiszel Bieler. Ilene recently joined us and has over 15 years of experience in the financial services industry and is reaching out to those of you she doesn't already know.", "Now, to my remarks, we have delivered another very good quarter. Our third quarter results, including EPS growth and a meaningful increase in return on equity reflect continued strength in equity markets and strong business momentum. We are continuously advancing new product solutions to support our client success, which in turn has helped drive new servicing commitments of $105 billion.", "Importantly, new business opportunities remain robust across both our asset servicing and asset management businesses. We remain well positioned to achieve our 2017 financial goals, including objectives associated with State Street Beacon. Through Beacon initiatives, we are focusing on delivering what matters most to our clients and their clients in less time and with less risk. By improving speed, adding data and analytics capabilities and upgrading client-facing technologies, we are enhancing the end-to-end client experience. While we continue to invest in our business, returning capital to our shareholders remains a key priority.", "In 3Q 2017, we purchased approximately $350 million of our common stock and declared quarterly common stock dividend of $0.42 per share. Now, turning to Slide number 5, I'd like to review some of the progress we made on our strategic priorities and key achievements this quarter. Our core franchise continues to grow. Strength in equity markets and new business lifted our assets under custody and administration to record levels with growth of 10% from third quarter of 2016 to $32.1 trillion.", "And for the first time, we've also exceeded $1 trillion in assets under administration in each of our two offshore businesses, in Luxemburg and Ireland. And as I mentioned, the pipeline remains strong. Our total new business yet to be installed at quarter end was sizeable at $390 billion, which we expect to onboard over the next 18 months. SSgA finished the quarter with $2.7 trillion in assets under management, a 9% increase from the third quarter last year, primarily driven by market appreciation as well as follow-on wins from the acquired GE Asset Management business and higher yielding ETF inflows. It's come primarily from institutional investors.", "Continuing with our focus on new products and solutions, we recently announced the launch of a suite of low-cost SPDR portfolio ETFs, targeted at a new distinct channel to registered investment advisors. To focus on the separate distribution segment, we have partnered with TD Ameritrade, the number-three registered investment advisor platform as their sole distributor or 15 low-cost commission-free ETFs.", "Across the industry, approximately 60% of ETF flows are being directed to this fast growing segment and partnering with a top distributor allows us to expand our delivery through this new channel. Beacon continues to drive scale across our business as we optimize and automate our solutions. For example, in our core U.S. mutual fund segment, which is approximately $7 point trillion in assets, Beacon has enabled us to accelerate the development of capabilities to allow clients to respond to the upcoming SEC modernization requirement, as well as improve the end-of-day pricing process by 20 minutes to 30 minutes.", "In closing, we're committed to achieving our financial goals as reflected by our third quarter operating base year-over-year 27% EPS growth, positive fee and total operating leverage, as well as improving pretax margins, all while turning capital to shareholders and improving our ROE by 2.3 percentage points to 13.4%.", "Now, let me turn the call over to Eric, who will review our financial performance for the third quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2017 and following that we'll take your questions.", "Eric Aboaf", "Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6, where I will start my review of our operating basis results for 3Q 2017.", "EPS for 3Q 2017 increased to $1.71 per share, up 27% from 3Q 2016. Return on equity for the quarter improved to 13.4%, a 2.3 percentage point - 2.3 percentage point higher than last year's third quarter.", "3Q 2017 results reflect continued strength in equity markets and new business activity in both our asset servicing and asset management businesses. 3Q 2017 results also benefited from the rising interest rate environment and disciplined liability pricing, resulting in an expanding NIM and strong NII, which I'll discuss further in a moment.", "3Q 2017 expenses continue to be well controlled, the weaker U.S. dollar added 1% of expense growth relative to 3Q 2016. As a reminder, the currency impact associated with expenses is largely offset in revenues.", "3Q 2017 results also benefitted from a lower than expected tax rate of 28%, primarily due to a higher share of lower tax, foreign earnings, which was worth approximately $0.04 a share.", "We delivered positive operating fee leverage relative to 3Q 2016 as we continue to focus on calibrating expenses relative to the revenue environment. Importantly, pre-tax margin improved meaningfully to 32.9% increasing 2.2 percentage points from 3Q 2016.", "And on a year-to-date basis, we continue to see good progress against our financial goals demonstrated by delivering EPS growth of 21% and 2.7 percentage points of positive fee operating leverage.", "Now let me turn to Slide 7 to briefly review growth of two key drivers. Both, AUCA and AUM increased again this quarter. AUCA of $32.1 trillion, increased 10% from 3Q 2016, growth was driven by a combination of market appreciation and good business momentum. New business activity was particularly strong in EMEA.", "At State Street Global Advisors, AUM increased 9% from 3Q 2016 driven by market appreciation, new business related to the higher yield in GE Asset Management operations and ETF inflows as we continue to expand our franchise, partially offset by continued outflows from lower fee institutional mandates during the quarter.", "Please turn to Slide 8, where I'll primarily focus on 3Q 2017 fee revenue results relative to 3Q 2016. You'll also find additional detail on the appendix with the sequential quarter comparison to 2Q. Overall, fee revenues increased 5% from 3Q 2016, driven by higher equity markets and new business activity. On a sequential basis, overall fee revenues were flat given the usual summer seasonality end markets activity.", "Servicing fees increased 4% and 1% from 3Q 2016 and 2Q 2017 respectively, reflecting higher global equity markets, new business wins particularly in EMEA and the U.S. middle-office services, and the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. These were partially offset by continued outflows from hedge funds, which caused us more than 1% of servicing fee growth on a year-on-year basis, as certain large players in the industry continue to see lower balances. We have seen some signs of this trends starting to moderate.", "Management fees demonstrated strong growth for 3Q 2016 increasing 14% reflecting higher global equity markets, and cash, and ETF flows. Fees were up, excluding the market impact, as lower fee institutional asset outflows were more than offset by better fee ETF and cash inflows as well as new wins from the GE Asset Management operation.", "Trading services revenue decreased from 3Q 2016, primarily due to lower foreign exchange volatility than what we experienced after last year's Brexit vote, partially offset by higher client volumes. We gained market share and real - with Real Money investors moving from number seven to number five in the most recent Euromoney survey.", "Securities finance fees increased from 3Q 2016, primarily due to continued growth in our Enhanced Custody business.", "Moving to Slide 9, NII was up 20% and NIM was up 29 basis points from 3Q 2016. As you can see from the graph momentum in NII continued in 3Q 2017, driven by higher U.S. interest rates and disciplined balance sheet management across major currencies in which we operate.", "On a sequential basis, 3Q 2017 NII and NIM benefitted from realizing a full quarter of the June rate increased and disciplined liability pricing. Notably, U.S. interest bearing client deposit betas remain relatively low around 25%. Deposits decreased sequentially, as we continue to reduce higher cost CDs and non-USC [ph] deposits, and saw the slow rotation of client deposits from non-interest bearing accounts to interest bearing.", "U.S. interest bearing client deposit costs increased by only 5 basis points sequentially. Overall, we're pricing deposits carefully and reducing wholesale CDs, which were down $15 billion year-over-year to manage the size of our balance sheet in line with our January guidance have down 0% to 5% for 2017.", "Now I'll turn to Slide 10 to review 3Q 2017 expenses. 3Q 2017 expenses increased approximately 4% from 3Q 2016 with approximately 1 percentage point of that increase related to foreign currency translation. Excluding the FX impact, the increase in expenses was driven by new business, annual merit and performance based incentive as well as additional investments in technology, partially offset by Beacon related savings and lower professional fees.", "Compensation and employee benefits increased from a year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting increased costs to support new business, annual merit and incentive compensation and the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by Beacon savings. Notably, almost 2 percentage points of the year-over-year increase in compensation benefits was related to a sizeable mandate and which we lifted out a portion of the clients' employees. This is an example of the increasing expenses that we expect during the on-boarding period for some large clients.", "Compared to 3Q 2016, information systems, transaction processing and occupancy costs increase the result of new business and Beacon related investments, other expenses decreased from 3Q 2016, primarily reflecting lower professional services fees.", "3Q 2017 GAAP results also included a pre-tax $33 million Beacon restructuring charge, which will provide payback on average within the next five to six quarters. As compared to 2Q 2017, expenses increased only 1% and were flat excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.", "Let me now turn to Slide 11 to review our progress on State Street Beacon. Beacon remains on track to achieve $550 million in targeted program savings, including at least $140 million in 2017. On the left side of the slide, we show the year-over-year growth benefits and investments related to Beacon. Each quarter we carefully pace the level of investment to consider multi-year initiative, support immediate opportunities and calibrate this to the external environment.", "The net benefit varies each quarter. And in third quarter 2017, we've recognized approximately $35 million in year-over-year expense savings. On a year-to-date basis, we have achieved approximately $100 million in pre-tax expense savings relative to our $140 million target.", "On the right side of the slide, we've broken out the key initiatives and percentage of the relative benefit approximately 70% of the projected growth benefit in 2017 comes from driving scale across our global platform. The balance comes from improving our technology and driving Beacon deeper into our organization. Each year the mix of benefits will change as we identify opportunities for improvement.", "And as I mentioned last quarter, we continue to make good progress expanding Beacon across the organization. We're getting traction with both the corporate functions and SSGA, while we also centralize our procurement and real estate processes.", "Now let's turn to Slide 12 to review our balance sheet and capital position. We continue to maintain a high-quality balance sheet, our investment portfolio is well constructed and diversified, but we've chosen to modestly reduce our credit securities to make room for direct client lending, and to better prepare for our internal stress test and the annual CCAR process.", "We remain focused on returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases, including buying back $350 million of common stock and declaring in dividend of $0.42 in the third quarter. At the same time, we continue to strengthen our capital ratios by retaining income and by optimizing the size of our balance sheet. Specifically, you can see that our Tier 1 leverage ratio increased 90 basis points from last December to 7.4%. Our SLR also increased nicely.", "Moving to Slide 13, I'll update you on where we stand regarding our original and updated financial outlook for full-year 2017 and for fourth quarter. In summary, strong 3Q 2017 and year-to-date results have us well positioned to exceed our 2017 financial target. Year-to-date revenue growth of greater than 8% and fee operating leverage of more than 2.5 percentage points reflect our focus on driving top line growth, while calibrating expenses against the revenue backdrop. This balanced approach in 2017 has resulted in a year-to-date pre-tax margin of almost 31%.", "Based on the strong results, let me provide a brief update on our 4Q 2017 outlook. First, we expect higher 4Q servicing fees to be offset by muted trading revenues compared to third quarter, as we continue to see less market volatility. Overall, we expect to exceed our 2017 full year guidance of 6% to 7% fee revenue growth, and even excluding the gain on a couple of divestitures, we expect to be at the high-end of that range.", "Second, on the expense front, we expect a slight 4Q 2017 increase over third quarter, largely driven by expenses associated with new business activity. 4Q 2017 expenses will also be dependent on the revenue backdrop in the quarter and the onboarding of new clients. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to be at the high end of our full year fee operating leverage guidance of 100 to 200 basis points.", "Third, we expect to see continued NIM expansion 4Q of a few basis points, from bit more asset re-pricing and continued liability management. We also expect a slightly smaller balance sheet as we continue to build capital ratios and prepare for CCAR. We thus expect NII to be relatively flat to 3Q and anticipate that this will put us at the top-end of our full-year NII guidance.", "Lastly, as I mentioned earlier, we expect our 4Q tax rate to increase relative to the third quarter, resulting in a full-year operating basis tax rate near the low-end of our full-year range of 30% to 32%.", "In summary, we're very pleased that both our strong 3Q results and year-to-date performance sets us up well to achieve the higher full year 2017 financial guidance that we discussed in July. Now, let me turn the call back to Jay.", "Joseph Hooley", "Thanks, Eric. Victoria, we will now - we are now available to handle questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Ken Usdin", "Thanks, good morning. Hey, Eric, I was wondering if you could just talk us through some of the balance sheet permutations. I know you've been purposely trying to get the leverage ratio up going into CCAR 2018 versus where it was a year ago. Going into the fourth quarter at 7.4%, can you just talk to us about how you're trying to still hold back the rate of growth in the overall balance sheet and what we should expect for the mix going forward?", "Eric Aboaf", "Sure, Ken. Let me give you a little context. I think a year-and-a-half, two years ago, we made a - decided choice to reduce the size of the balance sheet and bring deposits down to the tune of $20 billion to $25 billion. I think it's an ongoing process and we saw a little bit of a tick up towards the end of last year during third quarter and fourth quarter, which is why we signaled in January that we wanted to bring the balance sheet to trend it back down.", "And I think we're making good headway. You saw that fourth quarter last year our balance sheet was about 5% higher than it is now. So we feel like we made good progress, our tier 1 leverage, which tends to be our binding constraint under CCAR and some of the stress test, was that 6.5%. And the kind of the work that we've done, both with clients and then with non-client deposits, including the CD book that, that we had built several years back has really positioned us well now with a tier 1 leverage ratio of 7.4%.", "Going into the fourth quarter, I think those efforts continue. Nothing dramatic, but we continue to expect a mild trend downwards as the - as we continue to unwind the CD book, as we continue to compress the current - a couple of higher cost deposit areas. And our view is that, it will set us up well for the coming year. And then it's - to be honest, it sets us up well for growing naturally, right, over the course of the coming years, as AUCA grows at a nice pace between market and new business wins, clients expect to be able to leave a little more deposits each year with us and I think we'll kind of get back into more of a business as usual mode at that point.", "Ken Usdin", "Got it. And my second questions, just on the U.S./non-U.S. point, you've had the benefits of the currency mismatch and then you have the swap that kind of works that out. Can you just help us understand if the BOE and ECB, who have been getting more hawkish start to hike rates? How will that actually flow through the NIM and net interest income?", "Eric Aboaf", "Hey, Ken, it's certainly something on our minds, right, because the U.S. has clearly moved 4 times over the last year, which we're quite pleased to see. The Bank of England is starting to signal and market expectations are probably a bit better than half that they'll move. It's been moving around. And the ECB is really talking about - at some point slowing down their expansionary policy. I think for the way to think about it, is about half of our net NII interest rate exposure to rising rates within the U.S. and the other half is in international markets which is primarily sterling and euros.", "You saw us take up NII just from rising rates in the U.S. by $20 million to $25 million a quarter. So it's sizable and if you think about - sterling will help a little bit if it moves and euros even more. But you could see, as and when that happens, I think some more NIM expansion, which would be a good result.", "Ken Usdin", "Got it. Thanks, Eric.", "Eric Aboaf", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.", "James Mitchell", "Hey, good morning. Maybe we could just talk a little bit about the fee rate. I appreciate the color on hedge funds. I think even if we think about adding the 1% drag back, AUCA was up 10%, fees were up, say, normalized 5%, if normalized for hedge funds. Do we see - I know ETFs have been a growth area that's probably lower margin. But is there some sense that we could start to see those move more in tandem at some point going forward?", "Joseph Hooley", "Hey, Jim, this is Jay. Let me start that one. I'll let Eric jump in. So the one thing I guess I'd just reorient you to is the third quarter 2017 versus 2016 up 4%, year-to-date up 4%. Third quarter little bit of a softer quarter from a service fee standpoint. I'd say, I'd point to a couple of things, one, the mix which you mentioned is mixed and you see - in the U.S., you see U.S. fund outflows offset by ETF inflows, almost one for one if you look at the industry.", "And then if you - we reference hedge funds, which continue to see outflows, although industry data would suggest maybe that has hit the tipping point. We haven't yet seen that in our book, but were - a pretty good reflection of the overall hedge fund industry. And if you go outside the U.S., I'd point to, Eric mentioned that in his comments, EMEA, or more specifically Europe played out through the offshore centers of Ireland and Luxembourg, continue to see very strong flows, which is a mix of long-only product hedge and ETFs as well.", "So I would say the mix has been pretty consistently like that. I wouldn't read anything into the quarter itself. I look more on the year-on-year to look at the reflection of kind of the service fees. The only thing I would add before I ask Eric if he wants to add to this is the - the pipeline is good. It's good. It's well diversified. And it's probably proportionately a little heavier in big deal activity, which you know for me is a reflection of more folks looking to consolidate work among fewer custodians, and an interest in doing a deeper level of outsourcing, think about middle office is one component of that. So I'd say, generally, pretty steady as it goes. I don't know what you'd add to that.", "Eric Aboaf", "Yeah, Jim, I'd just add on the fee rate. Just remember, this isn't the - the servicing business is a little different than the asset management business, in asset management the fee rates are linear, right, as you add more assets you get automatically higher revenues in services. You kind of get 10% higher market. AUCAs is only 3% in equity. It's 10% [ph] and 1% [ph] in fixed income. So you kind of have that denominator effect. And then you have the mix of whether it's hedge funds, whether it's emerging markets are at higher rates than the U.S. and so on and so forth.", "So I think the way we think about the fee rate is it's something to track, because the question is, as Jay described, are you doing more business with clients, more business with existing clients and the more business you do with existing clients tends to offset the mathematical reduction you'll get in fee rates just from the way the numerator and denominator work through.", "James Mitchell", "Okay, well, that's all helpful color. And maybe just my second question, Eric, you've been now at State Street for a little while. What's your sense of Project Beacon? Do you feel like there is - are there any more opportunities as you look into this more over the course of the next few years or do you feel like it is good target or an easy target, trying to get a sense of - your sense of the expense line as you dig into it?", "Eric Aboaf", "Yeah, Jim, I think the - my perspective on Project Beacon, like you say, I've dug into it now. I've dug into it at a couple of levels of details as you'd expect and it's something that Jay and Mike initiated a couple of years back and really was a follow on to that original ITOT effort. I have a lot of confidence to be honest that there is a lot to do. And why is that, because we run a servicing process and system that has become more and more automated over time.", "But you remember, we take on very large mandates from very large asset managers, pension funds, insurance companies. And they usually hand them over to us in a fairly bespoken customized manner. And they like it when we execute on them in that basis. And so, there is a lot of work to do as you march across one large client to the next large client, to the group of medium sized clients, as you march around the world to continue automate and digitize and simplify those processes over time. And so, as I looked underneath, Beacon isn't one effort, right, it's actually dozens and dozens of effort.", "So there is a lot there. And I think it will be something that we keep at. We originally announced it as a four, five-year program. I think our view is Beacon will continue, right, because it's got to be part of our DNA and how we manage the business. And then I think I did say in my prepared remarks, there are also new areas of Beacon that we continue to push on, whether it's the corporate functions, right. We spend a $1.3 billion or so of our $8 billion expense base in the corporate functions and so that needs to be under scrutiny as well, carefully, but under scrutiny.", "Ron O'Hanley is driving Beacon into the asset management business. So there is always more to do and I think we see good opportunities in the coming years.", "James Mitchell", "Okay. Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.", "Glenn Schorr", "Hi, thank you. Quickly on the assets under custody and administration, the insurance and other products is down another 5% in the quarter. The markets have been doing good, something unique in the quarter to point out?", "Eric Aboaf", "Yeah, Glenn, it's Eric, and I think for the others on the phone, I think you're pointing to the supplemental information package on the assets under custody are on Page 7. There is actually nothing significant going on with the insurance clients. I think the line you're looking at, which is the fourth one down, is actually - has three sub-lines, got insurance, got private equity and it's got other - insurance and private equity are actually flat sequentially, so some upticks offsetting some - just the usual movement.", "And then the other line which you kind of can see underneath the surface is more volatile and that's due to timing of installations. What effectively happens as we bring on new business, right it gets categorized in other and then you need to do a detailed categorization up into the lines above and that just plays over a couple of months. So you've seen this - I think we've seen this volatility a little bit before and just think of it as classification volatility, nothing more than that.", "Glenn Schorr", "Okay, okay, and then quickly on balance sheet, I noticed, the rate paid on your U.S. deposits is down the last couple of quarters, which is also in a raising rate environment. I'm just curious if you could talk towards how you manage that dialogue and what type of clients that is.", "Eric Aboaf", "Sure. Glenn, there's a couple of things in the U.S. deposits on the average interest earning balance sheets, right? There is the - I'll call core client deposits and then there is the wholesale CD book that we had built up to the tune of a bit over $15 billion year-and-a-half, two years ago. So what's happening on that line is you actually see a mix effect. As the CD book comes down, the overall rate paid on total U.S. deposits is coming down.", "And that's offsetting the slight increase that we're seeing quarter-on-quarter, as we adjust rates up a little bit every time the Fed has moved. If you wanted to unbundle that the cost of deposits for just the U.S. client deposits is up 5 basis points, right, against a 25 basis points move in at the Fed and that's where we - that's how we quote the beta of 25%.", "So kind of it's moving up exactly as we would have expected at this - given the external dynamics.", "Glenn Schorr", "Awesome. Thanks, Eric.", "Eric Aboaf", "Yeah. My pleasure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.", "Alexander Blostein", "Hey, good morning, everybody. So I had a follow-up around just the servicing business either for Jay or Eric. Totally get the fee rate dynamic, obviously more of an output and as we've learnt over the years. But I guess taken a step back given the mix shift dynamic with hedge funds. The BlockRock issue coming up, I guess, next year with some of the loss business, but then clearly some positives on the non-U.S. side, et cetera. Holding kind of market's effects flat, what do you guys see as a reasonable organic growth for the servicing fee revenues over the next couple of years?", "Eric Aboaf", "Alex, it's Eric. It's hard to tell precisely, which is why we have - we've stuck to our general view that we should focus on overall fee growth, we said 6% to 7% now that was up from 4% to 6%, there is obviously some market movement in there. You see the - I think, if you want to dive down into servicing fees specifically, you see those were up 2% on a currency adjusted basis year-on-year, and up 4% year-to-date, right. And so the - in our mind 4% for a little more representative.", "Now clearly, there's a number of factors in there, right. There is some market appreciation, there's some inflows and outflows, and we called out more than a percentage point from the hedge fund business, there is some amount of new business activity, and then there's a very important amount of expanding activity with existing business, and then there's a little bit fee headwinds, more or less than we've seen before, but it's always been a little bit of that over the last couple of decade.", "So it's - I think, it's hard to be precise and part of what we're trying to navigate through is, we're always looking at what business can we bring on, at what fee rate. But in particular at what margin, right, because it's the margin that really matters at the end of the day.", "And then, as we think about new business at the right margin, and then, we kind of get to fee operating leverage, and we feel like we have a business system that is remunerative. So anyway hopefully that's enough guidance to start.", "Alexander Blostein", "Got it. Thanks. And just quick follow-up around the NIM and the balance sheet dynamic. So clearly, very nice job on kind of remixing the funding and optimizing the strategy a bit, it sounds like there is a little bit more to do here in the fourth quarter as well. But also taking to step back kind of assuming the composition of the funding structures in place more or less so in the U.S. now, how should we think about the kind of NIM sensitivity to next - to near future funds and hikes given kind of changes we saw on the funding side now?", "Eric Aboaf", "Sure, Alex. Let me - it's Eric, let me continue. I think, we're comfortable with our NIM sensitivity and in particular the position where we expand NII in the rising rate environment. I think, we've done - we've captured that benefit in the U.S. for the first three or four hikes, and that's been quite positive for us, and has helped us buoy NIM, but also margins and ROEs, that's important.", "I think, we'd like some amount of NIM sensitivity for the U.S. going forward, if we got a December hike, then we might as well stay open, right on from a rate position. And I think the Fed has signaled they want to get to - maybe not 3% terminal Fed funds, but two and three quarters. And we feel like, there is a big distance between now and then. And you remember the opportunity cost of running an open sensitive position to rising rates for us. As a custody bank is not very high, because at the front end of the curve, right? The front end of the curve is not particularly steep. So anyway long way to say that I think we'd like the open position in the U.S., we talked on one of the earlier questions being open in sterling and in euros, is helpful. It doesn't mean that if the 10-year doesn't spike up or we see some volatility where we have some nice uptick. We invest a little bit, but I think directionally we like the open position to rising rates.", "Alexander Blostein", "Got you. I understood. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.", "Brennan Hawken", "Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So first, Glenn had asked about the U.S. deposit costs, which you walked through nice, Eric. Thank you. On the non-U.S. side though, I think, if we adjust for the FX swap costs, we saw pretty decent pickup in the deposit costs there. Could you - number one, is that right? And then, if it is could you maybe walk through us going on there? Thanks.", "Eric Aboaf", "Yeah, I think on the international - what we've called the non-U.S. deposits on the interest bearing schedule, which is the Page 13, the math you'll want to do is to isolate the FX swap, which we put in the footnote, because remember the currency swaps, while they're tied the deposits from an accounting standpoint are offset on the interest earning asset size primarily they're in the deposits of the banks or in securities that we hold.", "If you were to, though - and if you do that math and we're happy to follow-up Brennan, as a - to help out with that. And you were to strip out the currency swaps, the change on the international side is, I think, literally 1 or 2 basis points, so it's relatively flat and within the scheme of what you'd have in any particular quarter. So we're not seeing much there, and we don't expect to see much there until either the Bank of England moves or ECB moves. And what I think it'd be a good day when that happen to be honest.", "Brennan Hawken", "Sure, sure. Thanks. I'll follow-up on the math there. Another question on the deposit front would be non-interest bearing, we saw that decline. I think, you spoke about how there was some remixing and some clients that were rotating out of the non-interest bearing and into the interest bearing side. Do you guys have any view about ultimately where that might end up shaking out with the mix or look like non-interest bearing to interest bearing. How should we think about that going forward? Thanks a lot.", "Joseph Hooley", "Sure, Brennan. I think, you are - what you've seen so far is actually even better or kind of within expectations or even a bit better, right. We saw a pretty slight $2 billion move out of non-interest bearing, which actually all ended up in interest bearing, when we actually did the detail tracking. And that's well within the bounds, it actually continues to positively surprise, how little has actually moved. And in truth if it moves, it's not that big of a deal. A couple billion a quarter would not be - is kind of well within, in fact it continues to be below expectations.", "In terms of terminal questions sort of where does it go, I got to say really hard to predict, I think, we don't see a fast move. So the question is, what's the - how much does it move and at what pace. And you've seen some - you've our results here, which are down just $2 billion quarter-on-quarter and about twice that year-on-year. I think, you've seen some of the industry results, which are probably a little bit more than that, but I think we fared well.", "And so it's hard to say, what that's going to be, I think you can look at the long range percentages of non-interest bearing to what the interest bearing. That's said, I think, pricing is different in this cycle, because we are pricing more adroitly for different types of deposits, right. Deposits that our LCR valuable, those that our non-LCR valuable. So I'm not giving you a sharp answer, because I think there is a range of results, and our view is, we should just work closely with our clients and to the extent they have a little bit in those pools. We'll help them, adjust them if they'd like to at the right time.", "Brennan Hawken", "Okay. Thanks for the color, Eric.", "Eric Aboaf", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Lynn Graseck", "Hi, good morning.", "Joseph Hooley", "Good morning. Go ahead, Betsy.", "Betsy Lynn Graseck", "Hi, good morning. Hi. Question on the outlook. I know that on Page 13 of the slide deck, you reiterated the guidance you gave in 2Q 2017 call. But then at the end of this call, you were highlighting that you thought you would exceed the 6% to 7% total fee growth range. Can you just give me a sense as to whether or not you're anticipating that full year could actually come above the high end of the range you've got here? Maybe you could speak a little bit to the operating leverage that you're looking for in the quarter.", "Eric Aboaf", "Sure. Betsy, it's Eric. Let me start. I think, we feel good about the results overall on fee growth year-to-date. A little bit - bounce around a little bit quarter by quarter. But the way we've described this is that we feel like, on a full year basis for fees, which have been running about 8% year-to-date, we're going to be over the 6% to 7%. I think, I also said that if you wanted to put aside the BlockCross sale and the other first quarter IFDS, BFDS transfer agency sale, that if you put those ex slide, you're closer to the top end of the 7% range. And so it just gives you a little bit of data by which to calibrate what we expect.", "Betsy Lynn Graseck", "Okay. So your Page 13 is more organic versus - the results will be obviously organic plus some inorganic activity. Is that fair to say?", "Eric Aboaf", "Yeah, that's a good way to frame it.", "Betsy Lynn Graseck", "Okay. And then, the follow-up is just on the SLR in the prefs. If the rule changes with SLR and we're - you are able to eliminate cash or reduce cash in the denominator of the SLR, is there any action you can take on your outstanding prefs? Or do you have to wait for them to mature?", "Eric Aboaf", "It's Eric again. There - each of the series of prefs that we have out there, and there are several have a call date. The call date was typically five years out from the original issuances. So I think, there is some calls coming through over the next 12 to 18 months. And it actually gives us, I think, a nice bit of flexibility. So I think what we put out there was good at the time. And if the rules change, we can always adjust a bit.", "Betsy Lynn Graseck", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Mike Mayo", "Hi, I have one question about a negative trend and one question about a positive one. So the negative would be foreign exchange. It stays - it's staying very low. And do you see any change in that? And if volatility were to increase, say, 10%, what's the sensitivity of those revenues? And also, I - just on the topic of foreign impact. Emerging market asset values were up 8% quarter-over-quarter and I thought that would have had more of a positive effect on your custody fees.", "Eric Aboaf", "Sure, Mike. It's Eric. Let me start on both of those. So first, on foreign exchange trading. I think there's just some evolution here given the volatility that we're seeing in the marketplace, right. And that's primarily what we attribute the changes to. If you recall, we had a particularly strong second quarter as we saw a very large shift to emerging markets. Emerging markets have typically much higher volatility and much wider spreads wider spreads, and I think we took full advantage of that in 2Q.", "And then a year ago, obviously, we had the backdrop of Brexit. So we're just seeing a lower level of volatility, and I think we're cautious. Underneath that market-driven kind of environment, though, we're seeing good volume growth - we're seeing good volume growth in developed markets. We've been drilling down. We've seen good volume growth in emerging markets. You see some of the results from the Euromoney survey, which isn't perfect, but it's indicative.", "And so we're actually, I think, quite pleased, and our view is if volatility comes back, we'll see some uptick. Hard to give you a percentage uptick. I'd do more of - 2Q was a standout. You can look at how much volatility spiked and kind of do some math, and we're happy to kind of be a sounding board for you as you do that. So I think what we're focused on is building that franchise. The franchise has been building. It feels like it's - by our estimate, it's picking up 0.5 point to a percentage point of market share over the last year or two, which in FX is actually significant.", "Maybe to the second question, on servicing fees, yeah, the equity markets were up nicely. Remember, bond market is not so much, alternative markets were kind of still are relatively flattish. So you got to do a weighted average kind of math here on the market indicators. That's why in the press release we actually give you a table of six different indicators, because it's a mix of those that really affect our business.", "And then, over and above that, there is the mix, how much are we taking on in ETF versus mutual funds, how much in the U.S., emerging markets. And so, the math kind of just moves around quite a bit, which is why we're focused both on a quarter but also on a year-to-date basis. And just we're kind of navigating through as we go here.", "Mike Mayo", "And then the other question, management fees are up quite nicely linked quarter and year-over-year. What's happening in asset management and with the GE acquisition? And would you consider more asset management acquisitions?", "Joseph Hooley", "Let me start that one, Mike. This is Jay. It's a factor of really shifting out of lower-revenue-generating assets and into higher-generating revenue assets. So if you look at SSgA in the third quarter, which had a net $25 billion in outflows, $40 billion, went out of largely passive institutional mandates, which has been a bit of a trend. And on the other side, you saw $12 billion into positive flows into cash, and $2 billion, positive flows into ETF. It's out of the lower revenue into the higher revenue, which results in management fees up 14% and AUMs up 9%.", "And that's not a one-quarter trend. We continue to see that, and it's been part of our strategy to focus on the higher-revenue-generating asset pools. I don't know if you'd add anything to that.", "Eric Aboaf", "Yeah, I think it's a good result and you mentioned GE. Even there, we've bought it on. We've gone to accretion sooner than expected by a quarter. So that was, I think, good work by the team. But we also added some of the - some additional mandates, in particular some of the GE UK pension, the OSRAM [ph] pension and so it's been a nice platform and a good result.", "I think you also asked about acquisitions. Let me maybe start there, Jay will probably weigh in, too. But we like this, the kind of tuck-in asset management space, it's attractive. The accretion works out pretty well. Given the relative PEs of ours versus the asset management space, that was a nice size deal. And so clearly, they've come up from time to time, but it's certainly a good use of capital from our standpoint.", "Joseph Hooley", "Yeah, I'd agree with all that, Mike, and I would say that if you look at where the gaps are and our asset management capabilities, we've got a bunch of gaps on the fixed-income side, a little bit on the equity and alternatives side. So to the extent that we can backfill those gaps, it makes us a more relevant player on the solutions space. I might just go one other place, Mike, on the asset management, which is, we recently announced that we were entering the low-cost ETF marketplace, and organically, although with a partner.", "The ETFs, 60% of ETF flows over some period of time have been on this low-cost ETF space, and State Street really hasn't participated because we haven't had the access to retail distribution. And so, we think it's a good move to enter a new distribution channel by taking 15 of our ETFs, translating them into low fees in concert with the TD Ameritrade partnership. TD is the third largest retail distributor. So it takes the ETFs, repurposes a handful of them, very low revenue give-up and positions us into this part of the market that's driving 60% of the flow.", "So not acquisitions we made there, but we do think that fills out a segment of the distribution market that we haven't been present in, and we think this enables that.", "Mike Mayo", "Well, we'll watch that. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Oh, good morning, thank you for taking the question. Maybe the first one on the operating basis EPS number. Perhaps you could remind us the logic for stripping out the restructuring charges, which feel like they occur to a greater or lesser degree most quarters but not stripping out something like the BlockCross gain on the business sale.", "And then any thoughts about whether it makes sense to continue posting operating EPS or switch away to GAAP, which is what most banks do?", "Eric Aboaf", "Geoffrey, it's Eric. Let me take that and I think you and I talked about that, and I certainly got a lot of feedback as I started back in December and January. I do agree that over time, GAAP results are something that we want to move towards. I think as you know, we've run a mix of both operating and GAAP results, we show them both so you can kind of see them both ways, so there are no surprises.", "I think what you've seen me do this year so far is actually narrow the difference, and we've done that both on some positives and some negatives together. And I think you can always kind of find one thing or another to add back. But I think what we'd like to do is move to a more standard presentation, and you'll see us doing that in the coming time periods. I just need to make sure that we're all - we design that well and we also do that with you all in mind so that it doesn't fluctuate with your models.", "I will say that we will want, though, to continue to be able to identify some of the restructuring charges not because we shouldn't include them in the GAAP results or the final tally of how we do. But one of the reasons we have carved them out and carved them out of operating is actually just so that you can see the underlying momentum of the business and expense management and not color that with whether a charge is $35 million or $70 million in another quarter.", "And so, we're just conscious that. I guess, the way I'd say is either way you are going to need to see the information. But because we are going to continue to optimize the business and drive Beacon, right, where are going to take a series of - I don't think it will be - well, series of expected charges. And we just want to make sure those are out there and everyone's expecting those.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Thanks, very helpful. And then, on the Ameritrade partnership, I noticed a few of the ETFs there are shifting to self-indexing. Do you think there is a longer-term trend there towards self-indexing to reduce the cost of ETFs? Is that going to be something that we see more of?", "Joseph Hooley", "Geoffrey, this is Jay. Yes, I do think though. I think that in a world of low cost ETFs where every expense line matter to the extent that you can internalize or create some synthetic of an index or create your own indexing. I do see that as a trend, not just for State Street, but for others.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Good morning, guys.", "Joseph Hooley", "Good morning.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Hi, Jay. I had to jump off the call for a minute, so I apologize if I you had addressed these questions. But the first question is, obviously, you've started to restructure the liability side of the balance sheet, as you mentioned. I noticed the non-interest-bearing deposits in the quarter fell to about $39.7 billion on an average basis from $42.2 billion in the prior quarter and about $44 billion last year.", "Aside from the obvious, interest rates are higher, were there any other factors that drove the non-interest-bearing deposits down.", "Eric Aboaf", "Gerard, it's Eric. No, it's literally an interest rate effect and clients are conscious of what accounts they have. They typically have multiple accounts, right, sometimes for the various fund family, sometimes geographically and sometimes just for operational purposes or preferences. But this is the moment that we've seen, which is kind of 5%, 6% in the quarter, we think, it's pretty modest given that the Fed moved, in effect, 25 basis points here. So nothing more than rates and kind of all within the bounds if not even less of a move than we would have expected at this point in the cycle.", "Gerard Cassidy", "If the Fed continues to raise rates, should we expect this line to continue on this kind of rate of decline? Or should it slow down, accelerate?", "Eric Aboaf", "Very hard to predict, right. We - the kind of the structure of what exists out there for clients to hold in terms of deposits versus money market funds versus prime money market funds, right, they're kind of options that has changed since the last set of rate increases more than a decade ago. I think for kind of a general view, I think this pace feels about right for the time being, but there could be a range of results around that. But this pace feels realistic as we see rate raises play through.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Great. And then my second question, I know this is not a significant part of the balance sheet, but in the other interest earning assets for the quarter of $23 billion, you had a nice jump from the second quarter yield from 76 basis points to 118. Okay, any color behind what drove that nice improvement.", "Eric Aboaf", "Yes, the other interest earning assets will include the Enhanced Custody activity, right, which is part of the sec finance business. And so as that - as we expand that business, we get paid both on the interest rate line as well as in fees.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.", "Brian Bedell", "Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question. Eric, just on that last one, maybe if you can differentiate what's happening with the repurchased securities line. I think that went up 97 basis points on a core basis. And then the Enhanced Custody dynamic on the other interest earning asset line, and if you can sort of parse out the Enhanced Custody contribution to that other line, that'd be great.", "Eric Aboaf", "Sure. Yeah, let me do those in reverse order. I think the - in interest earning assets - or other interest earning assets, which is about $23 billion, I think the large majority is Enhanced Custody and then you have a little bit of derivative balances and some of the other knits and gnats there. And so that's what's happening, and kind of underneath that in other interest earning assets, you'll find that derivative balances move around, but Enhanced Custody has actually been just moving up at a regular pace.", "And I think we can expect some amount of expansion there as we continue to grow the business at a modest pace, and you saw it up 8% year-on-year on revenue side, and I think we kind of - we think about the balance sheet scales accordingly. In terms of the securities purchase for resale agreements, right, the repo line, I'll just remind you that what you have in there is the on-balance sheet repo and reverse book.", "And then, the piece that is run through that FIC [ph] program or the - effectively sponsor a client, but it's the client's actual position and risk. We disclosed that in the footnotes and pretty well. I think what you'll see, as those rates continue - will continue to tick up in line with prevailing interest rates. So as the Fed moves, you've got movement in Fed funds, you've got movement in general collateral repo rates. And so what you're literally seeing is just the movement in market rates play through that activity.", "Brian Bedell", "Okay, okay, thanks. And then, maybe just to go back to the security servicing. I know, it's been asked - and I appreciate all your detail on it. But if we just think about sort of how the new business trends are coming forward, and maybe if, Jay, you can chime in on this as well, but with the shift towards ETFs, and I think, Jay, you mentioned some larger pieces of new business in the potential pipeline.", "How should we think about that fee rate going forward? It looks like, of course, it's kind of dropped down sort of in a trough level in the third quarter. I was just trying to sense if that's a little bit of an abnormal drop. And - or do see that rates sort of being a good sort of go forward?", "Joseph Hooley", "Let me start that one, Brian. Let me start with your question about - I interpret it as being pipeline and activity in the marketplace, which, as I would say, quite good, quite diversified, proportionately more kind of big deal activities, and as I referenced a minute ago, I think that to me, it stands for firms in the asset management industry that are looking to get more efficient, looking to create more front-to-back straight through processing, and therefore consolidating with fewer providers.", "There's a - it's rare that these big deals don't happen today without middle office, something that you know well as a component of that, we view that as all quite positive, because the deeper you get into the middle and front office, the more differentiated we are, particularly if you had to that multi-geographies. And therefore pricing - better pricing goes along with that.", "So I would say that deal activity, deal pipeline quite good. I'd also call your attention to we've got a little bit higher pipeline of deals committed, but not yet installed at just under $400 billion, which we'll roll in over the next 18 months. I'd say that when I add all that up, I look at 4% kind of year-to-date service fee revenue growth, 4% quarter-on-quarter. That feels to me more like a number you should focus on in the quarter itself and the sequential effects of that. And would you had anything to add, Eric?", "Eric Aboaf", "I just add that we do feel good about the momentum of business. We're trying to be clear about that notwithstanding the lumpiness that you get quarter-to-quarter. And so we have some confidence, because we do have some visibility. Obviously, in what's the backlog, what's coming from the pipeline, and so forth.", "On the fee rate specifically, I'll just remind you that as we add new wins, right, if we add - if we had the custody business for a big firm, and remember we have 40% share in the U.S. asset managers and the mutual fund business, right, if we had a custody and we're adding the accounting, right, you get fees with no incremental AUCA.", "So you kind of get a positive effect on the fee rate. If instead what we're doing is, if we had half the book and somebody consolidating it, right, and had half of the custody book, and now you're adding the other half of the custody book. You're actually adding both a numerator and a denominator. So there's a lot going on there, which is why I think the fee rate's indicative.", "But I'll just - it's indicative, but I think there's a lot going on in terms of whether you're expanding new clients, share of wallet with existing clients, and then all the ins and outs of geography and product type.", "Brian Bedell", "And then you mentioned you focus on the profitability, obviously, and improving that. For the some of these new deals that are in the pipeline, and how should we think about the on-boarding expense run rate? Should that be a little bit lumpy and high initially before we get to bring those in or more sort of this the same pattern?", "Eric Aboaf", "Yeah, it's Eric. I think, it depends on the deal sizes. So I think the small and medium sized deals, you kind of just roll into, and there's nothing particularly significant. I think with the larger deals, it depends how they're structured. And so we called out one from the middle of last year, and what regionally came over was literally a lift-out of business activity with rent costs, and people costs, and technology.", "When you get them that way, you often get them with a TSA, because they literally can't move all the sub-pieces. And so it comes over as a step change. And then what happens is that you then convert from the TSA to the actual line items, right. But as you're doing that, you're effectively digesting. So you might take on 400 people, which is kind of a percentage point of additional headcount.", "We know that we won't operate it that way in the subsequent years, but that's how we need to take it on. So kind of the bigger the deals, and I guess, we'll describe as we have big deals or - from time-to-time, we'll describe whether there are step changes, I don't think they are - they're enough to disrupt the full year expense growth story, but on a - and kind of trend. But on a quarter - a one quarter basis, there may be a little more or a little less.", "And so I point to this quarter. Sequentially, we had no growth in expenses when you adjust for currency, right, and that's because there wasn't any big deals just coming in, in a lumpy way. In another quarter, you might easily put in for a percentage point of expense growth, because they were a big enough deal in a particular quarter. And so it's that kind of dynamic or range that we're talking about.", "Brian Bedell", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Eric Aboaf", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.", "Marty Mosby", "Thanks. I had a one very particular question, one big picture question. But Eric, first, the tax rate dropped off considerably this particular quarter to one of the lowest levels we've seen in several years. The explanation really doesn't talk about discrete benefits, but says it's really mix and energy investment. How would that cause a temporary kind of downdraft? Those things seem more permanent, whereas if you look at the guidance, you're saying it's going to bounce back up to the 30% kind of level?", "Eric Aboaf", "Marty, it's Eric. I've learned to love taxes over the years given how they come in and the lumpiness versus the non-lumpiness. What happens during the year, if you remember, is there are also re-forecasts of expectations with regard to the full year, because you have to set your tax rate based on the full-year expectation of your earnings. And so what happened this quarter is, as we saw more foreign earnings than U.S. earnings in the current quarter and expectations for that to continue into fourth quarter, you effectively have to reset your tax rate to that amount and effectively do a version of what feels like a catch-up.", "So I think that's probably the best way to explain it, and I'm happy to take a little time off line. But it was - it creates a lumpy catch-up in the particular quarter there. I think on a year-to-date basis, we're running a little north of 29% on the tax rate, and I think we're - we still think we'll end up somewhere around the low end of the range - near the low end of the range that we've described.", "Marty Mosby", "So more of a permanent improvement as you move forward, putting it at the lower end of the range that makes that consistent. And then Jay and Eric, I have a bigger picture question in the sense that there's been a lot of talk over - since the financial crisis and recession that the trust business model was just broken. There was things that were falling off, and that you would never recreate profitability like you did it back in the golden days. If you kind of look at what you're doing, as soon as rates are starting to come off the floor, your returns are returning to, if not the highs, pretty close to that.", "So you're getting within reach of - now you're well into the middle 13s, 14, 15 is kind of upper end of that range. So you see rates driving you back to that. So was there really anything broke about the model other than just interest rates are really low and now we're getting that benefit back?", "Joseph Hooley", "Yeah, I would say - This is Jay, Marty. I would say that nothing was broke, but a lot has changed. When I think back 10, 12 years, and I look at the upward slope of things like mutual fund flows, ETFs weren't even in the frame yet, I looked at a time when there was a fair amount of revenue generated in the market base revenues, foreign exchange, securities lending, net interest revenue, as you talk about, I think that from then to now, the business of asset servicing, asset ownership has become more challenging. Returns are a little bit more difficult.", "So as we being a downstream - having downstream effect of that, we've had to change our operating model to be much more focused on creating efficiencies, creating straight-through processing, which - and also moving our business model from the back office to the middle office, heading to the front office, I might add. The value that customers see and what we provide on the servicing side today is much more around the data and analytics, which is why we're investing so deeply into Beacon because it's moving to a place where our ability to aggregate custodian data, inform it with data and analytics allows our customers to compete more effectively.", "So I think that another backdrop comment I would make is that, if you look at the world as we see it, which is not a North American, but a global world, our estimate is gross assets are growing in the 6%-ish range. So the asset pools are up, but they've shifted from traditional products to ETFs, solutions, all of which requires a higher level of sophisticated technology to support our customers' needs in the future.", "So I'm as bullish as I've ever been about our prospect and outlook from a standpoint of meeting our financial targets, but the underlying business has changed. And I think it provides a firm like State Street with a clear path to further distinguishing and differentiating ourselves as we move to middle, front office data and analytics informed by Beacon.", "Marty Mosby", "I guess, Jay, what I'm looking at is if you do all those changes what you've done in the operating model and expenses, and then you look at really at the bottom line, 80% of the your bottom line comes from net interest income. So everything else kind of nets out and it reminds me much of what we used to have in mortgage servicing where we did a lot of work. There is a lot of fees. The business always changed, always adapted to that. But at the end of the day, escrow balances was where we got our profitability.", "So I'm just wondering if at the end of the day that those deposits really are where the value comes and it produces a majority of what you see in the actual pre-tax income.", "Eric Aboaf", "Marty, it's Eric. I'd just be a little cautious about going as far as you're going. But remember, you didn't have a custodial asset. There will be no reason for client to hold deposits with you. If you didn't have a custodial asset, they wouldn't hold your current - foreign currency trade with you. If you didn't have a custodial asset, you couldn't do custody accounting administration, front office data analytics, so highly inter-dependent business.", "And does how you get paid adjust and evolve over time? Maybe, but our perspective I think is we should make sure we need - we understand well how we get paid in that business and make sure we get paid fairly. I think you saw returns on equity north of 13% this quarter, you've seen us do that a couple of quarters here.", "Return on tangible common equity, which is a traditional bank measure is like in the 19% range. I mean, pretty - I don't know what the golden era was like that you refer to, but it's pretty attractive returns for an institution here with very nice EPS growth.", "Marty Mosby", "Now, on you returning to those golden age kind of return is what I was getting at as all it took was rates. But, yeah, I appreciate the time you spent on it. We'll talk about it little bit more offline.", "Eric Aboaf", "Good. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America.", "Michael Carrier", "Thanks, guys. Just one quick one here. Just on the servicing, maybe the overall relationship. Thanks for the color on the quarter, just on the products and asset classes. But it does seem like the clients are under more pressure, whether it's them facing fee pressure, new regulations. I just wanted to get an update like when you think about the other like offerings that you have, we look at one line item, but obviously you can generate revenues in other areas.", "So I don't know if you have any update on how that shifted over time with the clients, the number of products and services that are being used. And then probably most importantly, given what you guys are doing on Beacon, like the incremental margin on clients today versus maybe three or four years ago before you went down this path, just so we can kind of get more of a holistic view versus just the one part of the business.", "Joseph Hooley", "Yeah, Mike, this is Jay. Thanks for the question, the - it's a good question, because in addition to the traditional packaging in the servicing business of accounting and custody, augmented by foreign exchange, trading and securities lending, more recently Enhanced Custody. I would say the package has been enhanced recently with - I mentioned, middle-office, which is where almost 24 years into middle-office, we were the pioneers and still the market leader by a long stretch.", "As clients, as you rightly point out are faced with more pressure. There is more consolidation of providers, but the value they see is, now into the middle-office, our ability to aggregate custodian data and provide them a platform for front-office analytics. All the other stuff are still relevant, with the trading, the lending. But increasingly, the value proposition is in that middle and front office data aggregation, which is why we talk about Beacon.", "And rightly, we're all focused on Beacon as an efficiency play, but it's much, much more than that to the extent that we can get our data, the $32 trillion in assets that we hold on behalf of clients or a specific client normalize, made available on a real-time basis, aggregate it with other custodian's data. It's a huge differentiator. And so, I think that that's what we're playing for and we think that long-term the big global asset manager is going to look for partners like that that can span global locations, that can move from the back office to the middle office, into the front office, all the while keeping all those other revenue pools intact, the trading, the securities lining and Enhanced Custody.", "Eric Aboaf", "And, Mike, it's Eric. I'd just add that to support that effort and those trends and those - that progress, we have fairly intense performance measurement that we do, sort of number of products, number of products per client for asset managers versus pension funds versus insurers. And we actually shared some of that at the early September conference just so you have a little bit of kind of tactical feel, but we generally think about 30 products or so that are out there that we offer.", "And the performance measurement gets us at that level so we can target and grow kind of at that level.", "Michael Carrier", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Eric Aboaf", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan.", "Vivek Juneja", "Hi, Jay, Eric. I want to get back to the servicing fee question. So if you look at constant currency versus year to date, in 2Q you were running at about 5% growth year on year. Now, you're running, again, constant currency year to date about 4% and you said you're comfortable with that. So there's been a little bit of slowdown there. What is causing that? Is there something, can you give some color on that?", "And what gets us to be - what's causing the slowdown and what gets us comfortable that it's staying at 4% and not going a little bit slower?", "Eric Aboaf", "Sure. Vivek, it's Eric. I think I just caution on individual quarters just like I would on individual months, because you got a fair number of small things going on. You got accruals, which are occasionally little lumpy. You've got new business that you install and which kind of has to tip in. You may have an old deal that is winding down that comes out. So - or a little - we just want to give a little caution to a particular quarter's results.", "And if you think about the little lumpiness that you might get in one quarter, if that lumpiness went the other way in the previous quarter, then you kind of get a little more than you might expect, which is I think what happened this quarter, so just a little kind of cautionary note to take it in perspective.", "In terms of why we had some confidence for the fourth quarter and the year is, we put aside new business pipelines, but we have a backlog of business that needs to be installed and when it gets installed, we begin to accrue for. We obviously have good visibility into that. And so, that's off of which we're doing some of our modeling and off of which we gave guidance for fourth quarter. And we think that will play through.", "Vivek Juneja", "So, Eric, keeping that in mind, do you think we're better off going back to where you were running first half of the year? Or is that too fine - cutting it too fine to go from where that's four or it's five or is there some kind of range in that - between those two?", "Eric Aboaf", "Yeah, I'd keep it in the range. This is a business that you win over quarters that become years, that become multiple years. You saw what year-on-year was 1Q, year-over-year 2Q, year-over-year 3Q. I think the year-to-date is a good indication and is our expectation for - is our expectation.", "Vivek Juneja", "And the FX swaps, Eric, for you, that you mentioned earlier that caused some of that impact on the deposit costs, was that because of the weakness in the dollar versus the pound or the euro or any color on that?", "Eric Aboaf", "No, the FX swaps and the reason why the FX swaps which are linked from an accounting standpoint to the deposit, cost more in the third quarter than the second quarter is because the interest rate differential, right, between U.S. markets and European markets. And so as the Fed moved, but the ECB did not move, the cost of the swap goes up. That said, when you invest in dollars you can invest at higher rates than you did in euros, and so it neutralizes, but the accounting shows it on two different lines.", "Vivek Juneja", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Eric Aboaf", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "So now, you mentioned earlier that you were reducing the credit securities and adding direct loans. Can you just size what the ultimate goal is of that strategy and the timing of it as well?", "Eric Aboaf", "Sure, Brian, it's Eric. We're gliding the balance sheet. I think you saw us glide a bit on deposits in a very purposeful way and we think that that's accretive to ratios and for the annual stress tests. And then on the asset side, on the investment portfolio side, I think you've seen that we have a kind of broad diversified mix of securities. You've seen us adjust by about $2 billion, $3 billion this quarter.", "And we have a capacity to continue to do some of that to the extent that we want to create room. I think if you step back, what we're trying to do here is optimize multiple ratios, right? Right now, tier 1 leverage is the binding constraint, since you see a lot of activity there. As tier 1 leverage becomes less of a binding constraint, then we have to think about the SLR constraint and the RWA constraint.", "And what you see us do is in a kind of in a forward thinking way, begin to tailor the balance sheet for those as well. So I think I describe the investment portfolio as a modest adjustment. We have the capacity to do more because we have a little more of a high quality, credit-intensive portfolio than others. And if there's good client business to be done and we want to grow that a little more quickly, it's a natural part to say should we do both or should we offset a little bit.", "I tell you, both changes are accretive on earnings and both are positive in our stress testing and so that's - that was some of the logic and something we'll continue to work on and refine.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "And just a second question, yeah, I heard you mention the impacts of the sale of BlockCross on the processing fees, but didn't hear the dollar amount. Did you give the gains on that sale?", "Eric Aboaf", "Yeah, the pre-tax gain was just around $25 million and it's in one of the footnotes. The - what I will remind you is it's in processing fees, which this quarter we're $145 million. A year ago, processing fees were $139 million, so there is - that's the fee line where we have lots of small items. We have software fees. We have loan fees. We have BOLI. We have tax-advantaged investments. It's a little lumpy.", "But - so BlockCross didn't have a significant move on a year on year basis. It does have a - it is, it does have a pre-tax effect in an absolute way in the current quarter though.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "Good, thanks.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions. Are there any closing remarks?", "Joseph Hooley", "Yeah, just quickly, Victoria. Thanks everybody for your time. And good questions this morning and we look forward to getting together in January to discuss our fourth quarter results. Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference.

The only authorized broadcast of this call will be housed on State Street website.", "Now, I would like to introduce Ilene Fiszel Bieler, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at State Street. Please go ahead.", "Ilene Fiszel Bieler", "Thank you, Nora. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our Chairman and CEO, Jay Hooley, will speak first. Then, Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to two questions and then re-queue.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include operating-basis and other measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measures are available in the appendix to our 4Q 2017 slide presentation.", "In addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors, such as those factors referenced in our discussion today, in our discussion today in our 4Q, 2017 slide presentation under the heading Forward-Looking Statements and in our SEC filings, including the risk factor section of our 2016 Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change.", "Now, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Joseph Hooley", "Thanks Ilene and good morning everyone. As you've seen today, we ended 2017, which is our 225th year with strong operating results reflecting momentum across our asset servicing and asset management businesses and continued strengthened equity markets as we advanced our digital leadership.", "As you're also aware, although we think tax reform will have a significant positive for us going forward. It did result in a onetime net impact in the quarter related mostly to deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, partially offset by the revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities, which we'll go into shortly in the presentation.", "Right now, we will be discussing our business performance on an operating basis, which excludes the onetime tax impacts. Fourth quarter and full year results included strong EPS growth and improved return on equity. We continue to see momentum across our core franchise. Strengthened equity markets and new business lifted our asset under custody administration to record levels at year-end, with growth of 15% from the end of 2016 to $33.1 trillion.", "We achieved new servicing commitments of $445 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $800 billion for the year. Our total new business yet to be installed at quarter end was $350 billion, which was roughly the same as last quarter. And importantly, new business opportunities remain robust across the franchise.", "State Street Global Advisors finished the year with record assets under management of $2.8 trillion, up 13% from 2016 year-end driven by strengthened equity markets, follow on wins from the acquired GE Asset Management business and higher yielding ETF inflows of $28 billion.", "Furthermore, 2017 results reflect success and realizing the benefits from State Street Beacon. Our multiyear program to digitize our business, enhance our client experiences and gain efficiencies. Importantly, as a result of the efforts we have made to expand and accelerate Beacon, we now expect to complete the Beacon program and realize the related financial objectives by mid-2019, 18 months ahead of schedule.", "Now turning to Slide number 5, I'd like to review some of our key achievements for the year. I'm very pleased with our performance this year, as we achieved or our exceeded all of our 2017 financial objectives. Fee revenue growth of 8% was driven by continued market appreciation and new client business, enabling us to exceed our fee revenue target for 2017 by healthy margin. We remain committed to expense control, as evidenced by full year positive fee operating leverage of 2.1% and Beacon expense savings of approximately $150 million.", "Net interest income growth of 14% exceeded our financial goal for the year by 8 percentage points as we actively manage our balance sheet. We also achieved a pretax operating margin of 31.4%, surpassing our 2018 Beacon target one year ahead of schedule. These results demonstrate our commitment to achieving our financial goals, advancing our digital leadership through Beacon and continuing to drive growth in our business by creating new product solutions to support our clients.", "We delivered full-year EPS growth of 25% and improved return on equity by 210 basis points to 12.9%. And during 2017 through share repurchase and common share dividends, we return 2 billion of capital to shareholders. Beyond the achievement of our financial goals in 2017, we marked our 225th Anniversary with employees and clients around the world, celebrated the 40th anniversary of our foundation. And with fearless growth, State Street Global Advisors advanced an important agenda to achieve greatest stewardship and diversity in our industry and beyond.", "Before I turn the call over the Eric to review our financial performance for the fourth quarter and our outlook for 2018, let me take a moment to talk through the recent tax reform change and how we will deploy some of the benefits. The majority of the benefits will flow through our financials and result in higher earnings. We are targeting a small percentage of the game to three specific initiatives that will benefit our employees and the communities where we live and work.", "First, we will invest in an employee retirement plans by enhancing the matching contributions from for our defined contributions plans. Second, we will introduce new technology and content to provide employees a customized learning experience to build the skill they need for future success. And third, we will increase our State Street Foundation matching gift benefit for employees and increase our global grant making to support the communities in which we live and work.", "And with that, Eric over to you.", "Eric Aboaf", "Thank you, Jay, and good morning everyone. Before, I begin my review of our 2017 results, I'd like to take a moment on Page 6 to discuss notable items in 4Q '17 and 4Q '16, and the related impact on our financials.", "In 4Q '17, we recognized 270 million of onetime tax cost and revenue adjustments based on estimates associated with tax reform. The primary impact from our GAAP basis results include, a repatriation tax expense of 454 million which was partially offset by a tax benefit of 197 million associated with the revaluation of our net differed tax liability due to lower future tax rates.", "We also had a revenue reduction of approximately 20 million associated with the onetime accelerated amortization of tax advantage investments. Together this resulted in a 30 basis point impact to asset funds and a 15 basis point reduction on Tier 1 leverage. Just to remind you, a year ago, our 4Q '16 results included the tax benefit of 211 million and the acceleration of incentive compensation expense of a 161 million. The net effect of these two items was a benefit of 50 million in the year ago quarter.", "Now please turn to Slide 7 where I will start my review of our operating basis results for 2017. Overall full-year 2017 results were driven by client fee revenue momentum and increased in net interest income supported by higher U.S. interest rates coupled with disciplined pricing as well as a continued focus on prudently managing expenses while reinvesting in the business. Key performance metrics for full-year 2017 excluding the impact of tax legislation and last year's items that I just mentioned are as follows.", "EPS increased 25% $6.41 a share supported by fee revenue growth of 8% and NII growth of 14%. ROE increased 2.1 percentage points to 12.9%, now nicely in our targeted range. Positive fee operating leverage came in at 2.1 percentage points. Pretax operating basis margin reached 31.4%, which is now ahead of our 2018 Beacon target of 31%.", "Turning to 4Q '17, EPS of a $1.83 increased 36% from a year ago quarter, driven by strength in servicing and management fees and higher net interest income. Return on equity for the quarter measurably improved to 14.1%, up 2.7 percentage points. Just like last quarter, 4Q '17 results also benefit from lower than expected tax rate of 27%, primarily due to the higher share of lower tax foreign earnings and benefits related to stock-based compensation, which was worth approximately $0.07 per share.", "Now let me turn to Slide 8 to briefly review growth of two key drivers. Business momentum continued in 4Q '17 in both AUCA and AUM. Record AUCA of $33.1 trillion at year-end increased 15% from 4Q, '16. Growth was primarily driven by a combination of market appreciation and client activity. Flows were particularly strong in EMEA and middle office outsourcing.", "At State Street Global Advisors, AUM increased 13% from 4Q, '16, driven by market appreciation and higher yielding ETF inflows, partially offset from lower yielding institutional mandates during the year. Our new low cost ETF offering added $5 billion of inflows in just 3 months. These 4Q, '17 levels in both AUCA and AUM positioned us well for 2018.", "Please turn to Slide 9, where I will cover 4Q, '17 fee revenue results on a year-over-year basis. You'll also find additional detail in the appendix with the sequential quarter comparison to 3Q, '17. Total fee revenue increased 6% from 4Q, '16 driven by strength in asset servicing, asset management and securities finance fees.", "Servicing fees Increased 7% from 4Q, '16 reflecting higher global equity market, broad based new business wins and the benefit of a declining dollar partially offset by modest hedge fund outflows. Management fees again demonstrated strong growth in 4Q, '17 increasing 16% relative to the year ago quarter. The increase was driven by higher global equity market, and higher revenue yielding ETF inflows, including $28 billion in 4Q, '17 alone. Compared to 4Q, '16 both servicing and management fees benefited from the weaker U.S. dollar, as we outlined in the table below.", "Trading services revenue decreased from 4Q, '16 primarily due to lower volatility as well as a modest impact from the businesses exited in 2017, partially offset by higher client FX volumes. Securities finance fees increased from 4Q, '16 primarily due to higher client volumes in both our agency and enhanced custody businesses partially offset by lower spreads.", "Moving to Slide 10, NII was up 20% and NIM increased 31 basis points from 4Q, '16. NII benefitted from higher U.S. interest rates, disciplined liability pricing and loan growth partially offset by a small balance sheet. The U.S. dollar interest bearing client deposit betas remain relatively low around 25% when compared to 4Q, '16. As I've previously commented, we expect deposit betas to increase overtime as they have in past cycles.", "Relative to 3Q, '17 non-interest bearing deposit balances declined only slightly, while interest bearing deposit balances remain relatively flat. U.S. dollar interest bearing client deposit cost increased by only 2 basis points sequentially.", "Notable in our financial supplement you'll see a decreased in our non-U.S. domiciled interest bearing deposit and a corresponding increased of the U.S. domiciled interest bearing deposits this was the result of the transfer of approximately 14 billion or foreign denominated came in brands deposits that transfer had no impact or a deposit rate paid. Overall, we continue our price deposits carefully in order to manage and size of our balance sheet while providing the necessary value for our servicing clients.", "Now I'll turn to Slide 11 to review 4Q '17 expenses. Expenses increased 4% on an Ex-FX basis from 4Q '16 excluding the acceleration of compensation expense year-ago, which I mentioned in my remarks. The increase was driven by new business activity merit an incentive and additional investments in technology, partially offset by Beacon related savings and lower professional services cost.", "Compensation and employee benefits increased from a year-ago quarter, primarily due to increased costs to support new business, annual merit and incentive comp and the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by Beacon savings. Information and systems, transaction processing and occupancy costs increase as the result of new business activity and technology related investments.", "Other expenses decreased from 4Q 2016, primarily reflecting lower professional services cost. 4Q 2017 GAAP results also included a pre-tax $133 million Beacon restructuring charge, which will provide payback on average within the next seven quarters. Program to date Beacon related restructuring charges now totaled about 385 million at December 31st 2017.", "Let me now move to Slide 12 to review our progress on State Street Beacon. Starting on the right side of the slide, we achieve the $150 in Beacon savings in 2017, including 50 million in 4Q. This exceeded our 2017 target by 10 million. We now expect an additional 150 million in savings in 2018, and we now expect our previously targeted 550 million in aggregate savings to be realized to 18 months ahead of schedule by the middle of 2019.", "Shifting over to the left side of the slide, I'll briefly touch upon notable achievements we have realized since the inception of Beacon. We continue to digitize how we receive and process data from clients and use speed as a way to differentiate our service. Key accomplishments include improving efficiencies from advancing our global accounting platform and creating the global workforce to service clients 24 hours a day. We've also expanded Beacon to our asset management and corporate divisions including procurement and real-estate and we expect to build further attraction on these areas as we move forward.", "Now let's turn to Slide 13 to review our balance sheet and capital position. We continue to maintain a high quality balance sheet our capital ratios remains healthy which enabled us to return capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases including buying back 350 million of common stock and declaring in common share dividend of $0.42 in 4Q. We ended the year strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio, up 30 basis points from last quarter and last year even with the impacts related to the recently inactive tax law. Notably, you can see that our Tier 1 leverage ratio increased to 80 basis points from last December to 7.3%, which positions us well for this year's CCAR.", "Turning to the Slide 14, let me touch upon notable items that will impact our financials going forward. First, let me start with the impact of the tax law change. We expect based on our current guidance our 2018 GAAP basis effective tax rate to be approximately 16%. This reflects a 4% to 5% benefit to our core tax rate, which I would define primarily as federal state and foreign tax rates combined, resulting in the 2018 benefit of approximately $150 million. As Jay commented in his remarks, while the large majority of the benefits from the after tax law will be realized by our shareholders. We are putting key initiatives in place to share some of the benefits with employees and the communities in which we operate.", "Next, starting in 2018 on a perspective basis, the new FASI revenue recognition standard take effect, in which certain costs previously presented on a net basis will now represented on a gross basis. We expect the revenue recognition standard to impact both revenue and expenses by about $225 million.", "Lastly moving to the bottom of the slide, we will not be presenting our financials on an operating basis in 2018. We will provide primarily GAAP basis presentation. We will continue however to present certain non-GAAP measures such as pretax margin as well as call out additional notable items such as acquisition restructuring costs in line with industry practice. They should offer investors the more streamline presentation with enhanced clarity.", "Now please turn to Slide 15, where I will discuss our 2018 financial outlook. In 2018, we remain focused on continuing our revenue momentum, investing in our business to drive growth in our core franchise and deliver additional capabilities to our clients while at the same time prudently managing expenses including executing on Beacon. On this page, you can see on the left and illustrative 2018 operating basis outlook on a like-for-like basis of 2017, which excludes the impact of the revenue recognition standard I just mentioned as well as the impact from the changes in our tax law. We're providing this view because we believe we continue to have strong momentum in the business and expect to deliver our Beacon pretax margin goal that was made on this basis.", "In the right column, you can see our 2018 outlook as we intend to present it going forward on a GAAP basis, which factors in the new revenue recognition standard, the new tax law and addresses the 2017 gains on sale.", "On a GAAP basis, considering the gains on sale, we expect 2018 fee revenue to increase 7% to 8%. We are assuming good equity market growth as well as continued low volatility trading divisions. The primarily difference between the historical operating basis fee growth outlook of 4% to 5% and our 2018 outlook is the impact from revenue recognition standard plus the small impact from the changing tax equivalent growth.", "We expect positive fee operating leverage of 75 to 150 basis points considering the gains on sale in 2017 that I mentioned. I would also note that fee operating leverage will vary by quarter. We are committed to calibrating expenses against the revenue backdrop over the course of the year.", "Turning to NII, we expect NII to grow within a range of 10% to 13%, reflecting higher expected interest rates in the U.S. Balance sheet growth in 2018 will largely depend on new business and related client deposit activity.", "Lastly, we expect the GAAP basis tax rate to be approximately 16% in 2018, which as I mentioned reflects a 4 to 5 point improvement over our core GAAP tax rate which is the $150 million benefit I referenced.", "To help to clarity the differences between the historical operating basis outlook and GAAP basis outlook, we\u2019ve also included Page 19 in the appendix, which has reconciliation between the yield operating basis and GAAP basis outlook for your reference.", "Now a word on first quarter, we expect first quarter 2018 to be broadly in line with this full year guidance, but let me remind you that as increase this year, 1Q '18 compensation benefit expense will be seasonally higher due to the effect of the accounting treatment of equity compensation from retirement eligible employees as well as payroll taxes.", "Finally to Page 16, in summary we're very pleased with our 2017 results, strong 2017 results included operating basis EPS growth of 25% as well as returning $2 billion to shareholders for common stock dividends and share repurchases. Strength in our asset servicing and asset management businesses and our focus on calibrating expenses against the revenue backdrop enable us to achieve our 2017 financial objective including generating approximately 200 basis points in positive fee operating leverage.", "Importantly, we continue to invest in our businesses to enhance client experience. We also achieved our 2017 Beacon related savings targets and now expect to realize the full program benefits 2018 month ahead of schedule.", "As we look forward to this year, we're well positioned to achieve our 2018 financial objectives and key strategic priorities including advancing our digital leadership, while controlling expenses and delivering on behalf of clients.", "And with that, let me turn it back over to Jay.", "Joseph Hooley", "Thanks, Eric. Nora, I think we can now open the call to questions. Nora?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We have first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Alex Blostein", "Great and good morning everybody, thanks for all the additional color obviously and trying to streamline the reporting, I think it's definitely very helpful as we kind try to compare you guys against the industry, so appreciate that. I guess along those lines, Eric, question for you around the margins. I guess if you look at the new reporting some more kind of under GAAP basis excluding any significant charges. Stage Street pretax margin is in the high 20s kind 28% to 29%, obviously with some room for improvement given Beacon initiative still, but when we look at the peers, the margins there again on a similar basis look to be in the low to mid 30s. And I just want to get your take on a; either do you see anything structural about State Street business that prevents you guys from getting closer to those kind of industry averages? And if not, would you see the margins going overtime once kind all the Beacon savings around the run rate?", "Eric Aboaf", "Alex, I appreciate the question it's Eric. On margin I think a couple of different parts of the answer to your question. I think first, we're pleased with where we came in on margins for the quarter and the year. Those are ahead of our Beacon expectations by full year and I think we're confident that as part of the outlook we gave, margins should continue to trend up in a positive direction and that\u2019s certainly part of the business model that we design when it comes to top line revenue, fee operating leverage and benefit in NII.", "In terms of comparison, the comparisons are kind of -- have a good size range and part of that is as you probably know well, the tax advantage investments which go through the GAAP line have varying effects on margins for different companies, partly based on how much they are doing the tax advantage investments and partly because of our couple of different ways to account for them. And I just encourage you to factor that in and to the comparisons.", "I think if you do -- we show that or within the range, I think from a perspective of should we'd be at the high middle or lower end of the range, business mix matters U.S. international, more middle office versus the classic custody operations, having asset management or not. So I'm not overly fussed with where we are in the range. I think with the view of that we\u2019re -- we are within it. And our perspective is, margin is one of the key indicators of our business and our expectations with that, it should continue to widen overtime.", "AlexBlostein", "And then second question around NII, just a clarification I guess. Your comment around deposit betas in the U.S, I think you said about 20% it still seems pretty low again relative to what we've heard from some of the other so far. Is there something against structural about State Street business that, that's keeping it that ways? Or is there something that you guys are doing proactively keeping to slow? And as we think about your commentary on the forward, should it be more over ramp? Or could we see a bit of a catch-up on the deposit cost because you guys have done obviously quite a good job of maintaining that at a fairly low level?", "Eric Aboaf", "Yes, let me first reemphasize what we've said over the last couple of quarters and what I just said in the call summary is that our deposit betas have ranged about 25% over the last year, right. So that kind of the current state, and couple of quarters back it was at the a bit lower than that and that's why where we are at today. I think what we factored into our outlook is continued uptick in deposit betas, so I think we've seen that around the industry, we've seen that in corporate deposits quite a bit, we've seen that in wealth management deposits, we've seen some of that in custody deposits.", "While we think custody deposit betas will tend to be somewhat less than some of the other price oriented deposit categories that I just mentioned, deposit betas have to rise overtime they have to rise into next year. We don\u2019t think they rise -- well, I guess we said, they just are going to rise and the question is a little bit of how much and how fast. And part of the reason we've put out NII range in place in the outlook is to accommodate that uptick that we expect.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken of UBS. Your line is open.", "Brennan Hawken", "Just a follow-up on Alex's question there on NII from a different direction. So we saw the balance sheet decline again this quarter although slower pace than last quarter. Could you maybe let us know how much of balance sheet growth or decline you have reflected in your outlook for NII growth? And whether or not the rate rises are only in the U.S. or whether or not you might have some tailwinds from that in Europe and UK as well?", "Eric Aboaf", "Brennan, it's Eric. Let me start with the backend of the question. I think the rate rises that we've expect in the outlook are primarily in the U.S. I think we're fair that about we are expected. There was a rate rise in sterling in the fourth quarter which is a rate we start to factor into 4Q results that we just released and obviously will help next year in 2018. But for the time being, we haven't expected much more in sterling or euros. And I think that's consistent we look forward.", "In terms of balance sheet side, we made a conscious effort several years back and then we emphasized that over the last year. It just around what I'll describe as a compact and efficient balance sheet. I think you saw us deliver on our objectives for this past year. I think at this point, we feel confident in the site for our balance sheet. You could see the capital ratios and leverage ratios in particular are at a nice place, which gives us the room we like.", "I think our pricing is fair and we'll continue to share some of the benefits of rate rises with the clients as they'd expect. And so there is a range in the NII guidance and part of that range accommodates some of the range that we have in deposit betas, some of not in a range in balance sheet growth. I think the balance sheet at one end could be roughly around where we are today. It could grow modestly. I don't think there is anything, there is going to be any dramatic shift, but there is a range of outcomes that we're just preparing for that range.", "Brennan Hawken", "That's fair. And then second question, you've referenced to capital and how you feel quite good about things, Eric. How should we think about potential for capital relief? We've heard in the press that regulators are preparing to moderate leverage ratio calculations and requirements. Is there a way in which you could help investors frame that potential release and how that would translate into capital return policies at State Street?", "Eric Aboaf", "Yes, Brennan. We're clearly optimistic like others around regulatory reform and refinements here with the current administration. And we're pleased to see both movement in the agencies, the treasury department and congress around leverage ratios and some of these other constraints that are important to us including some of the most recent announcements of and intentions. I don't think we can translate that into direct actions that quickly until we see what might come out.", "And part of the question will be is it supplementary leverage ratio? Is it leveraged ratio? Is it CCAR that changes, which part which one? I think we recently saw that there are 22 capital rules out there and ratios. And I think you all can feel that just like we can. So I think hard to translate it directly. I think we're optimistic that we'll see some changes what we'll need to work through. If we have changes in one ratio, the questions is that ratio are binding constraint or can we find the way to expand it in a certain manner that is that's offered to us in that way.", "So hard to tell, apologizes, I can't answer that until we see more. But I think when we see more we'll be able to give you more background, Brennan.", "Joseph Hooley", "And Brennan, this is Jay Hooley. Just as we saw the regulatory rules coming on a kind of a slow basis, I think they are going to go out on a slow basis. I think what is overwhelmingly clearly though is that trend is positive. The leverage ratio which is front incentive for the trust banks is got the special attention, I think from our good efforts and they should probably note they will work its way through the senate which is a broader banking bill which has in it somebody for the trust banks from our leverage ratio. So I think the trend is quite clear, but it's going to take longer than any of us would hope to get some of this regulatory adjustments implemented.", "Operator", "Another question from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies, your line is open.", "Ken Usdin", "I just want to ask you just on the spending side. It's great to see guys accelerating the recognition of the Beacon sales, and embedded within I guess the operating leverage is still a pretty healthy rate of cost growth. And I'm just wondering, can you help us understanding how much of that is? Is any of that a pull-forward layered against the pull-forward on the Beacon sales? And how much of it is putting a little bit of tax benefits back into the business? And just where do you think you are on just kind of tax spend needs and versus your prior thoughts any changes because of the tax changes?", "Joseph Hooley", "Ken, let start that. This is Jay and I will turn it over to Eric. I've always believe, we\u2019ve always believe that you need to spend in this business to continue to drive the revenue line, and in addition to Beacon, we're still making some pretty steady investment. They tend to be technology oriented. I will just give you some flavor for that. We talked before about the investments we\u2019ve made in our ETF platform, which are paying great benefits as we compete in the servicing of the ETF world.", "Most recently we just finished for Japanese accounting system and we just brought our first Japanese mutual fund account on to the system in the fourth quarter, we think that\u2019s a robust future opportunity. I guess the last one I might spike, the last couple I might spike would be, Eric referenced the European offshore markets which continue to run at great speed, and we're the recipient of that. We're the largest provider of services in places like Luxembourg and Dublin, and we have embark recently on an investment in our transfer agent platform, which is a differentiator to continue to differentiate ourselves when we compete for new business and serve existing customers.", "On a regulatory front, MiFID rules recently and even more recently SEC modernization have caused us to spend money to put in place administrative platform. So, there is a fair amount of spending that goes on, and we think that\u2019s the good thing, that\u2019s going to serve to serve our client's well, get in front of opportunities in the market which to us look like growth opportunity. So that\u2019s where this bank comes. I will let Eric pick up on the Beacon says and some of the other offsets.", "Eric Aboaf", "Yes, Eric, I'd just add that we've been careful and I think considered in how we operate the business within the revenue growth envelop that we have this year, which had revenues in the 7% or 8% a little higher than we would typically had expected. We have expense growth about 4% adjusted for FX. And if you think about what drives that, there is a couple of percent call it to for net new business, there as we brought onboard clients, there is a couple of percent call it to for merit and incentive that we have.", "There is a couple of percent again call it to just to keep it simple but it's literally how the map works for technology and some of the business investments that Jay described. And then there is a couple of points that go to the other way, right, in Beacon savings and yet that together and it's actually good business system and it lets us both do the right thing by our business and our clients and also work within the operating leverage that we would like to deliver.", "Ken Usdin", "And then just one quick one core business flows and transaction activity, I think you mention that hedge fund outflows continue to be slightly negative. Can you just give us the flavor for that activity and flows component of hedge fund emerging market? And what -- how that trended sequentially and if you've seen any stabilization ahead?", "Eric Aboaf", "Yes, let me I'll take it more broadly Ken and then I'll get into hedge funds. The flow the direction of the flows remain pretty consent in the fourth quarter so you've got that the rapid ETF inflow, you should got the U.S. mutual fund outflows. We are in the middle of both of those. I mentioned the in Europe that, European particular focus on the offshore markets and you can see, the numbers, if you look them up there quite robust. In the alternative world, you were asked about hedge and you've seen throughout 2017 the hedge outflows have moderated, in fact there were some quarters where there was even a handful of inflows, and we are largely seeing that we've seeing still little bit on the outflow side, but considerably diminished from 16 to 17 and we are hopeful. With the outflows that have occur that we've reached the trough, we even see some more recently some new fund introductions on the hedge fund world, which is a positive sign so and we're declaring a turn yet but the trend is pretty positive.", "Joseph Hooley", "I'd just add over the past year we've seen the servicing fee line on hedge fund outflows across this more than a percentage point of growth we're still seeing some of that in fourth quarter and we expect to see some of that into next year. And the question is when does it balance out stabilize fully in turn, but we've seen some improvements. But it's still there and we're just obviously navigating through it, and you see some positives from some of the other parts of the franchise, which Jay described as offsetting that, which I think gave us some good overall results on the servicing fee line this quarter.", "Operator", "Another question from the line of Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Your line is open.", "Glenn Schorr", "Maybe first the question in enhanced custody prime brokerage lands. Curious how you would define where enhanced custody begins and ends versus prime brokerage? And then, as I've seen some competitors Dublin certain asset classes like doing FX prime brokerage, how you think about different asset classes and where State Street's aspirations might go there?", "Eric Aboaf", "Glenn, it's Eric. I think it's a good question because it's an area that clearly we've expanded into in the last couple of years. We think as a custody provider where we have where hedged funds have their assets with us that actually provide a platform by which we can provide a portion of the classic prime brokerage services directly for them. I don't think there are bright lines as to where we play versus where some of the traditional broker dealers play. I mean they start from a position often times of having to borrow collateral to lend it, right.", "So in a way that you start with the two sided model, we have the collateral. We have our clients' collateral sitting right there which helps facilitate that. And it gives us some advantages it gives us some advantages with some of the 40 Act or some of the clients we already serve. But it's a good sized market. I think we are we continue to explore how to both strategically and tactically compete. In our perspective, it's been attractive. And we just need to make sure we balance some of the capital rules, some of which may change overtime, which could be beneficial with how we go to market.", "Glenn Schorr", "So no need for further technology build that's more of the, is it a ROE accretive event?", "Eric Aboaf", "Well, it's actually it's an area where we've invested in the technology years ago. I think that's what in a way we got our business off the ground as we're able to access directly from the custody system and what our clients already had with us. So we created that access. Overtime it's been and I think we've described it as 9 or 10 systems. So you have to actually pull together and we've actually integrated a good part of that. It's one of the areas where we've actually developed some block chain technology to actually connect the lenders and lending pools that are either in our asset management or away from us in the market to our custody system. And so it's an area which I think continues to have developments technologically. And we're finding that clients are quite pleased and responsive accordingly with the business that they've brought our way.", "Glenn Schorr", "Okay. I appreciate that. And just a follow-up on the fee operating leverage conversation, I think the year-on-year numbers impacted just because tough comps in the fourth quarter last year, so for the full year is really good. But I did notice that your target went from I think 100 to 200 of the operating leverage to 75 to 150. Is that just, it's harder to do as margins have moved up or maybe that lead into Ken's past question on, are you accelerating some of the investments?", "Eric Aboaf", "I wouldn't read anything in particular into that to be honest. So I think this past year, we had both a strong view as to what we could do on the expense side. And I think we saw early on that markets were going to be quite favorable. If we have that kind of favorability again, I mean that would be great to have. And if you can assure us we take it. But it's -- we\u2019re trying to be I think careful and vigilant in a way we don\u2019t want to overestimate what the market will do and sort of say looked in the top range should be higher and higher and higher.", "I think we actually want to run a conservative business model, as we have been over the last couple of years and have realistic expectations of revenues and then make sure that we both investment and save at the same time. So I wouldn't read anything into it. I think where we're at the 75 to 150 is kind where we're comfortable. I think it's where it\u2019s a good range for the last few years, and I think at least an indication of where we\u2019re going to be running the business this year and likely going forward.", "Operator", "Another question from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Betsy Graseck", "Couple of questions, one on the NIM side, I know we discussed the deposit angle. I'm just wondering, Eric, as you're thinking about reinvesting, if there any interest in, you'll be going little bit longer duration and picking up some yield that way?", "Eric Aboaf", "Betsy, it's Eric. We\u2019re always reassessing our position against rates and in the market, we certainly do that across the curve as you're suggesting. We do that in dollar sterling, euro, yen and so forth. I think if you look carefully our duration expense a little bit this quarter is an example, I don\u2019t think its trend but it's an example. We've seen some steeper curves in euro and sterling and given that we have good size deposit base as there is natural for us to take advantage of that. And so we've done that a bit, but I think we also want to be careful and keep the front end of the curve position open, so as the rate drives they come up. So I don\u2019t think you should expect some large changes in positioning but that\u2019s an example of the tax adjustment that we make and will continue to make and look for opportunities accordingly.", "Betsy Graseck", "And as we think -- had little discussion on Europe as well, I realize that you're taking in the forward curve. Just wondering given some investor and discussion around inflation and global inflation will that pick up. What remind us, if the European rate structure were to move up 25 bps let's say beyond what forwards are currently estimating what that impact is on your financials?", "Eric Aboaf", "Yes, I think the best way to describe it is and we try to share the bases the balance sheet, but we describe in our Qs and Ks that we\u2019re open to interest rates, right. And we say about half of that in the U.S. and half of that is non U.S. The value of 25 point move in the U.S. has been in the $20 million to $25 million kind of the last over the last year. I think more currently it's going to be in the $10 million to $15 million, but it's these are ranges, right. And given that is half of our exposure, if there is 25 base point move instantly in euro, you'd expect something in that order of magnitude while it have to euros and sterling because I'd say half of balance sheet is U.S. half is about non-U.S. But I think you can probably build off of that would be an indication.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay and then just lastly on the tax guidance that you've got on the forward look nice decline there when we pencil that out. I think we had a slightly a larger decline and obviously you have more information than I do. Just wondering, if this tax rate outlook for 2018 is similar to what you are thinking 2019 and 2020 is? Or is there any migration and your structure there would drive different tax rate outlook for 2019? And could you also discuss a little bit about the beat and whether or not there is any impacts on you?", "Eric Aboaf", "That's a tough question. We will give the award of the call for that. Here is how I'd say it. The tax law is new. I think we've had every tax expert right here and around the world trying to work through it and understand the implications for us. We've made both over constant and our good estimates of this point for 2018, and we don\u2019t see large movements going forward from them, but I think it's just too early to tell, it's just too early to tell. And as we learn more we certainly share that with you, but I think we're confident that there is a nice $150 million benefit in '18, that's going to fall primarily to the bottom line and shareholders, as we learn more of that we will certainly share that.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay so is this tax outlook for '18 more like your other guidance conservative would that be a fair statement or?", "Eric Aboaf", "Our guidance is our guidance we're trying to be -- we're trying to be off course fit in and how we characterize our expectations, and hopefully that's a good bit for you to work off.", "Operator", "Another question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. Your line is open.", "Jim Mitchell", "Maybe I don't think you've mentioned it to. Can you discuss what your equity market assumption is on the fee income line, and if that also includes BlackRock in that equation?", "Eric Aboaf", "Jim, it's Eric. Are you asking about the outlook are you asking about the '17 results?", "Jim Mitchell", "I am trying to looking in your 4% to 5% guidance range for fee income just wanting to see what your equity assumption is and what your assumption is around the walls of the BlackRock contract?", "Eric Aboaf", "Yes, here is how I'd what we had incorporated. We've incorporated basically all the known market expectations and client activity. So we have market expectations of where we have market and elsewhere where we are today on equity markets and fixed income markets from both are important to our book of business. And there is some consensus we believe some continued growth we've factored that in. We've factored in new business that we've already sold but has to be installed, we've factored in business that as migrating away from us and as you would expect. And then we've factored in some mix of flows some of good continued positive flows for example in EMEA, strength in the ETF activity, little of headwind in hedged funds. So I characterize it as an outlook that factors in all the various parts that you'd expect.", "Jim Mitchell", "And then maybe, you did have very nice improvement on the standardized ratios and leverage ratios sequentially and year-over-year. Does that I think last -- you guys were flat with your buyback. Does that give you some legal room particularly with the tax cut to up to buyback this year? Is that a fair way to think about it?", "Eric Aboaf", "Jim, it's a little early to say. What I tell you is that we're quite conscious about our capital position under CCAR. I think we made a decision early in the year that that would be just like revenue growth and operating leverage in Beacon managing a compact balance sheet would be a priority for this year. We've done that I think with pretty good results. So it's certainly positions us well and so we did that purposefully. I think we'll soon to jump to what you're going to ask for in CCAR. We actually have to we're waiting maybe even this week, it's not next week we'll see the CCAR instructions and see if there are various to more past year or is if there is anything new, so a lot of moving parts. And obviously as we know more we'll let you know more.", "Operator", "Another question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Mike Mayo", "Hi. This is the first conference call since the CEO change has been announced. And I was just hoping to get some kind a discussion on that. And I guess, Jay, if 343 more days to go, that's 40 steps down to CEO, but who is counting. I guess the question is. Ron or Henley, I'm not sure if Ron is there on the line, but historically Ron, you've run three of the largest asset managers globally. Generally, the GE acquisition gone better than you guys expected, you have record AUM, so no issues with that. But some questions I would come up. The first one is for you, Jay, you'll be leading before Beacon is done and granted that you've accelerated targets, but you still have $75 million left in 2019 and your pretax margin target of 33% is not target against until the end of 2020. So you're leaving before you actually gotten everything done. And then for Ron, I mean its three years at State Street for our 225 year old company that's not as long a tenure as you've seen in the past of State Street. And the third thing to Ron also, you've overseen asset management, but you haven't overseen the rest of the Company. So, what was the discussion of the board and your thoughts Jay, and Ron your thoughts in the accepting the job?", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. And you're right this is the first call since we announced our transition. And just be clear, the transition which I instigated is that, I will leave at the, before the end of 2018 and likely chair the Board through '19. When we began that discussion a year ago with the Board, they went through a pretty extensive evaluation looking at internal talent, looking at external talent. As you pointed out, Ron has been with us for three years. He's done a terrific job with us as Jay, but he casted even broader shadow over the bigger State Street. And so the Board and their valuation concluded that Ron is the right person to take over the CEO ship of the State Street at the end of 2018.", "We decided Mike to announce it early just kind of unusual that we would announce early because we wanted to get Ron situated in the core businesses, both the asset servicing, trading and the global exchange business and in this transition period all over see asset management business just so he can come fully up to speed. But as you pointed out running three of the largest asset managers over the past 20 years and having been the first, McKinsey consultant that started there asset management business, he is deeply knowledgeable and tons of asset management and has overseen a great deal of front assets, middle assets, back assets transformation. So he certainly understands the business from our client prospective and understands the core components. I think this transition is designed to give him even more time to focus on as you point out the key core back office middle business. So, we're working together throughout 2018 with the plan to turn over the baton in beginning of '19.", "To your comment Mike about Beacon, I think Beacon will never end in my opinion. I mean we declared a premature completion Beacon mid '19, but Beacon represents the digitization of State Street. I would say Beacon as we know it in my view is simply down payment. We have a long way to go to fully digitize the 33 trillion in assets that we oversee for our clients and the ability to mine that information and this is not something that just State Street is looking at. Everybody is looking to take that critical information incorporated with other datasets in order to provide insights that our clients can benefit from.", "So that journey is underway, but it's far from complete and I am not sure I'd live long enough to see the end of the Beacon as I know it. So I think we're on the right track, I think Ron and more importantly the Board thought that Ron was the right guy to carry the ball for the next period, and I'm excited to work together with him to make sure they hand office smooth and that Ron takes over the execution of Beacon and driving growth in the core business.", "Mike Mayo", "And a follow-up then, I mean if you leave with a pretax margin of 31%. I can't imagine that's when you want to leave at the end of 2018. So can you give any guidance for that other than 33% by year end 2000 or that\u2019s where it comes out and that\u2019s where it comes out to leave in that note?", "Joseph Hooley", "I think Mike where I would say that, it will lend up or ends up based on the guidance that we gave you on based on factors that are outside of our control, market factors. But I would also say that margin important to keep focus on but to me it's as important that we continue to invest in this business. And so I would think it would be bad advice to just pushing margin at the expensive not investing in the business. So I think State Street has been around for 225 years because we've kept some amount of balance between understanding client needs and inventing in those things that represent future growth opportunity. So we're focused on margin improvement but we're also focused on creating the right balance between investing in areas that will provide long-term payback.", "Eric Aboaf", "Mike, it's Eric. I'd just add if you go through the outlook and you'll build up to the model with the revenue growth we've given and the operating leverage guidance, right. That adds to the margin in '18, does it get and in the nice way, does it pull-forward the 2020, 33% by full one year or two year's. I think we will see as we get to the end of this year, but there is -- I think there is a nice, there is another is more than down payment or recurring payment that we are going to make on margin improvement this year in '18.", "Operator", "Another question comes from the line of Mike Carrier of Bank of America. You may ask your question.", "Mike Carrier", "Just a question on the management fees, the year-over-year the growth was impressive, but just sequentially I mean it was flattish just given the markets. And I didn\u2019t know if there was anything that was unusual given the quarter-over-quarter numbers. It's going to need a little a little odd?", "Eric Aboaf", "It's, Eric. Let me just start and I think and Jay may participate on this one as well. There is -- just remind you, there is always a little bit of lumpiness in management fees whether it's performance base fees whether it's a accruals and so on and so forth and between two quarters until a little bit of positive and one and a little bit of negative and the other. So I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the quarterly performance, if you look at the fee rate on management fees which I think is a good indicator was that I think 6.1 basis points that's nicely in line with the first half of this year. I think their quarter with little bit of was little lumpy and nicely above where we were last year. So we are feeling I think we\u2019ve got good results in management fees and ask asset management on the revenue line.", "Joseph Hooley", "And Mike let me just unpack a little bit the quarter which I think was quite a strong quarter. We noted net flows of the 6 billion in the quarter in asset under management, but importantly we had ETF flows of 29 billion, which is I don\u2019t know that we've had that ever, but it's been a long time. The institutional business has that 2 billion and negative flows and then cash was 21 billion in negative flows. And importantly the cash two thirds of that cash outflows was came from our securities lending collateral and its clients, increasingly using non-cash collateral which we don\u2019t view as a negative thing it's really neutral to us. So I think that your question was about sequential quarter I would say the quarter itself from a standpoint of flows was quite strong.", "Mike Carrier", "And then to follow up, just in terms of the outlook on some of the investments that you guys are making. I think throughout the industry, if there is a lot of commentary on key pressure whether it's on the asset management servicing business. But I guess on flipside when you look at some of the areas that you are investing, where do you see some of these opportunities for the best growth and maybe I mean on pricing power but pricing stabilization where you can still grow the business is demanding for the products given that there is some areas in the industry that with everyone you've seen some pressure?", "Joseph Hooley", "Let me start there with Mike I mentioned a few of them earlier but the ETF industry is obviously growing and is likely to continue to grow and so the investment were making on our platforms to provide enhanced really their data and analytic services to authorize participants and planned sponsors I think is a differentiator. I referenced the offshore markets which markets that were quite prominent in and are making investments in the areas that our differentiating transfer agent being a specific. Japanese fund market which is historically internalized servicing, we're starting to punch through the outsourcing there.", "And then the last one I would kind of spike out for you is, the whole data and analytics world. So we have Beacon and Digitization represents us getting the information we hold on behalf of clients in a more real time basis. We established GX, Global Exchange, probably three years ago now. And one of the products one of the seminal products was something called Data GX which is an aggregation platform, which we can keep up with the demand. It represents the capability to aggregate data across not only State Street for the other custodians.", "And so I point that out, because that's if we secure that position, which we're in the position to do. The ability to get into the front office with data and analytics services which not only provide some revenue uplift but importantly protects the core franchise that provides differentiation. So those are the three or four things I would just highlight that the things that we're investing in which we think have revenue accounted to them, but also importantly differentiate the core products.", "Operator", "We have another question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Brian Bedell", "Just to clarify a couple of things in the guidance. For the expense guidance given that you see operating leverage. I assume that includes the charges for Beacon. And Eric, if you just want to outline what you think those might be? And then also I think the prior question asked about market return assumptions within the guidance. And I didn't get exactly what that was if you could reiterate that?", "Eric Aboaf", "Sure. On the expense side on Beacon, the fee operating leverage guidance is I think pretty free down the middle of the fairway, right. We know what we expect on revenues and is and against that our expectations so quarterly expenses. I think you saw that this quarter we had a good sized restructuring charge, that's partly because we tend to look forward. The accounting guidance that encourages us to do that and also we were laying out our plans for 2018. And so we saw through what are -- what's the range of areas in which we're restructuring, and we follow the guidance to take that on.", "The guidance here on operating leverages exiting future restructuring. And I think what we've tell you as we don't want to restructure every quarter, that's a little clunky. We do want to be mindful though as new operating is come up what are they and take action on those. And I think our perspective is if there are new opportunities that come up from time-to-time, we'd expect additional benefits that come and add to the $550 million of Beacon benefits accordingly.", "And I hopefully that clarifies the on the expense side, we're expecting market growth I think in line with consensus, I think there is a general point of view that markets will continue to take up this year, there is a range of economist out there. We\u2019ve looked at that range and said let's think about the midpoint of that and there is -- I just said there is optimism in that general optimism and we've included that in the outlook.", "Brian Bedell", "On the expenses, you had 385 million through the Beacon charger now. What do you expect terminal Beacon charge to be in? And again, is that actually in 2018 expense guidance?", "Eric Aboaf", "I think the way to think about this is as Jay described. I mean Beacon is becoming, right, has become kind of a way of life and way we do business. And so we can try to keep announcing a program or adding to the program or new program, but what we would like to move to is certainly as we communicating with you all in the analysts and investor community is that we want to do Beacon every year, right. And you've seen the rate of savings, the $175 million two years ago, 150 last year, we expect 150 this year it's about 2 percentage points of improvement each year, right, on our expense base. And obviously that accumulates through which is really valuable from an earnings and shareholders prospective.", "I think as we go forward, there are well occasionally be some restructuring charges, if I knew enough now and I had to find actions, I know the account rules, I would be taking charges. Now I will say we try to look forward and we try to look forward over the next few quarter, as I just said it's hard to me to say that we will not come up with new initiatives and new benefit. And so if we see areas of benefit I can take a 550 of benefit. At that point, we will do the right thing and if necessary, not all initiatives take restructuring, but if necessary, we will consider some amount out more. We just don\u2019t want to do that every quarter and we certainly call it out, if we haven't.", "Brian Bedell", "Okay that's fair enough. And then on the fee revenue growth of 4% to 5%, just can you parse it out just between the recurring business the asset servicing, the asset management versus the volume and volatility related business whether you think you see better growth in the core asset servicing, asset management versus the volatility. I think you mentioned you'd expect volatility to remain retain. And then maybe just to tack on, Jay, what you said about you gave a good example with data GX as an example of digitization, helping the revenue growth profile. Is that, is the incremental revenue growth opportunities from the things that you done with Beacon, also a significant part of the 4% to 5% fee growth for '18?", "Joseph Hooley", "Let me start on the fee outlook. I think you\u2019re looking for enormous amount of detail and in truth, we don\u2019t really know that the future will hold. So we're trying to give you an overall fee guidance, which is why we gave a range. I think within that there is servicing fee, you seen the pattern. Over the last year or years all I think you can use that as some trending. On asset management that\u2019s done well and with market with positive markets, it does positively well to just as you will think about last year versus next year you've got the GE acquisition that helps by half of the year, so that you should factor that in. And then trading, it's just could be what it could be. And I think we would always want to be careful there, but we're not going to give guidance kind of line by line and because I think it's at that point it's a little to precise in an accurate and we're just trying to give you some new directional implications, hopefully that's enough.", "Operator", "Another question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "So I guess just to clarify on the restructuring charges. It sounds if I'm hearing what would you said the right way like there is a bit of the change in mindset. I mean historically they've been almost every quarter, it sounds like going forward there going to be more occasional when there is something really specific that you want to work on. Am I hearing that right?", "Eric Aboaf", "Yes, I think that's a good way to summarize.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "And then just on BlackRock and that business exiting, can you give a quick update on kind of how that flows out over the course as 2018? And is there any lumpiness that we are going to see in the numbers as a result of that.", "Joseph Hooley", "Yes, Geoffrey, this is Jay. I will make a comment on that. As I think we've said in prior quarters, we would expect the transition to commence sometime mid first half of the year and these can take a year or longer to progress, that's probably the best I can give you. But importantly it's all factored into as Eric mentioned our fee revenue guidance. So it takes time for these things to happen.", "Operator", "Another question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Steven Duong", "This is Steven Duong for Gerard. First question just on your dividend, your payout ratios is around 25%. Is there a level and you guys expect to bring it to in the long run especially given your valuations?", "Eric Aboaf", "Steven, it's Eric. There is not a level at this point that we feel wedded to either on our percentage basis or a dollar basis. I think we'll continue to do the financial and economic work on one hand just doing through as you have a higher and higher PE and to adjust the mix of buyback and dividend, but there is on one hand of that's we do and I think all the other banks are probably going to consider doing that given market trading level. On the other hand what we have also been doing is being in touch with some of our largest share holders and certainly valuing your opinion about, do they prefer a certain mix of dividends versus buybacks because we're certainly open to input. I think what's important to us if I step back is that as earnings grow and EPS grows that we share that with shareholders as much as we can, and that's why you see us taking the dividends up. Certainly, we're going to consider shareholders actively we as we go into CCAR this year for example.", "Steven Duong", "Thanks for the color there. And then just in your presentation you'd mentioned that you guys had reduced manual touches on trades by 30% since 2015. Is there a dollar amount you're aware of that that's bucked through the bottom line? And is there a further target of reducing the manual touches too?", "Joseph Hooley", "Steve, let me, this is Jay. Let me comment on that. We put that out there as just more symbolic to what we're trying to achieve here, which is we get a lot of input client trade data. And our goal is that that enters electronically and passes through our system electronically. And what we've referenced there is eliminating manual transactions, transactions that have to be manually fixed in order to see them balance sheet internally. So we have internal metrics, none of which will be particularly helpful for you, but we do measure all the stuff. And the more important thing is this whole straight through processing, which is to connect our systems internally which is in some respects what Beacon is all about so that as information enters as electrically that passes all the way throughout the other side. And that has all the obvious benefits of better service, lower cost and it enables this, it frees up this information so the data can be used for other purposes.", "Eric Aboaf", "And I would just add, there is a host of metrics one and two levels down below that. And across our accounting platform and systems across our product line and businesses around unit cost as you'd expect. Straight through processing is important but can actually measure at many, many individual points in the chain. And our perspective as we continue to build out Beacon on one hand, but now with our as you seen, we've refined our organizational structure where we've added more to the operations on a global basis. We creating a real operations and production organization which is almost quite so size of what it was relative to the client facing business activity. That gives us even larger area in which we can systemically drive that straight through processing in those kind of unit cost improvements and efficiencies.", "Operator", "Another question from Vivek Juneja of JP Morgan. Your line is open.", "Vivek Juneja", "Jay, first question for you. You talked a little bit about where you are in the whole processes digitization. You had a competitor who's talked about stepping things up. Where do you stand and given that you're leaving a lot of a tax reform benefit stuck to the bottom line? And even sort of give us an outlook where you expect to be on that?", "Joseph Hooley", "Sure, Vivek, happy to do that. I mean as you, now I don't have perfect visibility on to the competitive landscape, but I do feel pretty good about where we are relative to Beacon. And I build a little bit of a story starting with for a long time States Street has had good discipline around common systems. We made a number of acquisitions in the last 15 years as we acquired, we've moved to common accounting systems cash and security system, so we have great starting point. Beacon as I was mentioning earlier represents the digitization of connecting all these systems up together and taking advantage of through processing.", "And your question of where are we in that journey, we're third the way into it, just pick a number and we've got a very high percentage of those incoming trade that I referenced earlier come to on an automated business but in my perfect world I think about the fund accounting activity that we do for 10's of 1000 of portfolio is all over the world. A trade would come and it would hit the accounting books, it would hit the cash books it would hit the pricing books and you will have a virtual system where you could place a portfolio virtually throughout the day.", "So that\u2019s my and once you get there you essentially have hands free fund accounting operation where everything is virtual and automated which would take all the manual cost out, it would as I say allow one to calculate in net asset value throughout the day and most importantly and real price here, I said this consistently over the years is freeing up that data, if you have that data available on a real time basis what you can do through data GX and other sources is where the future is in this business.", "So that\u2019s I think on a relative basis but we seem to be ahead of the pact from my standpoint, we had a better starting point, I think we got to add this earlier. The other thing to your question as that I would say is, we're going as fast as we can go, we don\u2019t feel constraint by investment but when you're changing systems the way we're that we're operating day in and day out is that there is a certain pacing and there is so much, you can always go so fast without getting damage. So we're investing at the optimum or maximum pace that we can give in the change that we're invoking.", "Vivek Juneja", "Eric, a question for you on the tax front. I hear you you're getting some of the benefits from the tax reforms. We're just trying to triangulate all the operating and GAAP and future one metric. As I step back and think about it, are you changing the amount of tax advantage investments? Are you reducing it? Are you increasing it? Are you trying to get a sense of what's going on underneath? And because you're going down 4% to 5%, but you have the GAAP rate doesn\u2019t going up quite as much, if you can just help with that?", "Eric Aboaf", "Vivek, let me try to describe how you get to the GAAP rate. I think tax advantage investments for us will be roughly comparable in '18 versus '17. And if you put that in with the new stated rates on federal state and then for together that what gives us the about 16% rate that we expect in '18, and the roughly $150 million of benefit. I think there is complexity in tax rates. The headline rate that I think go down by about that 5 points because of the tax advantage investments tend to be dollar base credit, those don\u2019t go to the effective tax rate in the same way as net income continues to grow and you need to have a version of that but they are also affected by the tax rate.", "So there is couple of different moving parts, parts. I think as we step back we are pleased with the landing and we expect to be a 16% tax rate in '18 we think that's going to be with that said that's better than many other banks but I think that's certain by the tax planning we've done over the years and that rate and we are going a bit of the range right 15% to 17% I'm just using the midpoint we'll see where that goes going forward. I think specifically as it gets to tax advantage investments we have we intend to continue but if that activity.", "Clearly, we're going to employees or benefits of that activity under the old rates but they are certainly still benefits and then the new rate on a volatile pre-return spaces, it's still attractive. I think there is going to be a question of do you get the same amount of tax managed deals out there that are available in the marketplace, do you get more win, less solar or vice versa, light tech. We think there is going to be some amount of market adjustments and I think if that ends up, that was market adjustments end up changing the amount that we will do, we will certainly signal that. But for the time being in at least dollar terms, it will be roughly consistent last year versus expectations for '18.", "Operator", "Another question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW. Your line is open.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "It is one clarification question on your outlook on Slide 19. The way we're looking at when you give the 7% or 8% revenue growth and 10% to 13% NII growth. Is the base that you're using just simply those for your numbers on Slide 18?", "Eric Aboaf", "It's Eric. For the left column right on Page 19 which is the historical operating base of outlook, it's still like for like-for-like outlook then you would use the figures from Slide 18 because that's the historical basis that we just reported in '17. When you move the right side of 19 which is a GAAP based outlook yes if you go back into our financial supplement and we can the IR team is concerning hope you do that and use those amount as the basis so that you have an apple-to-apples per trial. I think then on the EPS basis and net income basis you are close the line items sometimes a big different and we can I think those are well described in the supplement because we show both operating and GAAP and we can certainly help you walk through it if you have any questions.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "And then on the tax reform I know you outline three different ways that you are investing the savings from the tax reform and it is the way why we think about that it's going to be year one investment I expected some acceleration and year two especially in light what some of the competitors maybe doing what's greater investment that what you are doing in your one?", "Eric Aboaf", "And I think you have to probably unpack those three different line items, the adding to the matches and the refine contribution would be a recurring kind of a cost of the investing and training, some of that's technology so that's front ended it trails off a little bit. And then the third which is just to increase the match, we would make that determination in this year into the future, so it's a little bit of a mix Brain.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "But are you expecting more wage inflation I guess in the second year above and beyond where we did not expect from that increase?", "Eric Aboaf", "No, I think if you from an outlook standpoint I think we've got wage inflation from a merit standpoint in '15 to '17. We had it in '14 and '15 to '16. We have some into '18. And I think there is a tradition in some amount of merit increase. So we were supportive of that tradition. I don't think we see an acceleration or deceleration at this point.", "Operator", "We have a last question from the line of Steven Duong of JP Morgan. Your line is open.", "Steven Duong", "Hi guys. Actually, Vivek asked my question, but I'm just going to ask one little additional add-on to that. If you did decide in the future to reduce the amount of tax advantage to investments because basically the tax rate is now lower. So arguably of the value of this was less. Would you then see an offset on the revenue side? Because the way I've been thinking about is that, I mean you guys have been very aggressive user of tax advantage securities, which is why you have this little tax rate. And I just wondered if the appetite in '19 and '20, is there for those type of securities or would you rather let the tax rate drift up and instead investment securities got higher yields and would that be a net neutral?", "Eric Aboaf", "It's Eric, Steven. Let me answer this in two ways. I think if you do less tax advantage investment then you're right. We have less revenue amortization less of counter revenue and then less tax benefits. So you have the right way around the there. I think if you step back, there is I think number of different tax advantage investment areas. There is Muniz, there is light tech, there is wind and solar that's the major category. And each of those we think may or may not adjust to some extent.", "And each of those we run through a kind of return screening process. Now Muniz somewhat say won't adjust very much because it's primarily consumer based market, we'll need to see if that's the case or does it adjust. Light tech, there is a long tradition in. I think wind and solar, many would say there would be some realignment because of expectations of investors as what they need to earn.", "So I think it's early to tell. I think we say though that the returns have always been quite attractive impact and tax advantage investments. And if you adjust the rate by the amount we have, there is still healthy returns. And so we feel we need to quickly change our tactics and strategy. And our perspective is that they are still valuable to do at these tax rates and in this form. But obviously as some market evolves, we'll always be we're always reassessing and we'll do accordingly.", "Steven Duong", "So, is it fair to say that you continue to invest at the same level and then there will be no upward creep all else being equal and 15% to 17% in the tax rate?", "Eric Aboaf", "No, just to be careful there, if you invest at the dollar amount in each year as you have higher net income, your effective tax rate starts to creep up. Alternatively, if you invest the same amount of growth in tax advantage income, if that growth in dollar term and percentage terms is similar the growth in EBIT then the effective tax rate stays relatively constant. And I think that's a bridge for us across '19 and '20, as we learn about how the market evolves and it goes back to Betsy's questions about where we think tax rates will go.", "And I think as learn more this year, there will be a lot -- there're number interpretations we need to see from the treasury department right, but regard to this taxable change, we need to see if there are some market adjustments. And all these and some of asset management investment then once we do that, I think like this year we should have a better bid on '19 and we will share that with you and all the other.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time.
