And welcome to the Seagate Technology Fiscal Third Quarter 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Liz and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participate are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over it to Kate Scolnick, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Please proceed, Kate.", "Kate Scolnick - Seagate Technology Plc", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call. Joining me today from Seagate's executive team are Steve Luczo, Chairman and CEO; Dave Morton, Executive Vice President and CFO; Dave Mosley, President and COO; and Phil Brace, President of Cloud Systems and Silicon Group. We've posted our press release and detailed supplemental information for our March quarter of fiscal 2017 on our Investor Relations site at Seagate.com.", "For the last few years, we have communicated our belief that data growths trends will continue to drive storage exabyte demand and the related measurement of capacity per drive and that units are less relevant to mobile cloud environments and future client addressable markets.", "In today's newly deployed architectures and applications, high-capacity mass storage is critical. Importantly for Seagate, it is the advanced technology and heads of media, as well as manufacturing absorption of these technologies and test capacity absorption that will most significantly impact our financial performance.", "Going forward, we will continue orienting our conference call remarks and supplemental data to key market exabyte results and other business metrics and discontinue providing unit detail. We recognize this represents a change for the investment community in the short term, but believe it better reflects how we are managing and measuring our business performance internally and will help our industry to be evaluated more effectively in a forward-looking manner.", "During today's call, we will review the highlights for the March quarter and provide the company outlook for the June quarter and then open the call for questions. We are planning for the call today to go approximately half an hour, and we will do our best to accommodate your questions following our prepared remarks, as time permits.", "We will refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures on this call. Non-GAAP figures are reconciled to GAAP figures on our supplemental information available on the Investor section of our website. We have not reconciled our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.", "As a reminder, this conference call contains forward-looking statements about the company's anticipated future operating and financial performance, customer demand, technology and product development advancements and general market conditions. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current views and assumptions and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date. Actual results may vary materially from today's statements. Information concerning our risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause results to differ from these forward-looking statements are contained in the company's SEC filings and supplemental information posted on the Investor section of the company's website.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Luczo. Please go ahead, Steve.", "Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc", "Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. For today's call, I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business. Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the June quarter as well as an update for the calendar year.", "For the March quarter, Seagate achieved: revenues of approximately $2.7 billion, up 3% year-over-year; GAAP gross margins of 30.5%; net income of $194 million; and diluted earnings per share of $0.65. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved: gross margins of 31.4%, up 870 basis points year-over-year; net income of $329 million; and diluted earnings per share of $1.10. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $426 million, up 108% year-over-year.", "Our March quarter results reflect a relatively stable demand environment and improved profitability year-over-year. HDD exabyte shipments for the March quarter were 65.5 exabytes, up approximately 18% year-over-year. Average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was approximately 1.8 terabytes per drive, up 27% year-over-year. ASPs of $67 were sequentially flat for the March quarter and up 10% year-over-year. Our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group demonstrated 19% year-over-year growth in the March quarter, with particular strength in our flash-based solutions.", "We are pleased with Seagate's execution in the March quarter, both in terms of our ability to maximize the profitability of our storage technology portfolio and our continued execution on operational efficiencies.", "I will turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more detail on our operational activities.", "David H. Morton, Jr. - Seagate Technology Plc", "Thanks, Steve. For the March quarter, Seagate's addressable HDD market was relatively in line with our forecast. We continue to drive our HDD product sales towards our higher capacity products across our portfolio, benefiting both our revenue and margin results year-over-year.", "HDD enterprise revenues were up 3% year-over-year, reflecting exabyte growth of 20% year-over-year and representing 36% of our total consolidated revenue. Within this, nearline revenues were up 9% year-over-year and represented 24% of our total consolidated revenue. Hyperscale nearline revenues were up strong double digits, and our 8 terabyte nearline product continues to be our leading revenue SKU.", "Our HDD client high-capacity growth opportunities include consumer, surveillance, DDR and NAS markets. Revenues from these markets were up 25% year-over-year, reflecting exabyte growth of 41% year-over-year and representing approximately 28% of the total consolidated revenue. Average capacity per drive across these markets was over 2 terabyte per drive, up 22% year-over-year.", "In our mature mission critical and PC client markets, revenues declined year-over-year, as expected, and exabytes declined slightly. PC client revenues continue to represent approximately 25% of the total consolidated revenue.", "Operating expenses for the March quarter were $550 million on a GAAP basis and $443 million on a non-GAAP basis. Total consolidated expenses were slightly higher than forecast, primarily due to non-executive variable compensation.", "Capital expenditures were $95 million for the March quarter for maintenance capital and manufacturing footprint redeployment supporting the continued ramp of new HDD products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment. Our capital expenditures and maintenance capital requirement levels are expected to be less than 5% of our revenue for the remainder of the fiscal year. And through our manufacturing consolidation activities, Seagate is and will continue to operate at, or very near, full capacity.", "Cash flow from operations in the March quarter was $426 million and free cash flow was $331 million. These results include approximately $150 million in cash payments related to restructuring charges and biannual non-executive variable compensation. Excluding these items, cash flow from operations would have been approximately $576 million.", "Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the March quarter in $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 297 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the March quarter, which will be payable on July 5.", "In January, we successfully completed a debt offering of $1.25 billion of investment-grade financing with a weighted average interest rate of less than 5%. This funding will serve as a pre-financing of our 2018 and our 2021 notes and other corporate purposes. We have called our 2021 7% senior notes with a payment of $158 million scheduled for May 1.", "Interest expense for the March quarter was $60 million and will be similar in the June quarter. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment-grade framework, given our staggered maturities and low interest rate.", "Our March quarter results continue to reflect strong execution of our business model objectives and our ability to generate strong cash flow from our Storage portfolio. Combined with our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group, we view that approximately 80% of our Storage product revenue opportunities in calendar 2017 and beyond have growth potential.", "While we are still in the process of executing a number of our cost actions in our manufacturing sites and at the corporate level, we believe the combination of these cost alignment activities and the competitiveness of our HDD product portfolio will continue to benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of calendar year 2017 and beyond.", "I would now like to turn the call back to Steve.", "Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc", "Thanks, Dave. A few weeks ago, we launched our Data Age 2025 study with IDC that addresses data growth, location and new business verticals over the next several years. With a forecast of 163 zettabytes of information being created over the next few years, HDD mass storage technology will continue to be a vital player in maximizing the value of data across many new verticals.", "We believe continuing to optimize our full HDD product portfolio to the structural shifts in application workloads towards higher capacity will prove to be a resilient and competitive marketplace strategy. By this time next year, we anticipate less than 10% of our HDD technology portfolio will be exposed to competing flash devices.", "The competitiveness of our HDD portfolio is a result of our long-term investment in delivering world-class storage technology and our dedication to product innovation. A few recent portfolio highlights include: in the nearline market, our 10 terabyte Helium HDD is continuing to ramp with large hyperscale cloud service provider customers. Customer evaluation feedback on our 12 terabyte Helium HDDs has been positive, and we plan to start volume shipments in the June quarter. We believe our opportunities in the nearline market will continue to span across multiple capacity points as our customers evolve their capacity infrastructure for a growing multiple of enterprise workload applications.", "We are successfully refreshing a number of products in our portfolio, utilizing our fourth generation SMR technology. And to-date, we have sold over 35 million HDDs into the nearline client and consumer markets with this technology. We believe our technical leadership in areal density will continue through calendar 2017.", "Our planned 1 terabyte and 2 terabyte product refreshes for the PC compute markets are on schedule. And this week at NAB, we announced new consumer products including our first offering for the drone marketplace, the Fly Drive, which includes enough space for 60 hours of 4K video footage and developed in partnership with top drone manufacturer, DJI.", "From an R&D technology perspective, we continue to invest in our next-generation areal density HAMR technology. With products on the road map for the late 2018 calendar year, we believe we are leading the market in developing and bringing to market this important cost-benefit solution for mass storage capacity needs.", "Turning to the market outlook, we remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment and IT spending trends. For the June quarter, we are expecting to achieve revenues of between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion. Our expectations reflect a seasonal decline in revenue, our desire to maintain lower inventories going into the summer months and some conservatism due to the potential impact of component shortages in DRAM and NAND on various aspects of our customers' businesses in the server, CSP and client space.", "We are raising our gross margin expectations for the June quarter to 31%, and we are targeting a new range for calendar 2017 of 29% to 33%. As Dave indicated, operating expenses will trend sequentially down to expect approximately $430 million in the June quarter. We anticipate operating expenses will continue to decline through the rest of the calendar year and exit the December quarter at or below $400 million. Cash flow from operations will be down slightly sequentially, reflecting lower seasonal revenue and cash payout related to our elimination of U.S. vacation accrual.", "We continue to expect overall exabyte demand to grow double digits in calendar 2017 over 2016, representing modest revenue growth opportunities for Seagate. Assuming market conditions remain intact, we continue to believe Seagate will achieve earnings per share of at least $4.50 in calendar 2017, and we will provide a fiscal 2018 outlook on our July call.", "Thank you for joining us on the call today. And we'll now open the call up for questions and answers.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from the line of Joe Wittine with Longbow Research.", "Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC", "Hi. Thanks. Maybe discuss your go-forward exabyte growth expectations by the segments as you lay them out. And specifically...", "Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc", "We're not going to provide exabyte growth by segments. That's highly competitive information.", "Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Maybe I should ask...", "Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc", "We still believe in exabyte growth that's consistent with what we've said over the last couple of years. Exabyte growth in excess of areal density growth.", "Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC", "Can nearline still grow in the mid to high-30%s this year after the 20% start? I ask because the remaining quarters have some pretty difficult comps. So maybe talk a little bit more detail with that.", "Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc", "Yes, I do think they can. As you see the 10s and 12s start to ramp. I think the first half of the year has been an issue both of what's really the right marketplace for the 10 terabyte, especially with the 12 kind of coming right behind it, as well as the CSPs have been \u2013 and we've kind of expected this the whole time, that the second half of the year was going to be stronger than the first half of the year. So I think the combination of stronger demand signals for the second half plus the rotation of the portfolio that's going to have 8s, 10s and 12s and not just pretty much 8s, you're going to see exabyte growth there that's going to continue.", "Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And then as a follow-up, price per exabyte declined at the lowest rate in a few years. It's now the second quarter you're kind of in a 13% to 14% range versus the low 20%s range that the industry has been in. What is a good expectation to model going forward, given you said you're generally near peak capacity?", "Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc", "Yes. I think that's a great question. I think we've got to continue to be very careful on the pricing, especially, again, as you go from 10s and 12s. On the one hand, the customer demand is certainly there for those higher capacity drives, but the industry's capability to deliver that technology is coming through solutions that effectively cost more.", "Either you're adding more heads in disk or other technology to handle that kind of workload. And especially when you're adding more heads in disk, you have to obviously be very careful about the aggressive price takedowns that have occurred because somehow you have to absorb the extra parts. So I think you're going to see some resolution where those price declines are going to continue to stabilize just because we have to afford the new technology.", "And, of course, we're not going to end at 10s or 12s. We're going to have to get to 16 and then 20 and 32, and that's all going to take a lot of technology. So we definitely believe you're going to see stabilization in that pricing.", "Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Thanks, Steve.", "Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc", "Yes. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Edward Parker with BTIG.", "Edward Parker - BTIG LLC", "Thanks. Steve, I wanted to ask you about price elasticity and I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the impact of higher NAND pricing in the quarter on your HDD business. Are you seeing higher unit sales because of higher prices for SSDs or higher unit sales because of the lack of availability for SSDs?", "And then secondly, how do you think about price elasticity across your portfolio? And how could that change as you look at your business over the next couple of years?", "Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc", "Well, I think the NAND shortages are interesting because, at the end of the day, I think it's more challenging for the technology industry to deal with the shortages than it is maybe beneficial to HDDs because of some comparison on a 500 gig. I mean, the reality is even a 500-gig NAND drive, at today's prices or even at six months ago prices, aren't remotely competitive to an HDD price.", "I do think that the lack of availability of NAND in certain market segments results in people then shifting their strategies around do they use HDDs or not. So I think, for example, the NAND companies are constantly optimizing where do they shift their NAND. Does to go into phones? Does it go into the data centers? Does it go into the servers or does it go into the PCs? And depending on the grade of flash you're building, the capacity plans you put in six months ago and then what customers are asking for, there's this constant re-optimization of where the NAND is flowing.", "I think in the short term probably, and I think HP indicated this on their call two quarters ago, that they felt that the PC industry was being constrained a bit on NAND. I think that probably has shifted some longer-term strategy around product portfolios that breathes some more life into the HDD space, in that people don't want to be caught short with storage technology of any type. And, of course, there again we're talking about 128 or 256.", "For us, it's really an issue of getting the volumes ramped on the 1TB, where we have a substantial lead, and then offering that product to the PC companies that maybe today are taking a lot of 500- gig product because at volume, obviously, it's a single-disk and two-headed product, so we can be quite competitive. So I think from a Seagate perspective, we feel that the shortage overall might marginally help us on the client space as we move through the calendar year and maybe even to the beginning of next year.", "I think where it's more problematic for the industry in general, and I mean everyone, is if it's constraining build-outs at all at the CSP space, that with the DRAM shortages. And we have seen indications of certain deployments being delayed because they basically can't get all the component technology that they need across the board. We experience that a little bit in our own CSSG business, where we obviously need to get flash to sell our flash drives.", "We have a big demand profile for our current-generation products, which are quite competitive. But we're constrained by as much as $40 million or $50 million in revenue in terms of can we get the flash or not. So that's one of the issues that we're going to be working hard and one of the reasons that I think there is some opportunity on the revenue side if we can secure that NAND. So it's a pretty dynamic situation that you're on top of.", "I don't know that it's as easy to say that it's good or bad. I think there's some good to it and there's some pressures from it. We've always said it's a better world if there's a lot of NAND because that means people have more devices in their hand and they're creating more data. And that's still our thesis.", "Next question?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.", "Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Good morning. Steve, can you just elaborate a little more about your comment that less than 10% of your portfolio would be exposed to competing flash devices? Like over what timeframe are you referring and how do you get there? Is that walking away from categories, or is that just a mix change towards more cloud service providers?", "Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc", "Well, I'll let Mosley go into more details, but we've already walked away from those markets. Basically, again, we don't participate in the 500 gigabyte market really today. Ad that's because we have a technology lead and we want to leverage that. And, of course, the recent price increases from the NAND folks have made a 500 gigabyte drive unattainable, for sure. Even the 256s, I think we've heard price talks in the $60 or $70 range, which is pretty amazing. So I think it's a more longer-term trend, and I'll have Dave talk to it, but it doesn't really talk to the CSPs. The CSPs are enabled by all tiers of storage.", "William David Mosley, Ph.D. - Seagate Technology Plc", "Yeah, Rich. This is Dave. I would go back to Ed's question as well to dovetail on to that. So we have to model what the NAND pricing is going to be out in time. And then we model where Seagate wants to be selling product; is it 500 gigabytes, 1 terabyte, 2 terabyte and so on. And we look at those price banding for our various market segments and we make those estimates.", "So we what we said is, over the next year, it'll develop such that less than 10% of our portfolio is exposed. I think by this time next year, it will be far less than 10%. And we're working hard to make sure that happens, make sure we move up in capacity points. Of course, some of that's what the customers want and some of that is dictated by where exactly the NAND pricing is. But that's how we run the model.", "Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC", "Great. And then just lastly as a follow-up, the Systems business you said a good quarter on the flash side, but embedded in there is also the systems that are going to some enterprise players, like HP, for the mid-range MSA stuff. So in light of the Nimble acquisition, just how should he with think about the Storage Systems business?", "Philip G. Brace - Seagate Technology Plc", "Yeah, Rich. This is Phil. The Storage Systems business certainly in the current quarter had a good performance as well, year-over-year growth. And we expect to see year-over-year growth going forward. Customer activity in that space continues to be really high, particularly in the OEM space.", "What we see is that as OEMs look to be figure out where they spend their R&D dollars, they certainly are making opportunities available for Seagate for us to come in and work with them on higher levels of integration. And that's particularly true as we start to have higher levels of integration between, I'll say, our component-related products, like SSDs and HDs, and our system-level products. So, overall, that business continues to grow nicely.", "Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc", "We have time for one more question I think.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Rob Cihra with Guggenheim Partners.", "Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Hi. Thank you very much. I guess I wanted to follow up on Rich's question on the Systems business. If you go back, you guys have made a couple of acquisitions both in Systems and with LSI on the flash side. And yet it's still well under 10% of revenue. I was just wondering from a strategic standpoint, as Systems are moving higher up the enterprise stack, is that strategically a big part of what you guys are looking to do do you think over the next few years, or is that kind of taking a back seat? Thank you.", "Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc", "Yeah, I don't think it's really changed much in terms of our original intention. We've always felt there's an opportunity in the Systems business in the higher value-add categories because our Systems business, at least a good hunk of it, has a fair amount of software competency to it as well. And so we serve OEMs in that space. And more and more so, we're getting traction with the cloud service providers that are looking at solutions beyond the device level.", "So I think, from our perspective, we've always viewed this business as attractive in terms of its core business of selling into OEMs as well as servicing cloud service providers at one level. But really the opportunity to, as architectures evolve and different customer needs evolve, to have the capability to optimize the devices, either at the device level, the sub-system level or the systems level. And if you don't have the software capability to do that, you really can't take advantage of what we think will be a potentially significant long-term trend.", "I think the issue is, one, is that how does that evolve, over what period of time and what does it cost you in the mean time? And so I think, for us, we continue to work the financial model so the Systems business is profitable to the overall business and then gives us the option to grow into some of these markets if we see either OEMs or CSPs decide that they want to see solutions at the systems level versus the device level. And we still believe that's the opportunity in front of us.", "I would say, if anything, over the last six to 12 months we've seen and had dialogues with customers that have us more encouraged about that opportunity versus less encouraged. So we are as committed as we have been to growing that business to what we with think will be a meaningful business in the overall portfolio.", "Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Makes sense. Thank you.", "Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc", "Okay. Great. All right. Thanks, everyone. We appreciate the time you've taken this morning. And I want to again thank our employees, our customers, our suppliers and our shareholders. And we look forward to speaking with you again in July.

On the phone with me today are Dave Wickersham, President and Chief Operating Officer, Charles Pope, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Brian Dexheimer, Executive Vice President and Chief Sales and Marketing Officer. ", "I'll focus my comments on the overall highlights of the 2007 fiscal year, as well as the fourth quarter specifically. Following that I'll turn to our outlook for fiscal 2008 and share with you our review of the key factors that will enforce our performance in the year ahead. I'll then turn it over to Brian, Dave and Charles to discuss details of our market, operating and financial results respectively. ", "Fiscal 2007 was a year in which we clearly demonstrated and further extended our industry leaders. Our operating performance or results reflect success of our very deliberate efforts to execute against the number of important objectives, including completing the Maxtor renovation, continuing to advance our technology in cost leadership positions, maintaining our leadership in key markets and introducing new products in core markets while developing the additional values streams in new and emerging markets. ", "On an annual basis, Seagate reported $11.4 billion in revenue, a 23% increase year-over-year. We shipped a total of 159 million units and captured a significant portion of the total available market with a 35% share. We are pleased with these results as our revenue and shipment numbers are unmatched by any other disc drive company in the industry. In the fourth quarter specifically, while maintaining our leadership position at desktop and consumer electronic markets. ", "We also greatly increased an already strong position in the notebook market, and further advanced our substantial lead in the enterprise market. Our product program progress to plan during the quarter, and we are particularly pleased with the continued advancement of our transition to perpendicular recording. We are ahead of our announced transition schedule with outstanding yields, quality, and reliability across the board. ", "I'll like to comment now on some of the highlights for the year. From a financial perspective, we continue to take a disciplined approach to efficiently deploying capital, and maintaining our technology and product leadership. Consequently we sustain and continue to invest in infrastructure and capital equipment needed to support and grow the business. ", "In fiscal year 2007 we increased unit shipments by 34% to 159 million from 119 million in the prior year. We continued to improve our cost structure, lowering our breakeven point to 12 to 13 points of gross margin. This compares to breakeven points of 16 to 17 points three years ago. We continue to expand our market coverage, and realize new revenue stream from investments in technologies such as full disk encryption, products such as our feature rich FreeAgent line, and adjacencies such as our services business. ", "Additionally, we completed shares repurchases totaling over $200 million during the current quarter, for a total of over $1.5 billion for the fiscal year. Our commitment to repurchasing Seagate stock demonstrates our confidence in the company's strategic plan as well as the long-term liability of the industry. ", "The fundamentals of Seagate business have remained consistently strong. We deliver solid revenue growth and generate the cash flow necessary for investments that will support both future product development and overall business group. As an industry leader, our scale and expertise have allowed us to continue introducing innovative products in the market place while simultaneously reducing cost in the company's breakeven point, plus combating the pricing pressures. This flexibility allows us to respond quickly to market changes, and enhances our ability to remain focused on growing the company and generating value for our shareholders over the long-term. ", "One significant effect of what we have seen in the recent environment and the environment in neither ahead is how we will handle guidance moving forward. We've determined as pricing volatility continues to challenge the industry, providing annual guidance on revenue and earnings is not particularly valuable. We have decided to only provide quarterly estimates going forward. We will, however, continue providing annual information on certain aspects of the business that will help you analyze the company's performance. Further, annual information will be provided at our Analyst Meeting in September. ", "In summary, this fiscal year was one in which Seagate made great strides on the product and technology front, maintained an impressive overall market share, and advanced or retained our leadership position within key arenas. ", "Looking ahead to fiscal 2008, we see market trends are continuing to drive robust demand for storage and significant opportunities for growth. I am confident that we will be able to capitalize on those opportunities given our position within the industry, while consistently delivering sound financials and operating performance. ", "We will continue our commitment to growing the business, executing our strategy, and generating meaningful value for our shareholders. ", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Brian to provide more details on our performance in the market during the quarter. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Thanks, Bill. Demand in fiscal 2007 was again very strong and led to record shipments for the industry and Seagate. Seagate shipped a record 159 million units during the year, representing the continued growth of storage applications in client/server environments, as well as clearly underlying this explosive growth in digital content, particularly in the home. In fact, we believe that in the past year more terabytes of storage were shifted into homes than businesses, as consumers continue to aggressively create, share, and collect digital content. ", "Evidence of this can be seen in the tripling of users in the past year of services such as YouTube, MySpace and iTunes. The more than 120,000 new blogs created globally each day and the more than 250 billion digital pictures taken in the past year. We view these trends as extremely positive for the industry and Seagate for the next few years to come. ", "Moving on to the June quarter, we are pleased that we were able to execute through our plans. In general, industry demand was in line with our expectations and we believe the overall total available market was slightly more than 110 million units, up 11% year-over-year. ", "In the quarter, Seagate retained its overall leadership, shipping 35% of the industry's volume as well as the number one position in Enterprise, Desktop, and CE shipments. ", "Looking towards the September quarter, we expect seasonal growth to bring the overall TAM up about 15% quarter-over-quarter to 125 million to 128 million units, representing year-over-year growth of 10% to 11%. ", "Now just some detail on the individual markets. The Mobile Compute market demand was a bright spot during the quarter as the TAM came in flat to the March quarter, which is slightly higher than our expectation was at the beginning of the quarter. ", "Seagate shipped a record 6.1 million units, an increase of 80% year-over-year and 30% sequentially. A strong trend to our higher capacity products continued as nearly 50% of the industry shipments were in capacity 120 gigabytes or greater. ", "Seagate's average capacity climbed to 100 gigabytes during the quarter. Also, we began initial shipments of our first hybrid network product, as well as our second generation industry leading security product featuring full disk encryption. ", "In the September quarter, we expect strong seasonal uplift in the Mobile Compute TAM. As expected, the TAM and the Consumer Electronics market were slightly down in the June quarter. Seagate maintained its leadership position during the quarter shipping 5 million units, driven primarily by shipments in gaming applications and DVR. ", "During the quarter, we completed a number of successful qualifications of our newest generation of DDR products and experienced the rebound in demand from the more middle levels that characterize the March quarter. We also completed several successful qualifications of the one disc, 60 gigabyte, 1.8 inch product, during the quarter. However due to a shift in market demands for higher capacity platforms in the near term, we've reduced forward-line expectations for these phases. We remain excited about these platforms and view the shift for higher capacity as yet another signal for a strong demand is highly mobile applications, and as a results we remain committed to future generations of products in these categories. ", "We believe the overall stand for the CE market in the September quarter will be seasonally higher, as CE manufacturers prepare for the holiday season. The enterprise market stand and mission-critical applications were slightly lower than expected; demand in the US commercial enterprise markets seems to be the driver of the minor deviation, though the current view for the September quarter indicates a rebalance in more normal demand patterns. ", "Overall we believe the industry shipped 6.9 million units in the June quarter and Seagate maintained its clear leadership in these market shipping 4.3 million units. Additionally the adoption of small form factor drives continued to accelerate during the quarter. As shipments reach 1.6 million units now at 36% of our enterprise business, we also believe first-to-market qualifications and volume rent of our Cheetah 15K 300 gigabyte and small form factor 10K 146 gigabytes products have led to some incremental share gains. ", "Looking forward we expect the enterprise stands in the September quarter to be flat to slightly up. One final note regarding enterprise market, over longer time periods we do observe that the explosive growth of high capacity enterprise class SATA products is likely shifting some demand from traditional machine critical class drives; we view this trend positively and this emerging space has added dramatically to the net-growth profile of the enterprise business, and that market requirements match well with Seagate's technology leadership in customer access- to that end some products in this space, namely our 750 gigabyte drive, in the June quarter we saw a 28% sequential increase in shipments. ", "Now on the desktop compute market, we maintained our leadership positioned by shipping 23.8 million units and a TAM that was expectedly below that of the March quarter. We continue to see average capacity points increase in this market, which we believe favors Seagate's strength in technology and cost leadership. In the June quarter, 35% of the desktop TAM with drives at 250 gigabytes and greater. Seagate once again led the industry and delivered in volume the industry's first 250 gigabyte pro-disc product. ", "In addition two-thirds of our desktop-class drives shipped during the quarter were based on perpendicular recording, and we expect to raise that percentage to more than 90% in the current quarter. We are pricing in general slightly more aggressively than expected, particularly in mid to high cap products early in the quarter. We believe general inventory exceeding the June quarter for Seagate and the industry was under five weeks. ", "We expect the TAM and desktop compute to be seasonally up in the September quarter. Finally in our brands solution business revenue and execution improved sequentially. Consistent with last quarter market dynamics, pricing and competition remains aggressive. This market followed the growth and average capacity of all other markets, where Seagate averaged 3.5 inch shipments reaching over 360 gigabytes. We strongly believe there is additional head room for growth in this space and expect strong seasonal back half of the calendar year. ", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Dave to run an update on our operation. ", "Dave Wickersham", "Thanks, Brian. I'll start with a few comments regarding Seagate's supply of media given Western Digital acquisition of Komag, and then provide some information related to how Seagate executed during the June quarter, and conclude with the discussion of our expected capital investments for fiscal 2008. ", "First and foremost Seagate anticipated adequate supply of finished media and substrates, notwithstanding WDs plans acquisition of Komag. The volume purchase agreement in place with Komag provided Seagate the flexibility and adequate time to address our media and substrate source in needs. In regards to industries supply of finish media and substrate, assuming industry capacity is added as anticipated and the transition to perpendicular media is executed without disruption. We believe the industry has and will continue to have adequate supply of finished media and substrate. ", "Inventory in the June quarter decreased by $38 million, from $832 million to $794 million. Inventory turnover improved slightly to 10.8 turns primarily due to a reduction of $55 million in finished goods. These reductions more than offset an increase in the precious metal inventory required to support our conversion to perpendicular based products. ", "Looking forward to the September quarter, while we will continue to focus on optimizing our supply chain, the impact of precious metal use associated with the volume ramp for perpendicular products will continue to pressure our turnover. Consequently, churns are expected to be approximately 10 in the September quarter. ", "We continue to be very pleased with the successful ramp of our perpendicular products and processes. Perpendicular component and product deals are meeting plans and already exceed the legacy longitudinal products they replaced. ", "Customer qualification continued to progress as expected and in the June quarter we shipped over 28 million drives with perpendicular recording up, from the 17 million shipped in the March quarter. ", "In addition to the successful introduction and ramp of perpendicular based products, we are very pleased that the field reliability of these products is significantly better than that of the longitudinal-based products. We expect to exit calendar year 2007 with a convergent to perpendicular recording largely complete. A significant accomplishment that reflects the product and technology leadership Seagate has consistently demonstrated. ", "As always we aggressively manage the company\u2019s capital investments to align with customer demand and to improve the utilization of capital equipment. Consequently, we further reduced our capital expenditures in fiscal year 2007 to approximately $900 million. Based on the current customer requirements and the planned equipment utilization we expect fiscal year 2008 capital investments to be flat year-over-year. This includes the investment necessary to expand our media and substrate capacity in Asia. ", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Charles. ", "Charles Pope", "Thank you, Dave. You will find the company's press release, 8-K and additional financial information related to Seagate's financial performance, along with a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results and other supplemental information in the Investor Relations section of Seagate's website at seagate.com. ", "Seagate reported June quarter revenue of $2.74 billion and unit shipments of 39.2 million. GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are $541 million and $0.96 respectively. Included in the GAAP results are approximately $27 million of purchased intangible, amortization and other charges associated with the Maxtor and EVault acquisitions. Without these charges and the associated tax effects, non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share was $568 million and $1.01 respectively. ", "At the beginning of the June quarter, we provided a non-GAAP earnings per share outlook of $0.34 to $0.38. However, the reported GAAP and non-GAAP net income per share for the June quarter include the certain non-operating items that were not factored into our original guidance. It is important to understand these non-operating items since the company believes that achieved results at the high end of the range originally provided. ", "First, there is a $29 million restructuring charge which reflects cost associated with ongoing expense reduction activities across the company. Approximately $10 million of the restructuring charge is cash related and will be paid out in fiscal 2008. ", "Second, we wrote off a $4 million equity investment which is reflected in other income and expense. ", "And third, there was a significant favorable book tax rate adjustment that reflects the change to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets that resulted in the benefit to the income statement of approximately $359 million. The adjustments to the valuation allowance will not impact our cash tax rate or cash taxes paid. It is clearly an accounting adjustment. ", "A summary of these items can be found on page seven of the supplemental package on our website. GAAP gross margin for the June quarter was 21.6%. Excluding approximately $11 million of acquisition-related cost, non-GAAP gross margin was 22%. Non-GAAP gross margin was in line with our expectations and roughly flat sequentially when adjusting the March quarter for the favorable benefit of eliminating the fiscal year 2007 variable compensation. ", "Consistent with the March quarter results, there are no costs associated with variable compensation included in cost of goods sold. GAAP, R&D and SG&A costs were $364 million for the June quarter. Excluding costs related to the Maxtor and EVault acquisitions, non-GAAP expenses were $361 million. ", "During the June quarter, Seagate acquired storage-related intellectual property for approximately $9 million. Once again consistent with the March quarter results, there are no costs associated with variable compensation in R&D or SG&A. ", "Slide six has the detail for the adjustments made to GAAP, R&D and SG&A for the June quarter. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities ended the quarter at $1.14 billion. ", "During the 2007 fiscal year, Seagate made capital investments totaling $906 million, of which $218 million occurred in the June quarter. As Dave mentioned, we aggressively focus on aligning capital investments with customer demand, and at the same time continue to improve the utilization of our capital equipment. ", "At our Analyst Day last year in June, we told you to expect $1.35 billion of capital investments for fiscal 2007. As the year progressed, we aligned our capital equipment expenditure to changes in customer demand, utilized the portion of the Maxtor test equipment and benefited from improved yields and utilization of the existing equipment. ", "Cash flow from operations was $373 million for the June quarter. Days sales outstanding was 46, days payable outstanding was 55, both within the normal range. ", "Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter was $201 million, a decrease of approximately $35 million from the March quarter. This decrease is due primarily to a reduction in intangible amortization related to the Maxtor acquisition. ", "We have provided you with our estimated amortization of purchased intangible for fiscal year 2008 on slide 8 of the supplement on information package. ", "During the June quarter, the company took delivery of approximately 9.7 million shares related to its share repurchase plan. The average price of the shares that were delivered was $20.76. For the fiscal year that ended in June, Seagate repurchased approximately 62 million shares at an average price of $24.62. ", "Seagate has made significant progress in its desire to make the Maxtor acquisition a virtue on cash transaction. Since May of 2006, when Seagate closed the acquisition, the company has repurchased just over 78 million shares. The company has authorization to purchase approximately $975 million of additional shares under the current stock repurchase program. ", "For the September quarter, we are expecting the industry to experience a nominal seasonal increase in units demand of approximately 15%, as compared to June. It is important to note that we began the fiscal year with the assumption that Seagate's financial would be sufficient to reinstate the annual variable compensation plan. ", "For the September quarter, revenue is expected to be between $2.9 billion and $3 billion. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be $0.35 to $0.39 and includes approximately $27 million of purchased intangible to amortization and other charges associated with Maxtor and EVault acquisitions. Accordingly, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, excluding the acquisition-related costs, is expected to be $0.40 to $0.44. ", "GAAP, R&D and SG&A expenses are expected to be approximately $384 million for the September quarter on a non-GAAP basis, excluding approximately $4 million of acquisition-related costs. R&D and SG&A costs are expected to be approximately $380 million. ", "Additionally, other income and expenses are expected to be a net expense of approximately $17 million, and the tax rate is expected to be between 5% and 10%. ", "As always this outlook does not include the impact of any future acquisitions, stock repurchases or restructuring activities the company may undertake during the quarter. ", "As Bill mentioned, we believe that providing annual revenue and earnings guidance in this volatile environment is not particularly valuable. We will continue to share annual information with the investment community relative to factors that impact our business. That concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call back over to Bill. ", "Bill Watkins", "Thank you, Charles. There will be a quiz for the analysts if any one of you understands our tax structure. But anyway, on behalf of the management team I would like to thank our employees around the world who performed amicably in this fast-changing market. We are very confident in Seagate\u2019s strong position moving into fiscal year 2008. And look forward to the opportunities in front of us. So with that let\u2019s open it up to questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you Sir. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Aaron Rakers with A. G. Edwards. ", "Aaron Rakers -A. G. Edwards", "Yeah thanks guys. A couple of questions, I guess first just looking at the model, two things I guess one on the gross margin side, obviously seen a little bit of positive seasonality of as we get into the September quarter, but given your guidance it doesn't look like were expecting to see much in terms of gross margin expansion, maybe if you can touch on that first and then also I'd like to understand the pick up that is expected to happen in the operating expense line. ", "Charles Pope", "Okay, this is Charles I will answer both of those questions. In the September quarter we have built into the guidance continued aggressive pricing not as aggressive as in the June quarter but still at the low end of range of what is normal and historically in the September quarter we've actually seen a dropped below the normal range. We do not assume that it is prudent to anticipate it dropping below the normal range in the environment that we are in, and so that\u2019s the main reason for not seeing any margin expansion even given the seasonal up tick. ", "Then the second question relative to the OpEx if you look at the increase in OpEx it's almost evenly divided between the reinstatement of our variable compensation and then also some increased variable cost associated with R&D program that are in pre-production stages. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Hey let me just add one more comment because I know there will be a lot of questions maybe on the OpEx is the OpEx too high? And in all we're very focused on this OpEx expense. That said, for iMed I think theme is that we still see there is a lot of investment out here that we've want to make we think there lot opportunities in products. I think the critical issue for us and what we can focus on are we getting the cost reduction and or the market revenue opportunities with our OpEx expending and then that's where more focus on to take these money that we're spending and making sure its in program that reduce our cost, our breakeven points and or add to the revenue and product market breadth that we are trying to attend. So again, I think we are very extensive to that, but again we think there are clear opportunities and how we spend our money and that is the future for us. During this time we think we set the opportunities for two year out now. ", "Aaron Rakers -A. G. Edwards", "Great. And if I could ask one follow-up on your CapEx guidance for the year being flat with fiscal 2007, can you give us I think its your analyst day can give us breakdown of how that spending worked? I would like to understand maybe where are the reductions might be coming in the place given your comments around deployment of the Maxtor equipment as well as improving yields on some of your existing cost equipment? ", "Dave Wickersham", "Sorry and this is Dave, so the first what you describe at the end that was really the historical, how do we get from where we were to where we are the 900 million actual, and as you have mentioned a small piece of that frankly was utilizing for Maxtor test equipment. But the vast majority was one as Charles said earlier aligning the customer demand which we'll always do, we have been in this environment you should might imagine. ", "Fairly conservative to make sure we didn\u2019t ahead of our customer requirements, so we dialed back some flexibility throughout the year, and then secondly the team has just done a admirable job it continuing to look at equipment utilization and the factors that drive are yields and as we have said we are pleased with the continued improved and perpendicular ramp in associated yield, that helps with our equipment utilization and then just from continued remanufacturing standpoint to make sure from the supply chain and so forth there is no waste in the process. ", "So the vast majority were, one time the customers and two equipment utilization. Going forward in the '08 the reason we are able to continue to invest in technologies and expand capacity are those same reasons primarily equipment utilization, enjoying the benefits of our new products in the yield associated with newer products. At the same time continuing as I said earlier was a significant investment, both in Woodlands 3 which is our Singapore finish media expansion as well as our Johor, Malaysia aluminum substrate expansion. ", "Aaron Rakers -A. G. Edwards", "Great, thanks guys. ", "Dave Wickersham", "Okay. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Harry Blount with Lehman Brothers. ", "Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks. Couple of questions. First, Dave, if I could start with you. You mentioned in your comments on media and substrate. Just in terms of the substrate capacity coming online for you guys internally, where are you guys with that. I think the last point I heard as you are looking at early 2008, is that a correct assumption? ", "Dave Wickersham", "The facility in Johor in Malaysia, Harry the expense I mentioned while the building will be up. It really won't be operational until March or June of next year. So think about mid calendar year '08. ", "Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And what are [two bottom x] to bring that online in a timely fashion? ", "Dave Wickersham", "Well, first, it's just a facility and getting that complete and all the logistics are getting the facility up and running. And that's proceeding as planned. And then like I said, it will largely be complete by the end of this calendar year. And then after that, it\u2019s facilitating it and the equipment for plating and so forth. ", "Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. ", "Dave Wickersham", "So, that's a first building, second from the long lead time equipment. ", "Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, great. And then Charles, in terms of phenol, first of all, should I think of depreciation of about $800 million for fiscal '08, is that the right number? ", "Charles Pope", "That would sound about right to me. I don't know the number up top of my head, but given the fact that our capital investments are a kind of $200 million to $225 million a quarter and it's been ramped up a couple of times during the last couple of years. That sounds like about the right numbers, Harry. ", "Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers", "And then given the better experience and field reliability with drives, is there a reason to expect your warranty reserves might improve in '08? ", "Charles Pope", "I guess I don't have that much visibility as to count right now. We track the reliability and adjusted the biggest thing you see relative to the ongoing warranty expenses, so that's a very, very large [PO] population that exists. ", "Dave Wickersham", "The other thing Harry, we still got a lot of legacy master parts too. ", "Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And then the share buyback by the current authorization, current stock price that would be about 14 million shares which we have taken basically flat free Maxtor. When should we expect you guys to be buying that back, what other factors you are thinking about to get more or less aggressive over the next several quarters? ", "Dave Wickersham", "I guess I will have two answers to that. First is that normal season speeds of things if we were doing it out of operating cash, we'd probably be completed by mid next calendar year. At the calendar we took out our debt offering last September, we indicated that in late summer, early fall, we would evaluate whether or not we wanted to further utilize the balance sheet to accelerate the share repurchase anymore. We still intend to do that and we'll be evaluating that in the coming 60 days or so. ", "Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers", "Last question, it is actually two part question. But it's related to the September quarter, I guess it's in my historic impression that mix tends to work a density on the margin side of equation with the little bit more gaining etcetera, is that true? And then related to that as we think about your gross margin structure longer term, could you maybe give us some of the ups and downs that you'd expect to see over the next several quarters? Thanks. ", "Dave Wickersham", "Brian. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "I will take the next question, Harry. And I think you hit nail on head. So if you just follow through in the market comments that I made, you'll find that the growth market are on the client side and the CE space. Those, spaces in general have ASP's that are below our average and so you are exactly right, from a mix perspective, ASP's and margins do get affected in the reverse direction, and right now of course it comes with it as tremendous amount of unifying growth. So, from gross margin dollar perspective, it's still positive. ", "Charles Pope", "Remind me of the second question. ", "Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers", "Going forward on gross margin. ", "Charles Pope", "I think it would be better Harry to talk about the model of the company as we have our analyst day in September and to go through some of those real point then. I think it will be a more complete answer during that period of that. ", "Bill Watkins", "I mean I guess I'll give a short answer to that Harry. We feel comfortable on those things we can control and the biggest assurance in why we talked about not giving the annual guidance, is our ability to predict pricing. We have run in vertical moderate pricing decline we went 21, 24, 26. So, we have aggressive pricing decline, its hard for us to be that much better than rest of the industry. So, it's little bit out of our control. But when we think within a certain pricing range, we can handle and that price, I think to be the point that we're trying to get our break even points lower. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of David Bailey with Goldman Sachs. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "Yes, great thank you. Just follow up on the pricing question, you commented on desktop pricing in the quarter, could you talk about pricing in the other areas as you went through the quarter. And what have you seen in the market lately from Samsung and Hitachi and how realistic is it, to expect those two companies to remain a little more well behaved as you go forward. ", "Bill Watkins", "I will let Brian start it and then I will give you a comment. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Yes, Dave, I think Bill might have addressed the later half of your question, since his comments of, let me tackle the beginning part. I think with the exception that I noted and one of the reasons they didn\u2019t comment selectively through the segments, because we price behavior largely what we expected at the beginning of the quarter. So in the notebook space we had intended it was going to be relatively aggressive and in fact it was. In the enterprise space we expected to be in the normal range and in fact it was. So, really the only exception was as I noted mid to high cap early in the quarter which produced a net differential on the quarter for the desktop products. ", "Bill Watkins", "Just let me add onto that, I think, in the pipeline again we had a hard time predicting what people do, because people are not in certain cases they seemed to be very market share driven versus comp ability but that said after this last year I haven't been through the industry as long as I can think. I have never seen two year like last year. But we are preparing ourselves for clearly aggressive year ahead of us. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "And then just one clarification, if you back out the three non operational items that you included in GAAP and non-GAAP, what would your tax rate have been in the quarter? ", "Charles Pope", "In the note that you send out there before you normalized it to 7.5%, that is probably the right way to approach it. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham and Company. ", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Thank you. Just two questions, first obviously the unit guidance, more of the commentary in the 15% for the TAM and your own revenue guidance 6% to 9% sequential growth is not so different in how September quarters have gone for history, but probably a little bit better than has been typically guided at this point in July, can you just comment on what you are seeing today that might be giving you confidence in this type of guidance level? ", "Bill Watkins", "I've bought to a sales book, and I have to brand it, no actually it's too early to call the quarter, again we've looked at this from a quarter perspective and again we think there is pretty good demand out there and we feel good about the cost structure and some of the things that are going on the new products. We expect the 250 gigabits single disk you have out there. Again, it's our kind of confidence on the thing we can control. And I guess the concerned we have is all things we can't or what the behavior or what competition. So, right now, we feel that we got the right structure and right things going forward, but it still early to say, how this will fall out to. ", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay, and just secondly, Dave, you talked about how you are comfortable with your VTAs and you\u2019ve mentioned your specific rollout there for Malaysia. But on Woodmans' 3, has this action caused you to in any way accelerate those plans to bring Woodman 3 up and is it even possible to accelerate those plans? ", "Dave Wickersham", "First, Rich, technically we are not going to change anything as I indicated with the VTA. We\u2019ll continue to buy from Komag, and Kellogg\u2019s we sit on lounge, look at expanding Woodman 3. We really don\u2019t see the need to accelerate that. And frankly, speaking and honestly speaking, there is not much more we can do, because it similar to Johor to navigate in the facility up in running and facilitate. They are really some extent expense restrictor or will it be flexible from an outside perspective. ", "So we are going to continue to work with Komag. We look at other option, as you might image there is lot of dynamics in share shifts going up between the remaining three median suppliers. And we will just have to asses long-term what we want to do regarding finished media. So, we are -- current question is to be full steam ahead on Woodland 3 and then one that\u2019s in place, will have pretty much unlimited flexibility. ", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay. Thank you very much ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller from Brean Murray ", "Mark Miller - Brean Murray", "Following up on the Komag acquisition, do you see any long-term implications, I mean Komag was noted as a low cost producer, and also having very good substrate. I just wondering if that might put cramp in certain people ability to drive pricing ", "Dave Wickersham", "This is Dave Mark let me take a stab at it certainly with one last independent media supplier on the outside it's going limit the amount of opportunities for others to compete if that's a technique that they use to drive pricing lower but having said that I think there is lots more than adequate capacity in my opinion already on the market. So I think that the three remaining finish media suppliers will be very flying full on how they add capacity and as terms of the behavior how they want to price that I guess should have to ask them I really satisfactory but clearly one big one of the market will have some implications source on supplying pricing is my view. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "I think just makes 17 more competitive but also I think it makes the Siemens, Samsung, and some of you guys less competitors. ", "Mark Miller - Brean Murray", "Do you think that you've already said there is that consolidation will be a continuing trend you think that forces the two firms you just mentioned that there is something and any speculation what they might do? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "It's personal I don't see how these three Japanese media suppliers exist on broad. Its like there couldn't two head suppliers and so there is already one source my personal but you never know I mean Japanese are a little bit different than we do so. ", "Mark Miller - Brean Murray", "Alright thank you ", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Christian Schwab with Craig Hallum Capital Group ", "Christian Schwab - Craig Hallum Capital Group", "Great, my question is, quite some people it seems like we've taken away some price discounts on high capacity drives here recently, hear you chatter of that. Can you guys comment on whether you think that we are now in a situation where we might see stability and 250 and 500 drives. ", "Dave Wickersham", "We got to wait for this quarter it's a little early for me to call I have seen behaviors change pretty fast so quite early to call in rather. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "If we toss stability and pricing rational pricing in particular the Desktop, probably doesn't happen in the mobile side, but what's the gross margins be? ", "Christian Schwab - Craig Hallum Capital Group", "I am not going to speculate. There has also been speculation about other components you shipped into disc drives and mergers that could be happening within that space. Maybe you could comment on your thoughts on the suspension side of the business? ", "Bill Watkins", "Go ahead Dave. ", "Dave Wickersham", "Christian, this is Dave, yeah. There are three independent suppliers, one of them has in fact posted on their websites that they were in some talks, nothing definitive, nothing finalized. And so we are monitoring that situation and continuing to do business with all three. They'll get partners of ours. We'll stay close to see what happens but it's too early to predict what we might do. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig Hallum Capital Group", "Great. And then I would imagine that your build plans aggressively could down our finished goods, probably manufacturers that drives than we shipped, is that a correct assumption? ", "Dave Wickersham", "Yes. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig Hallum Capital Group", "Great. No further questions. Thanks. ", "Dave Wickersham", "Thanks Chris. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with J.P. Morgan. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Yes, very good afternoon. I was wondering Brian if you can weigh in on the mix within Desktop and Notebook as related to the geographies of the world, or the certain geographies, and thereby certain foreign factor calls that we will now announce. We are hearing a lot of that, some of the low array of PCs fees over an Asia, Eastern European are up picking up, are you seeing a dynamic as well for both Desktop and Notebook? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Well, let me try to give you an overall answer on the Desktop. The Christmas seasons saw a pretty dramatic shift. I think we talked about this in our January call upwards in terms of capacity. And so for large part of the December quarter, we actually were short of 300 gigabyte and prototype products. We've moved into this calendar. We saw that shift exactly other direction. My sense is that we'll see in the back half of the year as the consumer becomes more of a factor in PC purchases in the seasonal seasons that will be shift back in other way. ", "So, I don't think that gave complete answer to your question, whether you state for that geographically. But geographically what we do now is that those systems tend to be at the lower end of PC spectrum to clean the desktop. And as the growth rate outside of the US, Japan and Western Europe in the desktop are double digit whereas in those countries reports are more than likely negative. ", "All in all, we are seeing desktop growth rates in the 7% to 8% range globally and the majority of that growth and all that growth is happening in those regions. So, the only offset to that is what we see happening in external storage environment, IER branded business where there as I mentioned the average capacity is up over 350 gigabytes. And so we have got that phenomena. We have also got from the 3.5-inch ATA spectrum, the business critical or the near machine critical taking high capacity product in some sectors of the DDR environment. So all that rolled out great set phenomena, I talked about which is about 35% of the market today being 250 gigabytes in greater. And I think you will see that percentage increase this quarter or next quarter. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, I appreciate that. And then you mentioned Brian, maybe you or Bill could weigh in, in terms of how Seagate is assessing the branded performance thus far versus your internal expectations. You have been pretty resolute in terms of why you have been doing out there in the marketplace? How do you feel the velocity of revenue trajectory is to fill into plan at this point? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Yeah Mark, I will take that one. It's too early to call in terms of what really happened in the overall market in June, we are still trying to get our arms around the overall market. Our sense is that that's a quarter where seasonally the retail market is little bit softer. As I mentioned we met our internal plans and those plans were to be added above March results and we achieved that. So to the extent that we achieved that plan in the market, in fact we have moved the other direction and I think we feel good about that. If for some reason it\u2019s busted through seasonality, then I think we feel such good about our results. But they are making mistake about it's really a focus force. I think it is a tremendous growth opportunity for ourselves and for the industry, and that consumers are going to continue to draw storage into their home in a pretty significant way. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And I have a one more question for you Brain, and then I'll have a follow-up with Charles if I may. Earlier you talked the enterprise, the dynamics in terms of how CE views the potential penetration of high-end 700 gigabytes SATA drives over time that wasn't performance based, just system file applications, I wanted to get a sense in terms of how you view the comparative dynamics? Obviously, you guys enjoy the considerable dominance within the fiber channel and SCSI, but given that we see a lot folks introducing their own flavor of 750 gigabytes and one terabyte SATA drives. Do we have more of a competitive dynamic growth that you are going to be watchful of? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Yes, I am Brian Dexheimer Mark. It\u2019s a great question. So, there is couple dimensions to that. One is to the extent you believe that those customers will always want the highest capacity available at the best cost per gigabyte. This plays right in the hands of our leading technology. So, we have every intention of deploying our latest aerial density technology into the products that you just mentioned, Really that gives us a great advantage and I think the evidence of that's in the 750 gigabytes soon to be a terabyte product. ", "The other thing is that it is little bit customer dependent, this is not a, what I call desktop class products. So, what we are finding is that, while these products have characteristics of many desktop drives, like the interface and capacity point in the form factor. There is additional set of requirements that many of the customers are taking into market and deploying in these enterprise like applications or putting on top of that. ", "I think we understand that better than anyone, because of our position in the classic enterprise and actually think that\u2019s worked to our won designs and we were able to incorporate that future set into that product class for lot more regularly than maybe others are. So, I think those two things will continue to play to our advantage sort of stake. And make this market a pretty attractive market for us as it grows and it's growing pretty rapidly. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you. And then Charles if at all if I could, looking at the gross margins. Can you give us a sense of what are the key levers that really need to stick at the key gross margins within a relatively range going forward . Do you need to really continue to execute on your new technology and product announcements in the past few months or longer term should we think about you maybe even taking on more interest in having a wider range of gross margin profile to give you a little more breathing room given the current types of mix that you and Bill have referenced? ", "Charles Pope", "I think there is a number things that have changed overtime that are making it a little less predictable, Mark and that is just as Brian mentioned earlier, during the back half of the year when historically margins had expanded. Today with consumer electronics which tend to have margins lower than corporate average both are heavy seasonal periods for that which tend to mute the gross margin expansion opportunities in the back half of the year and all. That along with the pricing environment and the fact that there you have a higher mix of products that are going into applications that do have lower margin areas, the home hand held devices and other things. All make it a relatively tight range themselves, that product mix and the pricing environment are the two single biggest levels, the pricing environment first, the product mix second. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. ", "Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Hi guys, good evening. It sounds like channel inventory are back to normal levels and Intel commented earlier this week that inventories declined especially in emerging market. That\u2019s something that you also saw on the disk drive space. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Its depends where you measure it from. Katie this is Brian. Our observation is the quarter-on-quarter that we saw relative flat profile exceeding margin exceeding June. So, less than five weeks for the industry as it works at the end of March, it' a great differentiation up by region in that number. ", "Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then in the first quarter many of your competitors lost quite a bit of money. Do you have any sense as to whether industry profit has a whole improved or deteriorated this quarter and what implication that may have for further consolidation or restructuring at the vender level? ", "Charles Pope", "No Katie, we don\u2019t, we really don\u2019t. I mean we have to wait and feel over the next week so that people come out. But no we really don\u2019t have a central at. ", "Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "And then just lastly, since there will a quiz. What drove the decision to reverse the evaluation allowance on the deferred tax asset? ", "Dave Wickersham", "Good question, well its actually not the decision that you make to do it. There were set of circumstances given the industry, at the company structure that we have Katie for there have been some changes during the course of the last year, for really to follow appropriate accounting. We had to review the valuation allowance. Just as a quick reminder the deferred tax asset and then many companies are required to look in and evaluate the ability to utilize those deferred tax assets and if it's not apparent that they can fully utilize the differed tax assets. ", "They required a reserve against those and then at least on an annual basis you go through and evaluate that. We've had a couple of tax related changes that had occurred during the year so as we reviewed the reserve against the differed tax assets, we were really require to take down those reserves which would reflected with the benefit that you found the income statement. Doesn\u2019t change our cash taxes paid, doesn't change to reporting this is purely financial reporting accounting issues. ", "Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Merrill Lynch ", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Hi, good afternoon. Could you just go back over the notebook market a little bit I am just curious if you can provide more color on why you gain so much share during the June quarter? And then when you talk about you strong seasonal outlook for the September quarter is that assuming more share gain or is that just based on end market demand? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Maybe the second one first, Steven this is Brian, so the comment about strength in the September quarter is not Seagate specifics it's really market comments, so we certainly believe that we'll grow at least that market rate. We don't have any great ambitious to grow share was any execution issues but some of our competition. I think comparing March to June which is first part of your question recognized that March we were really happy with our performance there. It was a flat to slightly down share performances in December quarter. We had some product issues in the March quarter that presented some planed growth in the March quarter. ", "So a part of what we saw in June was recapture of what we didn't get in March, as well as we saw early in the quarter and really drop most of the quarter about a half of dozen large customers that came back to us for additional product as either they has quite disruption issues with some of other competition and or they send more demand than they had planned in the quarters. So I think part of that additional share volume that we got was maybe at the expense of some of our competition. We didn't execute it, because of our customer mix and their ability to gain in the marketplace and an environment that probably ended up be in a little bit stronger than everyone had anticipate. ", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, that's very helpful. And then just on the consumer market. Once you get through this quarter, are you still looking for, will Seagate reposition that well enough to participate in the December quarter for consumer demand that should pick up even further? And how much can some of the branding efforts play a role such as the FreeAgent product? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Well, we see consumers were really talking about those products that we sell to OEM device manufacturers in the handheld DVR gaming space. So I want to differentiate that from our brand solutions business, which was the last part of the comment. The net as we feel bullish about all the above. We have far more control of our brands solutions business. We take directly in some market under the Seagate Maxtor brands. ", "We think the December quarter is going to be as it is always a high seasonal quarter for the product set. And we think we're well positioned. We'll be announcing some new products over the course of the next 90 days that fall into that space, which you will hear about in September when we have our Analyst Day. On the Consumer Electronic side and the DVR gaming, handheld space, I don't think you will see much change for us in the handheld space. There will be some incremental growth there from us in the December quarter. But we do expect both DVR and gaming to have their high cycles in December quarter more fully participate now. ", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Great, thanks again. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Brickman with UBS. ", "Jeff Brickman - UBS", "Great, thanks. Just wondering if you could discuss the linearity on the quarter, particularly as you entered after a month of March that's perhaps a little disappointing takes on what you have been expecting? ", "Bill Watkins", "Go ahead Brian. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Yes, Jeff, this is Brian. It ended up be in a pretty typical June quarter. I think your comment about March is fair, certainly reinforced by what we said in our April call. But the linearity of the June quarter was about we expected and about 50% of the quarter half and then the month of June. ", "Jeff Brickman - UBS", "Okay and then just on, 2.5 inch in notebooks, I know this has been asked a couple of times, but did anything from a price perspective, do you see any sort of moderation and also, you felt you could come in and maybe be a slightly more aggressive or was that really not the dynamic, I know you have mentioned a few other things still going on. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Right most of the notebook pricing for last quarter would have been negotiated prior the end of March. So, that's pretty clear in understanding that when we talked about it in April, and really didn't see much change. So, what we saw in the June quarter, beginning the negotiations for the September quarter, too early to comment on whether those keep hold or not, but there is some reason to believe that there might be a little bit of moderation there, just based on overall supply and demand characteristics, the September quarter being much stronger than the June quarter. ", "Jeff Brickman - UBS", "Got you, okay. And then just last bit from me. Could you just give us an idea of the rough percentage of the line which from gaming and non-inflated. Maybe the counts per markets were weaker than expected. But any views of this, some of the price that we are hearing about, might be an opportunity to catalyze some sales there? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "We are pretty far back in the supply chain just so. I am not sure that you know any price cuts you see at the console level are going to be reflected in demand to us probably for months to come. Supply chain is relatively complete, I think after a year of rollout of that particular console. So I think, you know, while at the margin it seems to be a positive for demand in this space, I don't think we are going to see a direct within days kind of correlation, just because of the length of the supply chain. And note that in the June quarter that's typically the slowest or lowest build out quarter for the game console market. We expect September will be better and probably December incremental and better than that. ", "Jeff Brickman - UBS", "Again would you share us the rough percentage that I think you have in the past, but just as far as a percentage of units you shipped? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Of the 5 million that we shift last quarter? ", "Jeff Brickman - UBS", "Yes. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Now that\u2019s a 35% about third to that would be in gained consoles. ", "Jeff Brickman - UBS", "Great, Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line at Daniel Renouard with Robert Baird. ", "Daniel Renouard - Robert Baird", "Hi, Thank you, my question is just related to your restructuring charge $29 million, can you give us a little more detail where exactly that came from, how much of that was head count related, versus facility related , and how much you think about further restructuring potentially ongoing basis? ", "Charles Pope", "The entire $29 million was facilities and non-employee related restructuring, we would anticipate that they wont still be reduced during the course of this year to further reduce cost in certain areas no but non of the existing restructuring was employee related. ", "Daniel Renouard - Robert Baird", "What was the $10 million in cash then related to that just? I think out leases things of that nature. ", "Bill Watkins", "Correct. ", "Daniel Renouard - Robert Baird", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Hunt with Thomas Weisel Partners. ", "Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Hi just a couple of questions I didn\u2019t hear you really talk about the OpEx for the current quarter, you mention the bonuses in fact I think future cores but OpEx was really high looks like in the June quarter as well, then also what tax rate are you building in forward into that guidance you gave? ", "Charles Pope", "Okay. During the existing quarter part of the increase that you see in the OpEx, we did have the purchase of some IT and storage related IT that was expensed in the quarter that's the single biggest jump up in terms of the increased in spending in OpEx this quarter, as I have indicated both in terms of last quarter in the way to kind of look at it, normalize it, using the 7.5% rate that we had talked about early in the quarter is probably the right way to look at it, and going forward as I had indicated I think using something between 5% to 10%, and if you wanted cut it in the half and turn it to 7.5% its again probably the right way to look at it. ", "Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay and then one other follow up here, on CapEx may I miss it, but did you say that you were planning for the year it can imply to 800 or a billion for a year but could you -- ", "Charles Pope", "How is $900 million Kevin? ", "Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. And then just one other follow up on, just to clarify the questions on the sort of I guess, build or buy on a media, is there any change to your plan or is there any reconsideration going on your plan? What are you going to do internal versus external? ", "Bill Watkins", "It's too early Kevin like I said, short-term we are going to continue between that 10% or 15% for next three to six months beyond that. We will take a look at it if you have anything reportable we will get back in September. ", "Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. Thanks guys. ", "Charles Pope", "Okay, thank you. ", "Bill Watkins", "Hey Janice we\u2019ll take one more question. ", "Operator", "Thank you sir. And your last question comes from the line of [Keith Beckmann] with Bank of Montreal. ", "Keith Beckmann - Bank of Montreal", "Hi, thank you. Just two quickies, on the media side, is there are difference between the actual substrate and the media itself in terms of your goals on that 10% to 15%? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "That\u2019s a finished media statement. ", "Keith Beckmann - Bank of Montreal", "Right, so how about on the substrate line? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Well on the substrate side we are going to continue. The vast majority is external and as indicated we will proceed with the expansion of aluminum substrates into Johor, but as far as our relationships with our external substrates acquires they will continue. ", "Keith Beckmann - Bank of Montreal", "Okay. Then just on the 1.8 inch drive rather, you mentioned that it was a little bit disappointing you are going to try to move up in capacity point, how does that play out do you think over the next couple of quarters? In terms of either comments on where that support needs to be, any kind of color on the projected unit volumes or anything along those lines? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Yeah. Keith this is Brian, l really don\u2019t want to get into unit volumes or announcing a new products, it suffices to say, that there is some prices in the market today, announced products that are higher capacity then the one that we have. I think you can project out this and some of the things we said about aerial density and kind of anticipate what the next one might be. I don\u2019t there will be product that we\u2019ll release anytime before 2008. ", "So, products we have today, will be the products that we take to market for the next several quarters. And I think, we\u2019re going to keep our expecting in line just based on where that fits, given some of the applications fits out there today. ", "Keith Beckmann - Bank of Montreal", "Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Fine. Thank you, all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you.

Thank you for standing by.  Welcome to Seagate Technologies fiscal first quarter 2007 financial results conference call.  (Operator Instructions) ", "This conference call contains forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, statements related to the company\u2019s future financial performance including the expected impacts from the acquisition and integration of Maxtor Corporation.  These forward-looking statements are based on information available to Seagate as of the date of this conference call but are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements.", "Information concerning the risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's annual reports, on Form 10-K as filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on September 11, 2006 and in the company's Form 8-K filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on October 24, 2006.", "These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the company's views as of any subsequent date and Seagate undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made.", "I would now like to turn the conference to over to our host Mr. Bill Watkins, CEO.  Please go ahead.", "Bill Watkins", "Welcome and thank you for joining us.  On the call with me today are Charles Pope, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dave Wickersham, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Dexheimer, Executive Vice President, and Chief Sales and Marketing Officer.", "I would like to make a few comments on our performance this quarter and then provide a brief outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2007.  I will then hand the call to Brian for review of our market performance during the quarter.  ", "I am pleased to report that Seagate closed a strong first quarter for fiscal year 2007.  In which we achieved our financial objectives and record shipments of 39 million units.  During the quarter, we continued to make significant progress on many of the broader objectives we set out to accomplish for the year, while maintaining our leadership position and setting the foundation to benefit from the nearly $10 billion of industry revenue growth expected over the next two years. ", "During the quarter, we maintained our position as the industry leader in the three of the four major markets and our revenue retention targets following the Maxtor acquisition. We saw tremendous unit growth in the mobile computing space where qualifications of our industry-leading 160 gigabyte perpendicular drives continues to be well accepted by key OEMs.", "Seagate growth rate year-over-year in consumer electronic applications outpaced the industry and consumer electronics remains one of the most exciting markets for storage companies.  In the enterprise space, we maintained our strong leadership position and saw very positive trends in both the adoption of small form factor products as well as high capacity products with Internet infrastructure applications. ", "The desktop market remained competitive at the low end of the market, but we are seeing growing trends to higher capacity drives, which we believe favors Seagate products and cost leadership.  ", "Since closing the Maxtor acquisition last quarter, we have been focused on completing the integration process which will allows to rationalize our capacity to further lower our cost structure.  The integration is going well, and continues to progress ahead of schedule allowing us to realize synergies from this acquisition sooner than originally anticipated.  ", "OEM customer transition to Seagate products continues to progress as expected, as we have discussed previously, by aggressively transitioning the Maxtor products to equivalent Seagate products, we have concentrated the negative financial impact on the product transition into the June, September and December quarters 2006.", "Dave and Charles will discuss later during this call how the completion of this transition will result in material improvement in our gross margins and operating model beginning in the March 2007 quarter.  ", "In the channel, the recent launch of our dual-brand hard drive strategy has been well received and we will continue to manage both our Seagate and Maxtor sales channels to achieve maximum market share from all our customer segments.  Overall, I am pleased that through this acquisition we have met our revenue share goals to remain highly profitable.", "In connection with the Maxtor acquisition, we have planned on certain capital expenditures.  However, with the acceleration of positive traction of the integrations, I am pleased to report that we will require significantly less capital investment than originally anticipated.  This has also contributed to the reduction in our fiscal 2007 capital requirements, which Dave and Charles will detail shortly.  ", "Our outlook has been adjusted and will be affected by the aggressive pricing environment in the OEM desktop and notebook markets.  Resulting from what we believe are competitors who seem intent on trying to capture market share without regard for profitability.  ", "I am pleased though, particularly in the face of this environment with the revenue retention we have achieved and we are confident in our ability to continue to reduce costs and improve profitability throughout the year.  ", "Since the announcement in December of the Maxtor acquisition, the market has had ample time to complete its adjustments of supply chain strategy.  In light of this, we expect the normal dynamics of the market to returned and absent product transitions, quality issues or supply chain disruptions, there is no reason to expect market share shifts.  ", "Seagate has been and remains committed to pricing discipline which builds profitability and allows us to reinvest in technology, one of the keys to our leadership; but we are equally determent to maintain our current share positions. Consequently, we will meet market prices to maintain market share.  ", "Therefore, while there was an impact to our top line and original outlook we provided for the year, we are extremely confident in our ability to perform well in this environment.  We have consistently demonstrated our ability to deliver superior profitability and believe that we will continue to deliver strong results in the fiscal year and over the long-term.", "For the second half of the fiscal year, there are three key factors that will drive or improve profitability. First, we are accelerating our development efforts and we will introduced new, higher margin, lower cost products as quickly as possible to optimize product mix.  ", "Second, we will entering the growing 1.8 inch market where we believe we will have a market-leading product ready to ship at the end of the calendar year.  ", "And finally, as mentioned earlier, we are very focused on completing the Maxtor integration, which will allow us achieve a lower cost structure.  ", "Seagate continues to be the industry\u2019s technology product and cost leader with access to virtually every available market in the $30 billion plus disk drive industry and a strong and growing customer base.  We continue to focus on delivering on our financial and operational objectives.  I believe our board of directors demonstrated their continued confidence in our business and prospects with today\u2019s increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.10 per share.  ", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Brian to provide details on our performance in the quarter.  ", " Brian Dexheimer", "The September quarter was characterized by seasonal unit growth and industry demand of 13% sequentially and 17% year-on-year. We believe the industry had record revenue performance and Seagate maintained it\u2019s leadership in three of the four major markets, shipping a record 39 million units.  ", "In addition, overall revenue retention as a result of the Maxtor acquisition remained within our target range. As we look forward into December, we expect industry unit demand overall to be a 115 to120 million units for about 10% to 15% year-on-year growth.  ", "Now I\u2019ll give some detail on the individual markets.  In the mobile computing space, the market remained strong, delivering over 26 million units of demand.  Seagate saw continued growth, shipping 4.2 million drives, an increase of 24% sequentially and 74% year-on-year, over twice that of the industry.   We believe we are extremely well-positioned in the space, with one of the broadest product offerings in the industry, including our newly introduced mobile MAX line of Maxtor branded notebook products for channel partners globally.", "Further, our technology leadership in this space allowed Seagate to increase its average gigabyte per drive shipped to nearly 80 gigabytes, once again leading the industry.  Our industry-leading 5400 RPM, 160 gigabyte notebook drive is now qualified at nine leading notebook manufacturers, and we expect to complete another three qualifications during the December quarter. Looking forward, we expect overall notebook demand for the December quarter to be seasonally up from the September quarter.", "In the consumer electronics market, Seagate maintained its leadership position during the quarter, shipping 6.5 million units.  In the DVR space, all significant previous Maxtor customers have engaged in qualification, or shipment of, Seagate designed products and we feel good about our ability to retain this revenue going forward.", "Also in this space, the launch of our 750 gigabyte DV-35 and SV-35 products have been well-received and are in qualification for high definition digital video recorders and surveillance systems planned for later in the year. ", "As we have seen the average capacity of our DVR shipments grow to nearly 180 gigabytes, we feel the introduction of this high capacity platform gives Seagate an important advantage in cost and capacity in this space going forward.", "Gaming applications remain one of the strongest sectors of this market, as console makers geared up for increased demand in product launches during the holiday season.  To date, we have been pleased with our significant participation in both of the next generation consoles available in the market.", "In hand-held applications, demand for our 1 inch products remains steady, with shipments comparable to that of the June quarter.  In addition, our 1.8 inch drive, announced during the June quarter, targeted at personal media players, digital video cameras and other portable devices is on track to begin qualifications during this quarter. We expect demand in the CE market to be flat to slightly up in the December quarter.  ", "Demand in the Enterprise space was in line with expectations, as Seagate shipped 4.1 million units, maintaining our leadership position in this space.  Our industry-leading product line is well-positioned to take advantage of the growth ahead, particularly in the tiered storage and small form factor segments of this market.  In fact, shipments of our 2.5 inch Enterprise-class drives grew 36% sequentially, and we expect to see rapid industry adoption of this platform over the next three to nine months.  We expect overall Enterprise demand in the December quarter to be flat to that of the September quarter.", "In the desktop compute market, we maintained our leadership position by shipping 24.4 million units.  Revenue retention in this space is at the low end of our expectations as once again we saw willingness from our competition to secure additional share on aggressive terms, particularly at the low end of the product line.  Our product mix continued to improve, as shipments of products 200 gigabytes and greater continued to exceed the industry average as a percent of volume. Global distribution demand for desktop products was strong later in the quarter, as is usual for a September quarter.  ", "Our dual brand offering is being well received by our partners and end customers in the both the commercial and consumer channels of sale and we remained pleased with our revenue retention.  Channel inventory ending September was less than June on an absolute basis and was under five weeks, consistent with our recent history and model.  For the December quarter, we expect to see a normal seasonal demand increase in the desktop space.", "Finally, Seagate\u2019s branded solution revenue, comprised of Seagate and Maxtor branded products, was up sequentially.  Demand for networked and attached storage in small businesses and the home continues to grow.  We have the industry\u2019s  largest product offering in this space, and believe we are best positioned to capitalize on the growth ahead.  We expect December quarter to be seasonally strong for this business. ", "In summary, we are encouraged by the industry growth trends in fiscal 2007, and Seagate\u2019s unique position to capture revenue share across all markets.  Now, I would like to turn the call over to Dave to provide an update on our acquisition and operations.", "Dave Wickersham", "Thank you, Brian.  The Maxtor integration and product transition to Seagate products and processes is proceeding ahead of plan. We  are closing in on the final build of legacy Maxtor products quickly. Production of all legacy Maxtor products is expected to be complete by the end of November with the exception of the 10-K RPM SAS Enterprise drive which will be completed by mid-December.  The completion of legacy Maxtor products is a significant milestone and the expected improve in our manufacturing capacity, utilization, and shift to Seagate products and processes ensure we are positioned to achieve our financial targets in the second half of fiscal year.  ", "As Bill discussed earlier, completing this planned product transition will result in a material improvement in our gross margin and operating model beginning in the March 2007 quarter.", "Regarding inventory, last quarter I described our plan to improve inventory turns for the Seagate designed products to 12 to 14 times range.  Our performance did not meet our objective or requirement as inventory turns in the September quarter for Seagate designed products were slightly less than 11 turns, which is basically flat compared to the June quarter.  We have implemented a number of process changes to improve our inventory turns and I am confident it will improve our results.  Resources and weekly management reviews are in place to help ensure we meet 12 inventory turns this quarter. Regarding legacy Maxtor products finished goods inventory, we expect to have at most a couple hundred thousand legacy Maxtor drives at the end of December.", "Looking at our transition to perpendicular recording, Seagate\u2019s technology leadership is clear.  During the September quarter, we shipped approximately 3.7 million drives that utilized perpendicular recording.  Every major market -- desktop, notebook, enterprise and consumer electronics -- is being served in some manner by a perpendicular recording based drive.  We have growing confidence that we will achieve our internal plan of exiting our fiscal fourth quarter with greater than 50% of all drives shipped utilizing perpendicular recording. Finally, our leadership in perpendicular recording technology will allow us to access new revenue opportunity with the industry\u2019s first single-disc 60 gigabyte 1.8 inch drive.", "Our fiscal 2007 capital investment forecast has been reduced and we now expect capital investment to be approximately $1.15 billion for fiscal year 2007.  This is a reduction of approximately $150 million and is primarily driven by process, test and yield improvements; and to some extent utilization of equipment acquired from Maxtor.  ", "Finally there has been no change to our Singapore Woodlands 3 media expansion plan and we continue to target initial production in the first half of calendar 2008.  Now I would like to turn the call over to Charles.", "Charles Pope", "Thanks Dave.  You will find the company\u2019s press release, 8-K and additional financial information related to Seagate\u2019s financial performance, along with a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results and other supplemental information in the Investor Relations section of Seagate\u2019s website at seagate.com.  Throughout my remarks I will be referring to specific sections of the supplemental financial information by slide number.", "Seagate reported September quarter revenue of $2.8 billion and unit shipments of 39 million.  Included are revenue and unit shipments from legacy Maxtor products of approximately $344 million and 4.9 million units respectively.  GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are $59 million and $0.10 respectively.  Included in the GAAP results are approximately $82 million of acquisition-related charges and associated tax effects; as well as a favorable restructuring adjustment of $4 million.  Without these charges and the associated tax effects, non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share was $137 million and $0.23.  These are shown on slides 3 and 4.", "Non-GAAP gross margin for the combined company in the June quarter was 17.3%.  Slide 5 has the adjustments made to GAAP gross margin.  Gross margin percent for the legacy Maxtor product was notably worse then expected and was approximately negative 16.3%.  Gross margin percent for Seagate products was approximately 22.1%, slightly better than we expected.  ", "The pricing environment on average for the quarter was in line with our expectations.  The desktop and notebook markets continued to see competitors using aggressive price in attempting to achieve higher market share.  For Seagate products, average price declines on a like-for-like basis across all markets was in excess of 6%, similar to the June quarter.  Price declines accelerated in almost all markets as we negotiated pricing and share allocations with the OEM customer base for the December quarter, and is reflected in our outlook.  ", "GAAP operating expenses composed of R&D, SG&A, and amortization of intangibles for the September quarter were $394 million. Excluding acquisition-related costs of $46 million non-GAAP operating expenses were $348 million; considerably less than excepted.  Due to the uncertainty around the pricing environment, Seagate focused on minimizing operating expenses during the quarter as an offset.  Going forward, we will continue to focus on limiting increases in the operating expense area and now expect operating expenses for fiscal 2007 inclusive of Maxtor ramp down costs, but excluding acquisition related costs, to be approximately $1.48 billion. Slide 6 has the details for the adjustments made to GAAP operating expenses.  ", "Net other income and expense for the September quarter was $2 million of income.  The September quarter reflects a full quarter of the Maxtor debt we assumed as part of the acquisition, and approximately two weeks of the debt Seagate issued late in the September quarter.  ", "The accounting provision for income tax was a benefit of $5 million for the September quarter.  The primary cause of the tax benefit was a greater than expected loss from the legacy Maxtor operations.  Looking forward, we expect the tax rate for the year to be approximately 5%. It is important to note that we do not expect a material change in our cash tax rate now or in the foreseeable future.  ", "Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities ended the quarter at $2.65 billion. Seagate made capital investments during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 that totaled $227 million. As Dave indicated, we now expect approximately $1.15 billion in capital investments during fiscal 2007 ", "During the quarter, the company used approximately $150 million to repurchase 6.7 million shares. There is approximately $2.35 billion still available under the current stock repurchase authorization.  ", "During the December quarter, significant uses of cash will include redeeming the $400 million, 8% note and roughly $130 million of the $500 million previously discussed related to the Maxtor acquisition.  ", "As noted in our press release today, we have adjusted our business outlook for fiscal 2007.  There are a couple of reasons behind the change in our outlook. First in response to recent competitive behavior that we believe focused on market share and not profit, Seagate has shifted to a meet market price approach with the intent of not ceding any share in the market.  ", "Second, revenues generated from legacy Maxtor products will continue to have a meaningful drag on the company\u2019s financial results.  We estimate a negative impact to gross margin and earnings of approximately $30 million in the December quarter associated with legacy Maxtor designed products resulting in approximately negative 16% gross margins versus an earlier expectation of zero gross margins.  ", "In light of these changes, the management team has embarked on a focused cost improvement plan that spans all elements of spending within the company from bill of  material costs to below the line spending.  The currently identified savings from this effort is already incorporated into our outlook.", "Our financial outlook for the year incorporates our expectation of the environment I just described and also requires crisp execution by Seagate around three key activities.  The first is completing the Maxtor product transition and improving manufacturing utilization rates.  The second is launching and ramping new products with lower cost structures across various markets.  Third, expanding market coverage with the new 1.8 inch product mentioned earlier.", "During the second half of our fiscal year, we believe that the synergies and the accretion associated with the Maxtor acquisition will be realized and the company will move back into its gross margin model of 24% to 26% with sequentially improving financial results throughout the fiscal year.  ", "For the year, revenue is expected to be $11.4 billion to $11.8 billion.  Operating expenses, including the ramp down of Maxtor but excluding acquisition related costs, is expected to be approximately $1.48 billion.  The booked tax rate should be approximately 5%. Our outlook does not incorporate any impact to other income and expense or the outstanding share total represented by potential share repurchases that may occur during the year.  As such other income and expenses model to be a net of approximately $20 million and the average diluted outstanding shares model is 595 million. Accordingly, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share expected to be $1.70 to $1.80. ", "Including the estimated costs directly relate to the Maxtor acquisition and approximately $18 million of fees related to the early redemption of the 8% note, fiscal 2007 GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be a $1.35 to $1.45.  For the December quarter, revenue is expected to be between $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion with approximately $175 million for legacy Maxtor products.", "Gross margins for the company are expected to improve roughly 200 basis points due to improved manufacturing utilization as we accelerate the ramp down of legacy Maxtor products. Operating expenses including Maxtor ramp-down costs but excluding acquisition-related costs is expected to be around $370 million.", "Other income and expenses model to be a modest net income; diluted outstanding shares are modeled to be flat from the September quarter exit level at 595 million.  Accordingly, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the December quarter is expected to be $0.30 to $0.34  including acquisition-related costs, and approximately $18 million related to the early redemption of the 8% note. GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be $0.17 to $0.21.", "Finally, I want to provide an update on our internal audit regarding option grants. Our auditors have completed the review of all of our option grants as well as the option granting process since the company went public in December 2002 and will be presenting their report to the audit committee later this week.  Based on that review, I am confident that no adjustments to our financial statements are necessary with respect to our accounting for stock options.  That concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call back to over to Bill.", "Bill Watkins", "Thank you, Charles.  Looking forward, I seeing continuing success for Seagate. The bulk of the Maxtor transition is behind us and I believe our employees have done an excellent job in meeting our acquisition goals.  We believe we are the best positioned storage company in the industry and we will soon realize all the benefits of the acquisition in the form of revenue and earnings which will improve progressively each quarter throughout the fiscal year.  ", "With that on behalf of the entire Seagate management team, I would like to thank Seagate employees around the world for their contribution to another strong quarter.  With that, let\u2019s open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan.", " Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Yes, thank you.  A few questions, if I may.  It is somewhat of a loaded question for you, Charles and Bill. You describe pricing has gotten much worse, during what is probably the best time of the year historically.  Given the hard disk drive industry\u2019s past, I would say that when pricing starts to slide it is usually a pretty slippery slope. So I wanted to get your sense in terms of what is lending to your confidence that you get this material snap-back in your outlook in the March and June quarters of fiscal \u201907, given that we are in a pretty tenuous pricing environment right now? And the slower period of the year is just around the corner.", "Bill Watkins", "Tell you what, Mark.  I will let Charles answer it.  If he doesn\u2019t give you the right answer, I\u2019ll add. Go ahead, Charles.", "Charles Pope", "Okay.  Well, as I sat and looked at the back half of the year, the biggest part of the significant improvements in margins that was referred to in our remarks is really credited in products that are being introduced that have significantly reduced their cost structure.  That is something that is within our control to be able to go and do that.  We are feeling good about the products that are underway and will be coming out at the back half of the year.  That is the biggest part of the lift.", "Bill Watkins", "Mark, as we\u2019ve said a couple of times, getting rid of  the Maxtor, after going through this quarter, once we get rid of the Maxtor products and transition to Seagate, we feel that we have not only now, but going forward with the opportunities that Dave and his team are working on, we have the ability to be in a pretty aggressive price environment, but our ability to reduce cost in this environment and continue to grow revenue and earnings \u2013 we feel pretty confident about. ", "The net of it is, is our ability to execute.  You can\u2019t always control pricing, but we can have a big say in our cost structure.  We are feeling pretty good about some of the opportunities ahead of us.", " Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Then as an offshoot there, how should we think about this opportunity for Seagate to take advantage of the lower cost structure, in terms of how much ammo from that lower cost structure is going towards your meet the market approach, as you have described it?  Versus gross margin improvements?  Can we get a sense there?", "Bill Watkins", "Again, I think we are not going to drive pricing down. We are going to follow the market. We are going to be focused on profitability. We have been continuously.  That said, we are not giving up any market share for pricing.  And so, I think the net of it is as we take advantage of our cost structure, we are going to try to float the gross margins first.  But again, we are not giving up any more market share from where we are.", " Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "So you are pretty much shooting the cannon balls across the bows of your competitors today then, I take it?", "Bill Watkins", "No, I think that we have stabilized where the markets are and we are keeping our share.  I think there is a great opportunity for all of us. I mean, it\u2019s a nice market. There is a lot of growth and if we act smart I think we can all do well.", "Charles Pope", "Mark, I think if you reflect back to conversations that we\u2019ve had with the investment community announcing the Maxtor acquisition, we\u2019ve been open about the fact that we felt that there was share that would be lost; there was probably some share that we wouldn\u2019t mind losing. This is basically a statement that says, that time has past.  And so it is not really trying to be aggressive or anything else, it is saying that the transition has occurred, we are where we are and now let\u2019s go to business.", " Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, two more questions, if I could.  The distribution channel.  Brian, how should we think about Seagate\u2019s exposure to the distribution channel now, given that you have more of a dual source here with the Maxtor and the Seagate lines in the distribution channel?", " Brian Dexheimer", "I think as a percent of the business, obviously we have seen the business increase substantially, across the board, Mark.  So I think in terms of percentage of business, it is really probably not as dramatic as you might think it is.  So our mix did shift a little bit towards channels as opposed to OEM, but it is in low single-digits kind of  a shift, so I don\u2019t think it is really that material. In fact, I think because of the additional mix levers at our disposal relative to having two brands and two paths to market, I actually think it helped stabilize the business to some degree.", " Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Lastly, a major enterprise storage provider has commented that they have been building more or less a war chest of inventory for 3Q and 4Q. I am just wondering, given your position in the enterprise drive market, how does that impact your revenue assumptions going into the first part of \u201907?", "Charles Pope", "Well I don\u2019t think we factored in anything substantially different. I have been pretty consistent, I think maybe back in August when we talked about the September quarter being flat to June, there was some skepticism around whether that was really going to happen. In fact, we think that is exactly what happened and that is why we are saying this quarter will be flat as well.", "What we are seeing is a tremendous uptick in terms of pedabytes consumed in that space, but the unit totals are relatively flat and I think as it pertains to the first half of calendar \u201907, we don\u2019t have anything in our outlook that would say that they would be anything other than the same kind of seasonal enterprise demand we have seen before.", " Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Laura Conigliaro \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", " Laura Conigliaro \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Yes, a couple of things. What is your thinking behind the movement in your internal inventory where Seagate\u2019s finished goods inventory is up 80 million? And then I guess in a related question, maybe you can talk a little bit more about the $30 million of unexpected costs on the Maxtor side in gross margins for the December quarter?  In addition, what exactly do you expect for pricing to be in the December quarter?", "Bill Watkins", "I will let Dave take the inventory.", " Dave Wickersham", "Hi, Laura. I will start first on the inventory, up 81 million quarter on quarter. It is driven, that is basically two major components. Two-thirds of it are finished goods and the other is some increases in purchasing, primarily due to precious metals and positioning some perpendicular media this quarter.", "The majority of it is finished goods, and it is frankly a result of forecasts coming in different than what we planned.  So what we have done \u2013 and it is across all market segments, it is not legacy product, it is not old product, it is just again our inability in the September timeframe in particular to adjust the changes in the mix of customers across desktop, notebook and enterprise.", "So what we have done is put together a process, focus and some resources to make sure that throughout the quarter, not just the last month of the quarter, as we see changes in the actual consumption from our customers, we are in a position to quickly make adjustments.", "Charles Pope", "Laura, I will cover the next two points.  At the time that we were putting together our fiscal year plans originally, we had expectations reviewing the material and product cost of Maxtor products, that in the December quarter we would be able to have zero gross margin.  As we have better understood the purchase commitments and everything else and matched them up against our plans, we have found that we had a disconnect with that from a planning perspective. It is the same purchase orders that were there, continuing out the legacy build. It was missed in our planning process before. And so that is really what that is.", "If we sat and looked at the pricing environment, the pricing environment that we see for December is about a point more aggressive than it was in the September quarter and about a point-and-a-half more aggressive on a like-for-like basis than what we had built into our plans at the beginning of the year.  As you know, once you have an exit price that has stepped down and you maintain some reasonable price reduction expectations, it has a ripple effect throughout the year then.  That is one of the major drivers of the adjusted outlook that we have given. ", " Laura Conigliaro \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Can we go back to the last question, which is this has really been two quarters in a row now that you have had some inventory issues that you are really adjusting for.  Maybe you can talk about that too? You had the high end drive situation last quarter.", " Dave Wickersham", "Last quarter it was primarily driven by a mix change, frankly primarily in the desktop and the notebook area.  I won\u2019t describe it as anything different than the need to improve our process, recognizing the complexity in terms of configuration and number of customers that we are serving, we need to make those adjustments more timely.  I do think we understand the issue.  I do think, like I said, with the additional attention, resources and tools that we have put in place that we can manage this and get back to the 12 turns this quarter.", "So again, it is a process that we own and we are accountable for that we just didn\u2019t adjust or forecast quick enough.  I do think that we understand that. We have taken the steps to ensure that does not continue.", "Bill Watkins", "Laura, it can\u2019t. Just how we are thinking about, I think we need to be better focused on inventory, I am not going to try to side-step the issue. As we look at the September and December quarters, we are not probably as worried about inventory going into a December quarter. I think what is paramount is that we come out of December with the right inventory balance. So again, we kind of look at opportunities to put things on boats and things like that.  I mean, we don\u2019t do the hard shutdowns of production builds that we could have done to bring the inventory in line. We would be more inclined to do something like that in a December or March quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Harry Blount \u2013 Lehman Brothers.", " Harry Blount \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "The first couple are for Charles. Charles, you had mentioned that the company has embarked on some cost optimization initiatives on both the operating costs and the bill of materials side of the equation. I was wondering if you could refine that a little bit more for us?  Also, if you could give us a bit more clarity on the share buyback side? I know you have guided for no change from a modeling perspective, but maybe you could give us a little bit of a sense on the go forward basis, how much might be in a normalized buyback program versus more of an opportunistic buyback program?", "Charles Pope", "First, relative to the cost reduction, there were quite a few notes out from investors and also just industry notes during this last quarter identifying a great deal of uncertainty relative to demand, to the pricing environment and everything else. We as a management team felt like we needed to batten down the hatches.  I think that\u2019s reflected in the spending levels that we reported.", "And so to a very large extent at this point in time, we are focused on maintaining the spending levels that we have reported in this set of financial results, and as we continue to have growth and demand growth and revenue and other things to fulfill that through efficiency measures versus increased spending. ", "There are areas where we are actually going through and have opportunities to reduce some costs, reduce some inefficiencies, but by and large it is maintaining where we are now and not having the increases that we had planned during the course of the year.", "Share buyback. You know, I have between now and Friday to figure out exactly what we might want to do with the share buyback. I don\u2019t think it is prudent to really describe it, because it takes away the opportunities we have to be opportunistic in the market and everything.  I think it is fair to say that we would expect to be in the market, that us guiding you to flat numbers and the model as it is there is not an indication that we don\u2019t have an appetite and a desire to be in the market repurchasing shares, and I think that our history would demonstrate that we will in fact do that.", "Harry Blount \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Thanks. Dave, I know you said you anticipated being fully transitioned on the Maxtor product later this quarter, but is it safe to assume that the desktop products specifically is now fully transitioned?", " Dave Wickersham", "No.  We basically have 700,000 drives to go to complete it. Most of the desktop will be completed by the end of November completely and then we will have a minor number of enterprise drives that will carry us into mid-December.", "Charles Pope", "Dave is addressing it from a manufacturing perspective.  There may be a few hundred thousand left from a sales perspective that carry over into the March quarter, but aren\u2019t expected to have a material impact on the March quarter results.", "Harry Blount \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Then the last few questions are, Brian you had indicated that CE in the 1 inch space was essentially flat during September. Could you give a little bit more of a breakout on the DVR gaming side?", "And then Charles, I just have one more back on the desktop side. You indicated negative 16 on the Maxtor product in the December quarter. Should we assume as we move to the March timeframe, just to tighten up the models as we look forward, that we should be building in a Seagate desktop margin that is more in the mid-teens?", "Charles Pope", "Well I have never really been granular about what the individual market margins are, but in the March and June quarters we are essentially 100% Seagate based products, and we have modeled and feel confident in returning to our operating model of 24% to 26% gross margins, with some sequential improvement during that period.", " Brian Dexheimer", "June to September growth was what I would say relatively modest unit growth in DVR and gaming combined, and somewhere in the 5% to 10% range.", "Harry Blount \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "But similar amount of increase on both the DVR and the gaming?", " Brian Dexheimer", "Yes.", "Harry Blount \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham.", " Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham", "Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen.  In terms of your new, low-cost 160 gig, how should we think about that product ramping? Where do you expect it to ultimately be applied? Is this going to be namely 160 gig and under, or will you apply it further within your desktop line?", " Brian Dexheimer", "The 160 gig low-cost, can you just zero me in on what specifically you are referring to?", " Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham", "Well that is part of your new low-cost product suite that is going to be launched, right?", " Brian Dexheimer", "In the second half of the year?", " Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham", "Yes.", " Brian Dexheimer", "Yes.", " Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham", "So as you see that ramping, how should we view that? Is that going to be ultimately applied to attack the markets that other competitors have been going after, so you now have a competitive product?  Any color there would be helpful. ", " Brian Dexheimer", "Well let me first correct that perception. We have always felt like we have a competitive product.  This, as Bill pointed out, helps us bring costs down even further and makes us that much more competitive.  So the lack of a  competitive product has never been our issue in any statement in the market,  necessarily. I think what we are struggling with is the margin profiles up to this point.  Going forward, we will not hesitate in struggling with that to keep the share that we\u2019ve got.", "To address your original question around the second half of the year and the 160 gigabyte, that primarily will be a desktop purpose design, but it will also have applications in the DVR space that I think will be significant. At the same time, we will be working on some higher density PER disk implementations that actually go up in the product line and are greater than the 160 gig disk, that will help us attack things in the line and higher end DVR market.", " Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham", "Secondly, in terms of the CapEx reductions, can you provide some color on what is actually represented in the $150 million delta? Any specific examples of the types of process improvements or changes you were able to implement to reduce this capital spending level?", " Dave Wickersham", "Sure Rich.  The good news is, from our perspective, is it is across all areas.  Frankly head, media and slider through drive.  It again demonstrates some of the benefits that we are seeing as we both mature and ramp some of the new technologies. So when I think about the capital utilization, the improvement in OEE, the good news  is that it is really across all segments, all portions of our capital equipment. So it did turn out to be roughly 60% slider through drive and the other 40% is in the component world. ", "Again, the good thing that we saw is the benefit of the improved focus and the benefits of the products and technologies across the board.", " Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham", "Lastly, Bill, as you look into the next calendar year, there has been a lot of hammering about overall demand falling off a cliff. Any color you have on what you think the industry growth rate will really be, and what you have in your own internal planning; and how much of an effect, either positively or negatively, do you think Vista will be within that forecast?", "Bill Watkins", "Sounded more like a Brian question to me.", " Brian Dexheimer", "Rich, let me take a stab at that. First I would point you to history and I would say pretty consistently we have seen a period of about three years here where we have seen high teens in year-on-year growth rate.  And in fact, as I pointed out in the comments here, we saw 17% growth from September to September quarter in the one we just finished.", "I think it would be imprudent for us to think that kind of growth continues back into PC refresh cycles, et cetera. So our expectations going forward for year-on-year growth are slightly less aggressive than that, but still in the teens.  So I don\u2019t think it is a great deviation from past experience. Again, these are year-on-year growth rates.", "The effect of Vista is really a question that we, as you can appreciate, get asked quite often. We are currently planning that there is a little bit of demand shift from this quarter that we are in right now into the March quarter. If you picked up in my earlier comments the fact we expect about 115 million to 120 million units in December; you might note that sequentially, that is not a very aggressive growth rate, based on history. The primary reason for that is the shift of 2 million or 3 million units of desktop and notebook demand into that March quarter.", "Now if we are right about that, that will generally help the March quarter be a little stronger than normal, which typically is not too far off the December quarter. If we are wrong, then we will probably see some demand shift back towards us in quarter. It is a little too early to tell.", " Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steven Fox \u2013 Merrill Lynch.", " Steven Fox \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Two questions.  First of all, it sounds like you are going to draw down inventories as you go through the rest of the fiscal year. So can we assume that the negative effects on your gross margin are included in the gross margin outlook that you just provided?", "Charles Pope", "Yes. Our adjustment to inventories is reflected in the outlook.", " Steven Fox \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Great.  Secondly, just to further understand the pricing dynamics that you put in, you obviously are going to have a cost advantage in the second half of the year. Can you describe what kind of cost advantage you are going to have versus your competition in order to meet comp and still hold gross margins? Maybe just talk a little bit more specifically about which product areas that is going to come from the most?", " Dave Wickersham", "Let me restate what we said which is, with the introduction of products frankly across all market segments, we are seeing cost benefits of that technology that we discussed with many of you back in June. So it is not specific to any one product and not specific to any one segment. We are basically refreshing to a large extent, across the board. So as those new products are phased in with higher density, higher yields and lower costs, you are going to see the benefit across the board.", " Steven Fox \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "This is correct that it does give you enough pricing flexibility where you think you can be aggressive in this type of environment and still hold margins?", "Dave Wickersham", "That's correct and in fact we believe that it gives the ability to respond to the market pricing and grow our margins during the back half of the year.", " Steven Fox \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley.", "Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Hi guys. Just a quick question on that the perpendicular transition. As you think about that over the next 12 months, how are you considering the risk of potentially needing to carry more inventory to manage some of the supply constraints? In particular you point to a tight supply of two precious metals in your 10-K that are required in greater amounts as you shift over to perpendicular?", "Dave Wickersham", "I think as far as continuity of supply, including the impact for precious metals, one that has been addressed and two to the extent there is increased cost of those precious metals for the introduction of perpendicular, it's already factored into the outlook that Charles talked about. So we really don\u2019t see any other supply constraints in our ability to phase over. So now what we are doing is frankly working customer-by-customer to ensure that we have the proper amount of overlap between their current product in the phase in a perpendicular. Frankly, that\u2019s no different than any other product transition that we go forward with. ", "So the perpendicular products have been well accepted as I said in the opening comments. We are very, very pleased with the maturity of the perpendicular from a component and a drive assembly and yield perspective. So again, I don\u2019t want to say its business as usual, but frankly I don\u2019t know a better way to describe it other than to say the transition really now has become business as usual, transitioning our customers over to perpendicular.", "Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Great. And then just one quick follow up, sorry if I missed it, but what's your perception of where industry channel inventory stands at the end of September?", "Brian Dexheimer", "As we've reported, our inventory was pretty consistent with our model which has been less than five weeks for quite some time. The industry inventory outside of Seagate appears to be that or may be even slightly less as we exited September, so it was a rather healthy position as we came into this quarter.", "Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "I guess I'm a little bit confused on your comments on the ASP declines this quarter. I think during your August call you said that you were planning for ASP declines on a like-for-like basis of 7% and it sounds like this quarter you saw 6%. So, I'm trying to reconcile that with your comments that maybe pricing was a point more aggressive than your plan or a point-and-a-half more aggressive than your plan heading into December?", "Dave Wickersham", "What we had indicated was that September quarter was largely in line with our expectations. As you stated, it's probably a little bit more moderate than the June quarter, but largely in line with our expectations, but was in excess of 6% price erosion on like-to-like basis in September. ", "We had expected a little bit of moderation, only above a half a point or so of moderation, of price decline in the December quarter. We are finding that it\u2019s in fact closer to the 7% range and so we have in the December quarter about a point-and-a-half more price erosion than was built into our original plans that we gave everyone.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Does that suggest that ASP declines in December that you're planning for higher than 7% if it\u2019s a point-and-a-half higher?", "Dave Wickersham", "The original December plans were about 5.5%.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "It sounds like from a lot of your comments that you guys are shipping higher capacity drives, on average, than the industry. I would assume that would help the overall blended ASP. But your ASPs were still down 5% in the quarter. How is that offsetting the ASP declines you are seeing? Are you also seeing very aggressive pricing on the high-cap drives?", "Dave Wickersham", "Well the pricing is pretty consist across all platforms, all our markets. It is probably a little bit more aggressive in the notebook, but when you sit and look at just the mathematical ASP, you know divide revenue by the number of units, there is a very big mix impact on that. And if you sat and look at the increase in desktop, notebook and the reduction in enterprise drives from the June quarter to the September quarter, that represents the biggest shift that you saw in the ASP declines.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. So some of that is slower enterprise than the June quarter?", "Dave Wickersham", "That\u2019s correct.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Miller - Brean Murray.", "Mark Miller - Brean Murray", "The conference began with concerns about pricing, I was just a little puzzled here because I think Bill, you were talking about your expected normal dynamics to return and yet it seems like you know anything if pricing still going to be pretty aggressive December quarter. Maybe I'm taking these comments out of context, but what gives you the feeling things are going to settle down?", "Bill Watkins", "Well, you know again I think there is only so much losses -- I mean some of our competitors are going to report some pretty horrendous losses this quarter. So I think there is a sense of that, but right now we are planning on pretty aggressive pricing and what feel confident of is our ability to get rid of the old Maxtor products, which are beyond  -- this is like a big anchor on us right now from a cost perspective -- and then the introduction of the new products that we think have significant cost reductions; and then obviously the access to the new market and 1.8 inch drives.", "So again, we look at those three things and our ability execute those three factors in an environment we feel that we can be very, very competitive and obviously deliver on the continued increase in earnings throughout the year.", "Mark Miller - Brean Murray", "I think very recently that there has been some scuttlebutt about one of the share aggressors at the low-end of desktop maybe walking away from some business. Have you seen anything like that perhaps very recently?", "Bill Watkins", "You know, a lot of the OEM deals are cut in September. People were very aggressive in those OEM deals. Now I think, the channels seem to have moderated a little bit going through the month of October, We are going to wait and see. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "I think we have started to see some stops and starts relative to some of the behavior we had seen let\u2019s say February through August. It\u2019s not clear to me whether that\u2019s been an intentional backing away of aggressiveness or whether there are some constraints on the supply chain that necessitated that to happen. But just to confirm some reports, we did see that, I would say it\u2019s been on a very selective and regional basis.", "Mark Miller - Brean Murray", "Basically you were talking about fiscal '08 capital spending being down from '07. Is that still going to be the case maybe running 8% to 8.5% of your sales?", "Dave Wickersham", "I can tell you that it will be down certainly from the 1.15, I don\u2019t  want you to pin me down to a percentage yet, but it definitely will be down below 1 billion and consistent with the percent of revenue you described.", "Mark Miller - Brean Murray", "Thank you.", "Bill Watkins", "So, with that, thank you for joining on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today's conference.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Seagate Technology's fiscal second quarter 2007 financial results conference call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for questions. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. This conference is being recorded. ", "This conference call contains forward-looking, including but not limited to, statements related to the Company's future financial performance. These forward-looking statements are based on information available to Seagate as of the date of this conference call, but are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's annual reports on Form 10-K, as filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on September 11th 2006, and the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on November 7th 2006, and in the Company's Form 8-K, as filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on January 23rd 2007. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the Company's views as of any subsequent date, and Seagate undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made. ", "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Bill Watkins, CEO. Please go ahead, sir. ", "Bill Watkins", "Thank you, Matthew. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Charles Pope, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dave Wickersham, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Dexheimer, Executive Vice President and Chief Sales and Marketing Officer. ", "To begin, I'd like to make a few comments on our second quarter performance and then provide a brief outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2007. I will then hand it over to Brian, Dave and Charles to discuss details of our market, operating and financial performance. ", "I am very pleased to announce that Seagate has achieved a significant new milestone, delivering the industry's first $3 billion quarter, a 30% increase from our year-ago quarter. ", "These strong results were driven by a number of positive factors: the continued, explosive growth in digital content and the resulting increase in demand for storage; Seagate's ability to deliver a broadening suite of products to a growing set of customers; a better-than-expected pricing environment for desktop products during the period; and the successful transition of Maxtor customers to the more cost-effective Seagate products. ", "With the Maxtor integration completed and exciting new products hitting the market, we believe that Seagate will continue to increase profitability even as we enter the traditionally slower second half of the fiscal year. ", "Overall, the industry has completed its fourth consecutive year of annual unit growth in excess of 15%, and Seagate far exceeded that performance. Seagate continues to hold the leadership position in three of the four major markets by remaining committed to constantly improving our technology, investing in our operational infrastructure, and delivering on our financial objectives. ", "I'd like to give you just a few market highlights. In the mobile computing market, we delivered strong year-over-year growth, with a number of important perpendicular qualifications and an increase in average capacity. ", "In the consumer electronics, we shipped a record number of units and began qualifications of our new 1.8-inch perpendicular drive. Gaming was particularly strong, and DVRs continue to remain the highest-volume sector of the CE market. ", "In the enterprise space, we maintained our leading market share position, and have stabilized our position in this market following the Maxtor product transition. Our 2.5-inch small form factor products are gaining significant traction in this market. Specifically, qualifications of the 2.5-inch, 15,000 RPM product, the fastest drive on the market, will help generate future volume. ", "In the desktop market, we delivered an improvement in product mix, as a number of our drives shipped over 200 gigabytes grew substantially year over year. Entering our third fiscal quarter, we are in a healthy channel inventory position with respect to both Maxtor and Seagate products. ", "Our branded solutions revenue exhibited strong sequential growth this quarter for both brands. And based on preorders, acceptance of our new product line and our dual-brand positioning has been outstanding. Following the close of the Maxtor acquisition, we have completed the related product transition, and we are now clearly benefiting from the expected manufacturing efficiencies. ", "For the next six months, our focus will be on launching and ramping new products with lower cost structures across various markets, and we are tracking to plan. We completed the Maxtor integration in just seven months, well ahead of our original schedule. With the transition completed in mid November -- December, we expect this to favorably impact our gross margins and operating results beginning in the March 2007 quarter. ", "As we enter the traditionally slower half of the fiscal year, we are confident that the Company is on path to continued success and growing profitability for the third and fourth quarters. As we have previously indicated, there are three key factors that will be instrumental in driving profitability in the next two quarters. ", "The first is the completed Maxtor product transition and the continued improvement in manufacturing utilization rates. The second is the successful customer qualifications and ramp of new products with lower cost structures across the various markets. This effort is tracking to plan and will continue throughout the next six months. ", "And third, the expansion of market coverage with the new 1.8-inch product, which is currently in qualification at major OEMs. We are pleased with the progress we have made with the 1.8-inch drive, and look forward to providing updates as this product is introduced into the handheld consumer applications. ", "In summary, Seagate continues to be the industry technology, product and cost leader, with access to virtually every available market in the $30 billion disc drive industry. We remain committed to meeting our financial and operational objectives and providing value for our shareholders, evidenced by our strong performance this quarter. ", "We are pleased with our recent results and are extremely excited about the opportunities we see in the market, as we are confident the Company is well positioned to capitalize on these prospects. ", "I now would like to turn it over to Brian for more details on the market highlights of the quarter. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Thanks, Bill. Looking back at calendar year 2006, we saw continuing indicators that support the broad global expansion of the creation, aggregation, distribution and consumption of digital content. In 2006, the industry shipped over 430 million units, an increase of more than 15% over calendar year 2005. ", "Industry revenues surpassed $30 billion for the year and in December reached the first $8 billion quarter in industry history. More specific to the December quarter, the overall industry experienced healthy year-on-year growth of 16% and 6%, sequentially. Seagate performed extremely well in the December quarter, maintaining its leadership in three of the four major markets for storage. ", "Seagate's growth during the quarter was primarily fueled by the consumer electronics market and seasonal demand increases for desktop and branded businesses. As we look forward into the March quarter, we expect industry unit demand overall to be 116 million to 120 million units, or about 14% to 18% year-on-year growth. ", "Now, I'll give some detail on the individual markets. In the mobile computing space, we believe, overall market demand grew 32% year on year to 30 million units. Seagate again outpaced the industry's growth, shipping 4.4 million drives, an increase of 52% year on year. During the quarter, unit shipments of our perpendicular notebook drive tripled to over 1.6 million units, and the drive has now been qualified at a total of 21 OEMs. ", "The average capacity of our products shipped into mobile computing environments increased to 90 gigabytes, an increase of 36% year on year and 13%, sequentially. Looking forward, we expect overall notebook demand for the March quarter to be flat with the December quarter. ", "In the consumer electronics market, Seagate maintained its leadership position during the quarter, shipping a record 7 million units. In the DVR portion of this market, the average capacity per drive increased during the quarter to just under 200 gigabytes. ", "Gaming remained one of the primary applications in this market, and we successfully met the strong seasonal demand throughout the December quarter. Average capacity per unit also improved considerably, as new consoles entered the market, emphasizing rich media content experiences. ", "In handheld applications, our new 5-millimeter-high, 1.8-inch, single-disc, 60-gigabyte drive began qualifications with providers of portable media players and other consumer electronics applications. We expect to realize revenue from this product in the current quarter. We expect demand in the CE market to be flat to slightly down in the March quarter, as seasonality in certain applications produces less demand. ", "Moving to the enterprise space, Seagate maintained its leadership position, shipping 4.1 million units. As you recall, in September, we stated we were intent on maintaining our share position in this space. With all Maxtor customer transitions completed during the quarter, we believe, we were successful in this regard and have stabilized our share position, going forward. ", "The adoption of Seagate's 2.5-inch small form factor drives for enterprise-class applications accelerated rapidly during the quarter. Seagate's shipments of 2.5-inch enterprise drives grew 150% sequentially to 800,000 units. More and more, we're seeing enterprise customers look for solutions that can lower power consumption, reduce heat, and address space constraints without sacrificing enterprise-class performance. ", "As a result, we expect the industry to continue rapid adoption of small form factor drives over the next three to six months. We believe that Seagate is best positioned to serve this market with both our 10k and recently announced 15k small form factor drives. We expect overall enterprise demand in the March quarter to be flat to that of the December quarter. ", "In the desktop compute market, we maintained our leadership position by shipping 25.7 million units. Consistent with our ramp of perpendicular technology, our product mix continued to improve, as shipments of products 250 gigabytes and greater more than doubled year over year, representing 34% of units shipped during the quarter. The average capacity of desktop products reached 185 gigabytes. ", "In the global distribution channel, demand remains strong for both Seagate and Maxtor brands, and we exited the quarter with less than five weeks of channel inventory. In addition, during the quarter, we were successful in maintaining levels of sales in and sales out revenue in global distribution channels, subsequent to our decision to terminate our relationship with eSys. For the March quarter, we expect to see seasonal demand that is slightly down in the desktop space. ", "Finally, Seagate's branded solutions had a strong seasonal quarter and revenue was up sequentially. Earlier this month at CES, we unveiled our dual-brand positioning in the retail channel and a new lineup of Seagate-branded retail products. Both were met with overwhelming acceptance, and we are very excited about the prospects in the retail space. Seagate's new line of Free Agent products will begin shipping in February. ", "In summary, we are very encouraged by the opportunities presented by the industry throughout the remainder of 2007 and Seagate's unique position to capture revenue share across all markets. ", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave to provide an update on our acquisition and operations. ", "Dave Wickersham", "Thank you, Brian. The Maxtor integration and product transition to Seagate products was completed in mid-December. Completing this transition is a key factor in our expected improvement in gross margins and operating model beginning in the March 2000 quarter. ", "As Bill mentioned, we completed this transition in only seven months, well ahead of our original schedule. Beyond a few IT system conversions scheduled to be finished in the coming weeks, the integration of Maxtor is complete. ", "Regarding finished goods of Maxtor legacy products, as anticipated, there were approximately 200,000 units in inventory at the end of December, which we expect to be consumed this calendar quarter. ", "I would like to take this opportunity to thank and acknowledge our employees for their continued focus and dedication in achieving the integration of Maxtor ahead of schedule, while at the same time remaining focused on the successful ramp and customer qualifications of Seagate new products. ", "There has been some speculation recently about the ramp of perpendicular recording based products. So let me provide Seagate's perspective. First, Seagate's yields for perpendicular based products are as good as or better than planned. Second, the yields of our perpendicular products are better when compared against the prior generation products at the same point in their product lifecycles. ", "Third, customer qualifications of perpendicular based products continue to progress as anticipated, and we see no quality, reliability or perpendicular related issues that will prevent us from achieving our perpendicular shipment plans. In the December quarter we shipped approximately 10 million drives that utilize perpendicular recording, up from the 3.7 million that shipped in the September quarter. We will achieve our internal plan of exiting our fiscal fourth quarter with greater than 50% of all drives shipped in the quarter utilizing perpendicular recording. ", "Finally, in regards to the supply and cost of precious metals used in the manufacturing process of perpendicular media, Seagate has adequate supply plans in place to support our expected perpendicular product ramp requirements. ", "While there has been a run-up in the cost of some of these precious metals recently, we're taking actions to mitigate the financial impact going forward, some of which include alternative designs, improvements in material utilization and optimizing our supply chain. ", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Charles. ", "Charles Pope", "Thanks, Dave. You will find the Company's press release, 8-K and additional financial information related to Seagate's financial performance, along with a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results and other supplemental information in the Investor Relations section of Seagate's website at seagate.com. Throughout my remarks I will be referring to specific sections of the supplemental financial information by slide number. ", "Seagate reported December quarter revenue of $3 billion and unit shipments of 41 million. Included are revenue and unit shipments from legacy Maxtor products of approximately $200 million and 2.5 million units respectively. GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are $140 million and $0.23 respectively. ", "Included in the GAAP results are approximately $76 million of acquisition-related charges and associated tax effects, as well as a $19 million charge in other income and expense related to the early retirement of our 8% debentures. Without these charges and the associated tax effects, non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share was $236 million and $0.39. ", "Non-GAAP gross margin for the combined company in the December quarter was 19.9%. Slide 6 has the adjustments made to GAAP gross margin. Gross margin percent for legacy Maxtor products was approximately negative 13.7%. Gross margin percent for Seagate products was approximately 22.3%. ", "In aggregate, price declines were favorable when compared to our plan, due primarily to a more benign pricing environment in the desktop market for much of the quarter. The notebook market continues to be very competitive, and the price declines were slightly more than we had anticipated coming into the December quarter. ", "For the desktop and notebook markets, the rate of price declines for the March quarter is expected to follow normal seasonal patterns and be marginally more aggressive as compared to the December quarter. However, prices for products in the consumer electronics and enterprise markets are expected to decline at a rate similar to that of the December quarter. ", "GAAP operating expenses, composed of R&D, SG&A and amortization of intangibles, for the December quarter were $379 million. Excluding acquisition-related costs of $29 million, non-GAAP operating expenses were $350 million. This compares to a non-GAAP equivalent of $388 million in the September quarter, which includes a $40 million charge for the -- to the bad debt reserve related to Seagate's termination of eSys as a customer. ", "Operating expenses for fiscal 2007, including Maxtor acquisition-related costs and the $40 million bad debt charge, but excluding acquisition integration costs, are expected to be approximately $1.475 billion. Slide 7 has the detail for the adjustments made to GAAP operating expenses for the December quarter. GAAP net other income and expense for the December quarter was $21 million of expense, and includes a $19 million charge related to the early retirement of the 8% debentures. ", "Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities ended the quarter at $1.56 billion. During the first two quarters of fiscal 2007, Seagate made capital investments totaling $466 million of which $239 million was invested in the December quarter. We continue to expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 to be approximately $1.15 billion. Cash flow from operations was $482 million for the December quarter. ", "During the December quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 23 million shares. However, the shares were received late in the quarter, and therefore, had minimal impact to the average shares outstanding calculated for the December quarter. So far in the month of January, an additional 13 million shares have been repurchased. ", "Accordingly, the diluted outstanding share count for fiscal Q3 is modeled at approximately 570 million shares. Since May of 2006, Seagate has repurchased approximately 60 million shares. The Company has authorization to purchase approximately $1.4 billion of additional shares under the current stock repurchase program. ", "Now, for the business outlook. For fiscal year 2007, the Company's outlook for revenue is $11.5 billion to $11.7 billion, and for non-GAAP diluted earnings per share the outlook is $1.70 to $1.75. Some of the underlying assumptions in the fiscal year financial outlook that have changed since our last conference call are as follows. ", "First, because of the change to our capital structure and the ongoing stock repurchase program, other income and expense is now expected to be a net expense of approximately $20 million. Second, the $40 million charge we incorporated into our fiscal Q1 results for bad debt is included in both the GAAP and the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share estimates. And third, the expected impact of the higher cost for precious metals used in the perpendicular recording process has been factored into our outlook. ", "Fiscal 2007 GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be $1.27 to $1.32, which includes approximately $234 million directly related to the Maxtor acquisition, $19 million of charges related to the early redemption of the 8% notes, and a favorable adjustment to restructuring reserves of $3 million. For the March quarter revenue is expected to be between $2.9 billion and $3 billion. ", "Other income and expense is modeled to be a net expense of approximately $10 million. The tax rate is modeled to be approximately 5%. Accordingly, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the March quarter is expected to be $0.56 to $0.60. Including acquisition-related costs for Maxtor of approximately $40 million, GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be $0.49 to $0.53. ", "It is important to note that purchase accounting related to charges will be incurred beginning with the March quarter financial results related to the pending EVault acquisition. The purchase accounting allocation for goodwill and intangible assets is not complete, and therefore, amortization and other acquisition-related costs associated with EVault are not included in our GAAP or non-GAAP estimates for the March quarter or fiscal year 2007. ", "That concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call back over to Bill. ", "Bill Watkins", "Thank you, Charles. The December quarter was a tremendous milestone for Seagate in the industry. I'm proud of our employees' continued commitment to excellence in everything we do and congratulate them on an outstanding quarter. Looking ahead to calendar year 2007, I'm very excited about our product, market and operational leadership, and the opportunity in front of us. ", "So with that we'll open it up for questions, and we can share the Kool-Aid with you guys. ", "Question-and-Answer-Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. ", "Bill Watkins", "Let me make a comment, Matthew, right now. We are going to -- due to the fact we have so many people who want to ask questions, we're going to kind of limit it to one question and one follow-up per person. ", "Operator", "Okay. With that said, I'll take our first question from Harry Blount with Lehman Brothers. ", "Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you. You guys made some fairly meaningful progress on the finished good inventory sequentially in the quarter. But I also note that on a percentage growth basis, it's still up year-over-year more than revenue. ", "Obviously, with you guys growing retail, you'll have to carry a little bit more. But I'd love to get a sense from you, Charles, where you think finished good inventory ought to be on kind of a normalized basis. ", "Charles Pope", "Harry, why don't I have Dave answer that question, but I think he'll answer it on a total turns basis, and kind of help you understand some of the things that are going into the model we have for inventory turns. ", "Bill Watkins", "Yes. Before he does that, one of the things that we have to be careful today, with a lot of product transitions going forward, and as many different market segments we're trying to do product transitions. As we go through these qualifications, we've got to keep enough of the old inventory as we make this transition so we don't jeopardize our customers and their delivery systems, if you have delivered commitments. ", "So we are going to probably carry more finished goods of products going forward, just because of the massive amount of different market segments and product transitions we're trying to do, and keeping our customers whole as we go through these calls. So with that, Dave, do you want to answer? ", "Dave Wickersham", "Just from an outlook perspective, as well as achievement, as you may note, we did achieve approximately 12 turns, as we anticipated in the December quarter. And we see that we'll probably continue to be in that range going forward. ", "And as it relates to finished goods, you know, our focus, as we've talked about in the December quarter, was ready to do a couple things. First is to focus on the depletion of the Maxtor finished goods and transition to Seagate going forward. And as discussed, with the approximate $200,000 in finished goods, we think we were successful are there. ", "Having said that, though, while there's progress, we still think there's opportunities. Yes, we have more configurations, more complexity, more customers. All that is goodness -- does present some challenges on finished goods inventory. But I still believe we've got some opportunity. ", "So the teams are continuing to work together to try to balance the equation better between supply and demand. At the same time, meet our customer requirements and stay within the balance of 12 turns, and likewise continue to optimize our freight costs at the same time. ", "Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers", "And then the follow-up relates to Brian. On the outlook side of the equation, you were fairly clear, I think, on most segments. But on the desktop segment specifically, was hoping you could provide a little bit of color and any data points you might have on retail desktop inventory of PCs. You talked about your own channel inventories. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Well, I don't want to get too far ahead of us, Harry, on talking about what we think customers are -- do or don't have downstream in channels. So far we have not been able to determine that it's wildly out of balance with anything else that we've seen in the last couple of years. ", "And our outlook includes from an industry perspective about a 3% to 4% unit decline sequentially. So I think that's the best way to characterize it for you right now. ", "Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers", "Great. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. ", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Yes. Thanks. Just quickly going through some of your comments on gross margins, perpendicular, clearly tracking on plan or even a little better; pricing similar, a little bit better this quarter. ", "And then you have increasing average capacities in the various segments. Are there any headwinds on gross margins as we think about the next couple of quarters that we didn't discuss on this call? ", "Bill Watkins", "Well, I think pricing is still an issue. I mean, I think desktop pricing in the channel was maybe -- probably the only place where we thought it was pretty benign. I think notebook, for example, which is probably one of the highest growth, is actually quite aggressive right now. ", "So I think what concerns us is our own ability to execute. We've got to stay focused on our ability to execute. And if we do that, we feel pretty good. I think what we can't control sometimes is what our competitors do from pricing. And that's probably the one thing we probably worry about, though. Brian, do you have anything to add? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Well, Katy, just to address your question a little broader than perhaps Bill did, the items that are going to get us to a step up of roughly 200 basis points in gross margin in the March quarter. And even a little better in the June quarter the way that we've modeled it, is we do have new products with lower capacity -- with lower cost structures coming in, higher volumes of those. ", "And you know, we do have an increasing mix of products in terms of the capacity and performance. Those are the things that will help lift the margin. The things that you called headwinds are really, as Bill described, a pricing environment that's still a very competitive environment. ", "And then, as we have talked about, the increase in some of the costs, like ruthenium, that go into perpendicular recording -- those are the headwinds. All of those are factored into the guidance that we have given the world as we see it today. But that's really the kind of core variables that offset each other. ", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "So just to be clear, what's the right timeframe to get back to the 24% to 26% long-term goal on gross margins? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "March quarter should be at the low-end of that range, and we should be the midpoint of that range or a little better in the June quarter. ", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Great. Thank you so much. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from David Bailey with Goldman Sachs. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "Yes. Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could just follow-up on that little bit, Bill, and review the pricing outlook by product category for the March quarter? And what you've seen so far in the channel, and on the OEM side, that gives you confidence in those expectations? ", "Bill Watkins", "I'm not allowed to talk about pricing, so I'm going to let Brian do it. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Let me just rephrase what Charles had said in the outlook. So what he said in the outlook in his comments was notebook and desktop we expected to be marginally more aggressive than they were in the December quarter, and consumer electronics and enterprise to be relatively the same. ", "Trying to separate that for you by channel at this point is a little bit predictive, and I don't think we want to do that. Last quarter we felt the benefit of predicting something was a little bit more aggressive in the channel. And the results showed something more positive. That could happen again this quarter. It may not. ", "So we just have to get through more of the quarter to be able to figure that out. What I can tell you is that as we have negotiated through the OEM portions of each of those segments so I just outlined. We haven't seen any positive or negative surprises. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "And maybe you could just help us understand a little bit why desktop pricing ended up being a little more favorable? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Well, I think it's the primary reason -- and it's hard to tell from a 40% perspective, because that's about how much we are of that space -- but I think the primary reason was the fact that you have a high seasonal demand period. And that typically gives us a price environment that's less aggressive, particularly in markets that operate on more short-term behavior, namely the distribution channel. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Steven Fox with Merrill Lynch. ", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Hi, good afternoon. A little confused on the eSys effect. After you released last quarter, you restated the numbers for about $40 million. Did that come back in Q2, or is it expected to come back in the rest of the year? ", "Bill Watkins", "Charles? ", "Charles Pope", "After we released our financial results in the September quarter, we had a subsequent event that required us to take a $40 million bad debt reserve because of terminating our relationship with eSys. That has not come back. We have not recovered any of the receivables. ", "We are still pursuing all of the avenues available to us to try to recover them. But there is no recovery represented in our December results. And there is no expected recovery that is provided in the guidance that we've given for the fiscal year. ", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "And then, just on the operating expenses -- so, for the quarter coming up, can you just describe how that would look again versus the last quarter? ", "Charles Pope", "Well, it will show some step-up in terms of the operating expenses. I don't remember the exact number. But in the December quarter, we typically close down all nonessential functions during the week between Christmas and New Year's to give people some time off, which represents a significant savings to the Company as we use up accrued vacation instead of normal payroll. ", "And then we have our normal step-ups in terms of some of the merit increases and those types of things. So there will be a step-up, and then there's some additional R&D cost because of the new products that are rolling out that consume protype material. ", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Rob Semple with Credit Suisse. ", "Rob Semple - Credit Suisse", "Thanks, guys. On the gross margin side, when you did the deal with Maxtor about a year ago, you talked about some of the incremental drives coming on, once you got all the production on your own equipment, in kind of above that 26% range you have had on the gross margin target. Any update there in terms of where the incremental drives are coming in now? ", "Charles Pope", "Well, as you can sit and look at where we are forecasting, where in the December quarter Maxtor legacy products had an average gross margin of 13.7%, and we're anticipating taking the combined company from 19.9% combined gross margin in December to something like 24% to 24.5% in the March quarter. ", "You know Seagate's stand-alone margins in December were 22.3%. So, we're getting about 200 basis point lift in terms of Seagate standalone products with the mix and everything. But you can see all the other incremental revenue is coming up to that same level also. ", "So I would say that we are achieving the incremental 26% to 28% gross margin that we expected from Maxtor. And the reason we're not at the 26% is because in last June, when there was some very aggressive pricing, it just kind of lowered the whole bar a little bit. So we're moving back up into that range with new product introductions with reduced cost structures. ", "Rob Semple - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then I guess just one follow-up for Brian. Brian, usually for you guys, CE is up sequentially in the March quarter. I understand your comments on the TAM. But wouldn't you expect to see an above-seasonal quarter this time around, given you've got probably better PS3 production lines, Apple iTV, DVR rollouts, etcetera? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "So my comments earlier were about the CE market being down sequentially for the industry. And I think what you've pointed out is Seagate's performance may in fact be a little bit counter to that, and I would agree with that. ", "Rob Semple - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with J.P. Morgan. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Yes. Thank you. This first question is for Charles and Bill. If I sit and look at your truncated guidance for the fiscal '07 as far as the EPS, can you maybe help us understand, if we take the midpoint of your third quarter EPS range, and then we back into the fourth quarter, it looks like you're actually going to have an EPS decrement sequentially. ", "I'm just trying to understand how that could be if you're talking about gross margin improvements, as well as the impact of a much better flow-through of a reduced share count? ", "Charles Pope", "The modeling that we have and I'm not sure what you did, Mark. The modeling we have, if you just segregate the numbers, it would represent $0.58 for the March quarter and $0.62 for the June quarter. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Are you not using 20 and 39 then, for September and December, the non-GAAP numbers? ", "Charles Pope", "There's 16 for Q1. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. I must have had a glitch then in my model. But either way, I'm trying to get a sense as far as how you can only get, I guess, maybe call $0.04 of improvement when you're talking about having some major gross margin uptake here as you leave the Maxtor integration in history? ", "Charles Pope", "If you sit and look at the total guidance revenue and earnings, you'll see that we're expecting some seasonal lessening of demand in the June quarter on revenue. That's reflected in the guidance that we gave. That is historically the case. ", "And as we sit and look at the June quarter, at this point in time, we don't see any real reason why it would be counter to that so that where you're in fact increasing earnings in a seasonally-lower revenue period of time. Historically in the industry, when the earnings have gone down, so have the -- I mean, when the revenues have gone down, so have earnings. So, I actually think that's a very good outlook. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And then the follow-up would be -- the 1.8-inch market; you folks have seemed pretty loud about the prospects that Seagate possesses, and how it's important in terms of -- mentioned that was one of your three factors to really enjoying this margin uptake. ", "But can you kind of give us some explanation around that market in terms of what is your view of the overall opportunity outside of the iPod? Because there is some concern with the iPhone that there could be some sort of overhang on the iPod, as well as, from what we are gathering, there could be an oversupply of 1.8-inch drives in the market right now, in terms of the drives shipped versus actually consumed. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Hi, Mark. This is Brian. This market will continue to be more volatile at the margin than most of the traditional markets that we operate in, and we go in with our eyes fully open. You might remember that we entered into the 1-inch space and had some great fortune, and then the backside of that, as this market transitions. ", "So what I'd tell you is that we believe that the market is broader than one customer, and it continues to demonstrate that. Our experiences at CES here a few weeks ago reinforced that for us. We also believe it's a market that has the ability to routinely deliver 6 to 9 million units a quarter in volume, and it's a market today that only has two fundamental suppliers in it. ", "I can't speculate where other suppliers might be in terms of their ability to enter the market or announcements around the market. But we think that with our product technology and our supply chain, this is a market we can enter in and be successful. ", "We don't have extraordinary ambitions in terms of market share in the near-term horizon, but think that bringing a product to market at the highest aerial density and the smallest package gives us an opportunity to penetrate that market in a quality fashion. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Mark Miller with Brean Murray. ", "Mark Miller - Brean Murray", "Well, since nobody else said it. Congratulations on your progress. At least I'm impressed with it. I just wanted your thoughts about from where you were at a few months ago on Vista and what Vista is going to do in '07. ", "And also, we've seen a rather large decrease in the price of high-definition TV. I'm just wondering, is there more upside now from either of these than what you thought a couple months ago in your '07 and beyond estimates? ", "Bill Watkins", "Yeah. I'll let Brian to take it. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Sure. I think both trends, without getting real specific, are generally net positive to our business. One, the high-definition point, which you mentioned. Second, it was encouraging for us, because we think the high-definition displays goes with people's desire to enjoy the high-definition content that would naturally come with that. ", "And with that comes, obviously, the opportunity and, hopefully, the desire to record in high-definition. And that's a positive effect on our digital video recording business. In Vista, that also is, at the margin, a positive effect. ", "We haven't baked in either case, either high-def or Vista, significant uptick in volume because of either. But believe that there's some potential upside at the margin in desktop and DVR space because of both. ", "Mark Miller - Brean Murray", "Thanks gentlemen. The final question would be perpendicular. I mean, certainly you guys have been leading in that and you are one of the leader. But we've seen some announcements now from your competitors, especially in the mobile space, and how is that shaping up? Are people starting to catch up, or you still feel you're two to three quarters ahead of them? ", "Bill Watkins", "It's hard for us to know exactly what our competitors -- because we hear a lot of different stuff. My sense is that we have -- still have about a two-quarter lead, maybe more, actually, in certain markets and depending on the competitor. So I don't know. Dave, do you have anything to add? You stay pretty close to that. ", "Dave Wickersham", "I think that's accurate, Bill. I think that, given what we've described as our percent of perpendicular shipments this quarter. We think we are close to twice that of the industry average. And so, and as we look forward to the balance of this calendar year, likewise, with our plans, we think we continue to have a richer mix of perpendicular going forward. ", "So and then I guess finally, we're the only ones shipping perpendicular applications in all four market segments. So we think we're well positioned. Is it two or three quarters? Not sure. ", "Certainly, competition is probably seeing the benefits of perpendicular recording, and really just out of gas on longitudinal. So, we expect them to ramp. Whether or not they catch us in the remaining calendar year, we don't think so. So we think we've got a lead. I guess I'd describe it as a quarter or two. ", "Mark Miller - Brean Murray", "Thanks. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group", "Great quarter. Brian, could you give us the TAM for the December quarter. The total number of units you expected that shipped in the quarter? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Not all the returns are in, but my expectation is $120 to $122, somewhere in that range. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group", "Okay. We previously thought $115 million to $120 million, and kind of thought there might be some push-out in demand, due to Vista. Did Vista or any of that noise impact that? Why was the -- is there anything specific that you can point to that the TAM was greater than you anticipated? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Sure. I think the primary driver was over performance for, I think, the fourth quarter in a row in the notebook space. It was just stronger than had anticipated coming in. I think the desktop space at the margin maybe a little bit stronger seasonally in December than we had expected going in. But I think those are the two primary factors on the client side. ", "The CE and enterprise space came in pretty much where we expected. So not altogether that surprising, when the numbers are getting this big, you know, a difference of 3 million units or 4 million units, you know isn't as much as it might sound in absolute terms. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group", "Right. And then on the 750 gigabyte drive, how are things going there? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Great. We're encouraged by our penetration of a number of different applications, surveillance and the near line storage space being the two primary ones. We're in qualifications across the board with most of the providers in the near line storage space, and hope to have more news to report there when we have our next call in April about some success in getting those design wins. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group", "What do you think the market growth of that is? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Well, it's been the fastest growing segment of the enterprise space, as you know, an absolute terms, it's still a small portion of the overall enterprise space, if you include mission critical. But we believe it's growing quite rapidly and it's erosive to the tape business, and its additive to our enterprise space in SCSI and Fiber, and now SAS, segment of the business. So we're very encouraged by it's hard to tell what the absolute growth numbers are going to be, but it's certainly a high-growth space. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group", "Congratulations on that, and congratulations on drawing a line in the sand on market share and causing rational pricing. Thanks. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Joel Inman with Robert Baird. ", "Joel Inman - Robert Baird", "Hi, thank you. Could you share with us just the ASP in the quarter? And also the mix between distribution channel revenues, retail, OEM? ", "Charles Pope", "I will if you'll give me one second. OEM on a combined basis was 64% with distribution at 36%. If you look at North America -- geographic splits, it was North America 26%, Europe 30% and Asia-Pac 40%. And the blended ASP -- hang on -- $71, basically, no, hold it, $73. ", "Joel Inman - Robert Baird", "Okay. And retail is just folded into distribution? ", "Charles Pope", "Yes. ", "Joel Inman - Robert Baird", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Charles Pope", "Next. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Rich Kugele with Needham and Corporate. ", "Rich Kugele - Needham and Corporate", "Thank you. Just two quick questions. First, I believe you had intended on end-of-lifing the 10-K SAS that Maxtor had previously been the only one supplying. Is that still your intention today? And what have you been migrating those customers that were interested in it to? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Rich, this is Brian. Let me take that one. We in fact have end-of-lifed the legacy Maxtor design, as we had indicated. There are a select number of customers that we have engaged with that have a desire to continue that product trajectory. And what we've been successful in doing is moving them onto a Seagate platform. ", "Rich Kugele - Needham and Corporate", "Okay. And then just lastly, you did mention ruthenium, which has been somewhat over-hyped. Can you just comment as to how much of the EPS? Do you think it's really impacting? Are you just being conservative there, based on what's going on today? And how quickly do you expect to see your own actions reducing that impact? ", "Charles Pope", "I'll take a piece of it and then let Dave take the other piece. You know the cost of ruthenium has run up. And without giving you the amount we use per disc or anything else, we believe that we still have the lowest-cost discs in the industry. And the cost of ruthenium is built into the guidance that we have given. ", "So as I mentioned when Katy had the question, cost of ruthenium is a bit of a headwind in terms of the expanding margins. Now, I'll let Dave answer the rest of it. ", "Dave Wickersham", "Rich, there's not much to add other than what I described in the script. And that is, given the run-up in ruthenium and, clearly, the cost and inventory impact and we're doing everything possible within our control to mitigate it. ", "And that ranges anywhere from the design team looking at what are the design alternatives, the process team looking at what we can do to improve the material utilization, and of course, the supply chain, just working end-to-end to try to make sure that from an OEE and utilization perspective, we've identified all constraints and improved the overall utilization of ruthenium. ", "And so beyond that, and what Charles stated in terms of it being in the outlook, you know we're concerned. And that's why we have all hands on deck. We're looking at it across the board. Like you'd expect us to do on any significant cost impact or supply constraint. ", "So we're attacking it aggressively. It's something that we anticipate we're going to need to continue to do. And we've factored that in not only to our outlook, but in our priorities in the Company. ", "Rich Kugele - Needham and Corporate", "Okay. Thanks very much. ", "Bill Watkins", "Rich, let me add to that. I think it'd be -- I mean, when we think about the biggest issues in the fourth quarter, ruthenium probably wouldn't be there. There's a lot of other issues with our competitor base, and what they do is probably more important to us as we go forward. ", "Rich Kugele - Needham and Corporate", "That's very good. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Hi. Thank you. Charles, I'm sorry to belabor this point, but in terms of the gross margin, if I model sort of the midpoint of your revenue range and I model operating expenses slightly higher on an absolute basis, I am not getting in my model to a 24% gross margin, I'm getting more like a 23. Am I thinking about this wrong or can you just help me out there in terms of am I wrong on the operating expense number, or -- can you help me? ", "Charles Pope", "I'm not exactly sure what you're using. But the gross margin that we have modeled for the March quarter is about 24.5. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "You're modeling 24.5. Okay. ", "Bill Watkins", "And Wickersham is being held accountable to that. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then, in terms of the gross margin improvement sequentially from December to March, what percentage of that would you say is the exit of the Maxtor business and what percentage of that would you say, roughly, is the ramping of new lower cost discs? ", "Charles Pope", "There's probably -- if you sit and look at it, there's about, given the 24.5% gross margin I just discussed with you, about 4.6 -- 460 basis points of improvement. And given that Seagate standalone was at 22.3 in December and the combined was 19.9, it was 18.7, or I forget exactly what the other side was. ", "But you're seeing about 200 basis points improvement just in the Seagate side, which is mix of products, lower cost platforms that are shipping in higher volume, other types of things. So if you talk about an overall 4.6 -- 460 basis points, half of it is just improvement in mix and lower cost products that Seagate is shipping. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "And then the other half is roughly exiting the Maxtor facility? ", "Charles Pope", "Correct. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Charles Pope", "Yes. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brian Alger with [Strata Capital Management]. ", "Brian Alger - Strata Capital Management", "Hi guys, good afternoon. Just a quick question on the ruthenium. It seems that you guys have a unique advantage in the industry in that you use the flex capacity of your various suppliers. Do those suppliers have the ability to pass the rising ruthenium costs on to you, or is that something you guys can leverage through your margins? ", "Dave Wickersham", "This is Dave. Let me say, obviously, we're not going to share any specifics in terms of how we work with our suppliers or how we leverage the opportunity, other than to say that, like I said, we've got both the supply underpinned and the cost impacts in our forecast going forward. I don't think, Brian, it's appropriate to go beyond that. ", "Bill Watkins", "The biggest advantage we've had is, we've been in perpendicular for a long time and have understood this issue for a long time. ", "Brian Alger - Strata Capital Management", "Okay. Thanks guys. That's it. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Shaw Wu with American Technology. ", "Shaw Wu - American Technology", "Thanks. Just a quick question in terms of component availability, is there a change in the environment there, particularly on the media side? And then, if I could squeeze in a second question, it's just a quick update on the Flash, the hybrid drives. Thanks. ", "Bill Watkins", "So Dave, why don't you take the ruthenium, and I'll let Brian take the Flash. ", "Dave Wickersham", "Sure. So Shaw, from a component availability standpoint, I think we have been signaling for some time that we do not see any industry constraints, nor Seagate's constraints on either finished media capacity, glass substrates or aluminum substrates. So that situation really hasn't changed. ", "You know, we're continuing to monitor it. As Bill said, as we ramp to perpendicular and see how the competitors ramp to perpendicular that could create some tightness, perhaps some spot shortages. But our view is that overall, there's adequate supply in the near-term for both substrates and finished media capacity. So no component constraints, that we're aware of. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Shaw, this is Brian. Let me take the hybrid question. So we're very encouraged by our position relative to the remaining competitors in the notebook space. As you know, we've announced the product. We're in qualification at a number of OEMs during this quarter. We may get some volume this quarter. It's a little too early to make that commitment. ", "But certainly over the course of the next six months, we'll see a ramp of volume of hybrid technology, consistent with the release of this, than, to the consumer space. But I think it's really second half of calendar year before you start to see something that's a meaningful revenue impact. ", "Shaw Wu - American Technology", "Okay. And could I squeeze just one more, a quick one? I'm sorry. Dave, where do you think PMR, where do you think the industry is in terms of PMR? I mean your 24% of your shipments are PMR. Where do you think the industry is at? ", "Dave Wickersham", "We thought the industry, including Seagate, is about half of that in the December quarter. And so what I try to say is, whether we're two quarters or more in terms of the lead, we think we'll continue to have that kind of advantage through the balance of the calendar year. So again about 13 or so percent somewhere in that range the total industry December and Seagate, as you just described is about 22-23. ", "Shaw Wu - American Technology", "Okay. Thanks. ", "Bill Watkins", "And Matthew, one more question. ", "Operator", "Okay. Our final question and we have a follow-up from Harry Blount with Lehman Brothers. ", "Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers", "Hi, Charles, on the guidance, want to come back to the midpoint of the EPS. I think maybe part of the confusion -- I want to clarify this myself -- is that the September guidance that you guys provided of the $1.70 to $1.80 was prior to the $0.07 charge for eSys. ", "And then the new guidance includes it. So in effect, if we do the math, it really looks like you're, in effect, raising the guidance, midpoint of the guidance by about $0.04 to $0.05. Is that the right math? ", "Charles Pope", "It would be easy to just say yes, because your statements relative to eSys are accurate. The $1.70 to $1.80 guidance we gave at the end of September did not include that. The $1.70 to $1.75 we gave now does include that. But it also didn't include the better-than-average performance that we got in the December quarter. ", "So, you kind of net those two things out. The guidance that we gave for the back half of the year is relatively consistent, once you net everything out that came in and out. ", "Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Great. And then on the CE side of the equation, Brian, just to clarify the split between gaming and PVR how should we think about that, roughly? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Well, you can assume that gaming was less than half of that 7 million units. ", "Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Great. And then the last question. Charles, you indicated on EVault that -- ", "Bill Watkins", "Three. No one listens to us. You notice that, Charles? ", "Charles Pope", "I've noticed. ", "Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers", "I figured I had a freebie since I was the follow-up side. The data on the EVault side of equation Charles, you talked about the guidance excludes EVault on the amortization, but anything you'd care to add on either revenue or margin impact? ", "Charles Pope", "The expectation that we have with EVault is that it will have no material effect relative to revenue or earnings after we have taken care of the purchase accounting stuff. I'll give you an update on that when we have those. ", "Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers", "All right. Thank you. ", "Bill Watkins", "Okay. Thank you. ", "So again, everybody, thank you for joining us for the call today, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Take care. Travel safe.

Welcome to Seagate Technology's Fiscal Third Quarter 2007 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for questions, and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). This conference is being recorded ", "This conference call contains forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, statements related to the company's future financial performance. These forward-looking statements are based on information available to Seagate as of the date of this conference call, but are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements. ", "Information concerning the risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements is contained in the company's annual report on Form 10-K, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on September 11, 2006, and the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 2, 2007, and in the company's Form 8-K, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 17, 2007. ", "These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the company's views as of any subsequent date, and Seagate undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made. ", "We would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Bill Watkins, CEO. Please go ahead, sir. ", "Bill Watkins", "Welcome everyone, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Charles Pope, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dave Wickersham, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Dexheimer, Executive Vice President and Chief Sales and Marketing Officer. ", "I'll begin today\u2019s call by reviewing our performance for the quarter and our expectations for the fourth quarter. Then Brian, Dave and Charles will give you more details on the core market, operating and financial performance. ", "As I noted in our press release, we are disappointed with our results for the third quarter. We miscalculated the market. And in this unusually challenging environment, we failed to deliver the results that we had projected. ", "The gap was due primary to a shortfall in the expected total market demand for 3.5-inch ATA disc drives and due to our pricing environment for high capacity 3.5-inch ATA disc drive that was more aggressive than we had planned. ", "In light of the fact that we did not meet our plan for the quarter, we no longer expect to meet the annual revenue and earnings targets forecast in January. Charles will provide an adjusted forecast later in his part. ", "Despite this uncharacteristic market environment, it's important to note that the fundamentals of Seagate business and that of the industry remained solid. Seagate\u2019s revenue remained strong, our balance sheet is healthy, and we continue to generate cash for ongoing investments in the capital and R&D, required for growth. ", "Further, from a market perspective, we increased our share in key growth markets and maintained our leadership in the core markets. We are operating at the kind of scale that allows us to continue to innovate while driving down costs, and thus exercise a great deal of market flexibility. ", "Overall, our results continue to reflect our leadership position in the sector, as well as a strong trend line that shows the creation sharing of the content needed to grow at this pace. ", "We remain confident in our strategy and in the growing strength of our company. Seagate is well positioned in an industry that has seen some strong growth trends. We remain committed to pricing discipline, maintaining profit and ensuring continued investment in our industry-leading technology. ", "We have consistently demonstrated our ability to deliver superior profitability. And we believe that we will continue to deliver industry leading results in the fiscal year and over the long-term. ", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Brian for more details on the market dynamics of the quarter. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Thank you, Bill. As Bill clearly discussed the March quarter outcome was not what we had anticipated. While Enterprise Mobile Compute and CE markets displayed expected demand patterns, this is not the case in the 3.5-inch ATA space. ", "Post Chinese New Year and through March, the market typically displays an accelerated demand pattern. This pattern did not emerge this year, making March a weaker month than our plans predicted, which resulted in a total available market that we believe was over 4 million units less than the December quarter. I will offer more detail on this as I discuss individual markets. ", "We believe the overall total available market or TAM was 112 million units, down 5% from the December quarter, although this still represents a 10% year-over-year increase. In the quarter, Seagate retained its overall industry leadership as well as number one positions in Enterprise, Desktop, and CE shipments, and increased share in Mobile Compute and Consumer Electronics. ", "Heading into the June quarter, we expect normal seasonality to bring the overall TAM down to between 106 million and 110 million units, representing a year-over-year growth in the 6% to 10% range. ", "Now, I'll give some detail on the individual markets. In the Desktop Compute market, we maintained our leadership position by shipping 24 million units. The earlier discussed TAM decrease was mostly attributed to PC weakness in the U.S. consumer PC market and lighter than expected demand from the Asia-Pacific region. ", "Product mix continued to improve as the average capacity of Seagate shipments rose 10% sequentially and remains above the competition. The TAM in the distribution channel was down 7% sequentially, off primarily in North America and China. Downstream channel demand in March was likely affected to some degree by major microprocessor manufacturers announcing significant price moves in March to take effect in early to late April. ", "Seagate exited the quarter with target inventory levels at less than five weeks of inventory in the channel. Also, primarily in the desktop space in-quarter pricing pressure on high capacity ATA drives was more pronounced than planned, specifically for those products, 400 gigabytes and greater. While demand for this class of products increased sequentially as predicted, and Seagate maintained its share in this class of product. ", "Off-list pricing and commercial distribution and retail channels were substantially more aggressive than we predicted. ", "We expect the TAM in Desktop Compute to be seasonally down in the June quarter. In the Consumer Electronics market, Seagate expanded its leadership position during the quarter, shipping 6.7 million units. Gaming was again a bright spot during the March quarter, leading to a sequential share increase in the CE market. ", "We did experienced some in-quarter softness in the DVR portion of this market and believe this is a portion of the overall 3.5-inch ATA sequential TAM decline. This softness was particularly true in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific regions as certain customers rebalance inventory and some platform introductions were pushed out. ", "In addition, the release of our much anticipated 1.8-inch 60 gigabyte per platter drive into the handheld portion of this market remains on plan. Qualifications of this drive are well underway and we expect meaningful volume in the current quarter. We believe the overall TAM for the CE market in the June quarter is likely to be lower than the March quarter due to seasonal demand factors. ", "The Enterprise market performed as expected as we believe the industry shipped just over 7 million units. Seagate maintained its clear leadership in this market shipping 4.1 million units, an increase of 18% year-over-year. Seagate saw strong adoption of small form factor drives during the quarter, as shipments reached 1.3 million units, up 60%, sequentially. ", "Looking forward, we expect the enterprise TAM in the June quarter to be essentially flat to that of the March quarter. ", "In the Mobile Compute market, we believe the TAM was essentially flat to the December quarter as expected. Seagate shipped 4.7 million units, an increase of 25% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. We attribute these gains to greater market access through additional qualifications of our market leading products. ", "Average capacity per drive in the space increased to 97 gigabytes. We expected TAM in the June quarter to be seasonal and lower than the March quarter. ", "Finally, in our brand solutions business, revenue was flat sequentially. As noted, pricing for higher capacity solutions was more aggressive than expected. Also results in the space were hampered by later than expected launch of our new FreeAgent solutions, and product transition issues on legacy products earlier in the quarter. ", "We expect improved execution and adoption in the June quarter as our new FreeAgent solutions are more broadly available in the market. We remain very enthusiastic regarding the growth prospects in this space. ", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave to provide an update on our operations. ", "Dave Wickersham", "Thanks, Brian. Seagate's performance in development and operations during the March quarter were solid. In particular, we are very pleased with the successful ramp of our perpendicular products and processes. Overall, perpendicular component and product yields not only met our plan, but are already better than legacy longitudinal products. We are very pleased with the continued progress and customer qualifications, and the volume ramp of our new products. ", "Now, I would like to discuss three topics in more detail. Total inventory increased by $61 million with finished goods and work-in-process coming down slightly from last quarter, and raw materials increasing by $65 million. ", "Inventory turnover for the March quarter was 10.7, short of the 12-turn goal for this quarter. The lower than expected demand for 3.5-inch ATA drives at the end of the quarter prevented anticipated reductions in finished goods inventory and was the primary reason that turns came in under our projection. ", "Regarding expectations for the June quarter, while we continue to focus on optimizing our supply chain, the impact of precious metal use associated with the volume ramp of perpendicular products will further impact our turnover. Consequently, turns are expected to be approximately 10 in the June quarter. ", "The continued successful introduction of perpendicular recording products across all the market segments we serve is critical for our results going forward. Customer qualifications of perpendicular based products continue to progress as expected. ", "In the March quarter, we shipped over 17 million drives that utilize perpendicular recording, up from the 10 million shipped in the December quarter. We expect that during our fiscal fourth quarter, greater than 50% of our drive shipments will utilize perpendicular recording. ", "In regards to the capital investments, we are proceeding with our planned media and substrate capacity expansions in Asia. Our goal is to continue to align capacity additions with customer demand. ", "Based on the current demand environment, we will reduce our fiscal 2007 capital investment by $100 million to approximately $1.05 billion. ", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Charles. ", "Charles Pope", "Thank you, Dave. You will find the company's press release, 8-K and additional financial information related to Seagate's financial performance, along with a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results and other supplemental information in the Investor Relations section of Seagate's website at www.seagate.com. ", "Seagate reported March quarter revenue of $2.8 billion and unit shipments of 39.5 million. GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are $212 million and $0.37 respectively. Included in the GAAP results are approximately $62 million of acquisition-related charges and associated tax effects. Without these charges and the associated tax effects, non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share was $274 million and $0.47. ", "There were many factors that caused our non-GAAP earnings to be less than expected for the March quarter. Let me take you through these. ", "A couple of market-driven factors impacted us late in the quarter. Due to lower demand for 3.5-inch ATA drives, revenue was impacted $90 million and profitability by $25 million. Price declines for high-capacity 3.5-inch ATA drives impacted revenue and profitability by approximately $70 million. ", "Also, as Brian mentioned, the launch of the new FreeAgent line of products in retail was later than planned and profitability was impacted by approximately $30 million, as there was less margin contribution from these more cost-effective products than previously expected. ", "Offsetting these negative factors was a favorable impact due to the elimination of the company's fiscal 2007 Variable Compensation Plan, as the current outlook for our fiscal year does not achieve the required profitability targets. ", "The positive financial impact of this is reflected in our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the March quarter and was approximately $64 million. Half of the benefit came from reversing the accrual on the books and the other half from avoiding an additional $32 million we would have incurred if we had been on track to achieve our profitability target. ", "GAAP gross margin for the March quarter was 21.3%, excluding approximately $40 million of acquisition-related costs. Non-GAAP gross margin was 22.7%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins in the March quarter were impacted by the factors just discussed. ", "The positive impact of eliminating the variable compensation plan was approximately $16 million for the amount accrued through the first six months of the fiscal year. And another $16 million that would have been accrued in the March quarter if we had achieved our profitability target. Without this favorable impact, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins for the March quarter would have been 110 basis points lower. ", "Slide six has the adjustments made to GAAP gross margin. Those are on our website. ", "GAAP operating expenses were $356 million. Excluding acquisition-related costs, non-GAAP operating expenses were $335 million. The offsetting positive financial impact of eliminating the variable compensation plan was approximately $16 million for the amount accrued for the first six months of the fiscal year. And another $16 million that would have been accrued in March quarter if we had achieved our profitability target. ", "Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities ended the quarter at $1.2 billion. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2007, Seagate made capital investments totaling $688 million, of which $222 million occurred in the March quarter. ", "Cash flow from operations was $269 million for the March quarter. Days sales outstanding was 44, up from the December quarter, but reflective of the shipment profile of the March quarter. Days payable outstanding was 57, also up from the last quarter, but within the normal range. ", "During the March quarter, the company took delivery of approximately 22.6 million shares related to its share repurchase plan. The average price of the shares that were delivered to the company in the March quarter was $26.26. The company has authorization to purchase approximately $1.175 billion of additional shares under the current stock repurchase program. ", "Now relative to our business outlook. The 3.5-inch ATA market dynamics that were in play during the month of March has at least for the near-term reset the base line operating results of the company. Exit pricing in the high-capacity 3.5-inch ATA in the notebook markets was noticeably lower than our plan, and this has a significant impact on the June quarter. ", "For the June quarter, we are expecting the industry to experience a normal seasonal decline in unit demand of approximately 2% to 6% as compared to March. Price declines in aggregate on a percentage basis are expected to moderate slightly. However, keep in mind that we entered the June quarter with a lower starting point for prices. ", "Efforts are underway across all functions within Seagate to accelerate cost reductions and process efficiencies. The management team remains committed to delivering differentially superior financial results over the long-term. ", "For the June quarter, revenue is expected to be between $2.65 billion and $2.75 billion. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be $0.29 to $0.33, and includes approximately $28 million of expected acquisition-related costs. Accordingly, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, excluding the acquisition related costs, is expected to be $0.34 to $0.38. ", "GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $370 million for the June quarter. Operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis, excluding approximately $20 million of acquisition-related costs are expected to be approximately $350 million. ", "The expected GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the June quarter reflects: Other income and expense modeled to be a net expense of approximately $17 million, a tax rate of approximately 7.5%, and a diluted share count expected to be 570 million shares. ", "For the fiscal year 2007, the company's outlook for revenue is $11.3 billion to $11.4 billion, and GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be $0.92 to $0.96. And it includes approximately $247 million of costs directly related to the recent acquisitions and $19 million of charges related to the early redemption of the 8% notes. ", "Accordingly, on a non-GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share, excluding the above charges, are expected to be $1.37 to $1.41. ", "That concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call back over to Bill. ", "Bill Watkins", "Thank you, Charles. Technology leadership, cost leadership and product leadership across a broad customer base are Seagate's great strength. They are the fundamentals of a model designed to deliver strong long-term financial performance in spite of the occasional short-term fluctuations of the market. ", "I would like to acknowledge and thank Seagate employees who continue to establish for themselves and for our company the highest standards of performance. And with that we are ready to open it up for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Paul Mansky with Citigroup. ", "Paul Mansky - Citigroup", "Yeah, great thank you. You cited desktop a couple of times in the script as a source of that shortfall, when in fact it's down 7%, but that's actually in line with your three-year average. At the same time, CE was down 5% well off the trend line. Am I missing something here? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Yeah, I think so. This is Brian. Let me try and handle that. When we looked at historical TAMs, we see an expectation of December to March quarter rolling off at about 3% to 4%. In fact, what we saw in the quarter we just finished, it was 6% to 7%. So, it was essentially more than what the average was. In fact, it's the highest December to March roll off we have seen in the last three years. ", "Paul Mansky - Citigroup", "And what is your average capacity, and you mentioned it on notebook, what's your average capacity on desktop currently? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "It is right around 180 gigabytes, pure desktop. ", "Paul Mansky - Citigroup", "Alright. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Harry Blount with Lehman Brothers. ", "Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers", "Hi guys. I want to focus in on the gross margin a second. Charles, certainly it sounds like if most of the shortfall is on the desktop. It sounds like Enterprise margins and CE margins were generally in line with expectations and perhaps notebooks maybe a little bit below. Is that a correct read on what you guys are saying here? ", "Charles Pope", "Well, the high-capacity 3.5-inch ATA crosses both desktop and what we call business critical spaces and even includes some CE. And so, the biggest single impact was high-capacity 3.5-inch ATA across those multiple markets. ", "Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And then as we think about the longer term margin targets that you guys had previously set out to the 24 to 26. Help me understand a little bit here if, why the PMR is not seeing more of a beneficial impact, particularly in the high-capacity space where arguably you guys have lower component costs. ", "So, I guess, one of the things I am trying to rationalize is, you guys are ahead of the game on this PMR transition, but it doesn't seem to be translating into better margins on the high cap. ", "Charles Pope", "Well, at the risk of sounding a little defensive, if you look at the differential margins that the company has in the industry, I would say that the fact that we were the first to TGMR and the first to perpendicular has in fact represented differential gross margins for Seagate compared to the industry. ", "As we said and look forward when you have a reset like this where there is just a precipitous fall in pricing in a given capacity point, it takes a while to work through that. And usually it requires a product generation to completely recover from that. So, we have a lot of work ahead of us to try to figure out what we need to do to get back to where we would want to be on our gross margins. ", "Bill Watkins", "Hey, Harry this is Watkins. I mean again we do think we have a differentiated margin and obviously we were profitable. So, we do have competitors who are not focused on profitability right now and are willing to take. Basically they'll sell high-cap drives at whatever price they have to sell it out and take the hit. And we just got that to the environment where we think it's going to be somewhat short-term, because it only lasts for so long. But, we have to deal with that. ", "Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And then two last quick ones. Charles, I think you said that you expect share count to be flat at 570 in June. Does that imply no share buyback? And then lastly back on the gross margin question again. How much of an impact did selling through the remaining Maxtor inventory have? Thanks. ", "Charles Pope", "On share count, we've consistently excluded any impact that might arise from share repurchase. If you look at our forecast for last quarter it was consistent with that. We will need to go through and evaluate what our cash availability in it is, and how we want to proceed with share repurchase. ", "If you sit and look, there was probably a nominal impact on selling through some of the Maxtor legacy product to gross margins, but in reality we certainly look at all of the products at this point in time and view that as our normalized margin. ", "Bill Watkins", "Harry, this is Watkins. If I have to really characterize that, we came into March thinking that would be a much bigger month than it was. And what happened is as we all looked that demand started sailing, we also started to move the higher-capacity drive, which started a lot of pricing in those high-capacity drive. And as we got towards the end of March, we came down with a decision, \"Look, we have got to get back to many markets. We have got to calm this thing down.\" And there was a choice. We could probably go stop the channel. We could have got a lot more aggressive and things like that or pull back, keep the channel right and look at this as a longer term deal and that's the decision we made. ", "Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with J.P. Morgan. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you. I would like to follow up on that last comment from Bill, if I could. When you say, you are looking longer term, it seems like you guys are kind of battling down the hatches in terms of maybe the pricing conditions that we are starting to see right now as far as showing signs of slippage or have some [underlying] force if that could extend beyond the near term. Am I misreading that? ", "Bill Watkins", "Well, I think, we have got to be cautionary in an environment that we are at. I think one of the things that -- obviously, I think the inventories are in good position. I have been in this place, where we end up with eight, nine weeks in inventory as people try to make a short-term quarter. We did not do that. We pulled back. I think that having a good channel inventory is important as we go through this. We think that will minimize the impact. Again, I do believe from my competitors who are losing hundreds of million dollars, will not do that for another four quarters. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Well, they have been doing this for the past few years. I mean, when does this stop? ", "Bill Watkins", "I don\u2019t now. We have to plan right now to be smart or where we want to be. ", "Charles Pope", "And Mark, just a reminder, in the September quarter, we indicated to everyone that Seagate's pricing philosophy was going to be to meet market, right. And so, as we ended the March quarter, we were faced with a decision of how are we going to meet market on these prices or feed share. And we chose to meet markets to demonstrate our confidence in our cost structure, the cost structure of our products and the product breadth that we have. And so, I think that's an appropriate position to take. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And then if I could, I guess with the exception of the December quarter, Seagate have had some difficulty reading the market dynamics back to June and September. And now here again, the expectations have not been met for various reasons. Can you give us some insights in terms of what you are doing either Brian or Bill in terms of devoting resources, so you have a better accurate read either with the OEMs, the distribution channel or now the increasing opportunity in the branded side of things? ", "Bill Watkins", "Well Mark, we've done a really crappy job. We've done a terrible job on that. The easy compound is that we keep underestimating the ability of people to lose money in this business. We pay them some of the pricing that some people do. With that said though, we think this is a big issue to us and Brian has done a lot of work in that. So, let Brian -- will answer that. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Well Mark, this is Brian. I think if you look at what we laid out in specific, if you are talking about the year guidance that we gave back in July timeframe. The two biggest factors that we didn't anticipate correct was one Bill mentioned, which is the competitive behavior, which took a big chunk of both top line and bottom line out of that plan. But frankly, other one and the related was our ability to maintain share or gain share in some cases in this kind of a competitive environment. ", "So, I think those are the two things that we are looking at with a much more constructive view in terms of what the reality at this current industry structure is going to allow. And probably not get ourselves in a position where we commit ourselves to taking what we think are fundamental technology and cost advantages to market, and having them accrue in terms of share gain. ", "I just think at this point, our competitors have already demonstrated their behavior that says, without technology and cost leadership they are more than willing to compete head to head. And like Bill said, we don't think that can remain forever. But we're certainly going to plan accordingly going forward until we see the change. ", "Bill Watkins", "Mark, the easy answer for us to say, look, we are not going to give you guidance. We are not going to do yearly guidance. We are not going to do it quarterly. And we don't want to do that. We want to be transparent and open and this is what we think. That said, we are always going to have to take into regard our competitors have a big vote in this. And much bigger vote than we thought they would do. And we are just going to have to take that into our guidance. ", "But again, we want to be open and transparent, and we will set what we think we can do. And to the point that we get more conservative based on competitors who are putting much more credibility and the competitor is losing money. We will just have to do that. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. I appreciate it. If I can just tweak in one more question here. I guess it's kind of early in the game still, but some of your major systems customers out of this morning and late this afternoon commented that at least in the US you are starting to see some choppiness from a demand perspective. I want to get a sense in terms of the enterprise, based on Brian or Bill, in terms of the folks you are talking down the field. Is there risk in your enterprise business which has really held up in terms of the share position relative to the competition? Could that see some slippage later this summer and what could be the effect on margins if so? ", "Bill Watkins", "Yeah. Mark, I worry less about margin pressure there in that space. The space is going through a tremendous demand transition in terms of interface and products. And we have talked in some length about that in the past. So, there is a lot of change present today, which we think benefits us. There is a narrow competitive set today that certainly can change in the future. We don't view that\u2019s going to change in calendar '07. But the thing I do worry about more there is the thing that you have -- opened the comment with is, there's choppiness in overall demand. ", "If our customers were saying that and we certainly can reinforce some of the comments that you've made. That's probably the single biggest risk we have in the enterprise space going forward. It is how big is that market going to be? We think, however, big the market is going to be, our ability is to compete within that and protect the current that we have is good. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line David Bailey with Goldman Sachs. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Thank you. Two questions please. One, given your outlook for 3.5-inch demand, do you feel your customer capacity additions are enough? And are you concerned about the amount of capacity that the industry as a whole is adding between now and the end of the year? ", "Bill Watkins", "Well right now, I am concerned about everything. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "But right now, I am talking about the inventory. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Right. We certainly feel good about where we are at. And as Dave pointed out, we are actually taking some actions to we think more correctly balance our investments and capital to the [for view] demand. Now, relative to how everyone else is looking at that, at least the public reporting of additional capacity coming online. It is a concern. I think its one of those factors that Bill was alluding to you earlier. ", "We need to see a better balance in terms of how competitive behavior is playing out relative to tight financial performance. And right now, it's too early for us to tell how much demand we are going to see in the back half of the year and whether the current public reporting of capacity that's coming online is a good balance of that or not. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "And second question is that, what factors are you looking at when you are trying to decide whether you are going to continue to meet pricing or if you would actually start to see some share? ", "Charles Pope", "It kind of looks at how it affects our capital absorption structure and things like that. Sometimes it's better to keep the fact to at least to somewhat going forward. It\u2019s a financial decision, Charles. ", "Bill Watkins", "Mark, I guess -- excuse me, David, the single biggest thing I look at and we do competitive analysis and evaluate our product cost against all of our competitor's product cost. If we feel that we have the lowest cost product, then in almost all cases we are best served by meeting market pricing and maintaining the share that we have. In some cases where you have perhaps a product that is not the lowest cost which I am not aware of any at this moment in time. You could sense they hold it, we need to back away for a second because this is hurting us as a differential -- worse than it's hurting our competitors. And so I think that probably the single biggest factor is just what is our product cost and we believe that it\u2019s best in market. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then finally just one last question. On the gross margin side, do you have any idea where you might be able to get back into your target of 24% to 26% range? Is it even possible by the end of the calendar year? ", "Charles Pope", "I am not in a position to really answer that, David. When you go through a reset like this we have to go through and build up our fiscal 2008 and kind of see where we think the demand and pricing environment is going to be. And so I don\u2019t have a good basis for addressing that. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "Great, thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with A.G. Edwards. ", "Aaron Rakers - A.G. Edwards", "Yeah thanks guys, a couple of questions. First on looking at the variable comp change, I just want to be sure, I am clear here. So, if we factor everything in, it looks like variable comp was actually a benefit of roughly $0.10 on EPS line in the quarter. Am I off base there or is that a fair assumption? ", "Charles Pope", "No that\u2019s correct. ", "Aaron Rakers - A.G. Edwards", "Okay. So considering that, the next question is actually looking at your operating expense structure going forward. If you are pulling back the reins on capacity, why should we not expect to see a little bit better than say $350 million in total OpEx? Are you being conservative there? Is there an opportunity to take more expense out of the company here over the next couple of quarters? ", "Charles Pope", "If you look at the $350 million number, there is $16 million that came from a reversal of the accruals in the September and December quarter. As you go forward, we don\u2019t have that same reversal of accruals, and I think that\u2019s the biggest difference. So, this basically says that we are going through evaluating what we need to do in the company to minimize expenses and everything else. We will have a minimum, keep spending flat with what we had this quarter and then we don\u2019t have the benefit of that reversal of accrual. ", "Aaron Rakers - A.G. Edwards", "Okay. A couple of other questions. You mentioned some softness in the DVR piece of your consumer electronics business. However, if I look at that industry, I believe there is some regulatory dynamics that looking at some of the big set-top box providers are expecting, actually spur demand here over this quarter and into March and the June quarter in particular. Have you not seen that? Or was there a typical seasonal decline? Where is the disconnect there? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "I think it was relatively unique to some manufacturers who pushed out platforms. There are others who rebalance inventories. I think the thing that you are talking about is CableCARD becoming effective in July of this year, and some speculation in advance of that there is going to be build out in set-top boxes. We have pretty good relationships with the set-top box manufacturers. ", "It\u2019s our understanding that that\u2019s been more of a dynamic that will affect those that are not DVR enabled. They are just set-top boxes as digital set-top boxes. So we believe that\u2019s where you are going to see the effect and of course we don\u2019t participate in that part of the TAM. ", "Aaron Rakers - A.G. Edwards", "Perfect. And then final question. You guys have reported that you have less then five weeks in your distribution channel inventory. Any sense of where the industry as a whole currently sits in terms of distribution channel for 3.5-inch? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Yeah. With us included, it's under six. ", "Aaron Rakers - A.G. Edwards", "Under six. Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tom Curlin with RBC Capital Markets. ", "Tom Curlin - RBC Capital Markets", "Good afternoon. Just coming back to the enterprise guidance, you mentioned the TAM is flat. And seasonally, if I just look at your numbers historically, assuming I have the right numbers, it seems like you've been up at least moderately, sequentially in enterprise over the last three or four years in the June quarter. What I am getting to is, is that normal seasonality or you adding in some extra caution or just given some of the demand comments that we've heard from some of the enterprise OEMs? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Yeah. It's really tough, because if you back over five or six years it's really tough to depict the seasonal pattern, particularly for the June quarter in the Enterprise space. It's a space that typically moves with seasonality in the back half of the year. But it's less predictable in the front half of the year. ", "So, I think you could say yes we're trying to be cautious particularly given how the quarter finished. But, I wouldn't paint any expectations that we have any current signs of any significant upside from that flat expectation. ", "Tom Curlin - RBC Capital Markets", "Let me make sure I am understanding you correctly. You are factoring in some incremental caution just to make sure you are covered on some of the weakness comments that have been out there? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Well, we certainly don't have any belief from our existing set of customers who we've been engaged with for a long time that there is any upside potential across the March quarter. ", "Tom Curlin - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, that's clear. And then on low-cost Fibre Channel drives, there is some discussion out there. Maybe that concept is going away in favor of low-cost SAS. Can you guys just comment on, I guess, the trajectory there? Is that the case? What's driving that if you can comment? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Well, we've been a leader in the SAS transition and we have seen a significant portion of our Enterprise volume already moved in that direction, primarily at the expense of parallel SCSI. We have yet to see a significant transition from anyone invested in fibre infrastructure making a switch to SAS. There have been a number of transitions that have been made to date from parallel SCSI to SAS/SATA architectures and we're certainly well placed to accommodate that. ", "I think it's going to be a little bit more time before people decide to disengage from what has been almost a decade long investment in Fibre Channel infrastructure and commit to the SAS/SATA platform. So, if that is a threat going forward in terms of SAS replacing fibre at the low-end, it is something that's in the future and not anything that we see right now. ", "In terms of how to think about the threat, if you want to call it that, the margin differential between Fibre Channel drives and SAS drives for us is rather negligible at this point. Because, of course there is more costs on the Fibre Channel drive. ", "Tom Curlin - RBC Capital Markets", "I think what I am speaking to is just low cost version of those drives, right. The alternative to SATA drives in the form of FAT or whatever you would like to call it. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "No, I am sorry. I misunderstood your question. ", "Tom Curlin - RBC Capital Markets", "Are you finding that OEMs and so forth are leading towards SAS or low cost in lieu of trying to use low-cost Fibre Channel drive at least in next gen design? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Well, certainly anywhere in the direct-attached space, it is already a predominant installation of SATA drives for those type of applications. So what they call it tiered storage, near-line, whatever you want to call it, backup or storage types of application. So, the only place you really haven't seen what I call high-capacity fibre drives that\u2019s been in the network-attached base. And that frankly has been very specifically deployed through a couple of customers. ", "Whether or not they choose to go forward with SAS or SATA architectures going forward, I probably don't want to comment at this point but suffice it to say that some economic advantages are moving in that direction. But here again, they have to really contemplate those economic advantages of the driving [host to that] level versus the investments we already have in the Fibre Channel infrastructures of the host. So, net is, I do expect to see some movement in that direction. Again, there from an impact to Seagate, I think, frankly it's not a differential margin adjustment that we would think is material. ", "Tom Curlin - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Hunt with Thomas Weisel. ", "Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel", "Hi. Thanks. I had a couple of questions. First, I wanted to clarify on the gross margin that you are looking forward. I know that you already said too much but am I correct in assuming about 100 basis points decline in June over March quarter? And the majority can maybe evenly split between the pricing issues that you talked about versus lower units and less lower utilization? And I had a follow up. ", "Charles Pope", "If you back in all the different numbers that I gave you relative to the guidance on OpEx and tax rate and everything else, it basically comes in at relatively flat gross margin to the March quarter. ", "Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel", "Okay. And then the other question I had just -- follow-up on the first question of the call, actually. I am still having a little hard time following what you guys are saying here given industry groups are pretty much projecting about 110 and 111 million drives for the quarter. You guys are set to 112 million drives for the quarter. ", "So, 112 is higher than 111 from my math. Where is the shortfall, you guys keep pointing coming from I guess? It sounds to me, it's more like you guys must have assumed some kind of market share gains within the curve for yourselves. What am I missing here, I guess? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Talking about the March quarter, Kevin? ", "Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel", "Yeah, in the March quarter. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "This is Brian. Let me walk you through it. So, we finished at almost 119 in December. We had predicted that we would finish it around 116 in March. As you point out, we think the finish was 111 to 112. Almost all of that difference could be explained in 3.5-inch ATA where previous question really addressed this. But we had historically seen 3% to 4% rollover in December to March quarters. What we saw at the end of the March quarter, as a result tallied up to 6% to 7%. 116 was planned on the low end of that 3% to 4% range. ", "So, maybe we were planning in the wrong direction, but certainly based on history, it was a reasonable plan based on all the things we talked about. ", "Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel", "I guess that maybe the question, because other industries were not assuming 116. So, the question is, why were you guys so confident going into the quarter that things are going to be much better than they turned out to be, even they turned out to be normal quarter really? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Right. I think, I just try to give you numbers to say, it wasn't a normal quarter. But why we were so more confident? I don't think we were. I think we were just as confident as we would have been in any of the past three years. And it didn't turn out to be that way. We were planning to gain share. We were planning to see another 4 million units in the market, 3.5-inch ATA that didn't materialize. ", "Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel", "Okay. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line Rob Semple with Credit Suisse. ", "Rob Semple - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. You mentioned channel inventories for the industry just under six weeks. Did you see any, call it, irrational behavior, general stuffing by any of your major competitors at the end of the quarter? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Though it's tough to see, particularly without a little bit of history in your benefit. But to our knowledge, it would appear that the channel inventories and I said this earlier finished under six weeks for the industry and that's pretty normal position to finish. ", "Rob Semple - Credit Suisse", "Obviously, you guys usually report first and a lot of your competitors probably look to your industry, kind of TAM guidance as an indication. I mean, do you worry that and maybe if they didn't stop this, are there a lot of drive inventories sitting on their books as well? And is that going to be a big problem in the second calendar quarter? ", "Bill Watkins", "I really don't know. It is really tough for us to judge that. ", "Rob Semple - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then I guess just lastly, how was demand for corporate desktop PCs? You mentioned some of the shortfall was consumer driven. But given some of the comments from IBM or some of the other enterprise players, it feels like some of the shortfall this quarter was primarily around the enterprises in general. Did they come to market still on the PC side? ", "Bill Watkins", "To our knowledge they did. We have a number of relationships that service the commercial space. I would say certainly on a relative basis between consumer and commercial, commercial was the stronger of the two. ", "Rob Semple - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes form the line of Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. ", "Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Good evening. Couple of quick questions. As going back to the pricing discussion and given the conversation we've had thus far on the call, what gives you the confidence to guide to lower price decline sequentially going into June. I know the base is lower. But we are obviously surprised by the degree of pricing in March and why not assume that continues in the June? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Katie this is Brian, let me take that one. It's obviously something that we are watching very closely. Let me just kind of back into where we got to. First-off we did see a pretty precipitous decline in the high capacity products as we've outlined. We don't believe that the market has the opportunity to see that kind of a price decline in that product category two quarters in a row. We could be wrong about that, but given the margin oxygen, it appears to be less than that portion of the product line, we don't think it's likely. ", "Secondly, from an OEM standpoint, we have booked a significant amount of the OEM volume for this quarter and that's a significant portion of the 3.5-inch environment, it's about half of it. So, it gives us some confidence that at least we understand that piece. Those are the two data points that we are working on and nothing is completely certain. It really depends a lot on how competitors act in quarter markets. As Charles pointed out earlier, we have every intention of using what we think is the best cost position in the industry to protect the share that we have. ", "Bill Watkins", "Katie, one additional piece of information, the price erosion that we saw in the March quarter is the worst erosion that we have seen in three and half years on a quarterly basis. While we show that being moderately down from the March quarter, we are still built into our plan, the price erosion that is equal to the next worst price erosion that we have seen in that three and half year period of time. So it's certainly not going back to a low price erosion level, but it's built into our plans. ", "Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Then as it relates to demand, given the shortfall was late in the March month; do you have any insight into whether that softness continued in the April just to help us, delineate what was demand versus product cycle or processor price cut driven? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "I would say so far in April in the 3.5-inch ATA market, our expectations are being meet in term of industry shipments. ", "Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "And then lastly, you added a comment in the press release after the forward-looking comments that suggests acquisitions, repurchases and restructuring actions aren\u2019t included in guidance. Is it fair to read into that, that you are taking a step back and rethinking investments in a strategic direction to post the results of the March quarter? ", "Charles Pope", "Okay. Go ahead. ", "Bill Watkins", "I don't think we're looking at changing our strategic directions at all. I think what we're going to do though is to be kind of smart about where we put our investments and we are taking a hard look at cost structures throughout the company to make sure that we continue to be competitive in this environment. Charles? ", "Charles Pope", "But we are committed to our strategy. We still believe in it; we still believe in the long-term products in the market. We believe that long-term the volumes are there and we just need to be smart and manage through this June quarter. ", "Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Great. Thanks guys. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Brickman with UBS. ", "Jeff Brickman - UBS", "Great. Thanks guys. This might be for Brian or maybe Charles. As far as the 1.8-inch markets goes, are you still expecting that to be one of the main reasons that you get back to your targeted gross margin range? Or you really look at that entry as more strategic rather than something that you are going to rely on for growth and/or margin expansion? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Jeff, this is Brian. Luckily, it\u2019s probably more the latter. I think we have been pretty forthright in talking about our CE margins in general being less than our Company average. So, just with that description, it doesn\u2019t fit the first category. ", "Jeff Brickman - UBS", "Okay, and then just secondly. Obviously you saw pretty good acceleration there in the 2.5-inch Enterprise drive deployment. Was that surprising at all as far as maybe taking some actual demand away from 3.5-inch? Was there any shortfall there because of that? Or is that basically a separate thing? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "No, I think we were able to fulfill all of our 2.5-inch requirements, and this is something, we've been talking about for several quarters now and we are happy to see that transition is moving very rapidly. ", "Jeff Brickman - UBS", "Okay. Great, thanks guys. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Renouard with Robert W. Baird. ", "Daniel Renouard - Robert W. Baird", "Hi, thanks. Couple of questions. First is the 750 gig, which I believe you guys are going to be the only ones out with that product. Shouldn\u2019t that help, and if not this quarter is that kind of a back half for the year? Maybe if you could just talk about the dynamics and how that might help you on high cap side? And then secondly, can you give us any kind of breakdown or details around ASP by product categories or what you saw on the ASP side by product category? Thanks. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Dan, this is Brian. Let me try and tackle at least the first one and maybe give you something to think about on the second one. 750 gigabyte product we actually have been shipping since last summer. So, it\u2019s a product that\u2019s been on our portfolio for quite some time. It was subject to this price decline environment that we talked about earlier. I expect it was a significant proportion of that, though no one else in the marketplace has equivalent product, at least to this point that we are shipping any significant volume. The value proposition of product is directly tied to the products underneath it, namely the 400 and 500 gigabyte product. So, while it would seem that it gives us insulation from the price environment to some degree, but the fact that we don't have a direct competitor. The fact is that, we have direct competitors on the 500 gigabyte drive and to some extent that moves the 750 pricing with it. ", "Daniel Renouard - Robert W. Baird", "Does that slow the adoption in the OEM side? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "The fact that it\u2019s sole sourced? ", "Daniel Renouard - Robert W. Baird", "Both, sole sourced as well as more aggressive pricing on a 500 gig, sort of slowing the more rapid adoption of 750. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Well, it certainly would if we chose to keep the pricing solid on the 750. But what we've chosen to do is move the value proposition along with the 500 gigabyte market, so that we don't retard the OEM adoption. The sole sourced position for those customers who react to this value proposition are primarily there and some very specific markets around, the business is critical or near line interior storage markets. They are more than happy to adopt this product even though there aren't other sources in the market again, as long as the value propositions present it. ", "Daniel Renouard - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "On the ASP question, I guess the way to think about that, in terms to try to get to what we saw in this high capacity space. As Charles pointed out, in aggregate, our price erosion on the quarter was some of the most aggressive we have seen in recent history. Specifically, this 3.5-inch space we normally think about 3.5-inch ATA price erosion on a quarterly basis in the 4% to 7% range. We had planned for this high capacity because of the available margin there, and the price points available in that category being necessarily higher than the average. We planned for more erosion than 4% to 7%, slightly more than the high end of that range. In fact, what we see was 2x that plan. So, that was the route of some of the margin short fall that Charles outlined earlier. ", "Charles Pope", "Dan, to go further relative to the ASPs by product category, we have never really discussed that and feel that we shouldn't. ", "Daniel Renouard - Robert W. Baird", "Yes, thank you. ", "Charles Pope", "Okay. Justin, next question. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Merrill Lynch. ", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Hi, good afternoon. Just going back to your comments about the Free Agent rollout; can you speak more specific about what caused the delay and when do you get caught up and what that does for your cost structure and then I had a follow-up. ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Sure, Steven. This is Brian. We had anticipating product in full production in late January; and in fact it was into March before it was fully available. Delays were what I call normal. Delays that haven't ramped any new products in that class one product integration in ramping at the ODMs that supported some of the products. So, nothing that involves lot of rocket science, just some support and execution and unfortunately we didn't do it very well. ", "That's behind us. We have full availability in the channel now, the entire line-up for Free Agent. And from a cost perspective, I don't want to quantify it for you, but it's a significant improvement over the previous generation of Seagate branded products. ", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great, and then secondly, this maybe somewhat of an unfair question. But, when you look at whatever margin target you may set, whether it gets back to 24% to 26%. Tactically, is there anything else that you would be looking at besides the typical cost reduction consolidations, looking at your supply base closer? I mean, what else could you do if you assume that the current end competitive environment stays with us for a while? ", "Brian Dexheimer", "Well, I think, again, we would look at all of those things. But we continue to push our technology ideal of bringing in leading aerial density into and continue that. And so the next product rollout we have the opportunity to cut costs significantly per gigabyte. ", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "And is there a way to accelerate that and lap the competition further or is that, I am looking for something else that could happen that would be more creative outside of just the typical cost cuts, I guess? ", "Bill Watkins", "No. Right now, I think we are just planning on working harder. ", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Alright, thanks. ", "Bill Watkins", "One more question and that\u2019s it. ", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham and Company. ", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Thank you, just two quick questions. First Dave, should we assume then by your comments there that the bulk of the raw material inventory increase was ruthenium and other commodity like materials as opposed to something else? ", "Bill Watkins", "No, it was exactly that. It was associated with unique raw materials related to perpendicular and you hit it. ", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay. And then Bill, just taking a step back now and looking at the Maxtor acquisition and what we all thought we were going to gain in retrospect. More stable enterprise pricing seems to be one. But, is it fair to say that the aggressive pricing environment has washed away many of the other benefits that we should have seen or anything now looking back on what we all can ultimately gain? ", "Bill Watkins", "Well, I mean it's really easy for me to be very defensive here, and I will try not to be. But, I will be honest, I still like to deal. I think that when I look at the notebook price environment which really should have nothing to do with this. And I think about it in this quarter, if we had Maxtor and their Desktop Enterprise with all the other crap going on, I would be honest and I am glad that we are beyond ourselves. So, I still look at it in this environment, I think it was a good deal for us. I think things would be a lot worse. I would have never imagined that I will have to lose $500 million to $600 million a year, this year. But they've gone from breakeven at that. So, again, I think we are better served where we are today, we would have been trying to have one extra competitor in the business. ", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. ", "Bill Watkins", "Okay. Thanks guys. With that thank you for joining the call today and trust me I look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Thanks.

On the phone with me today are DaveWickersham, President and Chief Operating Officer, Charles Pope, Executive VicePresident and Chief Financial Officer, and Brian Dexheimer, Executive VicePresident and Chief Sales and Marketing Officer.", "I am pleased to report that wehad a very strong quarter, which produced record results in virtually everyarea of our business.", "I will start the call today byspending a few minutes reviewing those numbers with you, and sharing someadditional perspective on the industry landscape and the unique characteristicsof our platform and business model that enable us to achieve these results.", "Then I'll turn to our outlook forthe quarter ahead and share with you our view of the key factors that willinfluence our performance going forward. I will then turn over to Brian, Daveand Charles who will each in turn discuss details of our market, operation andfinancial results.", "Attractive market trends continueto drive robust demand for storage and significant opportunities for growth. Inthe September quarter, Seagate's revenue grew 18% year-over-year to $3.3billion. As you know, the first fiscal quarter is typically among our strongestand this year unit demand exceeded even the high-end of our expected range.", "We effectively capitalized onthis strong demand environment by shipping a record 47 million units thisquarter, representing a 21% increase over units shipped in the first quarter oflast year and 20% increase over our fiscal fourth quarter of 2007. Clearly,conditions in the industry as a whole have been quite favorable.", "Record demand that continues togrow is, of course, a big part of the equation and against that favorablebackdrop is Seagate's strategically optimized manufacturing operations andcommitment to technology innovations that have enabled us to extend ourleadership in the enterprise and desktop markets and maintain our leadership inthe consumer electronics market.", "We are particularly gratifiedthat our results this quarter underscore the value of the Maxtor acquisition,and the strategic and competitive benefits that have accrued to Seagate as aresult. We have already talked about our substantial year-over-year growth inrevenue and unit shipped.", "In addition, the results fromthis quarter demonstrate that the cash generation capabilities of Seagate withfree cash flow were approximately $604 million generated during the Septemberquarter. This is a dynamic industry that continues to be characterized byrobust demand growth, and for Seagate in particular, it is a story ofcommitment to competitive leadership and a demonstrated agility and vision tocreate value across all cycles.", "In summary, we delivered a verystrong quarter, which we believe has reflected not only the strengths of theindustry as whole, but equally important is the group positive or thecompetitive and strategic benefits that we have enjoyed as a result of theMaxtor acquisition. And an integration that has proven to be one of the mostsuccessful ever in a disk drive industry.", "As we look ahead, we willcontinue to focus on extending our technology, product, and market leadership,as we grow the business and execute our strategy to generate meaningful valuefor our shareholders.", "Now, I would like to turn thecall over to Brian to provide more details of our performance in the differentmarkets and the outlook in each of those markets in the quarter ahead.", "Brian Dexheimer", "Thanks, Bill.

Ourfirst question comes from David Bailey with Goldman Sachs.", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "You've already bought up againstthat higher end of that range. Are there times when you could actually go abovethe new range and would these factors drive you there?", "Bill Watkins", "Hey, David.", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "Yeah.", "Bill Watkins", "This is Bill. We didn't hear thefirst part of that question. Could you repeat please?", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "Sure. At the Analyst Meeting inSeptember, you gave a new gross margin range of 21% to 25%. Well, you arealready there. You are already at the high-end of that. So, are there timeswhen you could go above the high-end of the new range? And what would cause youto go above the 25%?", "Bill Watkins", "I will let Charles answer, but wehad pricing declines of 2% that we have been involved in this quarter. Go aheadCharles.", "Charles Pope", "The range that we gave on ourAnalyst Day was a long-term range that reflected the product mix changes thatare anticipated to occur over the next couple of years. During any givenquarter, particularly during the front-end of that period of time, if you haveenvironments like you do today, it may be possible to go beyond the top-end ofthat range. The range was discussed as a long-term range which includes thestructure of the industry and the growth of 2.5 inch in other products whichtends to have lower margins in the industry on the relative basis.", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "And could I just get a follow-upto that. Given the seasonally lower volumes in the March and June quarters,should we expect the gross margin to drop to the lower end of the range orthere are specific Seagate items that should keep it sort of at the mid rangeor above that going forward?", "Charles Pope", "I don't think we will comment onMarch and June quarters yet, I think it\u2019s too early to determine what thosedynamics are. But, we recognize that those are normally seasonally slowerperiods of time in the year and given the leverage that is in the company, youwould expect to have a decline in profits during those periods.", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from theline of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.", "Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal", "Hi. Can you hear me okay?", "Dave Wickersham ", "Yeah.", "Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal", "Just to follow-up on David'squestion. I think you benefited from the behavior of your competitors duringthe course of September and it clearly seems like that's going to continue inthe December quarter. If you think about some of the issues that Samsung andFujitsu have had, and perhaps even Hitachi,how should we be thinking about some of the competitive dynamics as we exit Decemberand look to the seasonal period. Is there any kind of color or comments on theway you guys are thinking about it?", "Dave Wickersham", "Well, again in the Septemberquarter, and as Charles and Brian mentioned it, we had 4% price. That's notwhat we call a great pricing quarter. Now, that would be normally what we wouldexpect. My sense says that, when I look at the losses that people had last yearand historically in this industry we don't tend to go two solid years of priceforce. I think in our mind that it should be a much better and more stableyear, especially with all the demand in front of us. That said, we arepreparing for the worst.", "Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal", "Okay. Well, let me just try toget a follow up in there. It seems like during the course of this quarter, aswe were in the summer, it seems like desktop was a big area of surprise interms of the sequential growth there. And you guys are forecasting, I think yousaid 4% to 5% sequential growth in the desktop. Why do you think the desktopmarket had this seasonal spike during the course of September, even on the backof what was arguably great notebook numbers?", "Brian Dexheimer", "Yeah. Keith this is Brian, let metake that one. It's a good question. One of the things that's phenomenal. I cantell you that what we did see is a much earlier September quarter than wenormally see in terms of linearity, primarily pronounced in Europe,which of all places, is usually slower. So, the reasons behind that are myriad.I think there is some potential exchange rate phenomenon that has crept inthere. Remember too that June was not the kind of June that we normally see. Itwas on the low side of June. So, I think maybe some of that demand rollovered aswell.", "The last one I gave you is thatit is not all through desktop. So, when we talk about growth and 3.5-inch ATAbeing 4% to 5%, or 15% or 11% year-on-year, there is a lot of applicationscreeping into that now that are growing at a much faster rate. You've gotthings like surveillance, you've got things like digital video recorders, youhave the branded businesses that both we and some of our competitors have thatare putting tremendous amounts of storage into peoples\u2019 homes under variousdifferent brands. So, those segments are moving, sort of, at different cadencethan the pure desktop market. Clearly, the desktop market is growingparticularly in emerging markets. But you certainly have to layer those thingsat higher growth rates on top of that, so that is some of it as well.", "Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal", "Okay. Thanks very much guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from theline of Steven Fox with Merrill Lynch.", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Hi, good afternoon. I\u2019m justgoing back over a couple of things on the quarter. Can you just sort of dissectthe 300 basis point improvement in margins a little bit more, if you broke itup between units, efficiencies, and pricing mix?", "And then as a follow-up, if youcould, within that answer, highlight what was the most powerful mix effect inthe quarter?", "Bill Watkins", "I will try to do that Steven. Ifyou look at just the order of magnitude of what drove the 300 basis pointimprovement, it would be pricing first and that's pricing relative to what wehad planned and anticipated at the beginning of the quarter.", "The second would be the mix ofproducts that we shipped and those really cover the entire margin improvements.Volume had a very nominal, if any impact on the margin expansion, depending onthe mix of products that got into it, and so whatever volume was included, itreally gets covered in the product mix piece of it.", "If you sit and look at some ofthe areas that really contributed to the margin expansion from the product mixperspective, I think it goes back to Brian's comments in the call where hetalked about the very high demand for high capacity ATA drives, 750-gigabytedrives, and the 80% growth rate in ATA drives that are 500 gigabytes and over.And I think that if you sit and look at a mix between product offerings,enterprise, desktop, and mobile, that is not as dramatic of driver as thein-mix, particularly in the ATA products.", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Great. That's very helpful. Thankyou.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from theline of Aaron Rakers with Wachovia.", "Aaron Rakers - Wachovia", "Yeah, thanks guys. A couple ofquestions as well, if I can. I guess, the first question is on your free cashflow generation. At the Analyst Day, I believe you gave a framework modelguiding basically $840 million to $1.35 billion and you guys just did $604million. Now, at the time were you thinking that was being rather conservative,or is there something out in front of us that causes you to possibly see somedeceleration in the free cash flow?", "Brian Dexheimer", "Charles is going to take thatquestion.", "Charles Pope", "Good question though. Good timesalways look really good and then when you are in the seasonally slow periods,you kind of grind through them. I think that it's a fair question and I dothink that it reflects that unless we would anticipate negative cash flows inthe back half of the year, which we don't. We expect to still have goodrevenue, good profitability in the back half of the fiscal year, with positivecash flows in those periods, that it may indicate that during this fiscal yearwe underestimated the free cash flow that could be generated by the business.", "Aaron Rakers - Wachovia", "And then if I could follow up onthat. The retail business was down modestly as a percentage of your totalrevenue. Maybe you can touch on the new products coming on board. If we shouldexpect that contribution to start to increase here going forward, and maybe ontop of that, highlight if you know possibly what the gross margin implicationscould be?", "Brian Dexheimer", "Aaron, this is Brian. Let me takethat one. I wouldn't look for any gross margin implications. That's a businessthat we target to run pretty close to the average of the company gross margins.So, I don't think you are going to see any margin expansion to the retailbusiness. So, on a top line basis, we actually feel pretty good about where weare both year-on-year and sequentially.", "It's a little early to tell allthe returns earning, yet from the people we compete within that space, we feelgood about our position there. We feel good about the cost structure of theproducts. As I mentioned, both brands have been refreshed and we're moving intoa season, that's going to be a high season. So a lot of optimism around thetop-line impact of the business going forward.", "Aaron Rakers - Wachovia", "Thank you. Congratulations.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from theline of Katherine Huberty with Morgan Stanley.", "Katherine Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Yeah. Hi, guys. As it relates tothe 4% to 5% sequential unit guidance, that's towards the lower end of what youwould typically see in December. How much of that is a function of demand,perhaps being pulled in from September versus just the manufacturing capacitylimitations that you've seen in your business for the quarter?", "Bill Watkins", "Brian?", "Brian Dexheimer", "Hey, Katherine, this is Brian. Ihad just a little bit of both. I think part of it's in our planning as well. Wewere proven wrong last quarter when we forecasted 15% sequential growth. It wasstronger than that. You can see by our channel inventories, nobody is sittingon the products. So I don't know that we could say demand was pulled intoSeptember, people are using the product that we're putting out there. So,hopefully, we're on the downside again, that would be a good scenario foreveryone, but frankly, there is also a capacity utilization limit that we'reheading into as well.", "As Dave mentioned, we madecapacity build-out decisions back in the spring timeframe that we're livingwith today, and living with quite happily in fact. It's presenting a challengeat some of the product pipelines, at or moving in some allocated stage forperiods of time. But, and I think much beyond the 5% range, there is probably,at least at Seagate, if not an industry limitation too in terms of industrycapacity. If you just extrapolate that growth rate out, that's going to be anindustry unit that's down close to 140 million units and is substantiallyhigher than it's ever been before. So I think we are bumping up against some ofthe limits, particularly as you get into certain product lines.", "Katherine Huberty - MorganStanley", "And why wouldn't those capacitylimitations give you better visibility going into the March quarter then youhad, say a year ago?", "Brian Dexheimer", "Well, Katie, they might. When weare setting in December and January having the conversation with you, they maywell. But we need to get through the December quarter, see what thesell-through is in the December quarter, what the channel inventories are as weexit the December quarter and what the OEM sell-through is and if the demandexceeds the 5% and the selling through, it may well give us better visibility,but it's too early to have that look at it yet.", "Katherine Huberty - MorganStanley", "Okay. And then I apologize if Imissed it, could you give what channel inventory was at the end of the quarter?", "Brian Dexheimer", "Yes, for Seagate it was under threeweeks, and for the industry excluding Seagate it was four weeks. ", "Katherine Huberty - MorganStanley", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from theline of Daniel Renouard with Robert W. Baird.", "Daniel Renouard - Robert W.Baird", "I am wondering if you can give ussome flavor on profitability. For the last couple of years you have talkedabout laptop pricing, and that on the PC side it has been more aggressive. Ourlaptops and desktops on the PC side at roughly comparable profitability levelssort of as much as you can do apples-to-apples or do you think there is moremargin pressure not this quarter but say next year on the laptop side. ", "And then secondly, there has beensome conjecture about double ordering etc. with some products on allocation. Wouldyou have any color that you could add to that in terms of what your endcustomers are actually doing in terms of their demand versus orders in furtherpatterns?", "Charles Pope", "So Daniel, let me take the firstpiece. This is Charles. Relative to profitability, and I will answer in twodifferent ways, I wasn't sure how you were asking about it. If you look at interms of just an absolute profit pool, by the sheer size of the desktop that weshipped versus the notebook, the desktop is by far the largest profit pool thatexists. If you look at it on a margin basis, I think we were relatively woken upand open about the fact that during this last year with the pricing pressureson the 2.5 inch product, that margins had slipped below the 3.5 inch ATAmargins, and while there may be a path to bring them up comparative at somepoint in time, they are still somehow below the 3.5 inch ATA margins. And so,we will have to see how these dynamics and product pressures allow that tochange overtime.", "Brian Dexheimer", "Daniel this is Brian, I will takethe double ordering question. I think at any time that you have a particularproduct line that is in short supply you can expect, you are going to see someof that, and I certainly would not deny that we are suspicious that there is someof that going on. I would tell you that anything that we've put in front ofyou, in terms of an outlook, including the 4% to 5% unit growth, fullycontemplates that. And the fact is we have far more demand, then that wouldrepresent in front of us today, some of which we don't think is necessarilyreal in period, that we are not frankly in a position to even react to in orderwe put that in our outlook. We are also very confident that there is otherpotential gauge in the supply chains of our customers, both in the desktop andthe notebook space, plastics, batteries, panels, processors, you name it. But wefeel pretty good about our triangulation around those data points and where wesit within that and consequently the outlook we've given you here for thisquarter.", "Daniel Renouard - Robert W.Baird", "That's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from theline of Mark Miller with Brean Murray, Carret", "Mark Miller - Brean Murray,Carret", "Let me congratulate you forhaving a very strong quarter. It appears very quickly on in your projectionsfor the December quarter that we are seeing somewhat of a more benign pricingenvironment. It also appears more flattish than what we thought was going tohappen in the September quarter. However, we are looking at relatively lowinventory levels, we are talking about products on allocation, and we are alsotalking about a move up in terms of capacity that supported your ASPs to bebasically flat last quarter. In the past, when we see an environment like this,we've actually seen price increases or ASP increases in the December quarter. Anyfeeling about that? You seem to be more conservative here, in terms of yourpricing projection for December?", "Brian Dexheimer", "Mark, this is Brain. Let me takethat one. Let me just kind of reset a perception. We've talked about normalpricing ranges on like-for-like across all products being in a 4% to 7% rangefor sometime now and in fact the 4% we saw in September, you would have to goback about four years before you would find anything lower than that. So, thereis a perception that prices actually go up in quarters and periods of tightness.We have seen several of those in the last three to four years, including theperiod we are in right now and prices just don't go up.", "And the large reason for that is about65% of our business and I think its true in most of the industry, goes to OEMcustomers who have an expectation of price takedowns on a quarter-on-quarterbasis. And those expectations really are set in the previous quarter, and as anindustry we have delivered to those expectations with a limited amount of side linein terms of any individual product lines, supply and demand balance over thenext 90 day period.", "So, by function of that withinour model in the industry, we have already have some price declines built in,where we typically get some leverages in more transit markets, eitherdistribution channel, which might be as much as 30% of our business, we havethe ability to change price on a more weekly or monthly basis. And so insegments like that, we have sometimes been able to at least keep prices flat insome capacity categories than we do at programs, may be slightly up. But as youmix the sense of the overall, we have not seen any quarters in the last threeyears that have had less than about a 3% like-for-like overall price decline.And the last point I will make for you, is that all of our products are inallocation now. So, the notebook is tight and some high-capacity desktopproducts are tight, there are many segments of a product line that aren\u2019tallocated.", "Mark Miller - Brean Murray, Carret", "But the point I was trying tomake is not on a product-for-product basis, but on an ASP basis because ofproduct mix effects.", "Bill Watkins", "I think you see that in ouroutlook, where we have said there would be 4% or 5% unit growth for theindustry. And if you do the math on the guidance we gave you, you are going toget 4% or 5% revenue growth. So, that implies a flattish ASP.", "Mark Miller - Brean Murray, Carret", "Right. Next question is that there\u2019sbeen some reports about mobile component issues. Is it possible that some ofthat could constrain mobile ships in the December quarter, and shift them intothe March quarter? You saw very strong growth this quarter. I am just wonderingwhat you are hearing about, there was a fire at Matsushita plant, also somepanel issues?", "Bill Watkins", "Yeah. That\u2019s a great point. Iwill try to address that a little bit earlier. Let me tackle it directly. Sofar, we certainly checked through our engagements with all of our majorcustomers, we are not going to be a constraint for them nor do they feel thatthe demands they are putting on us right now is in jeopardy because of othercomponent constraints. And so, whether it\u2019s the way they have aligned supply ona specific component -- battery is a great example because of the instance thatoccurred, we don\u2019t think there is risk there given the outlook that we have putin front of you.", "Mark Miller - Brean Murray, Carret", "And final question, some people,I know you don\u2019t want guidance, but to refresh my memory, the March quarterreally is not that big of quarter. It\u2019s typically, if I recall, and you cancorrect me, there are 2% to 5% from December typically, will I have to markthere in a typical March quarter following the summer?", "Bill Watkins", "I will let Charles take that.", "Charles Pope", "I would stay that it\u2019s more oftenthe 5% range.", "Mark Miller - Brean Murray, Carret", "", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from theline of Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.", "Rich Kugele - Needham& Company", "I have a clarification and a question.First, just to understand better your retail, Brian, when you are talking aboutbranded, are you referring to your retail or is branded also a portion of yourconsumer? I\u2019m just trying to understand the type of growth rate you are talkingabout relative to the additional color on the website.", "Brian Dexheimer", "Yeah. Sure, Rich. That is theproducts that shipped through retail and other channels under the Seagate orMaxtor brand. That\u2019s not any product that we ship or send to the game consoleor DVR space?", "Rich Kugele - Needham& Company", "Okay. And then question for Dave,just a little bit more on the supply chain. In particular, aluminum substrates,I know that you have your agreements with your vendors and as well as someinternal production. So and as you mentioned, you are fine for your own supply.But are you seeing any constraints from an industry perspective, particularlyon high cap perpendicular that maybe impacting maybe some of your Asian guys?", "Dave Wickersham", "Yeah, Rich. The utilization froman industry perspective is not much different than we talked about at ourAnalyst Day. It's very similar. So, it's in the high 80s. So, you would expectto see some disruptions, as people shift either their sources, theirqualifications or have issues with execution. So, aside from that there isadequate capacity. We think and again other competitors can choose to use thoseeither on the high-end or anywhere else for that matter. So, it's tight, Rich.But again as I mentioned earlier, our view is there is an adequate supply notjust for Seagate but for the industry as well.", "Rich Kugele - Needham& Company", "Okay. And then just lastly, justbecause we can ask the question, the International Trade Commissioninvestigation into the drive land, is this really an issue or is this justexploratory?", "Bill Watkins", "I don\u2019t know that I can give anyreal clarification at this point in time on that, Rich. I don\u2019t have anyonethat is close to that topic that can really provide that answer.", "Rich Kugele - Needham& Company", "Okay. I just wanted to ask. Thankyou very much", "Operator", "Our next question comes from theline of Mark Moskowitz with J.P. Morgan.", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Yes. Good afternoon. I have twoquestions, one for Dave and one for Brian. Dave, could you maybe give us alittle more context around the discipline that Seagate is exhibiting withrespect to CapEx and the future capacity additions? Is this a sign that themarket momentum could slow in the coming year or that potentially market share shiftsat peak or maybe there\u2019s one more or, or is it really just to sign that thecycles in terms of the peaks and values have a smaller input to what they aregoing to be, looks greater a frequent thing?", "Dave Wickersham", "Well, Mark, Dave. It's obvious.The first part of the question is really what I tried to hit in the scripts andthat is we continue to be very, very disciplined. And as we talked about ourAnalyst Day, we really focused on our overall efficiency, but to not spend anycapital before it\u2019s absolutely required. So, one of the things that we try todo every quarter is to make sure that we don't put any unnecessary capitalonline and that's what you saw here. Frankly, the 150 actual was a little bitless than plan and that's primarily due to some of the facility's expendituresthat we planned.", "So on a year, the $900 millionjust for your modeling will be pretty linear roughly half on the first half andhalf at the second half of '08. But I can speak for Seagate and I think we haveseen indications elsewhere that folks are being very mindful about puttingcapacity online before customer. So, they are either being cautions and I thinkthat's healthy for the industry and certainly we are doing our part.", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Thank you. Appreciate that. Andthen, Brian maybe you can just touch really quickly here on the prettyattractive opportunity here that you referenced in terms of high capacity, highmargin through ATA business, 500 to 751 terabyte, seems as if Seagate has apretty lead good followed by Western Digital. What are you seeing from yourcompetitors? Do they have the capacity? Do they have the technology to go outto this market particularly that becomes kind of the coveted profit growthstory for the industry over the next couple of years?", "Brian Dexheimer", "Well, the cynical part of me Markwould say that it close an opportunity to mess up the profit growth story basedon behavior. But, with the kind of growth we are seeing, fortunately right nowthat's not an option for the industry. What I'll tell you is there are twocomponents for the growth. One is through technology, which you are absolutelyright, we are well-positioned for. And products like that, they are a highdish, high headcount products, vertical integration helps, and leadingtechnology is even better, and we happen to have both. So, we arewell-positioned from technology.", "The other vector is applicationexpertise. As I mentioned to one of the previous questions, the growth we areseeing at high capacity really covers a number of different segments, theobvious one being the desktop market that's certainly a component of it. Lessobvious being things like commercial surveillance, the branded business that wehave and then finally where application expertise is really important and weare well-position the enterprise and this edge of the internet sort of buildout. We believe we shipped over 2 million units to edge-to-the-Internetapplications and high-capacity SATA, which we consider enterprise applications andpart of our enterprise business and the application expertise to pull that off,because it's the same primary custom set of our classic mission-criticalbusiness is not trivial. And we think that's a key component of growth thereand so from pure technology and application expertise, we think we are reallywell-positioned.", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you for that. And may be Iwould squeeze one more question. And Charles could you may be give us littlemore color behind the government research grant that you talked about earlier.", "Charles Pope", "Sure. This is a non-US grant. Wehave operations in countries that we operate in the tax holidays, and some ofthe benefits that we get are related to research that it goes on in thosecountries. This grant was about $4 million grant.", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from theline of Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum Capital Group.", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group", "Thanks, Brian. Just a quick questionon the tremendous OEM demand. How much benefit do you think you received duringthe quarter from OEMs, fearful about Hitachi'scommitment to the disk drive business versus end demand?", "Brian Dexheimer", "Yeah, Christian, I would probablyhazard to guess on that, it's tough to read minds. What I would tell you is, webelieve we've benefited from additional volume both in terms of market growth,but if you're suit and I know you are, you will look at our growth relativelyto industry and note that it's higher. So, we grew some share, and we grew thatshare probably because of our flexibility in our leading technology lineup. Wemay have also grown it because of some misexecution in part of some competitionand/or some of the things you mentioned. But, it's almost impossible for us totell that specific reason.", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group", "Great. No further questions.Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from theline of Kevin Hunt with Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Hi. Thanks guys, a couple ofquestions. First on the OpEx, how much you gave, Charles? What should we bethinking about that if you look beyond the December quarter? Should we beassuming those kind of increased bonuses would continue, i.e. the dollar runrates stays similar or should we think that would come little down as a percentof sales going forward? And I have a follow up.", "Charles Pope", "If said look in the March andJune quarters, we would probably expect them to come back down to the $400million to $405 million range, because in the spending level that's reflectedin the December quarter. It does have some increased variable R&D cost forproducts that are coming through that stage of it at this point in time.", "Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel Partners", "And do you guys did not talkregarding your options number once in the quarter?", "Charles Pope", "I do not remember on top of myhead what that is. I can certainly have Rod make that available.", "Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. And then one follow-up forBrian as well. Looking at the consumer business again just to make sure I amunderstanding things, when you are talking the consumer, the branded itself youare including is part of desktop, is that correct?", "Brian Dexheimer", "No, actually calling our brandedseparately.", "Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay.", "Brian Dexheimer", "Our branded business are thoseproducts that we shipped under the Maxtor and Seagate brands, where we saw(inaudible) consumer electronics business, is that which goes into consumerelectronics applications really as it drives them so. Think of handheld, DVR,game consoles, things like that, automotive.", "Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel Partners", "But did you give a number of abrand, I just missed that.", "Brian Dexheimer", "I didn't give a specific number.I said it was up 10% sequentially on a top line basis.", "Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. So when we're adding up inthe units here, is that part of that $29 million desktop fan or what?", "Brian Dexheimer", "We throw the units when you arelooking at the website. If you look at units, it will be in the desktop number.", "Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. Now, then going to the backto the gaming segment again, that was actually based on my numbers here anywaydown year-over-year. So could you talk about the dynamics, was that probablyjust because the real small contractors going way down or what, gaming down orwhat?", "Brian Dexheimer", "Right. If you remember last year,it was the launch of the PS3.", "Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel Partners", "", "Yeah.", "Brian Dexheimer", "And you remember that launch wasdelayed, so a lot of volume that might have been in. The similar quarter lastyear got pushed to the December quarter. So, it makes a difficult year-on-yearcomp.", "Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay.", "Brian Dexheimer", "Make sense?", "Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Yeah, all right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Out next question comes from theline of Andrew Neff with Bear Stearns.", "Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns", "Sure. I just wanted to see if youcould elaborate a little more than you get on competition and what you areseeing in that respect in terms of -- talked a lot at the analyst meeting aboutthings you are seeing Hitachi,Fujitsu, is that have you seen any change since the analyst meeting in terms ofcompetitive behavior?", "Charles Pope", "Not necessarily, so we haven'tnoticed anything I think at least for now. Again, the pricing was some whatbenign, more than we thought going to the core, but now we haven't seen anythingthat we didn't talk about the analyst and it appears that everyone's prettymuch got their head down and is kind of focus on the Metro products.", "Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Charles Pope", "Last question please.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from theline of Shaw Wu with American Technology Research.", "Shaw Wu - American Technology Research", "Sure. Just a clarification onyour hybrid comments, where do you said you shipped 100,000 units, not sure ifI heard that correctly, and just related to that, just kind of wondering what'syour view on Intel's Robson technology, is that something that's competitive,complementary or where we see notebook products kind of a both forms some withhybrid and some with Robson? Thanks.", "Brian Dexheimer", "John, first I want to clarifyyes, you did hear a 100,000 units. It's early days on hybrid. We got three OEMsthat are shipping new products. The market is still quite nascent relative toRobson. We are very confident this technology will perform well versus thatalternative architecture for several commercial reasons why, OEMs might notwant to align with Robson as an alternative. And we think the hybrid designwill provide some additional benefits beyond the performance that Robsonpromises. So, we feel pretty good about it. We're part of the industryassociation around hybrid, that's in full support of the hybrid design, and Ithink we're getting good acceptance from the customer base.", "Shaw Wu - American Technology Research", "Okay. And just a quick follow-up,in terms of support for the hybrid, the flash portion, is that through the OSlayer, through like Windows, or is that your software?", "Brian Dexheimer", "No, hybrid is really a functionof the operating system. So, Vista had anumber of changes in it that were to accommodate hybrid in fact. There isnumber of changes forthcoming in Service Pack 1 that will take more advantageof the features that the hybrid drive provides. But it is within the control ofMicrosoft.", "Shaw Wu - American Technology Research", "Okay. Thank you.", "Brian Dexheimer", "Okay. With that, thank you allfor joining us today.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Seagate Technology\u2019s fiscal second quarter 2008 financial results conference call. (Operator Instructions) ", "This conference call contains forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements related to the company\u2019s future financial performance. These forward-looking statements are based on information available to Seagate as of the date of this conference call but are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements. ", "Information concerning additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 27, 2007, and in the company\u2019s quarterly on Form 10-Q as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on October 29, 2007. ", "These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the company\u2019s views as of any subsequent date and Seagate undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made. ", "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Bill Watkins, CEO. Please go ahead, sir. ", "William D. Watkins", "Thank you, Dustin. Welcome, everyone and thank you for joining us. On the phone with me are Dave Wickersham, President and Chief Operating Officer; Charles Pope,  Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Dexheimer, Executive Vice President, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer. Brian is actually offline on a phone here so he will be kind of from a remote position. ", "As announced earlier today, we reported another quarter of double-digit revenue and profitability growth year over year. These results were driven by the continued strong demand for storage and the breadth and depth of our portfolio and our expanded customer base, which enables us to benefit from demand across virtually every market for digital content from the home to the enterprise. ", "I\u2019ll start the call today by spending a few minutes reviewing our second quarter numbers with you and sharing with you some additional perspective on our business trends and the industry landscape. I\u2019ll then turn to our outlook for the quarter ahead and share with you our view of the key factors that will influence our performance going forward. I\u2019ll then ask Brian, Dave, and Charles to discuss details of our market, operating, and financial results. ", "Our results for the quarter continue to show overall strength in Seagate's business model and the fact that technology trends continue to create strong demand for digital storage. At Seagate, we surpassed our first quarter with record demand that resulted in capacity constraints. For the quarter, revenue grew 14% year over year to a record $3.4 billion on shipments of 50 million units, representing a 20% increase over units shipped in the second quarter of last year. ", "We maintain our overall industry leadership position, shipping 35% of the total industry volume and retained our leading position in the enterprise, desktop, and consumer electronic markets. ", "Profitability improved with gross margins increasing to 26% in what was then a benign pricing environment. We continued to demonstrate that Seagate is a powerful generator of cash with $724 million in cash generated from operations and $512 million in free cash flow in the quarter. ", "Through the first half of the fiscal year, we have generated approximately $1.5 billion in cash from operations and over $1 billion in free cash flow, and we have returned approximately $600 million in cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. ", "Clearly we remain enthusiastic of what we see as a very strong future for the industry and expect Seagate will continue to leverage our technological and operational strength into a competitive advantage. ", "Given the seasonality of our business, we expect an historical 5% decrease in unit demand for the March quarter from the December, but we expect demand will be approximately 20% up from the March quarter of last year. ", "Longer term, we see demand trends continuing to shift towards higher capacity storage, indicating that the global appetite for digital storage in both the consumer and commercial markets remain robust. ", "Looking ahead, we see a continuation of a strong overall demand trends with normal seasonality in the current quarter. We expect to report solid third quarter results with a revenue in the $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion range, representing a 15% revenue growth year over year at the midpoint. ", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Brian to provide more details of our performance in the different markets and the outlook in each of those markets in the quarter ahead. ", "Brian S. Dexheimer", "Thanks, Bill. Calendar 2007 ended on a strong note for Seagate and the industry. Year-over-year demand increased significantly, delivering record units and revenue for the industry. Once again, supply and demand appeared to be well-balanced, contributing to a healthy operating environment. ", "Seagate and the industry continue to benefit from the dramatic growth in digital content creation and distribution and the increasing build-up of Web 2.0 applications. Specific to the December quarter, we believe the overall industry TAM was approximately 144 million units, up 21% year over year. Seagate maintained its overall industry leadership, shipping 35% of the industry\u2019s volume and growing its shipments to 49.6 million units. Seagate retained share leadership in the enterprise, desktop, and CE markets. ", "Looking toward the March quarter, we expect seasonality will bring the overall TAM down 4% to 6% quarter over quarter to $134 million to $138 million units, representing a continued strong year-over-year growth of 20% to 22%. ", "Now I\u2019ll give some detail on the individual markets. ", "The mission critical enterprise TAM in the December quarter grew faster than originally predicted at the beginning of the quarter, reaching approximately 8.3 million units, representing 13% quarter-on-quarter growth and 16% year-on-year growth. Seagate maintained its leadership position in this market, shipping a record 5.3 million units. ", "Server virtualization resulted in strong demand from customers deploying SAN architectures, leading to dramatic growth in our 15,000 RPM 3.5-inch high capacity products. Also, small form factory enterprise drives continued to be in high demand as Seagate shipments were 1.7 million units during the December quarter. These products offer a powerful combination of reduced power and physical footprint while providing industry-leading performance.", "Also within the enterprise space, we are seeing continued growth in the high capacity enterprise class SATA products. Growth for these products is driven by the build-out of Web 2.0 data centers and continued adoption of drive-to-drive back-up solutions at the expense of tape. ", "These products are being widely adopted for digital content aggregation and distribution over the Internet infrastructure. We believe we are the leader in this portion of the enterprise market. ", "Additionally, we achieved solid qualification starts during the quarter with several first tier customers for our 1-terabyte product. We expect shipments of this product to be material in the March quarter and beyond and further strengthen our leadership in this space. ", "Looking forward to the March quarter, for the enterprise market we expect mission critical class drives to be flat to slightly down seasonally, which high-capacity SATA products are likely to be slightly higher sequentially. ", "In consumer electronics applications, we believe the industry TAM exceeded 22 million units during the quarter. DVR growth of nearly 30% year-on-year was a key driver in this space. Seagate also experienced strong growth in this market, maintaining its leadership position by shipping 8.1 million units. This represents our largest quarter ever in consumer electronics applications. ", "Additional key sources of growth for Seagate in this space continued to be surveillance equipment and gaming, each of which experienced substantial growth in the quarter. ", "We are planning that the CE TAM for the March quarter will follow normal seasonal patterns and be approximately 15% to 17% lower than that of the December quarter. ", "We believe the mobile compute TAM grew 10% sequentially and 48% year-on-year to approximately 44 million units. Seagate shipped 6.4 million units into this market during the quarter, an increase of 46% year-on-year. Capacities continue to trend higher in this space as the notebook displaces the desktop as the platform of choice in the digital home. ", "We believe our 250 gigabyte notebook product, now shipping in volume, will provide additional opportunity for Seagate beginning in the March quarter. This product has been qualified by eight OEMs to date, with several more imminent. ", "We expect the March quarter for the mobile compute market to exhibit normal seasonality and be slightly down from the December quarter. ", "The TAM in the desktop compute market grew 5% sequentially to approximately 69 million units. Seagate shipments grew to a record 29.9 million units in fiscal Q2. we continued to see strong movement to higher capacity 3.5-inch ATA products during the quarter and believe that the industry exited the quarter with some unmet demand in capacity to 500 gigabytes and greater. We believe channel inventory of 3.5-inch ATA products for the industry exiting the December quarter was less than five weeks and Seagate's inventories were at four weeks. ", "For the March quarter, we expect that the desktop computer TAM to be seasonally down approximately 4% to 5% sequentially, yet still reflecting healthy year-on-year growth of slightly more than 10%. ", "Finally, we saw sequential growth in our branded solutions business that was greater than that of the core business. During the December quarter, we were challenged to meet increasing demands of our customers in several product configurations. We are seeing strong adoption of our new Maxtor OneTouch 4 products and expect this to continue as we see the creation and distribution of digital content proliferate globally. ", "Looking into the March quarter, we expect this market will be flat compared to the December quarter. ", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Dave to provide an update on our operations. ", "David A. Wickersham", "Thank you, Brian. I\u2019ll start with a few comments regarding our inventory performance in the December quarter, provide a quick update in regard to our capital spending plans for fiscal 2008, and conclude with some comments regarding our new product execution. ", "Seagate's inventory increased $67 million quarter over quarter from $763 million to $830 million. An increase of $76 million in finished goods inventory was partially offset by a $9 million reduction in work-in-process and raw materials. As highlighted in our October conference call, during the December quarter we expected to continue to fully utilize our available capacity and also replenish our OEM JIT hubs to required inventory levels. ", "To put this in perspective, on a year-over-year basis finished goods inventory decreased by $70 million while revenue increased by over $400 million. Inventory turnover was slightly higher than 12 turns in the December quarter, which was better than our projection of 11 turns. ", "As discussed in previous calls, we align our capacity expansions with customer demand. In light of the normal seasonal demand patterns in the March and June quarters, we do not expect to increase our fiscal 2008 capital spending plans. Consequently, the fiscal 2008 capital investment outlook remains unchanged at approximately $900 million and continues to include the expansion of our finished media and substrate factories in Asia. Over the next couple of months as we meet with our major customers, we will determine how much additional capacity will be required to support expected demand for the fiscal 2009 September and December quarters. ", "New product introductions continue to be a critical aspect of Seagate's ability to grow revenue and sustain margins. For example, Seagate has shipped more 250 gigabyte per disk 3.5-inch ATA drives than any of our competitors. However, we need to significantly improve our time-to-market results in the notebook market, where Seagate was late to productize the equivalent areal density, which is the 125 gigabyte per product disk that is now shipping in volume that Brian mentioned earlier. ", "Seagate remains committed to delivering new products that lead the industry in time-to-market, quality and reliability, and lowest cost. We are very disappointed with our time-to-market execution in the notebook market and we are addressing these issues. ", "While there is still much work to do, we are on track with the introduction of new products required to support our financial performance for the March quarter and beyond. ", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Charles. ", "Charles C. Pope", "Thanks, Dave. You will find the company\u2019s press release, 8-K, and additional financial information related to Seagate's financial performance, along with a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results and other supplemental information in the investor relations section of Seagate's website at Seagate.com. ", "For the December quarter, Seagate reported revenue of $3.4 billion and unit shipments of approximately 50 million, which reflects year-over-year growth of 14% and 20% respectively. ", "GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share for the December quarter are $403 million and $0.73 respectively. Included in the GAAP results are approximately $31 million of purchased intangibles amortization and other charges associated with recently completed acquisitions, including MetaLINCs, as well as a net gain from asset sales of approximately $15 million. Without these items and the associated tax effects, non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share was $419 million and $0.76 respectively. ", "Included in both the GAAP and non-GAAP results is approximately $27 million of restructuring charges, which reduced diluted earnings per share by about $0.05. ", "GAAP gross margin for the December quarter was 26%. Excluding approximately $11 million of acquisition related costs, non-GAAP gross margin was 26.3%. Gross margin increased approximately 140 basis points from the prior quarter, due primarily to the pricing environment that was prevalent during the quarter. ", "GAAP R&D and selling, general, and administrative costs were $429 million for the December quarter. Excluding costs related to recent acquisitions including MetaLINCs, non-GAAP expenses were $422 million, slightly higher than what we had expected. ", "The roughly $30 million increase in R&D and SG&A expenses compared to the prior quarter is primarily due to annual salary adjustments, non-recurring engineering costs related to new product introductions, and increased legal expenses. ", "Cash flow from operations was $724 million for the December quarter, while free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $512 million. ", "For the first six months of fiscal 2008, Seagate generated approximately $1.5 billion in cash from operations and $1.1 billion in free cash flow. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities ended the quarter at $1.75 billion, up $252 million from the previous quarter. ", "During the December quarter, Seagate returned $300 million of cash to its shareholders, consisting of $50 million for the quarterly dividend and $250 million of share repurchase. ", "Seagate's ability to generate cash is one of the strengths of our business model and this quarter\u2019s results again underscore that point. ", "Capital investment in the December quarter was $212 million and for the first six months totaled $362 million. As Dave previously indicated, we continue to plan for approximately $900 million of capital investment for fiscal 2008. ", "Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter was $215 million, up slightly from the prior quarter. Amortization of purchased intangibles totaled approximately $24 million. ", "You can find our fiscal year 2008 estimate for amortization of purchased intangibles on slide nine of the supplemental information package. ", "During the December quarter, the company purchased 9.3 million shares related to its share repurchase plan with an average price of $27. Cumulatively, under the current share repurchase authorization, we have repurchase 81.5 million shares with an average cost of $24.86. The company has authorization to purchase approximately $474 million of additional shares under the current stock repurchase program. ", "As indicated in the press release, we anticipate completing the balance of the current share repurchase authorization during the March quarter. I\u2019d like to point out that when we closed the Maxtor acquisition in May of 2006, we issued just over 100 million shares. Our objective all along was to make the Maxtor acquisition a virtual cash transaction. Since that time, we have repurchased approximately 98 million shares. To the extent Seagate is able to fully utilize the existing share repurchase authorization in the March quarter, we will have repurchased more shares than originally issued through the Maxtor acquisition. ", "Additionally, we expect to request a new share repurchase authorization at an upcoming board meeting that would allow Seagate to continue repurchasing its stock beyond the March quarter. ", "Now I\u2019d like to provide further detail on our outlook for the March quarter. ", "As Brian mentioned, for the March quarter we are expecting industry unit demand to be seasonally down around 5% quarter over quarter. Keep in mind that on a year-over-year basis, this equates to approximately 20% unit growth, similar to what the industry experienced during the last six months. ", "Consequently, Seagate expects revenue to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion. ", "GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be $0.57 to $0.61, and includes approximately $27 million of purchased intangible amortization and other charges associated with recently completed acquisitions, including MetaLINCs. Accordingly, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share excluding acquisition related costs is expected to be $0.62 to $0.66. At the midpoint, this outlook for the March quarter equates to top line year-over-year growth of 15% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 36%. ", "In providing this guidance, we recognize the current uncertainty of the U.S. economy. We believe our global market position and the breadth of our portfolio are strengths that may temper the effects of any cooling in the U.S. economy. ", "Demand for our products continues to be very strong, particularly among our content aggregator and Internet infrastructure customers. With ongoing input from our customers, we will continue to watch the U.S. economy closely and monitor its condition for any potential impacts that would cause deviation from the normal seasonal trends reflected in the company\u2019s guidance. ", "GAAP, R&D, and SG&A expenses are expected to be approximately $438 million to $443 million for the March quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding approximately $3 million of acquisition-related costs, R&D and SG&A costs are expected to be approximately $435 million to $440 million. ", "The increase over the prior quarter reflects modest incremental investments in technology leadership and continued increases in our legal expenses as previously discussed. ", "Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $12 million and the tax rate is expected to be near the low end of the 5% to 10% range, similar to the December quarter. ", "As always, this outlook does not include the impact of any future acquisitions, stock repurchases, or restructuring activities the company may undertake during the quarter. ", "That concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call back over to Bill. ", "William D. Watkins", "Thanks, Charles. Clearly Seagate operational and financial performance position the company well in what has become one of the world\u2019s most important and exciting industries. On behalf of the management team, I would like to thank and congratulate our employees around the world for another quarter of outstanding results. ", "So with that, let\u2019s open up the call. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. ", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Given your comment on unmet demand, it sounds like manufacturing utilization was near 100% in December. Where does that stand to date in the month of January?", "William D. Watkins", "Dave, do you want to take it?", "David A. Wickersham", "Where does it stand to date through the month of January?", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Yeah. ", "David A. Wickersham", "Well, again, we are 100% utilized to the December quarter. The vast majority of our investments for the remainder of the quarter will be to continue to facilitize the media expansion in Asia along with the substrate expansion. So we have the ability and we\u2019ll continue to monitor customer demand to try to keep our utilization very, very high but the roughly two-thirds of our capital investments, of the $900 million in 2009, or for 2008, pardon me, is really to position us to start to ramp those facilities in the June quarter but really prepare us for the September and December capacity needs for internal components. ", "William D. Watkins", "I think one way to think about it, if you look at we are really forecasting about a 5% drop in units on a sequential quarter on quarter, so you can see we are going to run pretty close to capacity, even now. We are not putting in a lot of capacity, as Dave said, unless it\u2019s reducing our costs on medium substrates. ", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "And then with the greater adoption of 1.8-inch drives in the notebook market, how quickly do you think you can come to market with a drive with appropriate capacity?", "William D. Watkins", "Brian, do you want to talk about that?", "Brian S. Dexheimer", "Well, I think first of all it may be a little presumptuous to think that there\u2019s going to be wide adoption of 1.8-inch in the notebook. They have been there for quite some time and in products very much like the one that we saw yesterday being announced, or a few days ago, and they\u2019ve continued to be less than 5% of the overall part of the notebook market. ", "So while that may change a little bit, it doesn\u2019t -- any announcements in the last week doesn\u2019t cause us to revisit our plans. The short answer to your question is we could be in a 1.8-inch product within 15 to 18 months after we decide we wanted to have one in our roadmap. ", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Richard Kugele with Needham & Company.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "Thank you. Just a couple of quick questions -- first, on the gross margin, obviously an impressive number but due to the demand being as strong as it was, you likely had to expedite much of the quarter, which usually means by air then, right? So if we were just to take a step back and look at what the earnings power and the margin potential, the model actually was, what do you think it would have been if you didn\u2019t have to do that? If you actually had the inventory and the capacity? Is there a way of figuring that out?", "Brian S. Dexheimer", "I\u2019m not terribly sure that it\u2019s worthwhile speculating about that. If you are meeting all the demand, who knows what the mix of product are and everything else. There\u2019s a lot of different moving parts, Rich. ", "William D. Watkins", "We\u2019re very happy with where it stands right now. We like to exactly where we are at. ", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay, and then just secondly, Dave, as you look at the manufacturing capacity, where do you think the greatest bottlenecks are in the system that need to be dealt with as you move throughout the year to meet the second half demand?", "David A. Wickersham", "Well first, Rich, I would say that we had some unique challenges within Seagate that I\u2019ve referred to, which is a good challenge to have and that is, we\u2019ve seen some very, very strong demand of our high capacity drives in particular, and so that is what has created some unique issues for Seagate that we\u2019ve worked through and we\u2019ve talked about publicly through December and we continue to see that strong and rich mix moving forward. ", "So we continue to have our media and slider demands underpinned but there are continuing linearity issues. As Brian mentioned, we exited the quarter with some pent-up demand and so from a Seagate perspective we like you said are constrained on some of those components but we think that\u2019s a nice problem to have. ", "For the industry, I think that most folks have been aligning their capacity to customer demand similar to Seagate. However, I don\u2019t see any industry component or drive capacity constraints. I think it\u2019s again well managed but I can\u2019t see anything that would prevent either Seagate or the industry from delivering in March. ", "William D. Watkins", "Rich, the bottleneck is me. I\u2019m just not going to let a lot of capital go out there. We are very happy with the way the state of the industry is right now and we are going to be very, very conservative. We are watching the TAMs. We are growing with the TAMs and we think we have a nice business for the next three years if we manage our business smart. ", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "Nothing wrong with leaving a little on the table and making -- ", "William D. Watkins", "I don\u2019t mind leaving it. We\u2019re really happy with what we got here and we -- the ideal is to keep this going for the next three years. ", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay, and then just the last question is on the CE side -- sometimes you guys do actually break out CE, since the gross margins are so different between the various segments. Is there any color you can give on DVR versus gaming versus surveillance, just understanding how it breaks down?", "William D. Watkins", "Brian, do you want to try to take that?", "Brian S. Dexheimer", "I guess what I would tell you is this; that the -- of the 8.1 million units, over half of those were DVR. ", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay. All right. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Bailey with Goldman Sachs.", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you very much. Could you comment on where you are in meeting your JIT hub inventory targets and what you expect your internal inventory levels to be at the end of March?", "David A. Wickersham", "I would say that we are still a little bit short, particularly as I said earlier, in the higher capacity drives. Our overall finished goods level I would say is pretty close to our profile with the exception of what I think Rich was hinting at, is trying to use ocean modes of transportation rather than air. We are still short. Our customers would tell you that Seagate is short to them on the high capacity, near line, a lot of the drives that Brian talked about earlier, enterprise and so forth, so it\u2019s a nice problem but we are clearly under profile, working very, very hard to try to put more inventory in front of our OEMs because that\u2019s what they want us to do, that\u2019s what they need us to do. But it is clearly lower than they would like. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "And can you talk about pricing trends so far this quarter, or maybe since the middle of December?", "Brian S. Dexheimer", "Pricing since the middle of December has followed pretty much the pattern we expected, so at least at this point through almost now three weeks in January, we haven\u2019t seen anything unusual. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "And then finally, do you expect any restructuring charges in the March quarter?", "Charles C. Pope", "I\u2019m not currently aware of any but as we go through the quarter and evaluate things, we will look at that. ", "I would make one comment relative to pricing, the pricing comment that Brian made indicated that we haven\u2019t seen anything that we wouldn\u2019t expect. We would expect pricing in the March quarter to be somewhat more aggressive than it was in a quite benign December quarter and that\u2019s reflected in the plans that we have laid out. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "That\u2019s at the higher or lower end of normal declines?", "Charles C. Pope", "Kind of the midpoint. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wachovia.", "Aaron Rakers - Wachovia", "Thanks for taking my questions, a couple of them if I can; so I want to dig a little bit into the seasonal decline going into the March quarter. We\u2019ve heard you talk about capacity constraints and even the extent of you are not where you want to be yet in terms of the OEM JIT inventory level, so why guide a seasonal quarter? Is that erring on the side of conservatism and therefore a little bit of, you know, there is an upside potential here going into the quarter if the industry overall is typical seasonal for you guys?", "William D. Watkins", "You know, the problem we have is we\u2019ve been down this path numerous times and a lot of things look good in January and February and in March don\u2019t turn up like we all think. Obviously with a lot of the noise about recession, I think we are just trying to be prudent here in the face of what looks like to be good strong demand. Again, we did this last year and we watched the market fall apart on us. ", "I think we\u2019re just trying to do the right thing. It looks like a normal season. We\u2019re projecting it to be that way. ", "Aaron Rakers - Wachovia", "Fair enough. A follow-up, if I can  then, on the mobile business -- pretty sharp decline sequentially on a unit basis. Just curious in terms of you getting to parity with your competitors on the areal density curve. I think Western Digital with their 320-gig drive is somewhere 160 gigs per square inch. You guys at 125 -- when do you expect to be on par with them in the industry and maybe start to recapture some share in the notebook market?", "David A. Wickersham", "Let me first clarify in terms of -- it\u2019s not an areal density efficiency. That\u2019s why I pointed out that the same areal density on the 3.5-inch versus the 125 and 2.5-inch notebook that you described is in fact the one that Seagate was first to market in very, very high volume. I would say I think we\u2019ve been fairly forthright in defining that as somewhat of a -- when you have finite resources and you set your priorities and then change those roadmaps, it is a little bit disruptive. So that\u2019s was the issue on the 125 that Brian mentioned where we have eight OEMs, we\u2019re ramping that to volume. ", "To answer your specific question then, when do we follow-up on that to the 160 2.5-inch notebook capacity point, we will begin to ship CTU units this quarter and ramp that to production next quarter. ", "Aaron Rakers - Wachovia", "Thank you. And then final question, if I can, I heard you bring up a couple of times the idea within the OpEx line some one-time items around R&D efforts, as well as legal expenses. It would be very helpful if you could kind of quantify them or give us any color to what those were this quarter and looking into the March quarter. ", "David A. Wickersham", "Well, I don\u2019t know what color I could give you. Virtually all of the increase is associated with variable R&D spending when you are dealing with prototypes and prototype materials and other things, and then we do periodically have ebbs and flows in terms of legal costs and that really represents the entire increase in the below-the-line spending. ", "Aaron Rakers - Wachovia", "Okay, fair enough. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Neff with Bear Stearns.", "Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns", "I just wonder if you could talk about some of the time-to-market issues. Is there something structural that is leading to those sort of issues? And what are you doing to resolve that? And I guess the other side of that, is it a capacity issue or is it a design issue? Can you sort of go through -- you mentioned this last quarter and for a couple of quarters now. Can you talk about other processes you are dealing with?", "William D. Watkins", "Let me do it before Dave falls on this -- here\u2019s the problem, and we\u2019re big in this company on being honest about things and the issue really started, we came off of last year\u2019s March quarter -- and I\u2019ve got no one to blame but myself here -- is I went into full cut-back mode. We killed the 250 program. We felt that we had enough areal density leadership. We didn\u2019t need it so we killed it and we spent a lot of churn during that April/May/June really looking at a whole different plan and cutting back, thinking that we are going to be in a significant price war. ", "That did not materialize but the effect on the organization was pretty big. We put a lot of churn and we spent a lot of time doing things that were probably a waste of our time and we should have been much more focused on making sure that these products got out. ", "And so as July came about, Dave and team put a lot of resources into this and you can see in the extra spending in R&D, get the people there and get the thing caught up. ", "But at the end of the day, I mean, this is one of these issues where I\u2019ve got no one to blame but myself and how we were kind of addressing and the churn we created in this organization. ", "Again, it\u2019s not an areal density. We\u2019ve got -- there\u2019s areal density there. I mean, we\u2019ve been doing better than that in other products but we just kind of -- I pulled this thing back way too far and I\u2019m paying the consequences and really thankful to the team that they really got their act together and are catching up two notebook programs simultaneously. ", "And that\u2019s it. I mean, there\u2019s nothing more. And I mean, that\u2019s the upside because we think this is our problem, we know what it is, and we know how to fix it. ", "David A. Wickersham", "Let me just add, I think Bill just gave you his view of the background. It\u2019s very similar to what I was trying to describe earlier. As far as your question about go-forward, as I mentioned we will be clearly behind on the 160 per platter on the notebook and the 125 and the 160, I would view those as if you look at our history, some pretty significant exceptions to our time-to-market leadership across all market segments, I would say it\u2019s going to be competitive for the next platform on the notebook but we expect to be there and be time-to-market, if not very, very close. ", "We think the issue is behind us for the reasons Bill described but it is disruptive to try to add a product back on the roadmap within lead time, and so we are dealing with that and we are working hard to get back and retain our consistency on time-to-market leadership. ", "Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Brickman with UBS.", "Jeff Brickman - UBS", "Thanks, just a couple of questions -- could you just talk about the linearity you saw in the quarter? Did anything drop off at all or did it relatively stay constant throughout the new year?", "William D. Watkins", "I don\u2019t know. I got beat up all quarter along. I\u2019ll let Brian take the question. ", "Brian S. Dexheimer", "From a shipment standpoint, Jeff, it was probably one of the more linear quarters we have see, so demand was pretty steady throughout the quarter. ", "Jeff Brickman - UBS", "Okay, thanks, and then just recently we saw EMC come out with some of their new high-end product line utilizing some Flash drives. What\u2019s your thought on this? Do you think the sales could be material and would this possibly be the kind of product that maybe we could see an initial entry point for you guys when you decide, if you decide to head into Flash?", "William D. Watkins", "We believe -- obviously we\u2019ve talked about solid state. We do believe this is the application set that will be best served by solid state and it\u2019s obviously a focus of our engineering, and so again I think it just kind of prevails what we think is the right direction for us to go as a solid state. ", "Brian, do you want to add something?", "Brian S. Dexheimer", "I think it\u2019s helpful to note even how EMC positioned it, as another tier of storage. So I think to that extent, it\u2019s going to not be corrosive to the drive business that we see today -- certainly not in a significant way. At the price premium you pay on a cost-per-gigabyte level, even a high performance application like that one is going to be difficult to displace disks, so I think we are viewing it that way. I think we are viewing it as one of the first spots we might want to enter with something but I also think we are viewing it as something that\u2019s going to take a little time to come to fruition. ", "I don\u2019t expect any immediate impacts whatsoever. ", "Jeff Brickman - UBS", "Thanks, guys. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Merrill Lynch.", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Good afternoon. Bill, your comments about what happened last March were kind of interesting -- I\u2019m just curious, given what you did last year and obviously no one\u2019s expecting you to predict the economy, what kind of contingency plans would you expect to put into place this year if things got worse than you are thinking about right now?", "William D. Watkins", "Well, I\u2019d cut spending. You know, we\u2019d take a hard look at spending. We\u2019d look at programs and we\u2019d do a lot of the things that we did. ", "That\u2019s not our expectation. I think we overreacted to a price war, not a demand which is probably the mistake I made, thinking about it more in hindsight. But again, we\u2019re a pretty reactive group. I\u2019m a very reactive guy and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. That this turned out to be obviously a great year and we should have been more focused on that.", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "And then just as a follow-up on the DVR market, I was just curious -- how sensitive do you think that\u2019s going to turn out to be to any kind of economic pressures? It can tend to be lumpy, I guess. What are the service providers saying? What are your equipment customers saying about just production of DVRs at this point?", "Brian S. Dexheimer", "It\u2019s probably one of the areas I worry least about in any kind of economic downturn. I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to be a personal preference and people aren\u2019t necessarily going to see a purchase price impact of that as they walk down to the store, because as we all know, that comes in the form of subscription. ", "So to date, we haven\u2019t seen anything and frankly, that would be one of the last places I\u2019d expect to see something, if in fact we do see something and the economy turns south. ", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thanks so much. ", "William D. Watkins", "If you can\u2019t go out to dinner, you might as well stay at home and play on the Internet and watch content on TV. ", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Exactly. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. ", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "I have two, if I could; first for you, Bill, if you aggregated where you thought not only your distribution channels are but included your OEMs as well, where do you think that combined inventory level is and how much cushion, if you looked out through March? Is that in aggregate maybe a week of cushion? Or is there any way to aggregate those two to think about the levels of inventory that are currently out there?", "William D. Watkins", "I\u2019m going to let Charles take it. ", "Charles C. Pope", "Of the distribution channel, we would normally target somewhere between four and six weeks and probably more realistically in the five to six week range. And certainly on the PS side, which is 50% distribution, being at four weeks that would give us at least a week under what we would target and depending on where you fall in that range, a little more than that. ", "And as Dave indicated within the OEMs, the JIT hubs, we made some progress in terms of getting inventory in front of them. We would normally expect to have two weeks of inventory in the JIT hubs and then transit inventory. We don\u2019t believe we are at the two weeks yet. We believe that we are over the week, which is where we spent most of last quarter, just around a week. And so I would guess that we probably have somewhere between three quarters and a week aggregated that is represented in terms of very lean inventory levels in front of the OEMs and the distribution customers. ", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "And so obviously -- everybody on this call and it seems the investment world is convinced we\u2019re heading into recession, so isn\u2019t that the way to think about it, is if you guys are giving normal seasonal patterns, but if we get some recession, the cushion would be some of that inventory that is represented by both the channel as well as the OEM? Is that the way to think about it?", "David A. Wickersham", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a wrong way to look at it, Keith. I guess the way that we look at it in the company is that December is always the wrong quarter to exit with high inventory levels, either with OEMs or distribution because you are going into a seasonally weaker period and so we would always try to manage the business in such a way that we exited the December quarter with lean inventories. That gives you a little bit of cushion against additional seasonality or any other perturbations that you might see in the economy or market. ", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, well let me try one for Brian then, if I could -- Brian, a previous caller mentioned your sequential growth in mobile is obviously not that great. How would you expect the market to shake out here in the March quarter as it relates to mobile in terms of if you could just refresh on what you said about the TAM but more importantly in terms of share distribution of that TAM, given that you are now in the 250s?", "Brian S. Dexheimer", "Well, we\u2019d expect to do better. The thing I would point out about December is some of that was conscious as well in that with a finite amount of 2.5-inch capacity, we chose to split that maybe a little bit differently between some of our consumer electronics applications and pure notebook, so that was part of last quarter\u2019s story. Although the lack of the 250 was certainly part of that story as well, so net is I think in the March quarter, you\u2019d expect our share to come up a little bit with better participation and better volume availability. ", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Could you just refresh on what you think the TAM does sequentially?", "Brian S. Dexheimer", "We said that it\u2019s going to be down.

A few questions -- I want to get back to the blended ASP for the December quarter, just given the strength in mission critical enterprise, also the strength in TV DVRs and also the commentary around [inaudible] cap -- one would think that the blended ASP would nudge up as we\u2019ve seen in Decembers past. Is this more a function of some of your lower end CE taking a bigger piece of the pie now or what\u2019s going on there?", "David A. Wickersham", "There certainly is the impact of more gaming in the December quarter, Mark. And then I\u2019d have to go through and be a little more granular in terms of all of the mixes but it is purely a product mix issue and the top of mind would be the gaming participation in the December quarter. ", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan ", "And then you would expect gaming to fall off somewhat in the March quarter, perhaps giving you a little buffer there on the blended ASPs?", "David A. Wickersham", "A little buffer on the blended ASPs, but being offset by the fact that you are in a typically more aggressive pricing environment. ", "William D. Watkins", "We probably had a little bit higher percentage in the channel. I mean, there was obviously some big channel opportunities we probably missed in the quarter -- ", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan ", "Okay, so you could have some upside potentially as you go through the first half of this year, as you kind of right-size the [inaudible] potentially, as far as distribution?", "William D. Watkins", "Well, it\u2019s something we\u2019re obviously taking a look at, where the right mix should be. ", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan ", "Okay, and then maybe this is more for Brian -- any thoughts in terms of what Seagate is doing with respect to the industrial design of some of the FreeAgent retail drives versus your peers, just in terms of making it a little more sexy? Should we expect some more announcements down the road?", "Brian S. Dexheimer", "Well, that\u2019s one vector differentiation and yeah, I think the answer is yes, so expect to see some different things. We\u2019ve just announced a new form factor around the Black Armor product we announced at CES. There\u2019s a different industrial design around that. ", "But that is one vector of differentiation that we think is potentially important to a certain set of customers. I think there\u2019s others and we\u2019re concentrating on all of them. ", "", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan ", "And then just lastly, Charles, you talked earlier about the legal expenses in terms of the incremental for March -- is that related to the appeals ruling that went against Seagate recently regarding [inaudible] valve?", "Charles C. Pope", "No, it isn\u2019t specifically associated with that and there\u2019s probably a couple of things that I\u2019d like to comment on relative to the note that came out today. ", "First of all, there was a misleading quote in the note that indicated that the patent office had ruled against and had ruled that Seagate's patent was derived from an invention from [Kon] Vault. That is not accurate. They did not rule that Seagate's patent was derived from [Kon] Vault and Seagate's patent is still issued and effective. ", "And then secondly, I really don\u2019t understand the underlying motivation for even issuing a press release about this decision today. The patent office decision that was referred to in that release was issued on August 24, 2007 and the time for appealing that decision ended in late October 2007. And that ruling really has no impact on the underlying litigation between the two parties. ", "And so I am a little baffled about what the motivation was to even have a release there, so -- ", "", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan ", "Okay, so it\u2019s nothing we should really worry about then as far as our model? Thanks for that clarification. I appreciate it. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you. I was just curious in terms of the gross margin upside we saw this quarter. Obviously you had a much better enterprise quarter. You mentioned pricing as part of the gross margin upside but how much of the better enterprise helped your gross margin in the quarter?", "Charles C. Pope", "I think that for practical purposes, you need to consider all of the improved gross margin to be pricing based because offsetting the improvement in the mix of high capacity, we also had a greater mix of gaming. And so you start putting the mixes together and the benign environment was a large part of the margin improvement. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, so you are saying the gaming and enterprise maybe offset each other on the gross margin?", "Charles C. Pope", "Substantially. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay and just in terms of the guidance, and if I look at the midpoint of the revenue guidance, it looks like revenue down 5% and you also commented it sounds like units to be down 5%, which suggest to me flat ASPs. Can you maybe help us understand -- I mean, that seems a little bit aggressive in a March quarter. Can you maybe help us understand where you are getting that from?", "Charles C. Pope", "Sure. As we sat and looked at it, again the March quarter we would expect gaming and some of the other CE applications to be down at a greater rate than the 5%, giving us a little better mix in products. And then Dave\u2019s already mentioned the fact that the area that is in tightest demand is the high capacity ATA drives, and so we would expect to have a little richer mix of the high capacity ATA drives during the March quarter also. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, so better high capacity, and then also it sounds like enterprise down just a little bit, so is it also a better enterprise?", "Charles C. Pope", "Certainly of the total mix, it would be. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with Brean Murry.", "Mark S. Miller - Brean Murry & Co.", "Just a couple of questions here -- first of all, can you break out for us last quarter your percent of sales in terms of OEM, distribution, retail?", "Charles C. Pope", "Yeah. Give me one second -- the distribution -- the OEM was 67%, distribution was 33%. That 33 includes the retail. Retail was 7%. ", "Mark S. Miller - Brean Murry & Co.", "So 26 and 7, okay -- could you also, and I haven\u2019t asked you about this for a long time, but with the concerns about the U.S. economy, how are your sales breaking out internationally?", "Charles C. Pope", "North America is 29%, which was flat with the September quarter; Europe is 28%, which is up one percentage point from the September quarter; and Asia-Pacific was 43%, down 1% from the September quarter. ", "Mark S. Miller - Brean Murry & Co.", "And then just, you\u2019ve discussed this I think previously but it seems like to me you could have a better product mix next quarter or do you think the product mix will be the same with, you know, because of the gaming exclusion and maybe some of your shipments in the mobile space. ", "Charles C. Pope", "We currently have in our projections a little richer mix of products for the two reasons that you\u2019ve mentioned. ", "Mark S. Miller - Brean Murry & Co.", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tom Curlin with RBC.", "Tom Curlin - RBC Capital Markets ", "Actually, I\u2019m good. My questions have been answered. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum Capital.", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "On the consumer applications, Brian, in September -- when we gave September quarter we expected that TAM to be flat and it was up 16% sequentially. What specifically drove that? Was that gaming or DVR being much better than you expected then?", "Brian S. Dexheimer", "DVR was a little stronger than we thought. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "And then, how would you categorize the start in the first few weeks of January versus historical starts? Has it been in line with a typical March quarter -- has it been weaker, softer, stronger?", "Brian S. Dexheimer", "I would say for the first two-and-a-half weeks it\u2019s pretty much as we predicted, if not a little bit on the strong side. Remember, as we mentioned there were a couple of categories of product where we thought we left last quarter under-serving them, so I think a little bit of that is catching up. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "There\u2019s some current investor fear that some of the leading OEM customers may begin to cancel orders, given the weakening U.S. economy. Historically, when in a March quarter and then maybe even you could comment on a June quarter, if there were going to be OEM cancellations, when would you see them?", "Brian S. Dexheimer", "I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s any historical pattern to cancellations, particularly for the reasons that you described. If economic concerns are going to be the driver of that, I think it could be anywhere, any time. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "Okay, so you\u2019re not seeing that yet?", "William D. Watkins", "No, we\u2019re spending a lot of time talking to people and we are just not seeing it. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "Great, and then my last question on the competitive environment, would you categorize Hitachi and Samsung\u2019s remaining fairly rational? I\u2019ll start with that. ", "Brian S. Dexheimer", "We haven\u2019t seen anything. It\u2019s probably a little early to tell, but we haven\u2019t seen anything at least for this period of time that demonstrates behavior any different than we\u2019ve seen for the last three or four months. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "Okay, so focusing more on product and quality versus market share?", "Brian S. Dexheimer", "Yes. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "Great. That\u2019s it. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Shaw Wu with American Technology Research.", "Shaw Wu - American Technology Research", "I just have two quick questions; just on R&D, it looked like it grew a bit sequentially. I am just wondering if there is anything unusual there and should we expect those spending levels to remain at this rate?", "And then second, just on the margin profile of notebook drives, historically they\u2019ve been below the corporate average. I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s changed. And also, with your new notebooks, can that -- I mean, can the notebook business be above corporate margins? Thanks. ", "David A. Wickersham", "Let me take those. The R&D increases that you have seen, as we\u2019ve indicated represent variable R&D spending associated with prototype materials and other things as we kind of have a bunch of products here that are in the process of being launched and ramped, and so we would expect to see that plus actually a little bit of increase in the guidance that we gave relative to the R&D spending. And it\u2019s all associated with the variable R&D material requirement. ", "Relative to notebooks, let me start at a high level and just back up with a little bit of history -- if you go to the middle of 2006, notebook margins on average were in the mid to high 20s. During a year-and-a-half of very aggressive pricing, the margins dropped to the low teens. Since that period of time, they\u2019ve been slowly working their way back up towards the desktop type margins and recognize that desktop is below the corporate average. You have other markets that we serve that have higher margins than the average desktop. And notebook was still running below the desktop margins, even though it is improving quarter on quarter during the last several quarters. ", "We don\u2019t ever really see the margins getting up to the levels that they were in in 2006, which would have put them slightly above corporate average margins. We do see them, a path to them improving up to desktop type margins as we continue to go through successive generations of products. But probably never even really at the corporate average margins again. ", "Shaw Wu - American Technology Research", "Okay. Thanks for the color. ", "William D. Watkins", "We\u2019ll take one more call, Dustin. ", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of  Daniel Renouard with Robert Baird.", "Daniel Renouard - Robert Baird ", "Can you just give us some sort of guidance or some sort of sense of as you look at your CapEx budget, you\u2019ve had a few investments you\u2019ve been making this year into moving parts. If you were to look forward, what would be reasonable for investors to assume in terms of a maintenance CapEx or what you would need just in terms of a replacement cycle versus any capacity expansion? Could we assume something close to half if the economy falls into a recession? Or maybe just give us a framework for what would be reasonable if you really had to tighten your belt? What would be the minimum you might have to spend on a CapEx front? Thank you. ", "Charles C. Pope", "I hate going down that path because if you sit and look at most of the problems that have come up with competitors in this industry over time, it\u2019s been by not funding capital and R&D during difficult periods of times and we have always maintained the position that says we need to maintain a balance sheet and everything that will allow us to fund capital and R&D during any difficult periods of time. ", "We are turning over our entire capital base every four years and if you don\u2019t do it on a pretty steady basis, you get behind and can\u2019t catch up. And so I\u2019ve always said, and I don\u2019t mean to be flippant about this, that the $900 million that we are dealing with is really maintenance capital because while you are adding capacity, it is usually at new technology points and everything else that are going through there. ", "I know we have proven in the past that we can tighten up some and we have, but I think for planning purposes, thinking about it in the $900 million range and anything that is below that, if there was an ugly economy -- which again, we are not seeing -- would be gravy versus planning on it. ", "Daniel Renouard - Robert Baird ", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "William D. Watkins", "Thank you for joining us on the call today and again, we look forward to speaking to everyone next quarter. Travel safe. ", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

These forward looking statements are based on information available to the Seagate as of the date of this conference call but are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements.

", "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Bill Watkins, CEO. ", "Bill Watkins", "", "On the phone with me is Dave Wickersham, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Charles Pope, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Dexheimer, President of our newly formed Consumer Solutions Division.  ", "As announced earlier in the quarter we have established a consumer solutions division to focus solely on making Seagate a leader in the home storage market.  As we had stated at that time, we are very bullish about the long-term growth opportunity for home storage.  ", "Moving forward, Brian will be dedicating 100% of his efforts to achieving Seagate\u2019s aggressive goals in this area.  Next I\u2019d like to start this afternoon\u2019s call by sharing some perspective on the third quarter and providing some context on our fourth quarter outlook.  I will then turn the call over to Brian, Dave and finally Charles who will cover in more detail our market, operating and financial results for the third quarter.  ", "Our results for the third quarter continue to demonstrate that this is a great time to be a leader in the storage industry.  Seagate experienced solid year over year revenue and earnings growth.  ", "For the quarter, revenue increased 10% year over year to $3.1 billion, shipping approximately 8% more than we did in the third quarter of last year.  Net income grew 62% year over year to $344 million.  ", "In the first nine months of fiscal year 2008, we reported over $1 billion in net income.  During the back half of March there was a steep decline in the demand for personal storage products, followed by what we believe were strong incentives from our competitors.  ", "These developments within the context of our ongoing commitment to maintaining financial discipline resulted in revenues below our expectations.  As I mentioned to you in January, our model is a powerful generator of cash which we have increasingly returned to our stock shareholders.  ", "I am pleased to report that the free cash flow for the quarter was approximately $390 million, bringing our nine-month fiscal period free cash total to approximately $1.5 billion.  Most recently the Board\u2019s commitment to returning value to the shareholders was demonstrated in February by an increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.10 per share to $0.12 per share and an additional authorization to repurchase up to $2.5 billion in outstanding common shares over the next two years.  ", "With that, let me turn the call over to Brian.", "Brian Dexheimer", "", "As we have previously outlined in our mid-quarter update, we expected March to be a key month in determining the outcome for the quarter.  While we anticipated typically strong industry demand for the month of March, in fact we experienced an unexpected drop in demand for 3.5-inch ATA products in the last couple of weeks.  ", "As a result, while year over year industry growth for the quarter was nearly 9%, the month of March year over year comparisons in the space were actually flat.  We believe market concerns with macro-economic pressures contributed to the change in hard drive demand as it was concentrated mostly in the US channel in retail markets.  ", "The impact of these concerns ultimately led to our revenue number coming in below our expectations.  That said, year over year comparisons confirmed growth trends for digital storage remained strong as the digital universe continues to expand.  We believe the overall industry total available market for the March quarter was approximately 131 million units, up 16% year over year but down 9% quarter-over-quarter, which was lower than our previous expectations.  Seagate shipped 43 million units in the quarter, up 8% year over year.  ", "We believe that this less than market growth rate is specifically driven by our performance in 2.5-inch ATA products which I\u2019ll address later.  Overall demand visibility for the quarter and the June quarter is limited as our customers continued to assess the impact the current economy will have on their own businesses.  ", "Consequently we expected overall TAM to be down 5% quarter over quarter to 120 to 125 million units.  This represents 8-12% year over year growth.  In the mission critical enterprise space, the TAM in the March quarter was within our expectations and remained strong at approximately 8.3 million units, representing 15% year on year growth.  ", "Seagate grew its leadership position in this market with shipments of 5.3 million units during the quarter.  Seagate\u2019s small form factor enterprise drives continued to be in high demand as data centers look to reduce energy consumption without compromising capacity or performance.  Seagate products are at the forefront of this growing trend.  During the March quarter 1.8 million or 34% of Seagate\u2019s enterprise drive shipments were 2.5-inch form factor.  ", "As we have mentioned the last few quarters, the build out of web 2.0 data centers and replacement of tape solutions with drive-to-drive backup solutions are driving growth for high capacity enterprise class SATA products.  ", "We saw continued growth for these applications in the March quarter with year on year growth doubling as Seagate increased its leadership position.  Looking forward to the June quarter, we expect the overall enterprise demand to be slightly down seasonally.  ", "The TAM in the desktop compute market decreased 9% sequentially to approximately 62 million units.  Seagate shipped an industry leading 27 million units during the quarter.  This market continued to trend toward higher capacity drives during the March quarter.  Our shipments also moved in this direction with the sales of 1 terabit barracuda drives reaching nearly 0.5 million units during the quarter.  ", "As a result, Seagate continued to drive technology leadership in this space with a higher than average share representation in products greater than 320 gigabits.  For the June quarter we expect the desktop compute TAM to be seasonally down.  And consumer electronics applications, we believe the industry TAM was about 18 million units, down 23% sequentially.  ", "The seasonal decline in this market was driven by expected lower shipments in personal media players and gaming applications.  Seagate maintained its leadership position by shipping 5.1 million units, down sequentially primarily as the result of seasonal demand for gaming drives.  ", "DDR penetration continued globally with industry TAM growing 25% year on year.  In the DDR our pipeline HD series of products began qualification during the quarter and we have received excellent customer feedback regarding market leading performance attributes important to this application.  We expect the CE market will continue to experience lower seasonal demand in the June quarter.  With regards to the mobile compute market, the TAM grew 41% year over year to 42 million units.  ", "Seagate shipped 5.5 million units into this market during the quarter, an increase of 18% year on year.  As I stated earlier, 2.5-inch products are the single driver of our current gap to market growth rate.  We\u2019re not pleased with our performance or position in this market and are very focused on improving our results in all 2.5-inch products during the calendar year.  ", "During the March quarter we moved forward in this direction with the ramp to full volume of our 250-gigabit product.  In addition, we\u2019ve begun shipments of qualification units of our 320-gigabit product and expect volume production to commence during the June quarter.  ", "We have successfully engaged customers in the notebook and retail markets for these product offerings and expect to begin to see positive results from our efforts in the June quarter.  We expect the June quarter for the mobile compute market to exhibit normal seasonality and be down from the March quarter.  ", "In our branded solutions business, our focus in the March quarter was on improving our supply chain and go to market execution.  We were successful in fulfilling all partner supply requirements through the quarter and introducing important new capacity points in both brands to position for more complete market participation going forward.  ", "In addition, we have realigned marketing programs with key channel partners in North America during the quarter to better position our product offerings and improve demand generation.  We believe all these activities will improve short-term execution beginning in the June quarter.  As we look forward we remain optimistic about the opportunity for storage in the home and we will continue to focus on improving execution innovation across our offerings.  ", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Dave to provide an update on our operations.", "Dave Wickersham", "", "Thanks Brian.  Three topics I would like to cover with you today, inventory, capital and new products.  Seagate\u2019s inventory increased $243 million quarter-over-quarter from $830 million to $1.07 billion and inventory turns were 8.5 in the March quarter.  ", "The softening in demand we experienced for 3.5-inch ATA products during the last couple weeks of the quarter was the primary cause of reduced inventory turns as finished goods increased $194 million.  Raw materials also increased by $54 million resulting from strategic purchases of external components.  ", "Although we have since adjusted our bill plans to consume excess finished goods this quarter, we plan to maintain some finished goods at the end of June to decrease freight costs by utilizing ocean shipments.  Consequently, we expect inventory turns to be approximately nine for the June quarter.  ", "In regards to fiscal 2008 capital investment, there is no change to the outlook of approximately $900 million.  As you know a large portion of our fiscal 2008 capital investment is for the expansion of our fixed media and substrate factories in Asia.  ", "Looking out to fiscal 2009, we expect the mix of our capital investment to move back to the traditional split of approximately one-third for media, one-third for heads and one-third for drive assembly and test.  ", "As discussed in previous calls, we are committed to ensuring our manufacturing capacity aligns with customer demand and will continue to manage our capital investments accordingly.  We are currently evaluating our requirements for the seasonal growth in the September and December quarters and will finalize our fiscal 2009 plan this quarter and will update you in July regarding our fiscal 2009 capital investments.  ", "At this point in time we anticipate a modest increase in our capital investment year over year.  In the notebook market we continued to make progress qualifying and ramping the new high capacity products.  As this market moves rapidly to higher capacity points, our execution in ramping notebook new products is critical to our success.  As planned the 250-gigabit product shipped in volume during the March quarter.  Additionally we began the initial shipments of the 320-gigabit product in the March quarter and we expect to ramp this product to volume throughout the June quarter.  ", "For the desktop market, our new products continued to experience broad customer adoption.  We were the leader in bringing to market the 250-gigabit per disk products and this products family continues to be very cost effective.  Demand for our 1-terabit product was strong as its 7200-RPM performance differentiated it from competitive offerings.  And in the March quarter we began volume shipment of our 320-gigabit per disk ATA product family.  ", "The success we have had in the mission critical enterprise market is directly related to our ability to deliver leading product technology capacity form factor performance and interface to our customers over a sustained period of time.  Customers continue to drive changes in this market as the mix continues to evolve to 3.5-inch 15,000-RPM products, 2.5-inch 10K RPM products and SAS interfaces.  To strengthen our leadership position we recently brought to market a number of product offerings.  ", "First qualification of our 15,000 RPM 450 gigabit product are in progress and volume is expected to ramp in the June quarter.  Secondly, last week we announced the first self-encrypting drive which offers the best solution for protecting data at rest.  Hard drives where sensitive information are being decommissioned and removed from the data center on a daily basis and this technology enables data center managers to rest assured the data is secure and not accessible to unauthorized users.  ", "And lastly we announced the shipment of the industry\u2019s first 1-terabit product with a SAS interface.  The SAS interface provides Seagate\u2019s customers with enhanced data pass integrity, error detection and correction, better performance and a simpler integration process.  ", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Charles.", "Charles Pope", "", "You will find the company\u2019s press release, 8-K and additional financial information related to Seagate\u2019s financial performance along with a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results and other supplemental information in the investor relations section of Seagate\u2019s website at Seagate.com.  ", "For the March quarter Seagate reported revenue of $3.1 billion and unit shipments of approximately 43 million which reflect year over year growth of 10% and 8% respectively.  ", "In the final two weeks of the March quarter, demand for 3.5-inch ATA products weakened particularly in the distribution channel.  Seagate stayed focused on maintaining supply demand balance in the distribution channel and ended the quarter with 4.4 weeks of inventory on hand in the channel using a four week average.  ", "Our focus continues to be optimizing profitability and cash flow without retreating on our market share.  GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share for the March quarter are $344 million and $0.65 respectively.  ", "Included in the GAAP results are approximately $29 million of purchased intangibles amortization and other charges associated with recently completed acquisitions as well as a net gain from asset sales of $4 million.  Without these items and the associated tax effects, non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share was $369 million and $0.70 respectively.  ", "Included in both the GAAP and non-GAAP results is approximately $20 million of restructuring and other non-operating charges which reduced diluted earnings per share by about $0.04.  For the first nine months of fiscal 2008, we reported revenue of $9.8 billion, up 14% year over year.  ", "Net income and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis are up in excess of 9% year over year.  Cash generation continues to be strong with cash provided by operations of $2.1 billion and free cash flow defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures of $1.5 billion.  ", "During the course of fiscal 2008, Seagate has returned approximately $1.44 billion of cash to its shareholders consisting of approximately $159 million through quarterly dividends and approximately $1.28 billion of share repurchases.  GAAP gross margin for the March quarter was 26.3%, excluding approximately $12 million of acquisition related costs, non-GAAP gross margin was 26.7%.  ", "Gross margin increased approximately 30 basis points from the prior quarter due primarily to a favorable mix of products within specific markets and across markets.  GAAP R&D and SG&A costs were $418 million for the March quarter.  ", "Excluding costs related to recent acquisitions, non-GAAP expenses were $416 million, lower than what we had expected by about $20 million due mainly to lower compensation related costs primarily from slower than planned hiring and favorable depreciation expense due to the push out of capital investments.  Slide 6 has the detail for the adjustments made to GAAP R&D and SG&A for the March quarter.  ", "Cash flow from operations was $665 million for the March quarter while free cash flow was $390 million.  Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities ended the quarter at $1.28 billion, down $467 million from the previous quarter.  ", "During the March quarter, Seagate returned approximately $836 million of cash to its shareholders consisting of approximately $52 million of the quarterly dividend and $784 million of share repurchase.  Capital investment in the March quarter was $275 million and for the first nine months totaled $637 million.  ", "As Dave previously indicated, we continue to plan for approximately $900 million of capital investment for fiscal 2008.  Depreciation and amortization for the March quarter was $211 million, down slightly from the prior quarter.  Amortization of purchased intangibles totaled approximately $26 million.  During the March quarter the company took delivery of 36 million shares related to its share repurchase plan with an average price of $21.79.  ", "This was previously disclosed on March 4.  We put in place a 10B51 plan that allows the company to repurchase shares during periods it would normally be locked out of the market.  Utilizing this plan, as of April 14, the company has repurchases approximately 9.1 million shares at an average share price of $21.36.  The company has authorization to purchase approximately $2 billion of additional shares under the current stock repurchase program.  ", "Now I\u2019ll provide some further detail on our outlook for the June quarter.  As Brian mentioned, visibility into the June quarter is limited as macro-economic situation which impacted 3.5-inch ATA demand at the end of the March quarter, this makes providing an outlook all the more difficult.  With that said, for the June quarter we are expecting industry unit demand to fall below normal seasonal patterns which are typically down around 5%.  Like for like price declines are typically more aggressive in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter.  ", "We expect this to hold true and have modeled price declines to be near the upper end of the 4% to 7% range.  Consequently, Seagate expects revenue to be in the range of $2.85 billion to $3 billion.  GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be $0.37 to $0.41 and includes approximately $21 million of purchased intangible amortization and other charges associated with the recently completed acquisitions.

So if you want to look at it from that perspective we only really participated during the full quarter in about 70-75% of the TAM.", "Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "And then in terms of 2008 as a whole, do you still expect the, well I guess what is your industry expectation for units and then do you think that you\u2019ll then have to exceed that level to regain share on the notebooks and are you putting in place then the capacity there Dave for that type of a level or should we just assume that you\u2019ll gain share really in 09?", "Dave Wickersham", "", "First on notebooks specifically as Brian mentioned in his commentary, we have worked with our OEMs on the ramps last quarter, the 250 gig products.  So on that one we do in fact think that we will have some modest opportunity as we look into the June quarter.  So we expect to see that.  And I think as Charles indicated earlier, another area is our plan is to pretty much hold our share.  So that\u2019s what we factored into both our capacity plans now and we\u2019re not talking pretty much about FY09 at this point in time.  But you could assume that similar thought process as we look at FY09.", "Operator", "", "And your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Can you talk a little more about just this visibility issue in terms of looking out to June Charles or Bill, you mentioned the macro had an impact on the 3.5 inch ATA demand, just kind of curious how much of that really is macro versus market share?  Because if it really is a macro wouldn\u2019t most of your segments have exhibited some sort of southern decline or V shaped decline?", "Brian Dexheimer", "", "Mark, here\u2019s my explanation for it, because in contrast we haven\u2019t seen the enterprise market for instance slow down and we\u2019ve been watchful for several months on that because there\u2019s a traditional wisdom that might say that that would be the first place you\u2019d see a macro-economic effect.  ", "The reality is that it appears the data center storage is still in the [parado] of data center expenses still relatively high and I think there\u2019s some third party information out there that would support that.  So we\u2019re not seeing it there, where we\u2019re seeing it is in places that seem to be a little more transient in terms of purchases and I would put the client in that space, so either the notebook or the desktop.  ", "And so I think that\u2019s the place where certainly commercial organizations and arguably consumers have more flexibility on delaying or eliminating purchases because those tend to be a little bit more transient in terms of purchase behavior.  And in fact that\u2019s exactly where we saw the last couple weeks of March end up where we saw those transient kinds of products freeze up to some degree and we really saw that in the markets that were in the channels that were more transactional, i.e. retail and US distribution.  ", "So I think all that kind of fits together, it makes sense to me why you\u2019d see it there and maybe not in some other places.  Now the real question I think as we go forward and this relates to visibility, is adapting into spread both regionally and then up the food chain if you will with the less transient types of items.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "You talked about the opportunity in the 250-gigabit notebook going forward, just wanted to get a sense in terms of, sounds like the products there; the yields are there, what about the OEM reception?  Is there a place for Seagate early on or do you have to wait until the market grows, to get a seat, how should we think about the OEMs dolling out that business versus some of your peers?", "Dave Wickersham", "", "As I indicated to Rich\u2019s question earlier, I think as far as the 250 capacity points, mentioned the qualifications are largely complete, that\u2019s behind us and the modest share growth that I talked to is underpinned and our customers like Seagate, the value we bring, so admittedly we were late to the party but we are very confident, we have great relationships and great product breadth and we\u2019re bringing value to those customers.

And how that translates is as stated we think that like price erosions towards the higher end of the typical range, it\u2019s not at 7% but it\u2019s pushing towards that range and we are often times able to offset the price erosion by either reduced product costs as we introduce new products or by mixing to higher performance higher capacity products.  That offset this quarter is only between 1.5-2% and so we are seeing some margin compression during the June quarter as a result of the mix of product that we are shipping and that\u2019s both mix within a given market that we serve and then to a certain extent also across the market.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of David Bailey - Goldman Sachs.", "David Bailey \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I was just trying to get a comment on the downturn that happened in the last two weeks of March.

As I mentioned before we continue to offer a number of new products and features that our customers need and we\u2019re confident that we can attain share given our current position.", "Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "And then with the plans to ocean ship more product in June would you expect to see any difference in the timing of the September quarter demand spike?", "Dave Wickersham", "", "No, I mean it\u2019s the same increase in seasonality you know July will be strong, we want to use that to our advantage actually to position product in front of that July increase as well as get the oceans savings but no, nothing abnormal this September quarter that we\u2019ve seen in the past.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Mansky - Citi.", "Paul Mansky \u2013 Citigroup", "Just as we kind of look in the back half of the year, obviously there\u2019s a pretty big as it relates to some of your comments around how you\u2019re balancing out the capital additions, clearly there\u2019s a pretty big holiday build tied up in September.  As we sit here today, how are you approaching that, what\u2019s your expectations or how are you approaching that consumer build?", "Dave Wickersham", "", "What we\u2019re seeing is a 10-15% year over year in the September build and what we will do is we will position some inventory as indicated before in advance of that and as I mentioned from a capital perspective we\u2019ll make some of those investments in the June quarter.  But we\u2019re going to continue to look very closely at the linearity, more at the peak in December and the peak in September.  ", "Last year I should say we were extremely conservative coming into this, we\u2019re going to continue to be very mindful of our capital investments and not invest any dollar before we need to.  So frankly I don\u2019t see approaching this September December seasonality and increase in requirements much different than last year.  ", "So again we\u2019re being very mindful, I think we\u2019ve got the lead times relationships the processes in place to defer capital investment as long as possible.

We\u2019d expect September to be the same or better and December and so again we\u2019re kind of planning that way and we see all indications from our customers that would support that.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal.", "Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "To follow up on the notebooks, as you think about the 25% of your TAM that you can now fulfill, more specifically do you have to use price to garner the attention of the OEMs or how is that share shift going to unfold do you think?", "Dave Wickersham", "", "As I said, the short answer is no, we won\u2019t do it with price we\u2019ll do it with the products and the total package that we bring to our OEMs and our customers who are used to using Seagate\u2019s [asset] portfolio.  So I would say the disadvantage we have is as Brian indicated we were locked out of 20-25% of the TAM and so that doesn\u2019t mean that we didn\u2019t continue to work with those customers as we normally do on the balance of the Tam that we did have access to.  ", "So I don\u2019t see us being disadvantaged.  The key of course is that we hit the [qual slots].

We will be qualifying it and have volume shipments in the June quarter but we\u2019re probably still only gaining access to half of that 20-25% or something in the June quarter.", "Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "The second question then is, on you mentioned some pricing activity by your competitors towards the end of the quarter.  Is there a way that you can characterize, that always sends a shiver through investors, is there a way that you can characterize how the behavior may have changed particularly with some of your competitors who have been acting well in terms of the environment for the last few quarters?", "Bill Watkins", "", "I don\u2019t know how to answer.  I mean again I think this March was a little bit like last year\u2019s March.  I mean sort of the same things happened a year ago.

I mean we have developed a lot of technologies in these application spaces and we\u2019re going to protect it.  And we will protect it.

And I guess the other part of that, you know for a lot of us this is d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, you know the industry has sort of over producing again, why should we take a different look?", "Charles Pope", "", "I don\u2019t think we were being overly optimistic, we\u2019re showing the typical seasonal down of 5% in units quarter over quarter and we\u2019re showing and forecasting pricing at the high end of what the typical pricing curve is during a June quarter and typically in a June quarter you have more capacity than there is demand during that period of time.  So by going the full distance on what the seasonal decline is and what the pricing environment would normally yield I think we\u2019re trying to recognize the environment that we\u2019re in.", "Bill Watkins", "Yes, we\u2019re talking about a quarter that\u2019s arguably if we\u2019re in a recession we made $0.70 a share on 10% plus growth here and so I really disagree with the same old same.  I mean are there the same characteristics industry yeah, did we have big Christmases and big Septembers and we\u2019ve got a cycle within the industry?  Yes.  But that\u2019s for sure and how we manage that\u2019s critical.  But we\u2019re all managing that to a much higher level of profitability than the industry ever came close to in the 90\u2019s.

Some of the same cycles and we have some of the same, we\u2019ve got to maintain and we\u2019ve got to manage this correctly and I think you saw how we acted, we kept gross margins up and we made $0.70 a share and again three or four years ago you\u2019d be looking at things we\u2019re losing money.  And so again I think the industry is doing a whole lot better in managing their way through these cycles.", "Charles Pope", "", "Just to punctuate what Bill has said if you look at the operating income that we\u2019ve guided to for the fourth quarter and compare it to the fourth quarter last year that would represent a year over year increase in excess of 20%.", "Andrew Neff \u2013 Bear Stearns", "That\u2019s my concern Charles is that you know the pricing just began to get bad you said and there\u2019s still a lot of those inventories are high out there, your inventories are high, I mean the highest sequential [inaudible] I\u2019ve seen in a long time.  I guess are you going to ramp back on production, what are you going to do to address that?", "Charles Pope", "Dave addressed that in his comments indicating that we would adjust our production that we expected our turns in the June quarter to end at approximately 9 and the reason that he discussed putting drives on the ocean was twofold, one for freight savings given the cost of fuels and everything today but then also to allow us to better balance capital investment because of being able to defer some things that would normally go in during September and December for the peaks.  And so you know I think in forecasting a conservative June forecast and having that conservative forecast still representing in excess of a 20% year over year growth on operating earnings shows a pretty mature level of operations associated with it.", "Operator", "", "And your next question comes from the line of Shaw Wu - American Technologies.", "Shaw Wu \u2013 American Technology Research", "Charles, just on you didn\u2019t provide explicit gross margin guidance but kind of running the assumptions that you gave, I get gross margin around 23%.

Is pricing a big factor?  Thanks.", "Charles Pope", "I suspect you were listening to the Intel call and got on a little late Shaw.  The like for like pricing that we have built into the forecast on the June quarter is to the high end of the 4% to 7% decline.  We are typically able to offset a fair amount of that with increased mixes in capacity or performance drives, higher capacity higher performance.

So I was just trying to understand that better.  I mean is pricing, you know you just talked about pricing now but it sounds like it\u2019s a pretty, sounds like that\u2019s a big component.", "Charles Pope", "I would have to go back and look at last year and I haven\u2019t refreshed up my head but I suspect the pricing is somewhere in the neighborhood of 150-200 basis points more aggressive this year than it was during the same period last year.", "Charles Pope", "", "And Shaw, just as a comment, if you go back and look at March quarter, because of the high capacity pricing that occurred in the March quarter, we actually settled out at a much lower level in the March quarter than we would have normally so I think that the decline or the margin compression from March to June is probably a little bit of an aberration last year versus what the norm is.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller - Brean Murray.", "Mark Miller \u2013 Brean Murray, Carret & Co.", "First it appeared to us that especially later in the quarter that there was a lot of inventory build in the mid capacity 500-gigs, 3.5-inch market, a lot of these drives that appeared to us appeared to be 3-platter designs, I\u2019m just wondering if these had been 2-platter type configurations, would you have seen less drop in demand?

These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the company\u2019s views as of any subsequent date and Seagate undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made. ", "I would now like to turn the conference call over to our host, Mr. Bill Watkins, CEO. Please go ahead. ", "William D. Watkins", "Thank you, Wesley. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the phone with me are Dave Wickersham, our President and Chief Operating Office; Charles Pope, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kurt Richards, our Executive Vice President of Sales and Customer Service. Brian Dexheimer, our President of Consumer Solutions, and Pat O\u2019Malley, our income CFO, are also available to answer questions during the Q&A session. ", "I\u2019d like to start this afternoon\u2019s call by sharing some perspective on the fourth quarter and the fiscal year we just completed, and provide some comments on our outlook for the first quarter and the remainder of fiscal year 2009. I will then turn the call over to Kurt, Dave, and finally Charles, who will cover in our detail our market operating and financial results for the quarter and the year. ", "In fiscal year 2008, we set new records for units shipped and revenue, which were up 15% and 12% respectively over fiscal year 2007. We delivered equally strong results in net income, which totaled $1.3 billion, up significantly over last year. Specific to the June quarter, Seagate's market leading position remained unchanged in the enterprise and desktop markets. We expanded our leadership share position in the consumer electronics market and grew share in the notebook and retail markets. And while we are certainly pleased with that kind of growth and are gratified to see the demand trends for storage continue to accelerate, we believe and we can and should be doing much better at turning an abundance of opportunity into better performance and better return for our shareholders. ", "To that end, we focused considerable effort over the past few quarters, successfully getting our product execution back on track, particularly in the notebook arena, where we have lost some of the first mover advantage we have historically enjoyed. We are gaining traction now with a new product lineup that will serve all markets, including the notebook market, and we expect to see significant improvement in Seagate's performance in the December quarter and continue that throughout the remainder of fiscal year 2009. ", "In addition to a relentless focus on product execution, we are taking action to align our cost structure with the current competitive environment, ensuring that we are investing in the right areas, operating as efficiently as possible, and eliminating redundancies. Dave and Charles will provide more details about these efforts later in the call. ", "Before I turn the call over to Kurt, I want to reiterate what I see as an important opportunity in our retail segment -- the business represents a significant revenue opportunity for Seagate and we are determined to be a leader in this space. We\u2019ve been essentially flat from Q4 of last year and that\u2019s not the kind of performance I see going forward. Our newly formed consumer solutions division is focused on improved operational execution and launching new products over the next few quarters, which I believe will lead to additional growth. ", "Although the residual effects of our previously mis-execution in the notebook in the near line markets will be reflected in the results of the September quarter, and the macroeconomic climate does cause some current uncertainty, we believe that our performance is largely dependent on our factors within our control. We have made strides in reclaiming our product leadership. We have confidence in our plan and we believe that we will grow revenue and improve earnings throughout the remainder of fiscal year 2009. ", "With that, let me turn the call over to Kurt. ", "Kurt Richards", "Thanks, Bill. As Bill mentioned, on the whole we expect the storage industry to continue its long-term growth profile. All macro trends from the industry, including creation, distribution, and consumption of digital content are driving significant unit demand. As a result, we believe the industry total available market, or TAM, grew by 83 million units during the fiscal year to approximately 541 million units. ", "Nearing fiscal 2009, we see a few near-term challenges but believe the industry will again experience solid year-over-year unit growth. Specific to June quarter, we believe the overall industry TAM was approximately 131 million units, up 18% year over year and down only 1% for the quarter, which was better than our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. ", "During the quarter, Seagate shipped 43 million units, up 10% year over year. We expect the overall TAM for the September quarter to be up approximately 18% quarter over quarter to approximately 154 million units. This represents a 15% year-over-year growth. ", "Now I\u2019d like to give some details on the individual markets. In the mission critical enterprise space, the TAM in the June quarter remained strong at approximately 8.3 million units, representing 20% year-on-year growth. Seagate retained its share leadership position in this space as shipments grew 21% year over year to 5.2 million. For the fiscal year, Seagate shipped over 20 million enterprise drivers, more than 60% of overall enterprise drives shipped. ", "Demand remains strong for high capacity enterprise class SATA products. While we maintained our leadership position in this application in the June quarter, we believe additional qualifications in the coming quarter with our new Barracuda ES products will provide additional opportunities in this space. ", "Looking forward to the September quarter, we expect the overall enterprise demand to be flat to slightly up seasonally. ", "The TAM on the desktop compute market for the June quarter was approximately 59 million units. Seagate also retained its share leadership position in this market, shipping an industry leading 25.4 million units during the quarter, representing better than a market growth of 6% year over year.  ", "For the September quarter, we expect the desktop compute TAM to be seasonally up. ", "In the consumer electronics applications, we believe the industry TAM was approximately 18 million units. Sequentially, Seagate extended its share leadership position in this space as shipments grew 11% to 5.7 million units. In particular, we saw in-quarter strength from several DVR customers who increased volume requirements in quarter. ", "We remain confident that our line of pipeline HD products designed specifically for video dependent applications will continue to set the standard for customers expectations in this space moving forward. We begin qualifications at several OEMs during this quarter for this new line of products. ", "We expect the CE market will experience higher seasonal demand in the September quarter. ", "With regard to the mobile market, the overall TAM grew 48% year over year to approximately 46 million units. We grew share sequentially by a few percentage points as Seagate shipments reached 6.9 million units, an increase of 12% year-on-year. Fiscal year shipments for Seagate grew at 37% to 26.7 million units. ", "We expect the September for mobile compute market to exhibit normal seasonality and be up from the June quarter. ", "In our branded products business, we continue to make progress. We believe industry sell-through in this market was seasonally lower, as expected. Largely based on continued supply chain performance and improved product mix, we believe Seagate gained share sequentially. Specifically, Seagate's percentage of shipments and share increased in the 2.5-inch products of 250 and greater, as well as 3.5-inch products 750 and greater. ", "We remain focused on continued operational improvements and new product launches over the next few quarters, which will lead to improved results in this fast-growing global market. ", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Dave to provide some updates on operations. ", "David A. Wickersham", "Thanks, Kurt. I will cover four topics with you today; the recently announced closing of our media operations in Milpitas, California, inventory, capital, and new products. ", "Last week, Seagate announced additional restructuring charges related to the ongoing realignment of our media operations. The closing of the Milpitas, California media operation will be completed by early October of this year. Consolidating our media production operation provides cost reduction opportunities in addition to inventory and transit time reduction. ", "The savings expected from the closing of the Milpitas media operation is expected to be approximately $42 million annually. In addition, our previously announced closure of our Limavady substrate factory is on schedule and will be completed by October of this year. This is expected to result in annual savings of approximately $30 million. ", "As Bill mentioned, we are focused on more effectively aligning our cost structure and these are two of the many actions we will take over the next year to improve our financial results. ", "In the June quarter, we made progress towards properly aligning Seagate's inventory. Our inventory decreased $128 million quarter over quarter from $1.073 billion to $945 million, while inventory turns improved from 8.5 in March to 9.3 turns in June. ", "A decrease in finished goods of $130 million accounted for virtually all of the reduction quarter over quarter. We remain focused on the requirement to improve our inventory turns while we continue to utilize ocean shipments to help offset the increase in fuel costs. Consequently, we expect to again improve inventory turns modestly to approximately 10 in the September quarter. ", "Fiscal 2008 capital investment came in at $930 million. Looking ahead to fiscal 2009, and as discussed in previous calls, we are committed to ensuring our manufacturing capacity aligns with customer demand and will continue to manage our capital investments in this manner. ", "Accordingly, the current outlook for fiscal year 2009 capital investment is approximately $1 billion. ", "Last quarter I mentioned the execution of product transitions to new, higher aereal", " density products was critical to our success. Recovering and sustaining time-to-market leadership remains a top priority. We have taken appropriate steps to improve our results and are confident in our ability to improve our new product execution. ", "In the enterprise segment, we remain focused on maintaining our product and technology leadership. We continue to see the mix of mission critical enterprise products in the market continue to evolve to 3.5-inch 15K RPM products, 2.5-inch 10K RPM products, and SAS interfaces. This aligns well to our product roadmap and storage trends such as server virtualization and ISCSI SANs. Our 15K RPM 450-gigabyte product ramp started in the June quarter and we have three major OEMs qualified. We expect to have the vast majority of the major OEM qualifications completed by the end of September. ", "To further strengthen our position in the enterprise market, last quarter we announced the shipment of the industry\u2019s first 1-terabyte product with SAS interface. Customer interest in this product continues to grow and we have completed two key OEM qualifications and expect to complete two additional qualifications by the end of September. ", "In the personal compute market, we continue to gain traction with new products, including the industry\u2019s first 1.5-terabyte desktop product and half-terabyte notebook drives, announced last week. ", "For the notebook market, the ramp of the 250-gig notebook drive has been completed and our participation in the 250-gigabyte capacity point in the June quarter was reflective of our overall notebook market share. ", "Qualification of our 320-gigabyte notebook product is in process, with some of the early movers already completed. For example, we announced during the quarter that we were shipping to a major OEM the industry\u2019s first 7200 RPM 320-gigabyte notebook drive. The notebook market is expected to be highly competitive during the balance of calendar 2008, as most HDD suppliers are shipping comparable products. ", "Our checks indicate that we are making progress restoring our time to market competitiveness in the notebook market and we expect to begin volume shipments of our 5400 and 7200 RPM 500-gigabyte notebook drives in the December quarter. So while we have made progress, we will remain relentlessly focused on improving product execution. ", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Charles. ", "Charles C. Pope", "Thanks, Dave. You will find the company\u2019s press release, 8-K, and additional financial information related to Seagate's financial performance, along with a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results and other supplemental information in the investor relations section of Seagate's website at Seagate.com. I will cover the financial results for the quarter and the outlook for the September quarter. Pat O\u2019Malley, who will be taking over the CFO role next month, is also present and will participate in the Q&A session. ", "For the June quarter, Seagate reported revenue of $2.9 billion and unit shipments of approximately 43 million, which reflect year-over-year growth of 6% and 10% respectively. Seagate stayed focused on maintaining supply/demand balance by reducing its own finished goods inventory by 21% and ending with 4.2 weeks of inventory on hand in the distribution channel for 3.5-inch ATA drives calculated using a four-week average of shipments out. ", "GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share for the June quarter are $160 million and $0.32 respectively. Included in the GAAP results are approximately $23 million of purchased intangibles amortization and other charges associated with recently completed acquisitions. Without these items and the associated tax effects, non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share was $183 million and $0.37 respectively. Included in both the GAAP and non-GAAP results is approximately $36 million of restructuring costs, which reduced diluted earnings per share by about $0.07. ", "In regards to the $36 million restructuring charge in the June quarter, $16 million relates to the winding down of the media substrate plant in Limavady we announced last October and $20 million relates to severance costs for the just announced closure of our finished media operations in Milpitas, California. ", "As detailed in the 8-K we filed last week, we expect the total charges related to the closure of the Milpitas facility to be approximately $74 million. Of the $74 million, approximately $36 million will be cash, primarily for severance payments. In the September quarter, we expect to record charges of approximately $43 million, of which $38 million will be for accelerated asset depreciation, which will be reflected in cost of goods sold. Additional detail relating to the Milpitas closure can be found in the 8-K we filed last week. ", "For our fiscal year 2008, we reported revenue of $12.7 billion, up 12% year over year. Cash provided by operations was $2.5 billion and free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $1.6 billion. ", "During the fiscal year 2008, Seagate returned approximately $1.7 billion of cash to its shareholders, consisting of approximately $216 million through quarterly dividends and approximately $1.5 billion of share repurchases. ", "GAAP gross margin for the June quarter was 23.8%. Excluding approximately $8 million of acquisition related costs, non-GAAP gross margin was 24.1%. Gross margin was slightly better than expected due to favorable freight costs and lower product return rates leading to favorable warranty costs. ", "Like for like pricing for the quarter was as expected, near the high end of the normal range for a June quarter. ", "GAAP R&D and SG&A costs were $445 million for the June quarter. Excluding costs related to recent acquisitions, non-GAAP expenses were $443 million, higher than what we had expected due to litigation cost and spending aimed at improving time to market, future technology development, and expanding our markets. Slide six has the detail for the adjustments made to GAAP R&D and SG&A for the June quarter. ", "Cash flow from operations was $395 million for the June quarter, while free cash flow was $102 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities ended the quarter at $1.14 billion, down $142 million from the previous quarter. During the June quarter, Seagate returned approximately $252 million of cash to its shareholders, consisting of approximately $57 million for the quarterly dividend and $195 million of share repurchases. ", "Capital investment in the June quarter was $293 million and for the fiscal year totaled $930 million. As Dave previously indicated, our current plan is for approximately $1 billion of capital investment for fiscal 2009. ", "Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter was $213 million, essentially flat from the prior quarter. Amortization of purchased intangibles totaled approximately $20 million. ", "During the June quarter, the company repurchased approximately 9.1 million of its common shares at an average price of $21.36. The company has authorization to purchase approximately $2 billion of additional shares under the current stock repurchase program. ", "Now turning to the business outlook, the September quarter is shaping up to be a challenging quarter for Seagate so I want to clearly summarize the factors influencing our outlook for the September quarter. We are expecting like-for-like price declines beyond the high-end of the historical ranges for a September quarter, which is 3.5% to 5%, due to ample availability of supply and the commonality of product and capacity offerings among the hard disk drive suppliers. ", "It should be noted that a majority of the price declines are already in place because of completed OEM negotiations. This pricing dynamic, combined with Seagate selling the less cost effective products represented in our June quarter inventory, creates significant margin compression in the September quarter. We expect the favorable impact of our lower cost new products to be substantially realized as we move into the December quarter. As our new products move into volume production and the company\u2019s cost reductions take effect, we are confident in returning to our model for gross margins. ", "Also, it should be noted that the macroeconomic conditions has created an environment of limited visibility and increased order volatility toward the industry. Consequently, Seagate expects revenue to be in the range of $3.15 billion to $3.3 billion, GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be $0.18 to $0.22, and includes approximately $20 million of purchased intangible amortization and other charges associated with completed acquisitions. ", "Accordingly, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be $0.22 to $0.26. These estimates for the September quarter do not include restructuring costs or accelerated depreciation charges related to the previously announced closing of our substrate operations in Limavady and the finished media operations in Milpitas, California. Additionally, this outlook does not include the impact of any future acquisitions, stock repurchases, or potential restructuring activities the company may undertake during the quarter. ", "R&D and SG&A expenses are experiencing upward pressure due to the 14th week in Seagate's September quarter, but we expect to offset this with reductions in discretionary spending and variable compensation costs and therefore expect R&D and SG&A expense to be flat compared to the June quarter. As Bill has mentioned, we are actively working and executing plans that will more properly align operating expenses with revenue during the course of the year. Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $20 million. ", "That concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call back over to Bill. ", "William D. Watkins", "Thanks, Charles. Now I\u2019d like to make a few comments regarding how we view the long-term outlook for the industry and Seagate. We believe that the demand trends for storage will continue to support healthy growth in the industry unit demand in a 10% to 15% annual range at an annual revenue growth of 5% to 10%. Specific to Seagate, we are confident that the plans we have begun to execute will improve our performance relative to time to market, inventory management, and our overall cost structure. The path to improved financial performance will not be a step function move but will be incremental as we implement numerous changes across all three areas during the fiscal year. ", "We expect gross margins to begin improving with the December quarter and settle into the targeted range of 21% to 25% for the balance of the fiscal year. ", "With that, I would like to open it up for questions. I am currently traveling so I am going to have Dave moderate the questions. With that, Operator. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mark Moskowitz with J.P. Morgan. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you. Good afternoon. A few questions; could you maybe help clarify again the impact on the margins for the September quarter? Can you maybe prioritize or rank order the impacts in terms of how much of it is related to fully available supply by all of your competitors and thereby the associated pricing detriment versus maybe increasing fuzziness in terms of the murky demand environment because of the macro, or other?", "David A. Wickersham", "Mark, let me try to answer that question. If we sat and looked at what we have modeled into our pricing, we\u2019ve modeled approximately 7% price erosion for the September quarter with the historic range having been 3.5% to 5%. Now, embodied in all of that is the economic environment we\u2019re in, the commonality of products, the ample supply throughout the industry, all of those types of things are embodied in that price erosion figure. ", "There is uncertainly relative to demand and visibility to that, at least in the early part of this quarter. That is historically the case where July and August are a little slower demand and then tend to pick up in the latter half of August and September. ", "So we have a significant pricing pressure this quarter and as we indicated, for the bulk of the September quarter we are still going to be shipping the products that were in process during the June quarter which, to a very large extent, represent some of the older, less cost effective products. And then as we start migrating through the September quarter and into December, we expect to see a meaningful improvement in that area. But it\u2019s that cost structure along with the pricing pressure that is giving the margin compression for the September quarter. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "And then if I could follow-up on the 7% price erosion bogey, how much of that is static in terms of dependent on the OEM versus maybe some swing factors that could go in your favor on the distribution side, or increasing market penetration in notebooks or higher cap desktop? Can you help us out there?", "David A. Wickersham", "Well, a little more than half of it is OEM based, leaving the rest for whatever the distribution environment represents during the course of this quarter. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, and then my second question is Dave, can you maybe help us understand, as Bill was talking about the move toward lower cost product structure, helping out your December quarter later this year, what are kind of the puts and takes there? How much of that is going to be based on internally developed disk drives using recording heads and media internally developed versus maybe using externally developed recording heads and media?", "David A. Wickersham", "Mark, let me just hit that head question because as Bill mentioned, and Charles did as well, a large -- probably the largest component of our cost opportunity going forward is the successful transition of new products ramped, so let me just hit the question that I understand you are asking. Regarding whether or not we are considering the use of external technologies, as everyone knows we have a model on media that\u2019s worked very, very successfully, which allows us to selectively use external media on particular products at roughly 10% of our total requirement. We are looking at evaluating something very similar to TDK. I wouldn\u2019t normally mention supplier names on this call but given they are the only independent head supplier left, I\u2019ll just get that out there and just be straightforward. ", "So we don\u2019t have any shipments with them today. We are currently evaluating the use of TDK heads at this point in time. As many of you know, TDK is a very valuable and strategic supplier on a number of components today and so we are very comfortable with pursuing an agreement and a relationship on heads as well, but I\u2019ll emphasize a couple of things. ", "One, it will be very similar to the media model in that it would represent 10%, approximately 10% of our total volumes, which says we\u2019re continuing to be dependent as we are for media on internal head development and operations. And so in this case, just to get to the point that I think you might be thinking about is that as an example, the recently announced 1.5-terabyte desktop drive as well as the recently announced 500-gigabyte notebook drives will include Seagate heads. So all products will have Seagate heads and then selectively, if we proceed with TDK arrangements, which again is being looked at and considered, that would represent a smaller portion, roughly 10% of our total volume requirements. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "And is it safe to say, given your examples there in terms of the products that it would be focused on more than just one form factor, that if it does work out where you find a mutually agreeable situation, you could apply it to both notebooks as well as desktop, or even enterprise? Or would it be staged?", "David A. Wickersham", "That really is something that we could work out with TDK. We would basically have the flexibility but it is a very limited number of products and we would work together, as we do on media, to plan that via a roadmap planning and intercept point. So we would have the flexibility, Mark, is the short answer to use it on any product and any segment. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Thank you and Charles, best wishes in your future endeavors. ", "David A. Wickersham", "Thank you, Mark. Next question. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Bailey with Goldman Sachs. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Thank you very much. Can you give us some more detail around the product execution problems that you are having and the impact that this might have on the September quarter? Are these new issues on the notebook side or are these the issues you\u2019ve been dealing with for the past few quarters?", "David A. Wickersham", "I think it\u2019s the latter. It\u2019s the issues that we\u2019ve been dealing with for the past several quarters, specifically and I think as has been discussed primarily in notebook, which has impacted not only our ability to both profitability and TAM access in the notebook space but has also impacted Brian in the retail space, so we\u2019ve been very vocal about that. And what we are describing is how we are catching up and position with this 500-gigabyte drive we think will be competitive. ", "The other one that is contributing to that has been in the 1-terabyte near line space and we\u2019ve talked a little bit about that, and that -- those two are somewhat similar in that they also were compounded or confounded with the execution and deployment of some of our platform technologies. We\u2019re through that and now it\u2019s just a matter of getting our focus on the qualifications done on every market segment. ", "So it\u2019s really nothing new here. You\u2019re not hearing any new execution issues. We\u2019re just pointing out how that has prevented us from getting the full benefit of those new products, both in notebook, retail, and in enterprise space in the September quarter and we hope with our execution and planned execution through September that you will see the full benefit of that in the December quarter. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "And then just a follow-up on the pricing side -- are you being more aggressive with pricing on the notebook side as you try to regain some of the share that you\u2019ve lost? ", "Charles C. Pope", "Our strategy has always been to meet the market and not lead the market. I think that we are still trying to execute to that strategy as well as we can, given the visibility that we have in the market. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.", "Katy Huberty- Morgan Stanley", "Dave, last quarter when you talked about extra inventory at the end of June on [inaudible] in order to catch the positive inflection point in July, it sounded like you expected to see the seasonal up-lift pretty quickly here. Are you seeing anything different in terms of either the level of demand or timing of that demand for the September quarter build?", "David A. Wickersham", "As Charles indicated, I think that we have a little bit less visibility. It\u2019s not unusual to have a lack of visibility in the July quarter at this point in time but I would say our visibility is limited and so we are being very cautious in terms of how we plan basically all of our inventory capital going forward, just given that limited visibility. So I would say it\u2019s a little bit unique this year in that regard. ", "Katy Huberty- Morgan Stanley", "Okay, and then Fred or Dave or Charles, it sounds like your channel inventory is at the lower end of the typical range. Inventories on your balance sheet are much healthier than March. Where is the excess supply in the industry, if it\u2019s not on your balance sheet and it\u2019s not your inventory in the channel?", "David A. Wickersham", "Well, I don\u2019t know that I can answer that question clearly, Katy. If you look as an example, the last week of the June quarter, the 13th week, on 3.5-inch ATA and 2.5-inch ATA products, the industry shipped 20 million units, approximately 20 million units that week, compared to the 12 week average of 8.1 million units. So I\u2019m not sure that the inventory is in the hard disk drive suppliers\u2019 hands or balance sheet. It may well be in the customers\u2019 and I don\u2019t have clear visibility relative to the individual suppliers\u2019 inventory levels in distribution channel or anything, just ours. And ours was at 4.2 weeks. ", "Katy Huberty- Morgan Stanley", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful math. And then lastly, what made you hold the buy-back back in mid-April? It doesn\u2019t look like you did anything after April 14th. ", "David A. Wickersham", "We did not do anything after April 14th and it\u2019s a situation where, given the transitions we were going through and the restructuring that we are anticipating and everything, we felt it prudent to maintain the cash so that we were able to maintain the liquidity and not create any issues. ", "Katy Huberty- Morgan Stanley", "Okay, thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. ", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company ", "Thank you. Just a couple of questions here; I guess Dave, just to get into the CapEx a little bit more, can you reiterate what your expectation is for how the $1 billion might break down between the various segments, as well as in light of I guess a good way to look at Milpitas was about $10 million a quarter of media production. So if you go and take that out of worldwide supply, your thoughts on that. ", "David A. Wickersham", "Okay. So Rich, I won\u2019t break it down into market segment but I will break it down into what I describe as a more -- it\u2019s really a more typical or traditional mix, maybe one-third, one-third, one-third roughly between heads, media, and then what I call the back end of the line, the assembly and test, unlike a little bit more facilities investments for the woodlands three and Johor in \u201908. So the $1 billion represents more technology and then just aligning the supply chain to the roughly 10% to 15% unit growth that we anticipate year over year. ", "As far as by taking Milpitas capacity offline, we think there\u2019s certainly adequate capacity between Seagate and our partners to cover Seagate and likewise, I think with the plan investments and finished media capacity, I don\u2019t anticipate any kind of media shortfall. It\u2019s obviously tighter in December on paper but I think there\u2019s adequate planned or installed capacity to handle that. ", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company ", "Okay, and then just lastly on pricing, I understand your products not necessarily being at the upper end and not being able to participate there, in part for why the 7% down but do you think the industry will also see 7% down? And you know, because there are other companies who have aereal densities higher and are participating at different levels. Is that an industry number or is that a Seagate number?", "David A. Wickersham", "The 7% that I quoted is a Seagate. There are probably a few capacity points or something, or a few unique products in the industry that are outside of that and may not have the same type of pressure but I think they are very few in exception. And as I indicated, our intent and our strategy is to meet market, not lead market, so I would be surprised to find that the entire industry is meaningfully different than that. ", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company ", "Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wachovia. ", "Aaron Rakers - Wachovia", "Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess one clarification, if I can go back to the commentary around the new 500-gig products shipping; are you telling us that when that product ships, it will be using Seagate heads at this point? Or would you position yourself to using TDK up front and then quickly there following after with Seagate heads? I\u2019m just trying to understand if you are getting into the market using -- if there\u2019s a technology challenge that you guys are trying to overcome. ", "David A. Wickersham", "Let me take that. We\u2019re not going to talk specifically, as I said before, nor have we ever on media or any other specific supplier strategy by product. I would only suffice it to say that that will have RHO heads include. It\u2019s yet to be determined how and where we\u2019ll be going to deploy the TDK technology. It\u2019s still being evaluated and frankly qualified as well. ", "Aaron Rakers - Wachovia", "Okay. And another clarification, if I can then, on the guidance for the gross margin, I believe you had mentioned that you were going to take a $43 million restructuring charge that\u2019s not included in the guidance for this next quarter on a non-GAAP basis. But when we look at the EPS report this quarter, we did see a restructuring charge. Are we to come out next quarter and then see restructuring charges at $43 million included in the numbers?", "David A. Wickersham", "That is correct. ", "Aaron Rakers - Wachovia", "Okay, so $38 million -- so that roughly 18% what it looks like in terms of the gross margin, that\u2019s exclusive of a $38 million charge to COGS?", "David A. Wickersham", "That is correct. ", "Aaron Rakers - Wachovia", "Okay. And then final thing -- in the past you\u2019ve been able to give some color on free cash flow generation. Could you take a stab at what you currently see or expect in terms of free cash flow for fiscal \u201909?", "Charles C. Pope", "I\u2019d be hard-pressed to give the fiscal \u201909. I expect the September quarter to be difficult and it, with the restructuring, may well be a negative free cash flow for September. I would expect good free cash flow numbers past September because there won\u2019t be the restructuring. There will be some expansion in margin during that period of time and relatively balanced capital equipment acquisition over the course of the year. ", "Aaron Rakers - Wachovia", "Thanks, guys. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from  Paul Mansky with Citigroup. ", "Paul Mansky - Citigroup", "A clarification; on the question, I wanted to kind of go back to the consumer expectations. You mentioned that you expected normal seasonality this quarter and yet I\u2019m sure we\u2019re all pretty acutely aware that it\u2019s anything but normal out there presently now. When I think about that in the context of your guidance, which also does at the top line, at least, look fairly normal, normal seasonal, where are the puts and the takes that would give you some -- how shall we say, some wiggle room relative to that consumer volatility? Hello?", "Brian S. Dexheimer", "Let me tackle that. I think your question is probably a little bit broader than just consumer per se, so let me kind of back you up into what our expectations are. I think we mentioned in a couple of different points in the presentation, but we do expect to see 58% year-on-year unit growth across the whole industry. I think Kurt mentioned that in his comments, so upwards of 150 million drives. Now, the other thing we did mention is, and I think Dave hit on this, is the visibility to that demand is somewhat limited and maybe more so because of the economic uncertainty that you point out. So there is some risk in that. I think in the context of share growth, we\u2019re not really planning a significant amount of share growth beyond the product execution focus that you heard a number of folks talk about so this plan is not particularly share dependent. It is dependent on a 15% year-on-year unit growth and the sequential seasonal growth that we normally see. ", "Now, I think in the notebook space there\u2019s every reason to believe that that will likely continue. I think in consumer electronics, there\u2019s probably a reason to believe that that will continue as well. I think if I were going to break it down for you by market segment, the areas I might focus on would be the B2B dependent spaces like enterprise and then the pure retail space around our branded products. Those are probably the two highest risk areas relative to any changes in the macroeconomic environment that float back into our category. ", "I will say that our category through a number of points of turmoil in the last six to nine months, this is a question we\u2019ve been asking ourselves now for the better part of a year, has continued to persevere and so the basic overall demand for storage so far has been able to bust through any uncertainties that we\u2019ve seen today. ", "Paul Mansky - Citigroup", "And I may have misspoke, two questions and a clarification; the second question is on the DVR comments, the intra-quarter up-tick in demand, is that a share issue or do you view that to be an in-demand issue?", "Brian S. Dexheimer", "Well, we gained a little bit of share in the June quarter and we think overall demand was a little bit higher as well. ", "Paul Mansky - Citigroup", "Okay, great. And then on the clarification, in the press release and then again in some of the prepared remarks indicated year-over-year growth. I just want to -- you know, throughout the balance of the year, after we get out of September -- I just want to clarify that that is year-over-year growth in revenue and EPS in each quarter of the fiscal year expected following this upcoming September quarter?", "Charles C. Pope", "It is growth in revenue. We do not expect to necessarily have year-over-year growth in earnings each quarter but we expect significantly improved earnings in December and then maintain or improve those improved earnings during the remainder of fiscal 2009. ", "Paul Mansky - Citigroup", "Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steven Fox with Merrill Lynch. ", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Good afternoon. A couple of quick questions; first of all, you mentioned getting back to 10 times inventory turns as you get out to the December quarter. Is that a stopping point or do you see further improvement possibilities after that?", "David A. Wickersham", "We see further improvements. We are doing what I\u2019ll call some strategic buffering, given the closure of Limavady and Milpitas, so we\u2019ve taken that into account in our September so clearly there\u2019s some upside as we work that down to a normal profile. And then secondly as we continue to look to optimize our supply chain, you know, both in the core business as well as in our retail channel, I think there\u2019s some opportunity there but as I mentioned, we\u2019re also trading off some opportunities to try to be opportunistic on using more cost-effective modes of transportation where possible. ", "So I do see definite upside to it, a turn or two, through the balance of the year but we are going to step our way through that. ", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and then two other quick questions; when you mentioned pressures from a commonality of products, were you only talking about notebook computers or were there other areas that you were trying to reference as well?", "David A. Wickersham", "Really, there\u2019s a high level of commonality in all of the markets at this point in time. I think that there may be a little bit of exception in the 450-gigabyte enterprise space but if you sat and look at the desktop compute, the mobile compute, and most of the consumer electronics, there\u2019s capacity point and performance that is very similar, so on the enterprise having the 450-gigabyte 15,000 RPM and the 1-terabyte SAS may give us a little edge in those two areas but all the rest are pretty common. ", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then last question was just on the time to market improvements that you can get, were you only talking about new products or are there execution opportunities, say when you sell into specific supply chains, like the retail market as well?", "David A. Wickersham", "The answer is yes. I mean, we have time to market opportunities both in terms of completing the qualifications that I described, some of the new products that we described, and then likewise as Brian sees the benefit of us catching up on time to market, particularly in the notebook space but also in the desktop space. Brian too will see the benefit of that. ", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from  Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. ", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets ", "I have two, if I could; number one, could you talk about over the next couple of quarters, or two quarters in particular, how you see the competitive dynamics on the enterprise changing either in the SAS or the SATA side, please?", "Kurt Richards", "I really don\u2019t see a lot of change. I think as we said, it\u2019s a competitive market. We\u2019ve got competitive products. We have a couple of unique out-layers in our 450 and our 1-terabyte SAS as Charles mentioned, but don\u2019t see the dynamics in that space any different than what we\u2019ve seen the last couple of years. ", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets ", "And so just to be clear, if I looked out over the next couple of quarters, two quarters in particular, holding, gaining, or share do you think?", "Kurt Richards", "Holding. ", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets ", "In enterprise. ", "Kurt Richards", "Yeah, our plan is to hold. ", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets ", "Okay. Then the second question is you are coming off of your September quarter is a 14-week quarter. You already gave us the OpEx. Does that involve any incremental revenue associated with the 14 quarter? And related, as we look at December, what are the implications if any on sequential patterns from going back from 14 to 13, both on the revenues and the cost side?", "David A. Wickersham", "Charles, do you want to take that?", "Charles C. Pope", "Keith, there\u2019s a lot of debate on this. You\u2019d like to believe that the 14th week brings some additional revenue. As we sat and talked internally and talked with our customers, it seems that people tend to focus more on the quarter and it tends to be more calendar quarter oriented. Certainly as our -- the September quarter tends to be more back-end loaded and certainly with the distribution channel, we basically have to align with our competitors because of the capacity that the distributors have and that would be in our competitors\u2019 13th week. ", "I think if there is some upside opportunity, it would probably be in the OEM base as they are building out for the December quarter and everything, so we think we\u2019ve factored that in but it\u2019s a topic of discussion. ", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets ", "Okay. And just let me sneak one more then on the inventory; you mentioned there were some incremental inventories out there in the channel. I assume that\u2019s all at the 3.5-inch level, that that\u2019s at the channel but is it -- because I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s not at the OEMs. Is that a reasonable assumption?", "Charles C. Pope", "Of the 20 million units that I referred to in the 13th week was going to both OEMs and distribution. I think that there was a lift in the distribution so that on a comparable basis, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if Seagate's channel inventories at 4.2 weeks are a couple of weeks below what the remainder of the industry are. ", "You know, the difference is that on 3.5-inch ATA, you have about a 50-50 split between OEM and distribution. On 2.5-inch ATA, it\u2019s more 75-80 OEM and 20% distribution, so it\u2019s predominantly 3.5-inch ATA, but not all of it. ", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets ", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert W. Baird. ", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird", "Thank you. Just a couple of questions; first, as a follow-up to the previous question, any additional color you can provide on the channel? It looks like revenues came down a bit sequentially and year over year. Is there anything going on there that you can talk about?", "David A. Wickersham", "I think right now, I guess our version is that quarter over quarter, channel was a little bit down. But looking forward, this is typically a quarter where it has a pretty robust quarter. So I think the visibility statement applies to what we talked about earlier today. It\u2019s really hard to kind of tell inside that today. ", "Charles C. Pope", "I guess the one embellishment I would make to that is that given the macroeconomic environment, it seems that the vast majority of the customer base are trying to run a little leaner than they historically would, which gives a little less buffer there, a little less revenue opportunity. ", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, and then on the notebook side, last quarter you gave a percent of TAM addressed. What was your view of the percent of the notebook TAM addressed in June and then what will that be in the September quarter?", "David A. Wickersham", "Let me take a shot at that because I don\u2019t know off the top of my head, and maybe I\u2019ll ask the other guys to chime in. I\u2019ll think about it in terms of the way we are addressing the 320-gigabyte, I would say we\u2019re only in the September quarter, maybe half of that is served of our opportunity, just given the prolonged qualifications and the late qualifications this quarter. So from a Seagate perspective, as it relates to that unique capacity point, I would say it\u2019s roughly 50% September and then resolved in December. ", "Kurt Richards", "I think as we exit the quarter, we\u2019re in a much better position from a percentage of market participation, arguably early September. ", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird", "Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum Capital.", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "Thank you. I just want a clarification of something earlier; going into the September quarter, the 7% ASP pressure, that was a Seagate-specific comment, is that correct? You would assume that others within the industry may see less than that. Did I interpret that correctly?", "Charles C. Pope", "It was a Seagate comment. It was one like-for-like capacity points and did not reflect mix associated with it. We do see a little bit of improvement in mix so that it comes down from the 7%. I\u2019m looking at an ASP as would be reported but on a like-for-like product basis, it was 7% and Seagate-specific. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "Okay. And then on the significant gross margin compression we\u2019re looking for in the September quarter, how much of that has to do with pricing and how much of that has to do with shipping older, less cost effective products out of inventory?", "Charles C. Pope", "Well, historically we have modeled average price erosion on a like-for-like basis at about 5% and have then wanted to offset two to three points of cost with component reduction and cost reduction product transitions, and then a couple of points with improved mix of products. This quarter, if you look at the like-for-like, we have 7% price erosion, a small amount of mix improvement, but from a cost, product cost structure perspective, it\u2019s largely the same cost structure that we had in the June quarter as we migrate through some of these products. And so that\u2019s the narrative. I have to kind of let you put your arm around which comes first. ", "William D. Watkins", "Let me add a little bit. I mean realistically, pricing, inventories, those are kind of new problems right now. But the real issue here is we\u2019ve been sloppy on product execution, we\u2019ve been sloppy on qualifications and we\u2019ve been sloppy on how we are doing our spending. And that solely rests on me and the management team, and this is in our control. We have a plan. We\u2019re starting to execute on it and that\u2019s what we need to go do, because there\u2019s plain demand out there. We have a good market but we at Seagate have got to execute, and we\u2019re starting to do that. We\u2019re starting to see the progress of that and I think as we go through this quarter and these product qualifications finish up, we are going to see this in December. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s about us and what we have to go do. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "Right, and then on the commonality of products leading to ASP pressure, it kind of suggests to everybody\u2019s mindset that we should see maybe price wars or very aggressive pricing. But then you kind of walk away with that and try to take all the -- you know, maybe catch all the arrows yourself. Although we may have commonality of products, we haven\u2019t seen the industry add significant capacity by anybody over the last year and with you giving 18% quarter over quarter growth and a similar number on year-over-year growth, it doesn\u2019t seem we\u2019re in an industry that could be positioned with a whole lot of excess supply. Am I looking at that wrong?", "David A. Wickersham", "I\u2019ll take a stab -- the answer is no. I mean, the good thing is as Brian has talked about, Charles and others, the good news is we continue to see exceptional growth and demand in both September and December year over year that\u2019s very healthy. That too requires each of us to add capacity, both the vertically integrated as well as the non-vertically integrated and from my view, it\u2019s similar from what you say in that I think people are being responsible in terms of adding both component and assembly capacity and I think that\u2019s a good sign for the industry. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "So my last question to leave on is as we look at this company and your guidance for the September quarter, which is not disappointing in revenue but very disappointing in earnings, seems to be to use Mr. Watkins\u2019 words, seems to be sloppy execution, sloppy qualification work, [inaudible] specific concerns and don\u2019t be surprised if we don\u2019t hear that the message is a little bit cheerier elsewhere?", "David A. Wickersham", "I think we\u2019ll take that as a comment and -- ", "William D. Watkins", "Yeah. We\u2019re focused on what we have to go do, Christian, and we believe in what we\u2019re doing and if we do that, we\u2019re going to be fine. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "Perfect. One last question -- can you quantify the cost savings per drive on the next generation products?", "William D. Watkins", "We\u2019re not going to go down that path. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "Thank you. ", "William D. Watkins", "So in conclusion here, guys, I would like to address one organizational matter. As you likely know, Charles Pope has chosen to transition out of his role as Chief Financial Officer, a position that will pass to the very capable hands of Pat O\u2019Malley. I would like to thank Charles for his many years of outstanding service as Seagate's CFO. ", "Moving forward, as recently announced, Charles will assume the leadership responsibility for Seagate's services and he has also accepted the role of Executive Vice President Strategic Planning and corporate development, including mergers and acquisitions, and we look forward to his contribution going forward.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Seagate Technology's fiscal second quarter 2009 preliminary financial results conference call. (Operator Instructions)", "This conference call contains forward-looking statements including but not limited to statements related to the company's future financial performance. These forward-looking statements, including any references to the savings we may achieve under our recently announced cost reduction plan as well as impact of the impairment charges we may take with regard to our goodwill and other long-lived assets, are based upon information available to Seagate as of the date of this conference call, but are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements. ", "Information concerning additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 13, 2008 and in the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on October 30, 2008.", "These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the company's views as of any subsequent date and Seagate undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Steve Luczo, CEO. Please go ahead.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "", "Thank you, [Wesley]. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Pat O'Malley, our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Whitmore, who heads R&D and manufacturing operations, Brian Dexheimer, head of our Consumer Solutions Division, and Kurt Richards, head of our Global Sales. ", "Before we get to results of the second quarter, I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss some of the announcements we've made over the past couple of weeks, as well as to discuss the challenges posed by the current business environment. I'll then give you my perspective on our business going forward before turning the call over to Bob and Pat.", "We are currently experiencing one of the most dramatic economic downturns of our generation. Macroeconomic trends are worse than what anyone expected even just a few months ago. While we continue to firmly believe that Seagate has a solid future and we view the long-term prospects for storage to be positive, there are significant short-term challenges facing Seagate. Companies of all types, regardless of size or industry, are being negatively impacted by this global downturn, and most of these businesses, large and small, are significant consumers of storage and therefore of Seagate's products.", "Due to the ever-changing and declining economic environment, the Board determined that now is the appropriate time to make changes in the leadership team, to facilitate quicker changes in organizational structure and to implement other actions to regain our position as the leading provider of storage devices across all markets.", "The entire Board and the management team have the highest regard for Bill Watkins and for his many contributions to Seagate. Bill's advice and his efforts to ensure a smooth transition are much appreciated and will help us in this acceleration of change. ", "We also announced last week that Dave Wickersham has resigned from the company as President and COO. Bob Whitmore has assumed the additional operational responsibilities previously performed by Dave. Bob has been with Seagate for 22 years and is an important member of our leadership team. In his expanded role he is now responsible for all research and development and global disc storage operations. I am pleased that Bob will assume these additional duties in his role going forward. ", "I will now briefly review the restructuring program that was announced last week. In fiscal 2006 Seagate began an expansion program to meet rising customer demand. In recent months, however, the market has contracted sharply, and when combined with some market share loss, revenues have declined significantly. In order to adapt our business model to the new economic conditions, we have implemented a series of necessary changes. ", "In early fiscal 2008, Seagate commenced a restructuring program that to date includes the closure of our recording media facilities in Milpitas, California and Limavady, Northern Ireland, and the announcement of the closure of our research facility in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Recent actions also include a reduction in our global work force, company wide salary reductions, and other cost reduction actions that we believe will result in annual savings in excess of $300\u00a0million. These actions are part of a comprehensive plan to align the company's cost structure with the current economic reality. Pat will be addressing this in more detail later in the call.", "We continue to remain focused on building liquidity and strengthening our balance sheet by taking actions to reduce capital spending, lower operating expenses, and to align production with demand to control inventory at appropriate levels. Today we also announced that the Board voted to reduce the quarterly dividend to $0.03 per share effective immediately. Reducing the dividend is expected to save approximately $175 million of cash over the next 12\u00a0months.", "Let me spend a few minutes talking about my perspective on our business. We understand that the issues we are facing today are not solely the result of macroeconomic pressures. I believe we have the right resources in place, but that we haven't executed at the level that we are capable of. After demonstrating sustained areal density leadership through a number of product generations, we decided to manage areal density growth in an attempt to optimize our product portfolio and R&D investment. This decision resulted in products that were less competitive in some markets, as overhead technologies advanced at rates greater than our estimates. Our technology assets, investments and capabilities remain intact, but we have not been efficient in deploying those technologies through the last two product cycles. ", "In addition, our internal execution issues were compounded by the macroeconomic environment, which we believe will continue to be challenging through calendar 2009 and potentially into the first half of calendar 2010. ", "Moving forward we need to optimize our leadership systems for faster decision-making and we need to increase the competitiveness and value of our product portfolio by better capitalizing on our core technologies. We will continue to adjust production to a level in line with our current estimates of the total available market. We will continue to structure our business to focus on building liquidity and strengthening the balance sheet so that we are competitive throughout a period that may reflect extended macroeconomic decline. ", "To the extent that business conditions are more favorable than what we currently anticipate, we can scale reasonably to address growth. We believe a positive change in the economy will be gradual and that we have the right relationships with those customers that are positioned to see an economic upturn earliest. ", "We believe that Seagate has a solid future. We need to make smarter and faster decisions and execute better and we will. We are committed to implementing actions that will result in Seagate being the clear leader in storage devices across all markets, providing our customers with the industry's leading technology, highest performance and highest quality products, and using our scale and technology to be the most advanced and lowest-cost manufacturer in the industry.", "Seagate has achieved and sustained this level of performance before and we believe we can attain it again as we re-focus on advancing areal density and accelerating deployment of our technology into our manufacturing base. Efforts along this line have started to produce positive results. Six months ago we began addressing the issues associated with our product and technology portfolio as well as the company's structure. We've built positive momentum in recent months, providing us with significant opportunities moving forward. Bob will address these improvements in more detail in a few minutes.", "The current environment certainly presents challenges, but as historically demonstrated, the fundamental core strengths that Seagate possesses when fully leveraged result in the company's leadership in technology, products, cost and financial performance. We are confident in our ability to execute at these leadership levels as we continue our efforts for improvement.", "I'll now turn the call over to Bob, who will highlight some of our product initiatives, technology and operations. ", "Robert Whitmore", "", "Thanks, Steve. Before I provide you with an update on our products, technology and operations, I'd like to give you a brief background of my career and my perspective on the company's technology and operational priorities as we move forward.", "I started my career with Seagate over 20 years ago as an engineer within the Enterprise side of the business. Most recently I've been focused on product development, but through the years I've led nearly every R&D organization and many of the operational teams throughout the company, including management positions at our operations in Asia. ", "I also know from my overall experience at Seagate that our greatest asset is our people, and I have a clear understanding of their capabilities and dedication. Having engaged with the global operations team, I believe we continue to be well positioned with advanced, low-cost manufacturing technologies, and I'm excited about the opportunity to lead this part of the business.", "I'll now provide an update of our products and technology, followed by an outlook of our capital spending. ", "We have not been satisfied with the consistency of our product and technology execution. We recognized this several quarters ago and have been addressing it directly. Today I'm encouraged to say that we're making measurable progress to that end. Specific to areal density leadership, our accelerated plans to deliver the industry's highest capacity per platter drives are starting to show tangible results. Last month we successfully launched the industry's first 7200\u00a0rpm 500\u00a0gigabyte per platter 3.5 inch product. Both desktop and CE versions are now released and being qualified.", "Additionally, our 5400 rpm 250 gigabyte per platter 2.5 inch drives have been shipping in volume for over a quarter and match the leading capacities in the industry today. We have also launched our 7200 rpm model at 250 gigabytes per platter. ", "Finally, in the Enterprise market we have now completed the refresh of our 2.5 inch product line, doubling capacity to 300 gigabytes. All major OEM qualifications are now complete. ", "Overall, we are making progress with our new product introductions; however, simply being at par with our competitors is not our goal. Our goal is to be the clear leader in areal density and product performance, and with these recent successes, we feel we are making progress across the entire portfolio. The product advancements we have made over the last six months are allowing us to recapture qualification positions with some of our key OEMs. This is a significant step in recovering our product leadership and growing market share.", "In the Enterprise market we remain the leader, and I'm encouraged with our current road map and position. This road map includes the commitment to solid state devices. We are set to deliver our first SSD product into Enterprise applications later this calendar year. SSDs and solid state technology are essential to our long-term product roadmaps, and we will maintain our investment levels to deliver leading technology as required by our current and future customers.", "Now I'd like to address our capital spend for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010. Capital investments for December quarter were $214 million. Looking forward, for the balance of this fiscal year our level of capital spending will be greatly reduced as we have completed most of our head wafer conversion from 6 inch to the most cost effective 8 inch format. We continue to minimize our capital spending in line with the reduction we see in demand and the installed capacity we currently have in place. ", "Capital investment going forward will be targeted primarily at technology transitions. We expect capital investment for fiscal year 2009 to be approximately $650 million, a reduction of approximately $350 million from the outlook at the beginning of this fiscal year and $100\u00a0million reduced from the capital outlook we provided last quarter. Based on our perspective of the macroeconomic trends, we believe our capital investments for fiscal year 2010 will be below $500 million. ", "In summary, clear and sustained time to market, product leadership, superior quality, and world class manufacturing are the key areas of focus for my organization. Seagate's foundation is solid, and I am fully confident in the talent and capability of our employees. Our goal is deliver sustained leadership by leveraging our technology and manufacturing capabilities across all markets. ", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Pat O'Malley.", "Patrick O'Malley", "", "Thanks, Bob. You'll find the company's press release, 8-K, and additional financial information related to Seagate's financial performance and other supplemental information in the Investor Relations sections of Seagate's website at Seagate.com.", "First let me provide some insight into how the industry's demand and pricing environment evolved during the quarter. The December quarter proved to be very challenging with industry demand degrading throughout the quarter. When the December quarter began, the total available market or TAM for hard drives was thought to be near 156 million units. Then at about 8\u00a0weeks into the quarter, the TAM was expected to be in the 135 million unit range. And now preliminary industry data indicates actual shipments for December quarter were somewhere around 123 million units.", "With this type of demand and supply imbalance, pricing was very competitive, especially in the 3.5\u00a0inch and 2.5\u00a0inch ATA markets, where we believe the industry experienced a second consecutive quarter of double-digit like-for-like price declines. ", "Now I'd like to discuss Seagate's preliminary financial results for the December quarter. These financial results are preliminary as the company has concluded that it is required to record a noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the company's goodwill and possibly other long-lived assets, which include purchased intangibles and property, equipment, and leasehold improvements. ", "The financial statements that will be included in the Form 10-Q that will be filed by the company for its fiscal second quarter of 2009 will differ from those issued today so as to reflect the outcome of this impairment analysis and any related tax impact.", "Seagate reported a net loss and a net loss per share for the December quarter of $496\u00a0million and $1.02\u00a0per share, respectively. Included in these results are the following items:", "$18 million of purchased intangibles amortization and other charges associated with acquisitions; ", "$94\u00a0million of restructuring related charges, and ", "A $271 million charge to reduce the valuation allowance related to the company's deferred tax assets. ", "The impact of these cash and non-cash items total approximately $383 million and approximately $0.79 per share. Note that the adjustment to the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets will not impact our cash taxes paid going forward. ", "For the December quarter, Seagate reported revenue of $2.3 billion, at the low end of our revised guidance, reflecting the project execution issues which we have previously mentioned, the continued softening in demand, and inventory drawdown throughout the PC supply chain and the more competitive pricing environment for the 3.5 inch and 2.5 inch ATA markets. ", "Seagate unit shipments for the quarter were 36.7 million, down 23% compared to the prior quarter. ", "In the December quarter we believe we lost approximately 2 points of market share. The factors that contributed to this are the continued transition of demand from 3.5 inch ATA to 2.5\u00a0inch ATA, where Seagate has meaningfully less market share, we chose not to participate in specific portions of the 3.5 inch market, and within the 2.5 inch ATA market, while our time to market 250\u00a0gig per platter product offerings continue to gain share and customers, the older product platform ceded share as our customers cut demand from the last supplier qualified, which was Seagate, before impacting those who were more timely to market. ", "Gross margins for the December quarter compressed in excess of 300 basis points, which reflected a more competitive pricing environment, lower unit demand leading to low levels of fixed cost absorption as we reduced build schedules significantly, and a higher cost structure on older products as Seagate continues to transition to newer, more cost-efficient product platforms. ", "R&D and SG&A totaled $377 million for the December quarter and included costs related to the acquisitions of $2 million and accelerated depreciation of $14 million related to our closing of the Pittsburgh research center.", "In addition to tight spending controls, similar to last quarter, R&D and SG&A was lower than planned due to the accounting treatment of the company's employee funded deferred compensation plan. As the plan's liabilities decreased again this quarter, a reduction was recorded in operating expenses while a corresponding increase was recorded in other income and expense. The net impact is essentially neutral to the P&L.", "Let me recap some information relating to the restructuring and cost saving actions disclosed by the company last week. First, the work force reduction totaled approximately 3,000 headcount and is expected to save $130 million annually. We will see the majority of this benefit in the June quarter. The expected restructuring charge for this action is approximately $90 million and is mostly for cash-based severance costs.", "Secondly, a salary reduction was enacted for nearly all professional employees on a sliding scale that is expected to save an additional $80 million annually. A portion of these savings will be reflected in our March quarter results.", "In addition to these actions, we recently completed the shutdown of the finish media operations in Milpitas and the aluminum substrate operations in Limavady, Northern Ireland. We are well into the plan that is expected to improve the efficiency of our research effort by moving much of the activity into existing product and component design centers, enabling Seagate to exit the Pittsburgh research facility.", "These restructuring actions I just mentioned are expected to eliminate in excess of $300\u00a0million of spending from the overall cost structure. ", "Additional cost savings outside the scope of these restructuring activities have been identified and have been enacted by the management team and are expected to significantly lower the cost structure of the company. Specifically, for product development and selling, general and administrative based on the actions implemented to date, our quarterly run rate spending level is expected to be approximately $340 million when full savings are realized in the June quarter.", "While the savings to date are significant, the management team will continue to evaluate and determine what further actions are necessary to properly align the company's cost structure with the current business environment.", "Now I will discuss the balance sheet, cash, cash flow and liquidity. ", "Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, up $156\u00a0million from the previous quarter. During the quarter, the company borrowed $350\u00a0million under the existing revolving credit facility. The Board's authorization of the reduction to our dividend mentioned earlier will improve our liquidity position. Going forward, the management team will continue to monitor the company's liquidity position and determine how to best prioritize the use of cash so as to position the company for long-term success.", "Cash flow from operations was $89 million for the quarter while free cash flow, defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was negative $125 million. ", "Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter was $228 million, including approximately $16\u00a0million of purchased intangibles amortization and $16 million for accelerated depreciation related to fixed assets at facilities we previously announced were closing. ", "Investments in capital for the first two quarters of fiscal 2009 totaled $494 million. The current expectation for fiscal 2009 capital investments has been reduced to approximately $650\u00a0million. ", "Looking forward, Seagate's capital investments will primarily be targeted at advancing technology and, as such, can likely be supported with an annual run rate of an amount less than $500\u00a0million. ", "Cash conversion metrics are as follows - days sales outstanding was 42, days payable outstanding was 64, and days inventory outstanding was 37, for a cash conversion cycle of 15\u00a0days, which was 10 days longer than the prior quarter. Our target for the cash conversion cycle is 12 to 15 days. Since we are at the high end of the target range, we expect no further incremental cash to be tied up on the balance sheet in the future due to working capital requirements.", "Inventory decreased in aggregate by $113 million as a $152 million decrease in work in progress and raw materials more than offset a $39 million increase in finished goods. ", "Distribution channel inventory for Seagate 3.5 inch ATA product trended down the entire quarter and ended under 4 weeks. We believe all channels, including OEM and retail, brought down inventories during the December quarter. We expect the March quarter will be much more sensitive to true end demand as inventory buffer has been reduced significantly.", "Long and short-term debt totaled $2.4 billion, yielding a net debt position of roughly $1\u00a0billion. Long-term debt maturities in the near term primarily consist of $300 million due in October of 2009 and $135 million due in April of 2010. The revolving credit facility has a six-month maturity with the company's option to extend the borrowing as long as covenant compliance is maintained through the maturity date in 2011.", "In regards to the company's liquidity position, management has recently taken many actions focused on building liquidity and strengthening its balance sheet. We continue to be in compliance with the covenants related to our revolving credit facility, and based on the current business outlook, we believe the company will generate or obtain sufficient sources of liquidity to support the business. The covenant calculations have been added to our supplemental package and can be found on Page\u00a010.", "Now let me cover the business outlook. For the March quarter, in light of the company's view of the current market environment and the uncertainty in global economic conditions, for planning purposes the company's expects the overall demand for disc drives to be approximately 110\u00a0million units and the pricing environment to be similar in nature to the past six months. In addition, the company is assuming no significant changes in its market share and therefore expects revenue to be approximately $1.6 to $2 billion. ", "Gross margins for the March quarter are expected to come under further pressure due to the competitive pricing environment and the cost inefficiencies due to lower volumes and higher component costs. ", "Product development and SG&A are expected to be approximately $395\u00a0million in the March quarter, essentially flat compared to the December quarter, when adjusted for the favorable impact from the employee deferred compensation plan.", "While current uncertainty and global economic conditions make it particularly difficult to predict product demand, the company expects TAM in the June quarter to be flat to slightly down quarter-over-quarter. Seagate has the potential to experience modest market share gains in the June quarter as our new products qualify and ramp in volume. In addition to a better cost structure on these new products as well as the full quarter benefit of the restructuring and salary reductions recently undertaken, the company expects to realize margin improvement in the June quarter.", "That concludes my remarks for today. Steve?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Thanks, Pat.", "And before going to Q&A I want to emphasize that in this challenging near-term environment, we will stay focused on what we can control - product leadership, cost and inventory management, and technology leadership. As always, my greatest confidence is in our employee base.", "Before we go to Q&A, I'd like to indicate that Pat, Kurt, Brian and Bob will likely answer most questions that reference our fiscal Q2 results due to my recent appointment as CEO, and with respect to the future direction of the company, our comments will be reflective of the entire management team.", "Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Richard Kugele - Needham & Company.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "", "First, just tactically in terms of the quarter, can you talk about what you've actually seen from a pricing perspective quarter to date? You talked about some of the OEM aspects of it being similar, but there's been some indications of some stabilization in the channel due to the low inventory levels. Can you corroborate any of that?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yes, Rich, let me just give you a high level remark just so we make sure that people got the message.", "What we're planning for against this economic environment is a pricing scenario that is not that different from what we've experienced. Now, as you know, over the last several quarters, this has been the steepest and longest period of pricing decline that the industry has seen maybe ever and certainly in a long, long time, and basic economics would say that that can't sustain itself forever. But for planning purposes, we need to be prepared. ", "To your comments about what's recently happened, there is some indications in some marketplaces that the pricing has slowed. For competitive reasons we don't want to go into the details which markets exactly, but it's actually been in several different markets and covers both OEM as well as other channels. ", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "And then I guess secondly from a total cost perspective, when you're looking at the future things you can do, I know you have a couple of facilities in China, you have a number of different R&D facilities, do you see it being more facility oriented or do you think that there's also some streamlining even within just your headcount that can occur.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yes, I think, you know, again, it's partly based on what the business model that we drive to and what's the revenue model that we drive to. And in this demand environment and in this macro environment, it's tough to pick a number to say how do you want to structure your business for the long term versus the fact that the next 24 months could potentially be quite difficult and I think most people would agree that the next 12 are certainly not going to be fun.", "So those are the levers that we have to play with that you identified, you know, what we do with our structural infrastructure. The factories are actually for the most part running quite efficiently. Is there opportunities potentially? But for sure I think with respect to some of the organizational issues, as you're probably aware, the org structure changed to a business unit structure. We're now shifting it back to a functional structure, and we do believe there's opportunities in terms of both management layers, ability to delegate and restructure, that there are some opportunities certainly to pursue there. And longer term structural issues, as you mentioned, whether or not it's any facility, design related or factory related, have to be assessed in terms of the overall outlook. ", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay, I guess, Steve, one last question. If you were to compare Seagate's issues today, the market issues, compared to 1998 and the issues you were facing then, any thoughts on how you would approach it or how you were able to solve it then versus today?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yes, I think the basic issues - or at least the manifestation of the issues - are very similar in terms of technology leadership that was lagging, execution issues, and high cost. I think those elements are the same. I think some of the things that have been driving those issues are similar and some of them are different.", "I think the good news today is one, there's a team in place for the most part that was actually the team that turned around the company the last time. As you probably recall, we had, I think, 111,000 employees when I was made CEO last time and I think it was 17 factories, 7 design centers, and over the course of four years we aligned the company to the business opportunity that we had and, more importantly, really invested in the technology and our heads and our discs and also integrated our design centers to a platform strategy where we could actually leverage all of our components and also therefore leverage our manufacturing assets in terms of final drive assembly.", "I think the good news is all that work is still here functioning and it's actually functioning quite well. As we mentioned, we did get behind in head technology. Last time we didn't have luxury to get behind because we were so far behind IBM, we just went pedal to the metal for as long as we could, and my assumption still is that if IBM hadn't shifted away from being a hardware company to a software company, we might not have ever caught them. But once they did that, we flew past them like they were standing still.", "With the areal density leadership that we had, we basically then in some ways had the luxury to say how do we deploy that areal density and how do we manage that growth, and the company pursued what I believe is a sound strategy of pursuing many more markets that were evolving for storage, whether or not it was consumer related or smaller devices or whatever, and in doing so we basically managed the areal density growth instead of just driving it as absolutely hard as necessary. ", "Throw in there the fact that the 80 gig platform stayed in the market for basically two product cycles, which was the first time since 1995 that a product cycle had been less than a year, and the product planning basically missed a generation as a result of that because, again, of course, the product cycles picked back up again. ", "Those issues are all pretty much the same. I think shifting the organization back to functional organization is obviously something we didn't have to face then, but I think there's opportunities related to that in terms of the decision-making that we'll have. ", "The culture of the employees is as good as ever, so that strength is similar. I'm 10 years older. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but I'm definitely 10 years old. ", "And of course the macro environment is completely different, and I think the challenge that we have in front of us isn't really so much can Seagate do this, because we can do it and we know how to do it. What we really have to prepare for the company, though, is for the uncertain macroeconomic environment. If we had clear view on a steady state environment, I would say the risks were much less than they were in 1997. ", "But in an environment that really it's hard to pick that point of what's the right revenue level, what's the right pricing level, what's the right margin level - and that being driven by external factors that, frankly, no one in the world is having a decent assessment of right now - certainly makes it a more complex challenge for all of us.", "We're up for the task. We're going to basically move forward in a way that we believe is conservative in those assumptions, but preparing the company in the event that the turnaround happens that we can obviously take advantage of any upside reasonably.", "We've given you our indication of what the TAM looks like for us going forward. We don't think that as you go to industry sources that there's going to be a wide variation of that. And again, then it gets back down to pricing, you know, how long do people continue to price or does the industry price itself into an unprofitable territory and obviously basic economics limit that at some point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Min Park - Goldman Sachs.", "Min Park - Goldman Sachs", "", "First, Seagate and Western Dig have both made public comments and have started to cut back on capacity. Have you seen any signs or other indications from your other competitors that they're willing to or are planning to take capacity out of the system. ", "Stephen J. Luczo", "That's a great question. I don't know that we could say we have anything [inaudible] public confirmation, but I think everybody's appearing to be responsible with all the macroeconomic things we're dealing with at the time. ", "Patrick O'Malley", "I think the other things that you're getting is obviously it's, as you said, public comments from WD. I think we're approaching it reasonable to say what is the TAM? It clearly has contracted. We're trying to align our business model to support that, which we think, as Steve said, we can take that down and reasonably take it up. ", "But with just the press coming out of Japan with potential consolidations and all the needs to get efficiencies, there's no doubt that they're looking at - when we look at some of the shared equipment suppliers, where they're cutting back, I think it's a whole supply chain just pulling back to align with this new reality of our customers may be willing to hold less inventory and of a smaller TAM for the time being.", "So I think it's not unreasonable to think that everyone's doing that right now.", "Min Park - Goldman Sachs", "And then just jumping right into the supply chain, if you look at a number of the vendors in the supply chain, including component and capital equipment vendors, already seem pretty stressed in the current cycle. Are you concerned about the viability of your suppliers and what plans do you have in place to protect Seagate from that risk?", "Robert Whitmore", "We are concerned and obviously we're watching it very closely and very carefully. We're talking to our suppliers every day and making sure that we're working with them. And I think it really comes down to a supplier-to-supplier case-by-case basis.", "We don't divulge any specific information on specific suppliers, but suffice it to say it's a big concern and we're working with them daily.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "And just to follow up on that, you know there is no supplier issue that we are concerned about currently and for most if not all of our technologies we have more than one source of supply.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "I just wanted to dig into the cash levels a little bit. I was a little bit surprised to see that you drew down on the revolver $350 million. Was there a particular reason that you did that? I know at the time you had mentioned some cash costs related to restructuring, but it seems like those cash costs are somewhere around maybe $100 million and not really the $350 million, so I wanted to understand that a little bit better.", "Patrick O'Malley", "As we've talked about, the $90 million was what I'd say was a first pass. We continue to look at the levels of our cost structure. There may be more, to fund those. But that work is undergoing, so we want to have enough in there to give us leeway to fund the restructuring. ", "As we talked about, the $90 million, that $130 million pays off annually, but it does pay off annually, so if we have any of these other activities, many of them we'll have to have the cash upfront and they'll take a stream of anywhere from six months to a year to get back, so we want to draw that in front of us so we can be very aggressive if need be, if the market conditions continue to deteriorate. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities", "I guess some of the questions I've had from investors have been you've got a lot of cash on the balance sheet. Is that cash accessible or is it in places that potentially you don't want to get at it for tax reasons or whatever and maybe that would be why you wanted to take the cash out of your revolver instead of using cash on the balance sheet? Just trying to get a better understanding of where your cash is sitting right now.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "No, all of our cash is totally accessible.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities", "And then in terms of the $15 million that's sort of - you don't have it this quarter, but you're seeing it again next quarter for the employee benefit stuff that's in the OPEX number, Pat, I'm just curious why would we necessarily have that $15 million in the number next quarter? I'm just trying to understand that charge a little bit and trying to figure out on a go forward basis - ", "Patrick O'Malley", "Okay, let me help you on that, Sherri. We took a - it was closer to $20 million credit into our comp charge. We're saying we're not going to get that benefit next quarter, so it's not a charge. It's just I'm not going to get that favorable benefit this quarter. So that $377, if you took the favorable benefit of the employee deferred comp plan, I'd have been closer to $400 million. So I'm basically telegraphing you $395 for next quarter, so essentially flat. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. And then we go into June, I think you said with the longer-term plan and the restructuring actions you've taken, that comes down to $340?", "Patrick O'Malley", "That's correct.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities", "And so that includes those changes and so we wouldn't expect to see another number in there or a different change?", "Patrick O'Malley", "Given current course, there would be no changes. If there was other activities that we enacted, you may have some effect to that, but $340 would be our steady state after the restructuring activity, reduction of all the other salary actions we talked about. So that would be what we expect to see, and if the employee deferred comp had some change, it'd be reflected in there. But $340 would be a plan steady state.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities", "And then just finally in terms of the restructuring, you've said $300 million in savings. How much savings should we expect to see in the COGS number taken out of your fixed costs? You've been pretty clear about what's happening in OPEX, but what should we expect in COGS?", "Patrick O'Malley", "We haven't been explicit because there's many moving parts to that. Its billed material reductions, external sourcing, whether it's internal or external, so there's a lot of moving parts. We haven't been very explicit. We manage the margin through what we'd call our portfolio mix. That's the biggest lever as opposed to cost reductions out of lineups like that. There are dollars there, but our biggest lever in our gross margin is our product, competitiveness and the pricing elements. So we haven't been as prescriptive there.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay, because that's a little harder to predict?", "Patrick O'Malley", "Yes, and it's just not the biggest lever we have in that bucket.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike Lanier - AIG.", "Mike Lanier - AIG", "", "I had a question about cash and I apologize - I got pulled away - if you've already answered this, and that is is it right that you said in the past you need about $500 million just to run the business. Is that a good number to use?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "$500 million is the covenant requirement, so you arguably run at less than that. I'm not sure I'd like to run at less than that given where we are even today. I always like to have a little more potentially. But $500 million is a hard covenant requirement we have, so we cannot run the business under that. ", "Mike Lanier - AIG", "And then along those lines, because recently from the school of hard knocks we realize that just because you have $500 or $1 billion in cash doesn't mean you actually have full access to it. Can you talk a little bit about how your $1.3 billion, I guess, whatever you ended the quarter with here, how much is tied up? How much is stuck in Europe or in places where you really don't have the ability to draw upon it if you wanted to.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yes. No, Mike, we answered that. That must have been when you were off. But yes, no, we have full access to the cash that we have on the balance sheet. None of it is in places that we can't get it immediately.", "Mike Lanier - AIG", "And then as far as the maturities coming around, is it your plan to rebuild the cash and keep it up above $1 billion or are you just going to - you'd be comfortable if it comes down to $700 or whatever it might be. God knows, it takes a crystal ball to know how operations will go, but you do have, what $450 over the next year coming around. Is it your intention to do a capital raising to get it back up if there's no cash build from operations?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Right. We're looking at the alternatives right now in terms of what's the best options for the company to manage either the retirement of that debt or the replacement of that debt. And so that's basically the task at hand right now and hope to have more information on that in the nottoodistant future. ", "But, you know, we're looking at all the options right now in terms of how to best position the company, again, for our planning scenario of sustained macro trend that we're in today and sustained pricing trend, even though that may not be viable for the entire industry, at least planning for those. And then if things get better, great, but that's what we're [inaudible] right now.", "Mike Lanier - AIG", "And lastly the reduction in CapEx, I guess the way we should look at it is it's probably not going to be a competitive disadvantage because the competitors will probably be doing the same thing?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yes. At least on a preliminary basis, one of our competitors has already announced a significant reduction in capital. I think for us we're not reducing any capital that relates to any technology transitions that we have ongoing, and in fact one of the reasons the capital was as high as it was this year is because we were completing a significant technology transition. So we're maintaining capital levels certainly to be competitive in terms of technology and obviously [break in audio] capability in terms of infrastructure. ", "And we believe that given today's demand environment, which we've scoped at 110 million units, plus or minus, for the next couple of quarters and then probably, you know, slow growth if any for the next two quarters after that, we certainly can maintain our ability to respond to the marketplace with those levels of capital.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "", "I think in the past you provided sort of industry TAMs across your product categories. Is that something you won't be providing going forward or could you give us that information this time around?", "Robert Whitmore", "We have provided it in the past, but we haven't provided it this time because the overall market has taken such a significant contraction. These are our assessments. So we'd be probably better advised this quarter to let the whole thing shake out. We're planning our business accordingly with our customers, but there's still some variation of that 110, where that may settle. So as that gets clearer, I think we'd be better - provide you guidance at that time. But right now there's a lot of variability in the TAM from moving from market to market, so we'd probably stay away from that this quarter.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "And then I guess if I just look at the restructuring initiatives and you've talked about OPEX going from $395 million next quarter to about $340 million in June, does that reflect 100% the savings from all the researching efforts or will there be some incremental savings beyond that as well?", "Robert Whitmore", "They would be very de minimis. Most of the actions that we've talked about in that $300 million of actions are all primarily reflected. There will be some folks that'll still be around in the June quarter, but it would be very small, so you would not probably get much incremental upside to the actions we've talked about. ", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Since I've been thinking about [$300] million savings, two-thirds on the OPEX line, about a third on the COGS line is a reasonable way to model this thing?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Well, I think if you did the math that comes close. That comes close. But you could probably look at it from a Q4 run rate and model down to where you see and you could probably figure out where that is.", "Now realize the $300 million we talk about are these restructuring activities. There's other cost reduction activities the company's undergone, so when you go through and you look at a Q4 run rate to an - '08 for a Q4 '09, you may see higher numbers, but the $300 million there is the restructuring activities we've done, so they're not the only cost reductions that this company has undergone over the last six months.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "And just, I guess, finally, [inaudible] this $1.6 to $2 billion revenue band for the next several quarters, and I think the last [inaudible] you were in that revenue band around fiscal '09, the OPEX was around $230, $240 million kind of run rate. Is it fair to say the researching effort we may take beyond this would be focused to drive that OPEX down from $340 to the mid-$200 range?", "Patrick O'Malley", "We'll look at that. As Steve said, this is a situation where we have to line up what we thing our long term is. One of the things we are committed to is to protect our technology and the key products that we think are the financial engines of the company over the next three years, so that's where we'll be protected. We also have some investment in our solid states, you know, technology that we look at that's probably above and beyond what you've seen in the past. ", "So we'll model to deliver the technology and the products across the whole storage market over that, so we'll model accordingly and we'll come back to you, but given the high flux, the high contraction over the last six months, we'll owe you a model on that, but we're committed to get back to profitability in this company.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "And maybe one more question.", "Operator", "Your first question comes from [Unidentified Analyst] - Bank of Montreal.", "Unidentified Analyst - Bank of Montreal", "", "I had a question on the competitive landscape with the potential combination of Toshiba and Fujitsu. Can you talk about what the impact would be for the industry and for Seagate, particularly your business segments?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yes, I think, you know, it'd be hard for us to speculate. I'm not even sure that anything official has been released with respect to it other than speculation. So I think it'd just probably be a little bit misleading to project anything other than putting two companies together is always challenging in the short term and whether or not it's beneficial in the long term depends on how good a job you did. ", "So I think we just have to wait until we hear more from what those two companies want to talk about.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Okay, everybody, thanks very much for participating today, and I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Morgan", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Operator", "Welcome to Seagate Technologies fiscal third quarter 2009 financial results conference call. (Operator Instructions) ", "This conference call contains forward-looking statements including but not limited statements related to the company's future financial performance. These forward-looking statement including any references to the savings we may achieve under our recently announced or anticipated cost reduction plans are based on information available to Seagate as of the date of this conference call but are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements.", "Information concerning additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements is contained in the company's annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 13, 2008 and in the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 10, 2009.", "These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the company's view as of any subsequent date and Seagate undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Steve Luczo, CEO.", "Steve Luczo", "Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Pat O'Malley, our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Whitmore, our Chief Technology Officer and Head of R&D and Manufacturing Operations and Dave Mosley, Head of Sales and Product Line Management.", "Beginning in early January with the establishment of the new management team at Seagate, our primary focus has been to take actions that would improve the company's competitiveness, return it to profitability as quickly and efficiently as possible and to strengthen the company's balance sheet. In general we have been pursuing activities related to reorganization, refinancing, restructuring and running the business. ", "I will first provide you with an update on the actions we have taken thus far and a description of the impact those changes have had on our operations and our financial performance both end quarter and structurally.", "I will then provide commentary on our third quarter performance and identify additional opportunities for improvement in the fourth quarter, and finally, I'll discuss other areas of focus going forward and the resulting improvements we expect to achieve.", "Our first actions addressed the organizational and financial structure of the company. We eliminated the business unit structure and returned to a functional organizational structure to improve decision making, drive better cross functional optimization and to provide strategic and tactical direction designed to improve overall corporate performance and manage resource allocation.", "Organizational changes include reducing our executive level positions by 33% since the beginning of fiscal year 2009, eliminating business units, integrating and redefining our sales, marketing and product line management functions, reintegrating certain functions of our branded business into the rest of our company and establishing a cross functional solid state strategy team.", "These organization changes are in addition to the previously announced closures of two recording media facilities and our Pittsburg research facility, the global work force reduction and company wide salary reductions announced in January 2009 and other cost reduction initiatives.", "To help facilitate and enhance our business processes throughout the company, we have reinstituted the company's executive committee which has responsibility for business decisions related to Seagate strategies and top level goals and the corporate management committee which has responsibility for implementing business strategies and making decisions related to cross functional and organizational optimization.", "From a balance sheet perspective, we have significantly improved our liquidity position and capital structure; first with the amendment to our credit facility with our credit facility and most recently with our debt financing. In addition, our Board of Directors agreed to adopt policy of not providing a dividend which when coupled with the reduction in dividend in January 2009 reduces cash obligations by about $230 million annually.", "We believe these actions position us to be cash flow positive and earnings positive during our fiscal year 2010 even if the current negative macro economic conditions persist. ", "Specific to the March quarter, there are a number of encouraging signs for our company. From an industry standpoint the total available market was marginally higher than expected and Seagate delivered greater revenue than planned. ", "The company also generated nearly $175 million of cash in the March quarter through working capital management, particularly as it relates to day sales outstanding and reductions in inventory levels throughout the quarter. ", "The company was able to respond to customer demand increases for Seagate products throughout the quarter resulting in share increases in the notebook and desktop markets. As a result of this increased demand for our products, the company was also able to accelerate the transition to newer platforms while reducing the inventory of lower margin legacy platforms.", "As we mentioned last quarter, we are encouraged by the progress of our product transitions and the accelerating ramp of new notebook and desktop products namely in the 2 1/2 inch 250 GB per platter and the 3 1/2 in GB per platter products. We expect the ongoing transition of these new product platforms to provide the foundation for continued improvement of gross margins into fiscal 2010. ", "Opportunities for mid to long term improvements that will support margin accretion as well as top line revenue growth include the following; in sales and product line management. First optimizing the product portfolio and mix for profitability, second better discipline around and senior management control of demand generation activities and third better management of inventory during product transitions.", "In operations and development, first improved absorption from capacity reductions and utilization rates, second greater integration of Seagate components, third improved execution on product and component ramp to yield and fourth, broader leveraging of our core technologies across products.", "Going forward, we expect further organizational restructuring before the end of fiscal year 2009. We believe this action, coupled with the restructuring and improvements mentioned earlier will allow us to achieve a cost structure that supports our operating expense projections.", "In addition we are looking at opportunities throughout the business to significantly decrease operating expenses and continually improve business processes. Through improved leverage of our processes and investments, we can position the company for sustained leadership and profitability. As a result, our long term gross margin is 18% to 24% on a revenue base of approximately $2.2 billion to $2.5 billion per quarter, assuming a more stable macro economic environment.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Dave Mosley, Executive Vice President of Sales, Marketing and Product Line Management. Dave has been with Seagate for 13 years in a series of executive management roles and enterprise desktop and notebook product development and most recently as head of our global operations.", "Dave Mosley", "Before I provide details on the current market environment, I'd like to give a quick description of the organizational changes we have made. As Steve indicated we've been repositioning the organization to address the current demand environment and simplifying and improving business processes. ", "We have identified a few key areas of immediate focus. First, optimizing the product road maps and mix for profitability by accelerating new product transitions, second, improving business processes around demand generation activities and finally, effective inventory management during product transitions. The functional organization structure provides the process leverage that was the foundation of our model before and had been less efficient in our recent business unit structure. ", "Now I'll provide some market commentary. Specific to the March quarter, Seagate shipped 38.4 million units against an overall industry total available market of approximately 112 million units, both of which were higher than the company expected at the beginning of the quarter. The increase in industry TAM was primarily a function of adjusting the supply chain that was depleted as days of supply levels exiting the calendar year that did not support end user demand.", "Throughout the quarter we were able to meet demand increases from customers in the notebook and desktop markets which drove significant share gains in both markets. Product mix was less favorable than planned as we shipped higher volumes of lower capacity product. We did receive a benefit from this as we were able to sell through our older inventory which positioned us to move to our newer, more cost effective platforms. Finally, pricing for the March quarter was in aggregate less aggressive than we had planned.", "Now I'll give some detail on individual markets. In the enterprise space the TAM in the March quarter was approximately 5.6 units which was down roughly 20% quarter over quarter. Seagate maintained its leadership position in this space during the quarter, shipping 3.4 million units. We believe this current TAM is stabilized at these levels largely due to replacement demand in the IT sectors. ", "As a result, for the June quarter we are expecting the overall enterprise market demand to be flat sequentially. While it's difficult to predict when, we do foresee growth returning to this market based on the continued increase in content creation in the enterprise.", "Specific to solid state drives in the enterprise, penetration has begun in the highly transactional work load environments today representing less than 5% of the total enterprise storage by revenue and less than 1% of if by shipments. We believe this will grow and expect to participate in this market in fiscal 2010.", "The TAM in the desktop computer market for the March quarter was approximately 52 million units. We believe Seagate gained significant share in this market as we shipped an industry leading 22 million units during the quarter. Adoption of our more cost effective 500 GB per platter configurations is progressing well. For the June quarter we expect the desktop compute TAM to be relatively flat sequentially. ", "We are also encouraged by the consistency in the consumer electronics market where we shipped 3.9 million units in the DVR applications which was essentially flat quarter over quarter.", "With regards to the mobile compute market, the overall TAM was approximately 39 million units in the March quarter and Seagate shipped 8.9 million units resulting in significant market share increases.", "As I mentioned earlier, we did experience strong demand for lower capacity products in this market and we were able to meet that demand. The movement of this inventory better positions Seagate for the ongoing transition to the 250 GB per platter 2.5 inch platform this quarter.", "That 250 GB per disk per platform is transitioning well which Bob will discuss in a moment, but I'd like to point out that we believe our non captive, i.e. non branded market share of 500 GB two disk products was comparable to the competition in number of units shipped. We expect the June quarter for the mobile compute market to exhibit a seasonal decrease in unit demand.", "In branded solutions we are encouraged by our ongoing market share growth and acceptance of our products. We grew our branded solutions revenue sequentially in both 3.5 inch and 2.5 inch form factors at a faster rate than the market and we reduced inventory. ", "Finally, the newly reorganized sales and product line management organization is focused on continued operational improvement in the areas in our control that could contribute to our margin recovery.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Whitmore to provide an update on our operations and development.", "Robert Whitmore", "I'll start with an update on products and technology followed by operations and then finally an outlook for capital spending. As I stated last quarter, we had not been satisfied with the consistency of our product execution in recent quarters and have been working to resolve that issue.", "I'm happy to report that we continue to see steady improvement in executing to our strategy of sustained product and technology leadership. While we are pleased with our progress this will remain the highest priority and believe there is room for more improvement.", "Last quarter, I reported the progress towards introducing the industry's highest arial density into our notebook, desktop and enterprise platforms. Today my report is focused on the product transition of those platforms. With the majority of our customer qualifications now complete, the factories are concentrating on converting to these higher arial density products.", "To give you a feel for our transition progress, I will provide you with a combined production percentage of our desktop 500 GB per platter and our notebook 250 GB per platter products versus the previous generation.", "We exited the December quarter at under 5% of production for the new versus old products. Exiting the June quarter, we expect that number to be in excess of 50% new versus old. Our focus this quarter will continue to be on product line transitions, yield improvement, factory ramps and sustained quality growth.", "Both our new desktop and notebook product yields support our plans to rapidly convert the factories to high volume production. I would also add that both of these platforms and qualified and shipping with internal and external heads and media. ", "As for enterprise, our new 10,000 and 15,000 rpm products are fully qualified and largely transitioned within the factories. In addition to our industry leading enterprise product lines, we remain committed to solid state development and are on tract to deliver our first enterprise SSD product shipments later this calendar year.", "We have increased our development focus on solid state and will continue to invest the appropriate resources to be successful in this emerging storage market. Overall, customer qualifications, the factory transitions of our new products are progressing well and will play an important role in improving margins and driving sustained product leadership.", "I would now like to provide some insight into Seagate's manufacturing operations. Over the last six months, while the macro economic conditions deteriorated, and demand for disk drives contracted rapidly, we have been adapting our manufacturing operations accordingly. Since the beginning of our fiscal year, we have reduced head count and support structure across our manufacturing sites.", "Simultaneously we have adjusted our factory lay outs and taking capital off line consistent with that structural reduction. We are currently reviewing operations to further reduce the company's fixed overhead cost structure going forward. This will continue to be reviewed in the coming quarter.", "In regards to capital investments, we are on tract to achieve the targets we communicated last quarter. We continue to minimize our capital spending consistent with the current demand environment and therefore most capital investment going forward will be targeted primarily at technology transitions.", "As such, capital investments for the March quarter were $59 million which supports our outlook for fiscal year 2009 of approximately $650 million.", "Our outlook for fiscal year 2010 has been reduced from last quarter's forecast. We believe we can believe our capital investments at approximately $450 million in fiscal year 2010 while continuing the necessary investments in our core technology. We will continue to evaluate both the manufacturing strategy and the capital outlook as the demand environment evolves.", "In summary, my team remains focused on sustained product and technology leadership, maximizing our scale and leverage to Seagate components and optimizing our manufacturing structure. ", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Pat O'Malley.", "Patrick O'Malley", "You'll find the company's press release, 8-K and additional financial information related to Seagate's financial performance and other supplemental information in the investor relations section of Seagate's website at seagate.com.", "We said in January that our priority in the near term would be improving liquidity and strengthening the balance sheet. Significant progress was made over the last three months so I'd like to touch on some of the many actions we have taken.", "First, we successfully amended the terms and conditions of our revolving credit facility including adjustments to the financial covenants that we believe provide flexibility to fund the restructuring needed to reduce the company's cost structure and continue to invest in technology.", "Second, last week we issued $430 of senior second lien secured debt. The proceeds are expected to be utilized to address upcoming debt maturities. This should not be viewed as incremental debt added to the capital structure.", "Third, we have ceased quarterly dividends which will enable the company to reduce annual cash flow by approximately $230 million. ", "And fourth, the company did an outstanding job of optimizing working capital specifically inventory, which yielded a significant increase to the cash balance during the quarter.", "Taken all together, these actions better position the company to address it's near and mid term debt obligations.", "Now I'll cover some of the details. Cash, cash equivalents and short term investment ended the quarter at $1.5 billion, up $172 million from the previous quarter. It should be noted the company paid in aggregate approximately $150 million in cash restructuring, dividends and interest during the March quarter.", "Cash flow from operations was $239 million for the quarter, while free cash flow defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures was $180 million. Depreciation and amortization for the March quarter was $226 million including approximately $16 million of purchased intangibles amortizations and $11 million for accelerated depreciation related to the fixed assets at facilities we previously announced were closing.", "Cash conversion metrics are as follows: day sales outstanding was 37, days payable outstanding was 63 and days inventory outstanding was 26 for a cash conversion cycle of zero days, an improvement of 15 days compared to the prior quarter.", "The improvement in DSO reflects revenue linearity and a higher percentage of revenue from the distribution channel. Looking forward, we expect the cash conversion cycle to move back toward the low double digit range and DSO normalizes and inventory turns stabilize in the 11 to 13 range.", "Inventory turns improved from 10 to almost 14 as the company tightly managed production and used the steady demand throughout the quarter to significantly work down the inventory of older, more costly product configurations.", "Inventory in aggregate decreased by $219 million or 28% compared to the prior quarter as finished goods decreased $116 million and work in process and raw materials decreased by $51 million. Distribution channel for Seagate products once again ended the four weeks using a four week training average. We believe inventory of Seagate products in the distribution channel is appropriately aligned with the near term demand environment.", "Now I'll provide some comments regarding the March quarter financial results. For the March quarter, Seagate's unit shipments were 38.4 million, up 5% compared to the prior quarter while down 10% compared to a year ago quarter. ", "Reported revenue for the quarter was $2.1 billion above our expectations due primarily to improved demand for 2.5 inch and 3.5 inch Seagate products, a modestly higher overall total available market and slightly favorable pricing primarily in the retail branded market. Offsetting these favorable items was a lower capacity mix in the desktop and enterprise markets.", "Gross margins for the March quarter decreased by approximately 700 basis points compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to lower factory utilization as we aggressively managed inventory, a 20% reduction in the enterprise unit TAM and the sell through of older products in inventory.", "R&D and SG&A totaled $377 million for the March quarter and include costs related to acquisitions of $2 million and accelerated depreciation of $11 million related to our closing of the Pittsburg research center. During the March quarter, we recorded an additional $25 million of restructuring charges that substantially relates to global headcount reduction actions.", "Now, I will address the business outlook for the June quarter. While there are signs of improved visibility the ongoing uncertainty in the global economic conditions make it difficult to predict product demand and other related matters which makes it more likely that Seagate's actually results could differ materially from expectations.", "For planning purposes, the company expects the overall demand for disk drives to be relatively flat as compared to the March quarter and the pricing environment to be consistent with historical June levels. Specifically, the company expects the following; revenue to be approximately to be $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion, gross margins for the June quarter to improve by 300 to 400 basis points as we continue to transition volume to the new product platforms and improve factory utilization rates. ", "Product development and SG&A costs are expected to be approximately $340 million in the June quarter, down approximately 18% compared to the year ago quarter. Other income and expense to be a net expense of approximately $40 million and a book tax expense due to discrete items in the range of zero to $15 million.", "As such, the company expects a loss per share of $0.37 to $0.47 which includes charges of approximately $41 million of costs or $0.08 per share for restructuring, purchase intangibles. amortization and other charges associated with acquisitions.", "As part of the company's ongoing cost structure alignment, additional restructuring actions are currently being addressed. The company believes opportunities exist to reduce operating costs and product development, marketing, administrative and manufacturing areas to target a cost structure that generates positive cash flow and earnings with fiscal year 2010.", "The estimated cost of additional restructuring activities has yet to be determined. Consequently, the company expects to incur additional restructuring charges in the June quarter of an undetermined amount.", "That concludes my remarks for today.", "Steve Luczo", "On behalf of the management team, I'd like to thank Seagate employees around the world for their continued commitment and effort during this time of change, and I'd also like to thank our customers, suppliers and partners, investors for their ongoing support, collaboration and confidence in Seagate.", "We're ready to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Keith Bachman \u2013 Bank of Montreal.", "Keith Bachman \u2013 Bank of Montreal", "A couple of times you mentioned having products in the SSD space. I was hoping your could flush that out a little bit. What's Seagate, how are you going to drive value in that area? How do you compete with your existing products in terms of margins in the enterprise space?", "Steve Luczo", "We're not disclosing specific product strategy there yet, but I think we can articulate it enough to say that as we look at the margin analysis from our viewpoint today, leveraging the expertise that we have in the enterprise market which is where we think the SSD is going to play first, for us at least, that a lot of the value obviously relates to things other than heads and disks.", "Of course there will be a lot more competitors in there with significant market share. So writing to different media while providing maybe some different technical challenges, we still think that there's a great margin opportunity for us and it shouldn't be ultimately that different than what we get in the enterprise sector today.", "Again, I think SSD is really fast memory and we think anything that improves performance of systems will then also drive additional storage which would also probably drive the necessary requirement of greater storage behind it which would most likely be in rotating magnetic's. So it's the hierarchy that we're looking at and we'll basically be rolling out a product strategy through the rest of the fiscal year 2010.", "", "Keith Bachman \u2013 Bank of Montreal", "Just so I'm clear, I think you said before the end of the calendar year you'll be rolling out products in the SSD side? Did I hear that correctly?", "Steve Luczo", "It will be in fiscal year 2010 and I think just depending on some of the issues that we're working with our customers on, I don't really want to disclose specifically the timing, but it's the end of 2009 or the beginning of 2010 because a lot of it relates to the work we're doing with specific customers. But it's 2010 event.", "Keith Bachman \u2013 Bank of Montreal", "You mentioned OpEx is $340 million and then additional restructuring. Is there any color that you can or want to add on how OpEx unfolds post the June quarter and then obviously the fourth?", "Patrick O'Malley", "We talked about this last week, but our intent is to drive an OpEx model of under $300 million per quarter. We aim to do that more near term than longer term, but as I said we're going through and addressing our plans but hope to have those underpinned shortly and we can come to the mark and be very clear, but the target is to get that under $300 million in short order.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Rob Ferro \u2013 Carris & Company]", "[Rob Ferro \u2013 Carris & Company]", "On your depreciation is still even X items call it $200 million a quarter. It's a lot higher than it was a few years ago. Is that the type of thing where there's anything you can do to try to bring that down in terms of asset write downs, that sort of thing just because I would imagine that's a pretty big weight on your gross margin even though maybe it's a cash flow cushion. Is there anything you can do there to try to get that number down?", "A question on desktop units, I had some people ask, you went another quarter with really low channel inventory. You had a nice rebound in desktop units. I guess any indication of channel inventory coming out of it and how do you feel comfortable that you didn't over ship?", "Patrick O'Malley", "On depreciation, obviously one way to lower depreciation is lower your CapEx which we're in the process of doing. Last year we added $980 million. This year we're targeting $650 million and next year around $450 million. So that's obviously the easy answer.", "Now as we go through the factory utilization and we look at excess capacity, as we shut down facilities we certainly would be required to write those off as in the January action that we did was primary cash related, it was people related. And so there was no facilities, but as we go through this factory footprint, there will be opportunities to write that depreciation off.", "But first and foremost is to preserve cash, so as Bob highlighted, we're driving the factory the most effective utilization today, will draft the overhead of the depreciation and existing depreciation as we continue to rationalize our footprint.", "[Rob Ferro \u2013 Carris & Company]", "Do you have any kind of depreciation target for fiscal 2010 yet or is that too early?", "Patrick O'Malley", "That would be too early given that some of that would tie into restructuring plans, but we certainly as that comes through will be able to clarify that. But as I said, first and foremost is driving down the CapEx will clearly start flowing through the numbers next year.", "Dave Mosley", "I'll answer your question on the channel inventory. The 3.5 inch like we said at the start of the quarter there was some rebound that occurred in the channel that lasted through January, but I think some of that was temporary replenishment of inventory positions that were very low going into the quarter.", "We exited the quarter with below four weeks in the channel, well within our goals so we think we're on track right now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kathryn Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Kathryn Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I just want to confirm your comments around the fiscal 2010 profitability goal and the confirmation is you are not looking for a revenue uptick, rather can hit that profitability with the cost plans you have in place and just confirm that. And then on the back of it, if we do see a seasonal uptick in unit shipments in the second half of this calendar year, is it possible to actually hit break even or even a slight profit in the first half of fiscal 2010?", "Steve Luczo", "The answer is yes to the first part. I think you said the cost plans in place. I think that is and to be announced, but if you include that in your statement, the answer is yes to the first question. And to the second question, the answer is yes as well.", "Kathryn Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "And given how important the enterprise is to margin performance, can you just comment on whether you've seen any signs of stabilization or even an uptick in the enterprise business in recent weeks?", "Steve Luczo", "I don't want to kind of address it specifically in terms of recent weeks because the enterprise customer base is fairly narrow and we don't like talking about our customers. But I think a more general statement, we believe that corporations and IT infrastructure has probably been aggressively managed and is likely to be aggressively managed until people see better traction in the overall macro economic condition.", "Therefore, while I think there's been signs of improvement certainly in the last several weeks or even a couple of months globally, I think most companies and people running companies would say until that continues for at least a period longer than one or two quarters, it's probably hard to imagine that things are going to improve drastically in terms of the people letting the capital flow which would obviously impact some of the broader based computing systems.", "So our view is probably relatively flat for the next quarter or two. I think the encouraging part of the enterprise segment is we do believe that is more likely to come back in a more of a step function format with maybe some pops in demand that are more dramatic than notebook and desktop where the return of growth is probably more gradual.", "Kathryn Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "You did a good job taking share in the branded business in 2.5 inch and 3.5 inch. Any reason to believe that market share traction is not sustainable into the second quarter?", "Steve Luczo", "I think as Dave pointed out, I think the share gains were a function of two things. One was our ability to deliver some of the legacy products that were lower capacity and we see as you a shift down to some of the lower capacity products. But the other point which I think is just as important is the traction with our new products, both the 250 on the 2.5 inch and the 500 on the 3.5 inch and we expect that with our continued improvement and ramp yields on that and qualifications with customers that that's a product offering that if you compare it to a year ago, certainly is much more compelling and competitive from a competitive perspective.", "So we would expect that we can continue to execute there, basically offering good products. This is not related to trying to buy market share. It's just by executing a good product delivery.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company.", "Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "As you look at your manufacturing mix of 2.5 inch versus notebook, where are you relative to where you think the market could be a year from now? Obviously desktop has been replaced by notebooks in many situations but 3.5 inch goes still into other applications so for overall footprint when you're talking about consolidation is this an element of it or do you think you have the right mix now? Any comments on that relative mix within your manufacturing.", "Robert Whitmore", "We do see the transition between 3.5 and 2.5. That's a part of the equation but not the whole factor. It really depends on where we end up with overall TAM's I think in large part. So I think that's a factor. We've got manufacturing equipment that's pretty flexible and we can manage between the two form factors pretty readily.", "But I think the footprint is going to be determined more by what we end up with max capacity in the quarter. I think as we go through the next couple of years that may become more of a factor but certainly in the next year, probably a larger part of just overall TAM per quarter.", "Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "Obviously this downturn has affected everyone but sometimes the effect is a little magnified as you move further into the supply chain. Have you seen anything within the substrate world for example or any other components that has given you pause?", "Robert Whitmore", "No, I think as we've gone through this macro economic downturn we stayed real close to our suppliers. Obviously we're in what I call an over capacity position across the board. We don't see any issues with regards to substrates, be it glass or aluminum and we're in pretty good position here for the next couple of quarters unless things significantly change.", "Steve Luczo", "It's one of the areas of the industry really if you think about the TAM going from 150 million units to 112 million or wherever it settles for the March quarter, that the industry is actually managed itself extremely well in terms of adjusting to that drop off and as we talked about last quarter, so much of that drop off actually occurred in about a three week period, not really a six month period, and obviously our customers adjusted their supply chain and the drive industry adjusted it, and the supply chain behind it had to adjust it, and as you mentioned as you go further down the supply chain, the more pressures exist.", "But really as an industry, really nothing really broke which is actually pretty impressive I think and most companies at this point have adjusted to the point where the new TAM's are where people are trying to balance supply and demand and work business models that are cash flow positive and earnings positive at these levels so I think thus far the industry has reacted quite well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Bailey \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "David Bailey \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "How much if any of the weakness in traditional enterprise drives do you think is due from a more permanent shift to Sada rather than a weaker end demand environment?", "Dave Mosley", "I think to answer your question the weakness that we've seen in the last couple of quarters in mission critical is not correlated to business critical, what we call business critical. The business critical space is we think that the TAM is down about 22% quarter over quarter but mission critical itself which is what I spoke to as enterprise was probably more influenced by IT spend directly that the transactional spaces and then I'll call it the highest capacity boxes.", "The business critical side was down as a function of some macro economic stuff that started two quarters or three quarters earlier relative to the cloud compute space. We think that side if any will come back first based on pent up demand and its a trend we're watching, but the comment that I made earlier, we weren't correlating the two.", "David Bailey \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Can you talk a little bit about the gross margins of the drives that you sell that go into notebooks relative to your other product lines and your notebook drives?", "Patrick O'Malley", "We don't break margins that specifically but obviously a notebook space that's growing in this and we design products to try and hit the acceptable margin in each segment.", "David Bailey \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Does that mean that you have comparable gross margins with the products designed for notebooks?", "Patrick O'Malley", "We think we get acceptable gross margins for a target market application.", "", "Steve Luczo", "I think the good thing about the notebook is again, we're actually probably at the end of the day as focused or more focuses on gross profit dollars than gross margins. Gross profit dollars is what basically funds our operating expense structure and as you know our operating expense structure is now returning to one that is saying how do we leverage our R&D and factories across all of our product lines.", "So it's a model that really says, does that market offer the opportunity for additional gross profit dollars that fund the incremental leverage off of the underlying investment and the answer is absolutely. That's just more units going out the door that does lots of things for us in terms of absorption on heads and media, leveraging our overall R&D expense whether that's component or drive related and puts more compute power in the hands of more people that are hooking up to basically a big sky full of disc drives somewhere.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Moskowitz \u2013 J.P. Morgan.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "You talked about your normalized target rates as far as gross margins of 18% to 24% and $2.2 billion or $2.5 billion in revenue threshold, can you give us a little more though kind of going off Rich's question in terms of the mix. How should we think about the mix a year or two out? Is there going to be kind a step function down away from the enterprise maybe because of the data compression technologies, virtualization, maybe provisioning hurting you guys also solid state drive and thereby it's going to be really based on just an ultra focus on bill materials, leaner cost structure in the notebook, in the branded and probably solid state drives. How should we think about it?", "Steve Luczo", "I guess I certainly accept the second half of that. We want to make sure that we're optimizing our cost structure for the product categories that you talked about, but I guess the first part of it, I don't know that I could sit here today and view what the world might look like three years from now.", "But I would say again if anything for example, solid state storage, that's fast memory and if what you're doing is saying that you have a big block of fast memory, that means it needs somehow to have a big block of data in there to munch. And once it munches that data what exactly is it going to do with that data spit it out into the air?", "It's going to go put it back on the rotating magnetic drives that it came from and to the extent that they're making systems that are more and more capable of doing that affordably across more and more application spaces, that's a good thing for us, and particularly because we're going to play in the SSD space.", "Whether or not it goes tier one, tier two, to tier zero to tier two we can argue about it. We could see what happens once the systems people really decide. Right now the only architecture we really have seen from the storage subsystems companies, the host computer companies are the server companies are really still architecting those systems but at the end of the day what those systems are really about is being more efficient in terms of driving better application utilization which really means more data.", "And I think you hit a good point. On virtualization, people thought that server virtualization was going to impact storage negatively and in fact we believe if anything it probably helped storage because it just meant that there was more processing power which meant therefore people needed more data to process.", "So I think that whole scheme is to play out and as we manage our portfolio going forward I think the more critical point is for us to keep engaged with those enterprise level customers to make sure that we're offering a complete suite of products. So in that sense, our product line will remain the most extensive and broadest. How it really mixes in terms of contribution margin at the operating level, it's to be seen.  But I still think all of this is beneficial for us as basically new technologies are deployed.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "So you really don't think there's a need for any major structural change in the revenue model. The reason I ask is I know you're just throwing this out as kind of a base line as far as the quarterly run rate to give us better mile post and we do appreciate it but as I look back these are revenue thresholds that haven't been touched since 2002 for the most part so I understand and appreciate how we're in a real tough period and it's going to take a few years probably to get back to 2005 or 2006 levels for the industry but to think about you guidance run rate going back even seven, eight years, I think some investors may walk away and say there's something structurally changed. It kind of gets back to David's question about the enterprise.", "Steve Luczo", "Let me clarify that because that's how you interpret it. That wasn't really the direction. I think what every company is struggling with right now is where is the new new and because there doesn't appear to be enough data in the world to say that we're at a bottom, or that there's enough traction being gained basically in the banking system yet to understand that the global economies are going to be basically able to re-gear at these levels or lower or where.", "As we look at what happened last quarter and still from a planning purposes in terms of how we structure our company, we're not planning on revenue bailing us out. So we're structuring our company so that if the current macro economic environment persists again into 2010, that this company can cash flow and be earnings positive.", "You're asking kind of a different questions which is what we're trying to provide some visibility on is from what we've seen over the last few months, where does the company look like coming out of this thing, if it comes out of this thing in the summer of 2010, then I could see the company being in a 2.2 to 2.5 revenue rate and then growing from there.", "So my message isn't that this isn't a 2.2 to 2.5 company and that's where it stays, but we're trying to give people an idea of where does it likely gain traction and that number could change positively or negatively over the next six months depending on how the summer goes.", "The December quarter was a quarter that as we described, basically stopped functioning somewhere around December 10 and I think the concern about March was, was March going to be a three month quarter or not? And we came up to March 15 and demand had pretty much been stable if not building through the quarter in different markets and on March 15 things continued strong and everybody held their breath and said well maybe it's March 20th when everybody says we don't want anything.", "And the reality is we actually got stronger pulls through the end of the month as opposed to decreasing and then the orders for Q4 continued to build through March and we actually had to build inventory and carry inventory from March so we could fill April demand.", "If June turns out to be a three month quarter and September turns out to be a three month quarter, then I think our confidence level of being able to articulate what the revenue range looks like and ability to get to the gross margins that we're indentifying increases, but this is what we're just telling your now. ", "So it wasn't supposed to be a message of negativism. If anything I was thinking it was better than when we started at $1.6 billion to $2 billion a quarter ago.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "In terms of the gross margin commentary, can you help us out a little more? I think a lot of us out there have been talking lately about the manufacturing yields. Can you maybe walk us through the desktop and the notebook in terms of the new product platforms, where you think it is and are you at the 50% threshold going to 75% to 80% in terms of yields, and how should we thing about that time to really get the gross margins back up into the mid teens?", "Robert Whitman", "First of all, I'd just tell you because of competitive reasons we don't give specific yield numbers. There has been some discussion that our yields were on the low side like below 50% and that's not true. They're well above 50%. They're in a range where we can execute a ramp in the factories. Obviously when you're going through a new technology transition, you don't have mature technologies so we're not to that point yet.", "But we're in a position where we can execute the transition and set ourselves up to be in a position for next quarter and the next several quarters at the mature yields that we should be. So I'd say that this quarter is a transition mode. We're growing the yields in the factories, but we're certainly in a position to make the transition and convert.", "And that's really what we've been doing. Last quarter was all about qualification completion. This quarter it's all about transitioning through the older products and into the new and next quarter it's all about being as secure as we can with the new products.", "I'll add one element that as Steve said, on the quicker transition of older than new that's much more important than yield. Now obviously you have to have acceptable yield to transition but taking out heads and disks are much more valuable to the margin accretion. So as we transition these newer products, that element of lowering the build materials will be much more important as we drive the margin accretion.", "I want to clarify I think you have to go to 2006 to see the $8 billion to $10 billion revenue range, so I'm not sure it went back to 2002. I don't have my numbers in front of me but I think it's closer to 2005 or 2006.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "On the cash flow perspective, do you think maybe the inventory level that Seagate has become rather lean and you may have to build up some inventory in June and would that result in possibly negative cash in the June quarter?", "Patrick O'Malley", "Obviously running a zero cash conversion cycle as proud as I am to how we managed cash, I'm not necessary signed up to it and say there's elements to that but by inventory this quarter we had a specific plan to drive to this level. In fact we probably ran a little higher to support April's demand so I think we'll continue to manage inventory effectively as we've done.", "We'll add a little more onto the books. That will really depend on how we see July but we'll make that trade off all day long on how to supply what's in front of us versus what's on the balance sheet. We think we're still in a position to do that. ", "It certainly may go 11 to 13 versus the 14, but we feel very comfortable how we're managing our inventory right now.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "It sounds like you don't really have to not build back a lot of inventory beyond what happens with demand so you should still be able to be positive cash, you should be able to generate cash in the June quarter as well?", "Patrick O'Malley", "We targeted maybe getting into a cash conversion cycle [inaudible] that would imply using cash from the balance sheet from operations certainly from what we've done this quarter we certainly would be up 400 basis points and we will continue to manage the balance sheet very tightly, but we'll do those trade offs as we see appropriate what volume is in front of us as we end the quarter.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Could you give us the details with regard to, you gave three items effectively driving the meaningful decline in the gross margin, utilization, enterprise mix as well as sell through of inventory. Can you break down and give us some color of what the contributions were from each of those?", "Patrick O'Malley", "I'd say in order of magnitude and that's probably a fair way to look at it and so we're certainly addressing the utilization in the factory with the depreciation and overhead, we're certainly managing our cash. We'll continue to look at our footprint, but utilization of our factory, whether it's people, whether it's the footprint of overhead, that's certainly we're challenged on that in the short term, but we continue to look at that.", "Obviously with our strength in the enterprise business, that's a significant element of our business model and so we're aligning the business appropriately to support whatever the new new is and we've seen where we think the bottom may be.", "And then as we transition as Bob talked about into new products, it's about half the magnitude of the other two. It certainly has a quick tail to start driving the accretions so I'd say as much as driving the accretion you want to put some quantification is that product transition and then slight factory utilization.", "But the product transitions are the quicker tail to recovery. The footprint and the enterprise will be a longer tail to recovery.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "The retail business looks like it showed actually some sequential relative out performance, pretty strong results on a sequential basis. Can you talk a little bit about what you're doing there relative to your competitor?", "Steve Luczo", "I think in the branded space you're right. I think it's actually for the last couple of quarters we've been gaining more share and I think it's probably just better execution in terms of the product offerings that we have and better management into the customer base and identifying the key customers where shelf space is really critical and servicing those customers with good product and good support around the product. So we expect that that would probably continues.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "With regard to you talking about the 250 Gig ram, I believe that the next step from a technology perspective is 320 and I think one of the merchant providers out there noting that that's more of a mid 2009 inflection point. Can you say at this point where you're at in terms of 320 per platter and the 2.5 inch drive?", "Steve Luczo", "We're not going to disclose that obviously for competitive reasons and again, we feel that with our 250 and 500 it seems to us we're certainly doing well relative to the competition and we're focused right now on getting our customers up and running on that platform. That transition is key for us here in the next six months so we obviously continue to pay attention to the products in development that will basically replace these products when they become legacy, but they're just babies in the carriage right now. I think we'll just get them walking and running and worry about the new guys next.", "Operator", "That concludes Seagate's' conference call.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Luczo ", "On the call with me are Pat O\u2019Malley, our Chief Financial Officer; Bob Whitmore, our Chief Technology Officer and Head of R&D and Head of Manufacturing Operations; and Dave Mosley, Head of Global Sales and Product Line Management.", "As we discussed last quarter, our management team is committed to accelerating the improvement in our operational and financial performance with the goal of returning to a sustained GAAP profitability as soon as possible.  By focusing on our core competencies technology and manufacturing to achieve consistent product leadership, we are making meaningful progress in achieving this objective as reflected by our fiscal Q4 2009 financial results.", "We have improved the way we manage our product line to position us for profitable leadership based on performance, quality and costs.  We have instituted better processes around factor utilization, demand generation and inventory management to more closely match supply with demand and with more linearity throughout the quarter.  We are returning to the platform strategy to provide accelerated response to customer needs while leveraging our industry leading technical and manufacturing investments.", "Importantly, for our long term growth we have redeployed our technical resources to refocus on aerial density leadership across all of our products.  And, as we previously stated, we will continue to make adjustments to our manufacturing infrastructure and to a broad based of organizational processes to further optimize capacity and profitability.  ", "The positive impact of these efforts is also reflected at the product level as evidenced by the recent announcements and customer acceptance in the 2.5 inch and 3.5 inch product lines which Dave and Bob will discuss shortly.  During the last six months, demand for disc drives has been stronger than we planned at the beginning of each quarter.  Our WIP inventory and our finished goods inventory in factory, transit and hubs are all at minimal levels.  In addition, we have no indications of a buildup of inventory in the supply chain, at OEMs or at distribution as we close the June quarter or thus far in the September quarter.", "In addition, the enterprise market which has experienced a significant reduction in demand since June of 2008 is starting to exhibit signs of improvement.  While over all visibility is improving, there is still the possibility for significant variability in our outlook for the September quarter and throughout fiscal year 2010.  ", "The growth in the TAM since December 2008 is encouraging and is indicative of the ever present need for storage devices across the customer base.  Despite the relative strength shown in the first half of calendar 2009, as well as the fairly robust projections for the remainder of the year offered by some industry analysts, we are approaching the September quarter cautiously with respect to our production volumes and product mix.  We continue to manage our factories with an intense focus on maximizing our return on invested capital through optimized inventory management while satisfying our customer requirements and still being able to appropriately respond to demand upsides if we have been too conservative in our growth expectations.", "Such upsides would result in improved financial performance relative to our outlook.  Pat will discuss the company\u2019s financial outlook in more detail shortly.  While we are planning for modest sequential growth in September quarter with a TAM of 135 to 140 units and no significant share shifts, Seagate expects to continue to optimize our operational and financial performance with increasing revenues, gross margins and operating margins.  ", "As the overall demand for storage remains resilient, we believe that technology generally and storage in particular are proving to be structurally important even in the current depressed economic environment.  As increasing amounts of content are created each day and the application environment broadens, the demand for storage continues its long term growth path in terms of terabytes required.  For example, although the year-over-year industry TAM stayed relatively flat, the average capacity of a 3.5 inch ATA drive shift increased by 45%.", "In addition, the technology advancements of hard disk drives and other complementary storage products are creating new opportunities for Seagate in the home, in commercial enterprises of all sizes and a wide variety of mobile devices, all of which require highly reliable, affordable, accessible and connected storage.  Seagate continues to offer customers the broadest disk drive product lines, as a result of our industry leading investment in technology and manufacturing resources.  We believe that this breadth and scale of disk drive technology is critical to participating in the evolving opportunities presented by the mobile content rich connected world.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Dave to discuss specific market dynamics in fiscal Q4 and going in to fiscal Q1.", "W. David Mosley ", "Closing fiscal year with positive momentum is an encouraging sign that the actions we are taking to return Seagate to market leadership and profitability are working.  Overall market demand for storage capacity has recovered faster than expected in spite of the economic conditions underscoring that the rapid creation of digital content and information has not slowed.  Our core strategy going in to fiscal 2010 will be to focus on demand generation and product portfolio optimization for quality of share taking advantage of technology positioning in different markets and providing improved cost solutions for capacity points that service the market needs of our customers.  ", "Now, I\u2019ll provide some commentary on Q4 and a look to Q1.  Seagate shipped 40.6 million units in June quarter, up 6% sequentially.  The overall industry shipped a total of approximately 132 million units during the quarter, essentially flat from the year ago quarter but markedly up by 17% quarter-over-quarter.  Demand in all markets was fairly linear and steadily increasing throughout the quarter and we were able to appropriately respond to demand upsides.  We transitioned to new more cost effective product platforms and experienced an improved product mix in all markets across our portfolio contributing to our margin growth.", "Relative to our prior expectations we believe we outperformed our competitors in these current product transitions.  The June quarter was unique in that we have never seen calendar Q2 unit shipments significantly above calendar Q1.  For this reason, we are closely monitoring the sell through in client markets specifically while we responded to customer demand.  ", "Now, I\u2019ll give some detail on the individual markets, in the enterprise space, the total available market or TAM for the June quarter was approximately 5.9 million units which was up 5% quarter-over-quarter.  Seagate shipped 3.6 million units in this space during the quarter.  As we indicated last quarter we believe the enterprise TAM is stabilizing and now see further evidence that server shipments have begun to outstrip baseline enterprise equipment replacement rates.  As a result for the September quarter we are expecting the overall enterprise market demand to be up slightly from the June quarter.  Should market conditions improve more rapidly we will continue to have the capacity to fill upside demand. ", "The TAM in the desktop market for the June quarter was approximately 54 million units, up 4% sequentially.  Seagate maintained its leadership position in this market as we shipped 22 million units in the quarter essentially flat from the March quarter.  Our 500 gigabyte per disk barracuda drives where we shipped roughly 9 million units are performing very well and receiving strong customer acceptance.  For the September quarter we expect a modest increase in the desktop TAM sequentially.  ", "In the mobile compute space the overall TAM was approximately 55 million units in the June quarter up 27% sequentially and 23% year-over-year.  Seagate\u2019s shipments grew 27% sequentially to 11.3 million units.  We continued to make solid progress during the quarter in our transition to 255 gigabyte per disk products in this market.  In addition, we believe we have the leading share position in the growing 7200 RPM portion of this market.  Overall, our customers are continuing to signal strong demand for our 2.5 inch products and we also expect further TAM growth in the September quarter.", "Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bob to provide an update on our operations and product development.", "Robert Whitmore ", "This afternoon I will provide an update on products and technology as well as an outlook for capital spending in fiscal year 2010.  As I\u2019ve stated for the last several quarters, our primary focus has been to improve our new product time to market execution and accelerate our product transitions.  We continue to make steady progress on both fronts and we\u2019ll maintain our focus towards sustained product and technology leadership going forward.", "Last quarter I discussed the importance of product transitions as it relates to our gross margin recovery specifically, in the 7200 RPM 500 gigabyte per disk desktop and 5400 RPM 250 gigabyte per disk notebook products.  Commensurate with our plan we were successful in transitioning the majority of our volume to these newer products which resulted in a positive impact to our gross margin as well as simplifying our factory output.  ", "In addition to these product lines, our 7200 RPM 250 gigabyte per disk 2.5 inch transition was well underway last quarter with a significant percentage of our 7200 RPM volume transitioning to this new platform.  Over the next two quarters we will continue to focus our attention towards yield improvement, factory ramps and customer transitions as these new products will represent the vast majority of our production volume.", "Launching new products at the next aerial density point continues to be an important priority as well and several significant milestones were achieved in the June quarter.  We delivered our aerial density leading 2.5 inch two disk 640 gigabyte drive to our US retail partners and will continue to ramp that product within this quarter.  Capacity leadership in the external retail business is a high priority making this milestone significant.  ", "As for enterprise, last week we announced the availability of our 7th generation 15000 RPM Cheetah product with capacities up to 600 gigabytes.  This is the latest addition in our industry leading enterprise product offerings.  Qualifications are in progress with all of our OEM customers with many qualifications complete and shipping.  Additionally, we completed several important qualifications of the industry\u2019s first 2.5 inch 500 gigabyte nearline product given our customers a form  factor option within this growing storage market.", "Our solid state product development is on track and we remain focused on delivering our first enterprise SSD later this calendar year.  We are fully engaged with our customers and supply chain partners and remain committed to delivering solid state storage devices with the performance and reliability this market demands.  Overall, we continue to focus our resources on time to market product and technology leadership as well as product transitions to [inaudible] our gross margin recovery.  We are making steady progress and we\u2019ll continue to have this as the highest priority.  ", "In regards to capital investments, we achieved the targets we communicated last quarter.  Capital investments for the June quarter were $80 million and for the fiscal year 2009 totaled $633 million, slightly below our target of $650 million.  The outlook for fiscal 2010 is unchanged as we believe we can manage our capital investments to approximately $450 million and still fund the necessary investments in our core technologies.  ", "As stated in previous communications we have sized our headcount and factory support structure commensurate with current level of demand and we will continue to evaluate the capital outlook as the demand environment evolves.  We also continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize and increase the efficiency of our internal supply chain with the intention of improving our manufacturing cost structure, flexibility and customer response time going forward.  ", "In summary, the team remains focused on sustained product and technology leadership, maximizing our scale and leverage with Seagate components and optimizing our manufacturing structure.  Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Pat O\u2019Malley.  ", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley ", "You\u2019ll find the company\u2019s press release, 8K and additional financial information related to Seagate\u2019s financial performance and other supplemental information in the investor relations sections of Seagate\u2019s website at www.Seagate.com.  I\u2019ll start with the income statement then touch on the balance sheet and close with some additional commentary for our September outlook.", "For the June quarter, Seagate\u2019s unit shipments were 40.6 million, up 6% compared to the prior quarter while down 6% compared to the year ago quarter.  Revenue for the quarter was $2.35 billion above the upper end of our outlook as demand remained constant through the end of the quarter.  Gross margins for the quarter expanded by approximately 1,000 basis points compared to the prior quarter due to a number of factors:  one, a favorable pricing environment as supply and demand remained in balance and we had a stronger competitor product position; two, improved factory utilization due to higher overall demand; three, transition to the new products in notebook and desktop; and four, a modest recovery in the enterprise unit TAM.", "While I have called out each of these factors separately, many of these factors are interdependent and are a direct result of significantly higher overall unit demand that Seagate appropriately responded to without having to add capital or capacity.  R&D and SG&A totaled $329 million for the June quarter, keeping us on track to achieve the targeted spending levels we previously communicated.  ", "During the June quarter we recorded an additional $85 million of restructuring related charges that substantially relates to the global headcount reduction actions we have undertaken during fiscal 2009.  The tax provision for the June quarter was $27 million and was higher than expected due to discreet items unique to the June quarter primarily the liquidation of Maxtor corporate structures.  We do not expect the discreet items impacting the book tax rate in the June quarter to increase the cash tax rate.", "For the past six months we have focused on strengthening the balance sheet and improving liquidity in large part to ensure we could address the debt that matures in the near term.  With that task completed we are now in the process of developing a strategic plan to optimize the capital structure for the long term.  At a high level, this will likely entail less long term debt and debt maturity profile that has more level than exists today.", "Now, for some comments specific to the balance sheet for the June quarter.  Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short term investments totaled approximately $2 billion at the end of the quarter, up $568 million from the previous quarter due to the debt offering we completed early in the June quarter that netted approximately $400 million in cash generated from operations.  ", "Restricted cash consists mainly of proceeds in escrow from a recent debt offering and cash in trust for the employee funded deferred compensation plan.  By keeping the proceeds of our recent debt offering in escrow with our credit banks, we will be able to treat it as refinancing the existing debt rather than incremental debt for purposes of calculating our leverage covenant.  ", "Cash flow from operations was $192 million for the quarter while free cash flow as $11 million.  The company paid in aggregate approximately $53 million in cash restructuring and interest during the June quarter.  Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter was $224 million including approximately $20 million of purchase intangibles amortization.  Cash conversion metrics were as follows: days sales outstanding was 40; days payable outstanding was 73; and days inventory outstanding was 27 for a cash conversion cycle of negative days, an improvement of six days compared to the prior quarter.", "It should be noted that during the June quarter we did not change payment terms.  Looking forward, if shipments remain fairly linear during the quarter like we have experienced the last two quarters we\u2019d expect the cash conversion cycle to be around zero days.  ", "Now, I will address the business outlook for the September quarter.  While we continue to see signs of improved visibility, the ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions makes it particularly difficult to predict product demand and other related matters which makes it more likely that Seagate\u2019s actual results could differ materially from current expectations.  Specifically, the company expects the following: revenue to be approximately $2.4 to $2.6 billion; gross margins for the September quarter to improve approximately 200 to 350 basis points as compared to the June quarter.  This improvement is predicated on the continued transition to the new product platforms and improved factor utilization rates. ", "The guidance range for gross margin is larger than we would typically provide and this reflects the lower than historical visibility that still exists in the business today.  R&D and SG&A costs are expected to be approximately $315 million.  Other income expense to be a net expense of approximately $40 million and a tax rate for planning purposes of 6%.  The September quarter outlook does not include the impact of any potential new restructuring activities, future mergers, acquisitions, financing, dispositions or other business combinations the company may undertake.", "That concludes my remarks for today.", "Stephen J. Luczo ", "On behalf of the management team I\u2019d like to recognize our employees for their focus and commitment as we progress towards our goals and I\u2019d also like to thank our customers, suppliers and partners for their ongoing support and confidence in Seagate.

This last quarter we exited it running a little bit more than 50% of our products with the new products.  We\u2019ll continue to grow that at a much higher level the vast majority in the Q1 and that will be the accelerant driving that.  As we fill our factories obviously, that leverage it will be maximized until the next step function.", "Analyst for David Bailey \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "If I can follow up, you mentioned favorable pricing because supply demand and balance, how about conditions today in to the third quarter, do you think supply and demand are in balance in to Q3?", "Robert Whitmore ", "As we see it early in the quarter we see it continuing with the velocity we left the last quarter and so we\u2019d say the supply demand is still in balance.

The backdrop is IDC was recently out suggesting that the sequential change in the PC market was about 5% to 6%.  You guys have indicated that you think the TAM was plus 17% quarter-over-quarter which is about what Intel suggests as well.  How do investors take some comfort that there isn\u2019t any inventory building, certainly it\u2019s not on your balance sheet.  And, I specifically wanted to just get some comfort on how deeply can you see in to the OEMs?  Are you comfortable that there\u2019s no inventories there that you\u2019re not aware of since you\u2019re on mostly JIT hubs?  Then, I have a follow up please.", "Stephen J. Luczo ", "I think you hit it on the head which is from our perspective and as far as we can tell in the industry given what\u2019s been reported that at least from the drive manufacturers perspective there\u2019s not inventory buildup.  So, we\u2019re clearly building to our customers\u2019 demand.  You\u2019ve also hit it on the head that some analysts for some reason are thinking that our customers are asking for too many products and being speculative on whether or not those products are sold through or not.  ", "Clearly, if they don\u2019t have disk drives in them they\u2019re not going to sell through, we know that for sure so if our customers are asking for our products and our inventories are at minimal levels as we\u2019ve indicated that\u2019s about the best we can do.  To answer your question for where we can see in to different downstream in the supply chain and it\u2019s variant obviously by customer and by type of customer, distribution is different than OEM and certain OEMs are different amongst each other but, as I indicated in my comments for what we can see we do not see the buildup in inventory that some of the, as you say, some of the bare side analyst have indicated.", "Now, that doesn\u2019t mean that it might not happen but all we can do then is see where sell through is, adjust to our customer response quickly and then maintain supply and demand.  I think the real question is how does the industry react if our customer base is overbought and I think it\u2019s just an issue of then adjusting demand at that point and supply in line with demand at that point.  Thus far though, we don\u2019t see those signs.", "Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Steve you can see pretty well on the desti side, right?", "Stephen J. Luczo ", "We can see very well in to the desti side, we can actually see decently well in to certain of our customers and as we\u2019ve indicated, the demand polls have continued strong.  And, as you also indicated, we do see our JIT hubs and our JIT hubs have been pulled very aggressively.  ", "Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Then my follow us I think for Pat, number one is what do you think the weighted average ASP Pat will do sequentially?  Then secondly, the cash flow was certain much better than I was anticipating, is there any color you could give us around expectations for September either cash flow from ops or free cash flow, however you want to characterize it?", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley ", "For the ASP I\u2019ll try to do that one justice, as you can tell from our even Q3 to Q4 we\u2019re trying to optimize capacity given where we\u2019re at so we are certainly looking with obtaining somewhat of a product leadership again in the 2.5 and 3.5, we\u2019re trying to optimize the higher capacity products to supply our customer needs because they\u2019re still pulling hard on that.  So obviously that mix would offset any pricing impact we\u2019re planning for seasonal pricing this quarter.  That\u2019s our expectation here so I would say that we should be able to keep that ASP relatively flat [inaudible] upwards bias.  That\u2019s number one.", "Then, on the cash I think quite honestly, we\u2019re running business week-to-week, that\u2019s how we\u2019re running it.  The team sits down, looks where the inventory is, if it\u2019s building up we cut back.  It\u2019s been fairly linear so if the business remains linear as it is, like I said the terms haven\u2019t really noticeably changed for anything in our business so that was probably the biggest effect to our model and if it continues that way, we think we can keep that cash conversion cycle near zero.

How has their commentary to you changed over the course of the quarter?", "Stephen J. Luczo ", "Rich I think everybody is running their business, as Pat just described, fairly tight.  I think the visibility has improved slightly.  If I look at accuracy of forecast and so on as I go throughout the quarter, things have improved.

", "Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "Then kind of a little bit of a longer term question, we seem to be at a tipping point, certainly within the Seagate model from a mix perspective. I mean the growth in the units on mobile was profound, 11.3 is definitely material especially as a percentage of the total and with desktops being overtaken by notebooks at the very point where you finally have a window, seven potentially driven refresh aging infrastructure, all this stuff over the next 12 to 18 months that we\u2019re going to be talking about, what do you think the Seagate mix looks like for fiscal 2010 between the major segments?", "Stephen J. Luczo ", "I think we\u2019ll probably follow the market on the trends there.  Obviously we\u2019d like to push where we have strengths in technology or product mix, product alignment and we noted that relative to for example 7200 RPM on the notebook.  But, I think in general we\u2019ll follow the market.  If that helps.", "Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "Do you think the supply chain is prepared for this type of mix?", "Stephen J. Luczo ", "Yes, I think people have been seeing it coming for quite some time and if anything, of late, just through the economic conditions that we\u2019ve seen in the last year there\u2019s been some flattening of the actual transition in the 3.5 inch side so I think the supply chain has been prepared.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "I guess first question, you\u2019ve touched again on the whole SSD question of timing around end of 2009, I\u2019m guessing calendar year at this point.  I guess what I want to know is when does that start to \u2013 I guess is that timing just from an introduction perspective or when do we expect to see qualifications?  Then I guess, any thoughts on the model implications at that point be it margin structure, etc.?", "Robert Whitmore ", "What I speak of at the end of the calendar year is really getting product in to OEM\u2019s hands so they can start their qualification process so that\u2019s really kind of the definition.  Then, calendar year \u201910 we\u2019ll go through qualifications and ramp up any kind of volume that they need to fulfill their requirements.  Hopefully, that gives you some clarity around the timing.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "I guess if I can follow on that, in terms of the enterprise business in general I think there\u2019s been some storage vendors out there that have started to implement technologies that allow tiering straight from an SSD to a SATA drive.  I guess from a longer term perspective how do we think about the evolution of SSDs and potentially the erosion that could present on the traditional enterprise hard drive market?", "Stephen J. Luczo ", "I guess I\u2019ll make an initial stab and then Dave can answer.  I think basically the way we view it is that architecturally anything that makes storage more efficient or faster is a good thing for anyone involved in storage.  SSD flash memory or whatever form of silicon can end up getting used is just super fast memory and if it\u2019s fast then it needs a lot of data moving in and out of it.  Is there applications where you could go from tier zero to tier II, I suppose there are but we happen to believe that probably the more prevalent enterprise architecture probably has some sort of staging of which data gets moved up closer to the SSD because you still have to have an application layer that\u2019s monitoring what you\u2019re throwing in to the SSD versus what you want to much with HDD so we think it\u2019s an overall architecture.", "The engagement that we\u2019ve had at the OEM level, I think that\u2019s probably the biggest range of architectural diversity that is going on.  I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to allude to in terms of given our product line and the relationships that we have with the customer base that spans every major OEM we\u2019re looking at nine or 10 different architectures that weigh different combinations of tier zero, tier I, tier II, SATA, SAS, fiber channel, grid, application driven, a variety of things and basically this is the battle ground that\u2019s starting to be formed not among SSD versus HDD.  That\u2019s why for us we\u2019re going after both markets.  ", "You could throw a couple of other technologies in there as well that involve silica or silicon and HDD but it\u2019s really what\u2019s starting to develop between the OEM spenders, the applications spenders, the server market place and storage subsystem market place.  The answer is too common and its evolving and it\u2019s going to be pretty dramatic I think over the next 15 years.  In the meantime a lot of storage is going to be sold and a lot of that is going to be HDD and a lot of that is going to be SSD.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "The final question for me is that in your gross margin guidance for this next quarter are you assuming a basic flattish mix in terms of enterprise as a contribution of your overall business?  What I\u2019m trying to understand is that as we look in to some stabilization and improving enterprise mix factors in your model, why shouldn\u2019t we be thinking that there\u2019s even a bit of upside relative potential to the gross margin guide you gave?", "Stephen J. Luczo ", "As I indicated in my comments, we are starting to see some traction in enterprise but what\u2019s been baked in to the forecast that we outlined for you was sequentially marginally improvement there.   So if it turns out that it\u2019s more robust than the plans that we have you\u2019d be right, we\u2019d have a better earnings profile.

Can you just talk a little bit more about how you are looking at that and what your trying to accomplish there?", "Stephen J. Luczo ", "I\u2019ll answer that because as Pat was saying it I could see where it may have had a different feel than we were trying to say.  The point was that when we came in a couple of quarters ago we clearly needed to sure up the balance sheet and make sure we had healthy cash position with respect to the debt obligations coming through as well as obviously investing in our technology and capital.  We feel that through the debt offer that we did earlier this quarter, the June quarter, that we\u2019re done on the capital raising side of any nature.  So yes, it could have been implied that there was some other form of financing to be done and certainly that\u2019s not the message we\u2019re trying to send.  ", "What we do want to indicate though is that with the existing debt structure that we have now, you\u2019ll notice that certain maturities are pretty peaky and while that debt is all at pretty low interest rates, especially in today\u2019s market and probably particularly in the future markets if inflation does start to accelerate, it would be nice to level out that payment stream.  Now, we can do that through virtual sinking funds and just putting cash off to the sides in our own minds or go out and buy some of those securities just so some of that debt is more level as we look out over the next five years or so.", "[Jake Cominey] \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "So it\u2019s kind of the 2011, 2012 time frame that you\u2019re looking?", "Stephen J.

What you\u2019ll find is in the branded market, the high capacity products are particularly important in terms of getting shelf space at the big retailers.  And of course, a lot of the high power users are always looking for max capacity.  So, we view our ability to be successful overall in that business to be making sure that we\u2019re participating in the high cap area which we hadn\u2019t been for the last two years.

Lastly, on notebook you talked about the 640 gig 2.5 inch retail product, when do we see you think a 320 gig per [platter] notebook driver kind of for the PC OEM channel?

Many of those employees were still on the payroll until July so we have a cross over so some affect of the employees that we had to go through the action in May will be reflected in numbers.  But also, with the upside of demand we certainly had the capacity in brick and mortar and tools in place but with the upside in demand most of that increase in headcount would be in labor in the Far East for responding to the upside.  So, we had the tools in place so we just went through our hiring plan to bring back some of the folks required to build those products.", "So, from our cost structure, as I talked about earlier, with $329 op ex this quarter going to $315 and getting to $300, that\u2019s still in line.

We\u2019re aligned with Dell and Intel on their comments as well.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Scott Schmidt \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Scott Schmidt \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Just a quick question, what was the biggest change from the June 24th update to today?  You were forecasting 120 million units at that time and now you said the TAM was 132 million, what was the biggest change?", "W. David Mosley ", "I think from just at the very end of the quarter the continued pull in some of the notebook markets surprised people and it may have been a pull in from the current quarter but, it may be true demand upsides as well.  I think that\u2019s the thing we\u2019re watching most carefully.  I made a comment about that in the client markets and it happened right at the end of the quarter.", "Stephen J. Luczo ", "I think as we\u2019ve indicated I think in all of our comments, we\u2019re really focused on the inventory management side of our business and I think when we were that late in the quarter given where some of the projections were starting to accelerate pretty quickly we just felt it was more prudent to not assume that was going to happen or not build to it, depending on what that demand was really all about.  Again, what we did see is kind of \u2013 and we actually talked to the same point in the March quarter you may remember and we got good pull through March in to April and we continued to get good pull through June and thus far in to July.  So, it does seem that the industry has moved to a more linear model up and down the supply chain which I think has a lot of benefits that can offset the fact that the TAM has obviously been depressed a little bit as a result of the global turn down.", "Scott Schmidt \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Is there any build in the inventory or any restocking?  I know you said it\u2019s mostly end demand but have you seen inventories uptick at all or is this really all end demand?", "Stephen J. Luczo ", "It\u2019s hard to tell from our perspective.  We haven\u2019t seen it build up certainly in our supply chain, that\u2019s reflected in our numbers and downstream of us we haven\u2019t seen it either.  There\u2019s still some time before all the back to school data is in and beyond.  We\u2019ll watch carefully but we haven\u2019t seen it.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from [Nahal Chocksee \u2013 Technology Insight].", "[Nahal Chocksee \u2013 Technology Insight]", "Can you talk about any mix that you\u2019re seeing in notebooks, especially with the commenced shipment of the CULV laptops?", "Stephen J. Luczo ", "I would say that the mix was fairly predicted by the Seagate numbers.  In other words, we\u2019re continuing to transition to 250 and 500 gigabyte per [platter].  There was some small uptick at the end in the lowest end, what I would call netbook segments.  But, in general I think we haven\u2019t really seen the impact of CULV yet.  We\u2019re watching carefully at what those lower capacity points.  Some of the CULV may actually move upwards in capacity as well.", "[Nahal Chocksee \u2013 Technology Insight]", "Have you seen any qualification activity with smartbooks?  Apparently there\u2019s about 40 OEMs, or 40 designs on the smartbooks, have you seen any of that yet?", "Stephen J. Luczo ", "It\u2019s not really significant in the TAM numbers for last quarter or this quarter yet but I am aware of the activity.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Anthony Venturino \u2013 Federated Investors.", "Anthony Venturino \u2013 Federated Investors", "", "Just a quick question, by my calcs I think the overall debt number deceased by like $50 million, is that accurate?", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley ", "The overall debt number?  ", "Anthony Venturino \u2013 Federated Investors", "Yes.", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley ", "We open market purchased $19 million of debt.  ", "Anthony Venturino \u2013 Federated Investors", "The par value decreased I thought, is that accurate?  Or, did you pay any debt down at all?", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley ", "No, we went open market and purchased $19.5 million last quarter.", "Anthony Venturino \u2013 Federated Investors", "", "Of par or was that cash?", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley ", "Of par, we went and bought the April \u201910 debt, $19.5 million in the open market.", "Anthony Venturino \u2013 Federated Investors", "Can you say what price you bought it?", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley ", "It will come off the books at par.  We don\u2019t have any gains or loss.", "Stephen J. Luczo ", "All the debt is pretty much trading at market now.", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley ", "And we also had a facility with the China loan that we work from time-to-time, that was a $15 million payoff.  So, that would be the only two elements we paid off during the quarter.", "Anthony Venturino \u2013 Federated Investors", "Is debt buyback something you are considering or is that just kind of when the price is right you might do it.", "Stephen J. Luczo ", "As Steve said it\u2019s in the market and if the price is right and we have an opportunity, we\u2019ll exercise it opportunistically.  We don\u2019t have a formalized program but if the market does trade it and it\u2019s a good price and it\u2019s a fair price, as Steve said, we\u2019re looking to take some of these peaks off of our debt and we\u2019ll look to those areas as well.  But, we have $300 million due on October 1st and then we have another tranche, about another $19 million due in April so this next fiscal year we have close to $500 million due that we\u2019ll service as it comes due.", "Operator", "", "Your last question comes from Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company.", "Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "Just quickly, when it comes to the discreet track recording and the [inaudible] patterned media, do you have any thoughts on the timing especially in light of a 45% year-over-year improvement in aerial density?  What\u2019s your thoughts there?", "Robert Whitmore ", "Well, you know we\u2019re investing in a number of different technologies, you mentioned a couple of them.  We see conventional perpendicular recording expending for the next several generations.  We\u2019re making investments so that we\u2019ll be ready for the conversion but we don\u2019t see that for a number of years in front of us.", "Stephen J.

(Operator's Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "This conference call forward looking statements including, but not limited to, statements related to the company\u2019s future financial performance.  These forward looking statements are based on information available to Seagate as of the date of this conference call, but are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements.", "Information concerning additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statement is contained in the company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on August 19, 2009.", "These forward looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the company\u2019s views as of any subsequent date and Seagate undertakes no obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect the events or circumstances after the date they were made.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to host, Mr. Steve Luczo, CEO.  Please proceed, sir.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Thank you.  Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.  On the call with me are Pat O'Malley our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Whitmore our Chief Technology Officer and Head of R&D and Manufacturing Operations, and Dave Mosley, Head of Sales and Product Line Management.  ", "The strong operational and development performance for our fiscal first quarter returned us to profitability ahead of schedule.  The results exceeded our expectations at the beginning of the quarter and were positive relative to what we outlined in our preannouncement on September 22nd.", "Throughout the quarter we experienced improving demand across our end markets, despite a macroeconomic environment that remains challenging.  ", "We believe that our strong operating and financial results reflect our continued focus on operational excellence and reestablishing our time to market leadership and key product offerings.  We remain focused on leading in technology and manufacturing and optimizing our broad product portfolio for profitability.", "As we've discussed previously, our market strategy is to pursue quality of share, optimizing the product portfolio and manufacturing capacity for profitability and return on invested capital as opposed to simply pursuing unit volume share.", "We achieved revenue of $2.66 billion which is at the high end of our revised expectations for the quarter and we more than doubled our net income year over year, despite the difficult economic conditions.  We are also pleased with our operating cash flow of $278 million during the quarter and with reducing our debt by $685 million during the fiscal year.", "We achieved gross margin of 24.5% as we successfully transitioned to our new products in the notebook and desktop markets and realized efficient capacity utilization throughout our manufacturing infrastructure.  Importantly, we were able to achieve this margin even though the mission critical enterprise space has not returned to historical levels.  For reference, mission critical enterprise drive shipments for the industry were 24.9 million units for the first nine months of calendar 2008 versus 18.2 million units for the same period of calendar 2009.", "We are expecting this market to gradually improve in a December quarter, however, we are prepared from a product offering, capacity planning, and supply chain perspective to respond to more meaningful growth if necessary.  ", "Additionally, while not included in our TAM outlook or longer-term planning as of now, we believe that the Windows 7 transition is increasingly likely to result in a replacement cycle that has the potential to accelerate growth for PCs in calendar year 2010.", "In light of the overall demand for storage over the last few quarters, the disk drive industry appears to be more resilient to the current macroeconomic slowdown than many others impacted by the global downturn.  As such, looking ahead, we estimate the TAM for the December quarter to be between 153-160 million units.", "Should the TAM reach the high end of this range or beyond, we believe it may be difficult for the industry to fully respond to these demand levels due to potential component constraints. ", "During the last three fiscal years, Seagate has invested $2.5 billion of capital throughout its manufacturing and development infrastructure, over two thirds of which was investing heads in media capacity and technology.  ", "These investments in our key underlying technologies have allowed Seagate to meet increases in customer demand in the near term with relatively low additional capital investment.  Given our breadth of product offerings and customer relationships, we have unique visibility to this demand which we view as a competitive advantage as it relates to future products, capacity, and capital investment.", "While we anticipate making capacity additions thoughtfully in the coming quarters, our objective remains to maintain a balance of supply and demand while optimizing our production volumes and product mix to meet customer needs.  ", "With that let me turn the call over to Dave to discuss specific market dynamics in fiscal Q1 and going into fiscal Q2.", "William David Mosley", "Thanks, Steve.  Entering our first fiscal quarter for 2010, we saw a strong overall demand for storage and that trend continued throughout the September quarter.  We executed well to our strategy of focusing on quality of share by leveraging the improved cost structure of our broad optimized product portfolio.  This resulted in strong performance across all of our product lines and sales channels.", "Seagate shipped 46.3 million units during the quarter, representing 14% sequential growth.  We believe the overall industry shipped 153 million units.  During the quarter, customers continue to transition to our newer, more cost effective, and higher capacity products, and we tactically responded to customer upsides.  Additionally, supply and demand were relatively in balance which resulted in a stable price environment.  These factors combined with a higher than expected unit demand drove continued margin improvement.  ", "Now I'll give some detail on the individual markets.  In the Mission-Critical space, the TAM for the September quarter was approximately 6.7 million units, up 13% quarter over quarter and down 19% year over year.  Seagate shipped 4 million drives for Mission-Critical server and storage products during the quarter maintaining its leading share position.", "This represents a healthy increase from fiscal Q4 to Q1, but it's still markedly lower than the 5.2 million units Seagate shipped in the year ago quarter.  As such, we believe there is still opportunity for growth in this market should a refresh occur, and expect that with our leading Mission-Critical product line, we will benefit from this growth.  For the December quarter, we expect the demand for Mission-Critical drives to be up seasonally.  ", "Seagate's SSD program is progressing on schedule.  We began production in shipped revenue units in September and customer response has been very favorable.  To meet customer requirements, the initial product in Seagate's SSD portfolio is targeted at the broad volume server market and has a SATA interface.", "We are actively engaged with our enterprise customers and are developing additional products with the entire spectrum of interfaces and performance options required to fully serve this market.  ", "Our product development plan enables us to emphasize endurance, reliability, and performance for SSDs at the same level of enterprise expertise customers have come to expect from Seagate.", "The TAM in the desktop market for the September quarter was approximately 58.4 million units, up 7% sequentially.  We believe we maintained our leadership position in this market, shipping 23.3 million units up 6% from the June quarter.  We continued to see strong demand for our 500 GB per disk Barracuda drives where we shipped over 14.5 million units.", "Additionally during the quarter we launched the industry's first 6GB/second SATA desktop hard drive Barracuda XT, which is designed for high performance PC gaming and video applications.", "For the December quarter we expect the desktop TAM to be flat to slightly up sequentially.  In the mobile compute space, the overall TAM was approximately 70.6 million units in the September quarter, up 28% sequentially and 32% year over year.  Seagate shipped 13.9 million units, an increase of 22% sequentially and 41% from the year ago quarter.", "During the quarter we benefited from our leadership position and execution in delivering 250 GB per disk products and 7,200 RPM products.  The customer base for our 2.5 inch mobile drives continues to expand as the system price bands have broadened throughout the netbook and notebook markets.", "We expect the TAM in the mobile compute space for the December quarter to be up sequentially.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Bob to provide an update on our operations and product development.", "Robert W. Whitmore", "Thanks, Dave.  This afternoon I will provide a brief update on products and operation.  For the past three quarters I've primarily focused my comments on new product, time to market, and the acceleration of our product transitions.", "In addition to providing a product update, today I will also comment on operational performance regarding supply, factory utilization, and capital investments.  We continue to make steady progress in the area of new product execution and product transitions.  Our desktop 500 GB per disk and notebook 250 GB per disk product line transitions are complete, fully ramped within our factories, and well accepted by our customers.", "As for the new enterprise products, our industry first 500 GB 2.5 inch Nearline product and 600 GB 3.5 inch 10,000 RPM product lines are fully qualified and ramping within the qualified.  Our 600 GB 3.5 inch 15,000 RPM product line will be largely qualified by the end of the quarter with many OEM customers qualified and in volume production today.", "Overall product transition execution is going well and will remain a high priority.  In regards to our new product introductions, we continue to focus on time to market across the portfolio.  As stated last quarter, we delivered our 2.5 inch two disk 640 GB product to our retail partners.  This quarter we are focused on qualifications with our OEM customers and increasing the factory output.  We also began shipping our 1 TB 2.5 inch retail product and will continue to increase volumes this quarter.  ", "Finally, we have now started the qualification process of the industry's first 2.5 inch 7 mm high hard disk drive.  This new slimline product allows our OEM customers to continue to reduce the thickness and weight of their notebook platforms.  Seagate is committed to supporting our customers with the fullest range of form factors, spin speeds, and interfaces, and as a result remains the storage supplier of choice.", "In summary, we believe that we have made significant progress in the last three quarters with regards to new product, time to market delivery, product line transitions, and factory deployment.  These efforts have had a positive impact on our growth margins and will remain the highest priority for the team in the coming quarters.", "Now I'll give some details as it relates to operations.  As was mentioned earlier over the last three years, Seagate has invested $2.5 billion of capital throughout its manufacturing and development infrastructure.  These investments have allowed us to upgrade our internal component tool capabilities to the latest generation of technology and positioned us well for future technology and product transitions.", "As a result of this industry leading capital investment, the company has been able to respond to the increasing unit demand since January while minimizing additional capital investment.", "The volume increases of our new time to market products combined with an improving demand environment for hard disk drives has increased our factory utilization to very high levels and provided meaningful scale and leverage throughout the internal supply chain.", "As we move forward, we'll continue to work closely with our customers and make the appropriate capital investments.  In light of the robust demand for HDDs over the last nine months, and the increasing likelihood of a gradual macroeconomic recovery, we're in the process of evaluating our capital investment levels for calendar year 2010.", "With respect to the overall supply chain, we believe we are well positioned to meet the near term demand.  However, similar to our manufacturing capacity, we are monitoring this closely and working with our suppliers in order to appropriately support any increased demand.", "In August we announced plans to close our AMK factory in Singapore and move the hard disk drive manufacturing operations to other Seagate locations.  This action is one part of an overall strategy intended to enhance flexibility within our factories, improve manufacturing leverage, and reduce our overall cost structure.  The annual run rate savings of approximately $40 million is expected to be achieved when the transition is completed at the end of calendar 2010.", "In summary, the results of the September quarter demonstrate the powerful impact on our financial results from product and technology leadership and optimized manufacturing structure, and a flexible supply chain.  ", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Pat O'Malley.", "Patrick J. O'Malley", "Thanks, Bob.  You'll find the company\u2019s press release, 8-K, and additional financial information related to Seagate's financial performance and other supplemental information in the investor relations section website at seagate.com.", "I'll start with some comments regarding the fiscal Q results, then touch on the balance sheet, and close with additional commentary regarding our outlook.", "For the September quarter, Seagate's unit shipments were 46.3 million, up 14% compared to the prior quarter and down 4% compared to the year ago quarter.  Revenue for the quarter was $2.66 billion, up 13% from the previous quarter and down 12% year over year.  ", "Gross margin for the September quarter expanded to 24.5%, an increase of roughly 700 basis points compared to the prior quarter to the continued transition to new products, improving product mix, and improving factory efficiencies and utilization.", "R&D and SG&A totalled $314 million for September quarter.  Favorability due to R&D materials spending moving into future quarters was essentially offset by charges associated with the partial restitution of salaries previously subject to the companywide salary reductions implemented last January and the cost of performance based variable compensation plan.", "During the September quarter we recorded $46 million of restructuring charges that relate to the closing of the AMK facility in Singapore and to the global reductions we initiated during fiscal year 2009.  Additionally, we wrote down $64 million of research related fixed assets this quarter.  This charge is reflected on the income statement line item impaired of long-lived assets.  ", "The tax provision for September quarter was $1 million better than expected due to favorable adjustments related to the company's valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and other tax adjustments.  As these adjustments are nonrecurring, we continue to use a tax rate of 6% for planning purposes.", "Because the company was profitable on a GAAP basis for the September quarter, outstanding options that are in the money are now included in the diluted share calculation which accounts for the majority of the diluted share account increase as compared to the last quarter.", "Going forward, the diluted share count will vary somewhat based on the number of stock options in the money which is determined by the average price of the stock for the quarter.", "Now I'd like to address the balance sheet.  Since the beginning of our fiscal year, including activity up through October 19th, we have reduced debt by approximately $685 million.  The debt reduction was comprised mainly of $300 million paid to retire the senior unsecured floating rate notes at maturity and $350 million to pay off our revolving credit facility.", "We have made significant progress in regards to our capital structure as our net debt position is now less than half of what it was at the beginning of the calendar year.  Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short term investments at the end of the quarter totalled approximately $1.8 billion, down $257 million from the previous quarter due primarily to the debt reduction activities I just mentioned offset by cash generated from operations.", "Cash flow from operations was $278 million for the quarter while free cash flow was $189 million.  The company paid approximately $107 million in cash restructuring and interest during the September quarter.", "Depreciation and amortization for the September quarter was $204 million, including approximately $10 million of purchase intangibles amortization.  Cash conversion metrics were as follows; days sales outstanding was 42, days payable outstanding was 75, and days inventory outstanding was 28, for a cash conversion cycle of -5 days.  Looking forward if shipments remain fairly linear during the quarter, we'd expect a cash conversion cycle to be around zero days.  ", "Now I will address the business outlook for the December quarter.  While visibility has improved throughout the calendar year, the ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions makes it difficult to predict product demand and other related matters, which makes items more likely that Seagate's actual results could differ materially from current expectations.  ", "Specifically for the December quarter, the company expects the following; revenue to be approximately $2.75-$2.85 billion, gross margin for the December quarter to be near the high end of the new target range of 22%-26%, R&D and SG&A costs to be approximately $335 million, higher than what we expected at the beginning of the calendar year.  The bulk of the increase is a direct result of the company returning to profitability.  As such, we are addressing salaries and variable compensation sooner than we expected.  ", "We believe opportunities still exist to improve efficiencies in our operating expense structure that will, over time somewhat offset the cost of restoring salaries and variable compensation.  ", "Other income expense to be a net expense of approximately $35 million, a tax rate for planning purposes of 6%, and an outstanding share count of approximately $520 million.  The December quarter outlook does not include the impact of any potential new restructuring activities, future mergers, acquisitions, financing, dispositions or other business combinations the company may undertake.  The company's policy is to refrain from commenting on any such activities.", "Now I would like to provide an outlook for fiscal year 2010.  We felt it was time to update our view of the longer-term financial model in light of the progress the company has made since the beginning of the calendar year.  Some examples of this progress are evident in our improved time to market delivery of products, our significantly lower cost structures, and our improved decision making processes. ", "Before I review the financial outlook, it is important to understand some of the critical assumptions on which we have based our fiscal year 2010 modeling, and then I will provide a perspective on how these will reflect on Seagate's financial results.  ", "The fiscal year 2010 financial model is based on the following key assumptions; the unit TAM will grow roughly 10%-15% over fiscal year 2009, there will be a return to as seasonal pattern in demand, pricing trends will reflect a balance supply and demand environment, and Seagate will continue to deliver time to market products.", "With these key assumptions, we believe that fiscal year 2010 revenue will be greater than $10.5 billion while diluted GAAP earnings per share would be in excess of $1.90 which includes approximately $155 million or $0.30 per share of restructuring costs, asset write downs, and amortization of purchase intangibles.", "Inherent in any long-term financial modeling is the potential of significant variability in the outcomes due to unforeseen changes in demand and pricing environment.  Specifically, while we are not expecting another large scale global economic slowdown, neither have we factored in corporate refresher PCs or a rapid recovery in the Mission-Critical market for hard drives.  The point is there are many factors, both positive and negative, that could cause our fiscal year 2010 results to deviate from this model.  We look forward to updating you on these factors as the fiscal year progresses. ", "That concludes my remarks for today.  Steve?", "Steve:", "Thanks, Pat.  We're continuing to make progress on a number of fronts and I want to thank our employees around the world for their continued focus towards achieving our goals.  I'd also like to thank our customers, suppliers, and partners, for their ongoing support and confidence in Seagate.  With that we're ready to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator's Instructions) And our first question will be from the line of Kathryn Huberty.", "Kathryn Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Yes.  Thanks, good afternoon.  A question on the guidance for the December quarter.  If we look at the fundamental sin the industry, HDD inventory is at least two year loads, PC inventory is very low heading into the Windows 7 launch on Thursday.  And on top of that we have improving command in both the consumer and enterprise markets.  So I guess if you can take those fundamentals and compare it to the guidance which is suggesting that units grow at less than normal seasonality in December.", "Patrick J. O'Malley", "Let me take that, this is Pat.  Number one, as we talked about the TAM, we believe at a certain level \u2014 that over 160 there may be supply constraints.  I think the industry will work its best to hit any upside that may occur there, but also given the linearity and the needs of our OEMs and distributors throughout the quarter, going over 160 million may be a challenge.  So I think what you are getting there is a big of an industry, and maybe Seagate at a certain level constraint, that may not be able to respond to all actions.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yeah.  And I think the other thing is that from a planning perspective, I think the industry obviously is pretty cognizant of what happened a year ago December.  So speaking about seasonality of December quarter versus September quarter and December quarter to March quarter I think hopefully is something we can return to.  I guess we'll learn this year whether or not we can, but obviously last December things looked great up until the first week of December and then with the slowdown that really occurred in many other sectors that started six or seven months before that.  It really impacted the technology industry late in the quarter.  ", "So I think we also have to be cognizant of that and plan conservatively in case the summer isn't a three month quarter.  If it is then I would say your comments are more accurate and then there's the question of whether or not the industry can respond to that.  A lot of that will have will have to do with linearity and pulls through the quarter so we're obviously keeping a close eye on it.", "Kathryn Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Let me ask a more specific question.  OEM mix is back to peak levels in the quarter.  What's your view as to whether OEMs pulled forward seasonal demand as they built product ahead of Windows 7?  Do you think there was pull forward or do you think the inventory levels have been managed appropriately?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I think the inventory levels are managed appropriately.  We have visibility to our jet hubs, but we have no indications that there is buildup of demand at the OEMs.", "Kathryn Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay.  And then just lastly, is glass supply still the biggest constraint for the industry, and have you or others brought on additional suppliers to fix that?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Well, we wouldn't talk to our specific supply strategy, but from a glass perspective, we feel comfortable with our supplies.", "Kathryn Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay great.  Thanks so much, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question will be from the line of Richard Kugele from  Needham & Company.  Please proceed.", "Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "", "Thank you.  Good afternoon.  Two questions, I guess first in terms of capacity additions, you seemed to pose to run effectively fully utilized in the December quarter, and if you kind of look at the PC industry, analysts forecasts, they're suggesting something in the low double-digit range for calendar 2010.  Traditionally drives have been a couple of points higher than that.  So if we think about your ability to expand capacity in a timely fashion to hit that number, when do you have to make those decisions and what's kind of the drop-dead date to actually have it be meaningful for the year?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yeah. A gain, Rich, what I was trying to point out in my comments, given our position in the industry and the breadth of our product portfolio and the breadth of our customer mix, we actually think that's highly competitive in information.  So I don't think we can give you a whole lot more guidance other than, as you point out, if the industry grows at double digit rates for 2010 relative to what we've told you about where we're at now and where we think the industry is out, it would mean deploying capital prudently, and deepening on lead times that could occur early in the year and throughout the year.", "Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "Okay.  Then I guess just lastly from a much more recent quarter balance sheet perspective, virtually every category of your inventory from a raw material perspective and a finished goods perspective is dramatically less than it's been over the past couple of years.  ", "How were you able to really do that to be able to hit the kind of unit numbers you've been able to do, is your supply chain just a little bit more streamlined or are you just effectively managing your factories that much better to have, in some cases, a 50% reduction?  It was a pretty material number, that's why I asked.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I think there's a few things. I mean, one is we've spoken to linearity so the customer linearity has been significantly different than any time in the 20 years I've been in the industry and I think we talked to this a couple of quarters ago that maybe one of the good things that came out of the pulling out of so much credit is that companies aren't tearing as much inventory and they're ordering products sooner in and flowing revenue more evenly throughout a quarter, which of course if you're a high volume manufacturer it makes a big difference.", "I think second thing is with respect to Seagate relative to where we're at in the beginning of the year versus now is just the mix of products that was in the factories.  It was a pretty complicated mix with several variations and generations earlier in the year and because of the success of the new products we've basically been able to transition to a much narrower set, if you will, in both the notebook and desktop segment as well as the new enterprise class products.  So our factories are running, I would say a lot more efficiently because the product set is a lot less complicated.  ", "And then thirdly, yeah, I do think we have excellent relationships in the supply chain.  Obviously some of those are internally controlled and some of those are significant external relationships that we've had and we've continued to, I think, improve in that front.", "Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "Okay.  Actually I have one last question.  When it comes to the fiscal 2010 guidance, just a clarification, you are saying that the $2.20, that does not include the rapid recovery and enterprise or a corporate refresh of PCs.", "William David Mosley", "That's correct.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "That's correct.", "Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "Okay.  Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you.  And our next question comes from the line of David Bailey from Goldman Sachs.  Please proceed.", "David Bailey \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Great.  Thank you very much.  Could you let us know what you think the most important drivers of growth margin are at this point and how should we think about the plusses and minuses to gross margin as we move into sort of the margin June quarter?", "Patrick J. O'Malley", "Well, obviously the product mix of the old and new is the key driver.  It has been the key driver since we've been shedding the old products to the new starting with the lull of March and continuing.  We wound up well over 80% of the new products, so obviously that leverage is getting diminished as we go to 100%, but it's certainly been a key driver.  The element that can't be discounted is the overall TAM which is, as Steve talked about, not just our factories being more efficient with the products, but they're being highly utilized.  So our factories are probably at the highest level of utilization.  ", "So if you look what are going to be the drives in the future, obviously we haven't talked about an enterprise.  We still have opportunities in yields in these new products that will be driving us into next quarter and beyond, some of the new enterprise products that will be in issue, and just the normal cost reduction.  So we still feel there's tailwind into the margin structure, but obviously we've captured a lot of that, we captured it earlier, and it's been primarily to the products and where the factories are.  So I think that's how we would look at it going forward.  And as I characterized it, there is an enterprise refresh, PC refresh, obviously there's some opportunity there, but we're not planning on that right now.", "David Bailey \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay.  And then when you look at your debt levels, are you comfortable where you are right now or is there more work still to be done?  And maybe more broadly, what are your priorities for your cash next year?", "Patrick J. O'Malley", "So I think we're comfortable with the debt level where it is. I mean, obviously reducing the debt where we have in addition to generating the cash and seeing what the company can do in terms of cash generation certainly gives us a lot more confidence than how we were 10 months ago.", "However, I think as we've stated before, longer term we can see the debt level more in the $1.6-$1.7 billion range is probably the right amount of leverage for the company given the lessons of the last 18-24 months.  And we'd probably just continue to go ahead and deal with that through cash generation from operations.", "David Bailey \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question will be from the line of Mark Moskowitz from JP Morgan.  Please proceed.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Thank you, good afternoon.  A couple of questions here first.  It seems like the hard disk drive industry is really benefiting from some structural dynamics, it's really propping up ASPs.  How sustainable do you see some of these dynamics in terms of at what point is the major Tier 1 OEM customer saying enough is enough, you guys can't keep on raising prices on us going into the back half of the year?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Well, I guess I'm not sure that I could validate the raising prices comment.  I don't think we've raised prices.  I think supply and demand have been relatively in balance, and I think the industry obviously from a revenue perspective took a pretty big hit in the December quarter and I think the industry basically pulled back on capital pretty dramatically to make supply and demand come into the balance.  You got to remember, we were probably off by 25 million units on a TAM of 125 million units in the December quarter so that was a lot of excess inventory that was basically priced to sell and that impacted pricing for a number of quarters.", "So I think for most of our customer base at this point, they're more concerned about availability of supply and obviously we always have to be competitive in terms of the value that we attach to the product that we're selling and most of our customers can be pretty pleased at this point, I think, to get the products they're getting and getting them when they need them.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "The second question then revolves around the Mission-Critical weakness that you're seeing in terms of the enterprise hard disk drives.  Are you seeing these weaknesses with the enterprise more a reflection of customers deferring large ticket items, or is there any sort of secular shift whereby SATA drives are starting to win greater placements in systems historically served by fiber channel?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I wouldn't characterize it as a weakness.  As a matter of fact I pointed to the quarter over quarter growth before, but I would say, Mark, that the right way to look at it is what was the original baseline?  We talked about this for the last couple of quarters which was the refresh rate of either IT systems or enterprise systems hit a baseline when the economy went down and it slowly climbed back out of that and hasn't gotten all the way back to the previous levels.  We actually do anticipate some growth like we said.  It'll be up sequentially this time and there is some pent up demand, we believe.  So forecasting that going out is rather difficult, but I don't think it's a replacement rate with SATA versus SAS or fiber channel right now.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question will be from the line of Jayson Noland at Robert W. Baird.  Please proceed.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird", "Thank you.  A question on OpEx first.  Is 300 still within reach or with increases in variable comp is that not possible anymore?", "Patrick J. O'Malley", "I wouldn't say it's not possible.  Obviously I think we have some things to do on that, Jayson, and we continue to look at those.  Like I said, our return of profitability sort of accelerates some growth in there that we'd look to long term offset a vast majority of that.  I don't have a timeline to give you, but we'll certainly update you on that as we progress.  But I think the way to even look at it, Jayson, which sort of ties that 300 as the business gets the $3 billion again, we'd like to run our OpEx somewhere in the 10%-12% range.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yeah.  I think the shift is coming in a year ago when we sat a $300 million number is when we were thinking about sub $2 billion revenue numbers.  And again, how do we have a business model that is setup to be running below $2 billion in revenues, how do we still maintain cash flow and profitability?  And we restructured the company pretty aggressively to get to that point and in doing so we kind of targeted a sub $300 million per quarter OpEx number.  ", "I think two calls ago we indicated that in a more stable environment, obviously you want to be investing in underlying technologies, particularly in storage.  I mean there's so many shifts occurring in terms of the deployment of storage across so many application sets, whether or not it's cloud based or mobility or Windows 7 or netbooks, notebooks \u2014 the way we really think of it is how do we get to an operating expense model of 10%-12%, an operating contribution model anywhere from 10%-14% or higher depending on gross margins.  ", "So I think the net net is if you looked at the model three or four years ago versus now, what we're trying to do is produce one that has an operating contribution that is probably a couple of points higher than where we used to operate as a long-term model.  So still obviously active management on OpEx, but we want to obviously make sure we're investing for some of these future opportunities that we think are pretty significant.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird", "That makes sense.  On the CapEx side I believe you said this was under review and I may have missed it, but I would assume there would be upward pressure to the 450 million in fiscal '10?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yeah.  I think especially, as was indicated in the first question, if December pulls through solidly for the entire three months, which we have no reason not to believe at this point, but again, based on last year's history you need to remain cautious.  And your normal seasonal pattern would say March quarter anywhere from down slightly to up slightly and then June of course falling off and then September and December stronger.  ", "I think what's tricky this year of course is this could be against the backdrop of a general gradual growth in a macroeconomic trend which means maybe we're growing through the fiscal year and then through the calendar year which obviously would imply pressure on capital as you indicate throughout the year and then the question is how do we deploy that as reasonable as possible in terms of matching capacities so we're optimizing our profitability, but still fulfilling our customer needs?", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird", "Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Thanks you.  Our next question will be from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean, Murray.  Please proceed.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean, Murray, Carret & Co.", "Hi.  Thanks, guys.  Just a clarification around the new guidance.  Is it 190 before the charges and then $0.35 of charge so then 225 after charges?", "Patrick J. O'Malley", "It's actually 190 and 30, but yes.  I mean those would be the numbers we've quoted.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean, Murray, Carret & Co.", "Got it.  Okay, thank you very much.  So, 220 overall.  And then I guess just on the OpEx, another question about the OpEx, is the 335, is that sort of a new base level relative to where your revenues are?  And the way to think of it going forward, I know you're giving your 10%-12% guidance ranges, but is there a way to think about it going forward as it'll tend to trend more or less with revenue growth?", "Patrick J. O'Malley", "We think we still have some leverage to take some of that out, but as Steve mentioned, we certainly have a lot of options on other areas to deploy OpEx dollars, especially in the R&D that we continue to look at. And as Steve said, we're really focused on an operating margin to deliver 10%-14%.  So we'll make those tradeoffs in between margin and OpEx, but clearly if the 335 is probably fair to model for the short term \u2014 but we certainly will look to optimize whether taking some out, but reinvesting some of those dollars.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean, Murray, Carret & Co.", "Okay, great thanks.  And then if I could just touch base on the CapEx issue.  Without giving any guidance, just talking about to what degree you might think of adding, if you were theoretically to decide in January to begin to put on capacity, when might we expect the usual volume capacity to really be in place?", "Patrick J. O'Malley", "Probably back half of the year.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "It depends on what we're putting in place.  That's the key and I think that's why this is much more complicated because it's not just even Seagate \u2014 we have to work with our supply chain as well.", "Patrick J. O'Malley", "The supply chain is a lot narrower and we want to respect the confidentiality with our supply chain as well.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean, Murray, Carret & Co.", "Certainly.  And so is there any way to give us a big picture view, sort of all things equal, what pricing might look like next year I mean terms of \u2014 I mean, if we think about typical year over year ASP declines, sort of mid single digits, but you have some mixup going on within sort of your notebook PC mix today, and the if we get sort of some kind of tailwind or however you want to call it, a little bit of support in the PC demand next year and then a pickup in enterprise demand \u2014 I mean, would those mid-single digits typical type of ASP declines be on the conservative side?", "Patrick J. O'Malley", "Yeah.  Again, I think you pointed out the reason why we really can't comment on it.  I mean, there are so many variables between what happens if there's a big refresh cycle after 7, what happens if there's a pickup in enterprise Mission-Critical, what happens if supply and demand are constrained, and what the competitive situation is in terms of their ability to ramp products, to introduce new products, and to ramp yield.  I think it's definitely a different environment I guess is what we can say the last nine or 10 months and I think we're highly focused on just addressing what our customers need and helping them achieve their revenue plans right now.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean, Murray, Carret & Co.", "Okay, great.  And then just last one for me if I could?  I guess on the supply side of things in areas where you're considering glass and anything else, what are you seeing from a pricing perspective from those guys?  Is the input cost starting to go up, and what are they looking for from maybe the industry collectively before they're willing to take on and on more capacity.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yeah.  Again, I think our supply relationships run pretty long and pretty deep and we feel pretty good about where we're positioned in terms of our supply base and that means with respect to quality, quantity, availability, and price.  I think to comment anything beyond that again would kind of betray the trust that you have with our suppliers and you need to ask them directly.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean, Murray, Carret & Co.", "Okay.  Thanks. ", "Operator", "", "Thank you.  Our next question will be from the line of Scott Craig from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, please proceed.", "Scott Craig - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Okay.  Thanks, good afternoon.  Any flavor you can provide around the fiscal 2010 gross margin assumptions in your EPS?  And then secondly, around the gross margin, the 22%-26% range, it sounds like you\u2019re going to be there at the high end already without an enterprise rebound.  So, what\u2019s the likelihood that you think you can get above that 26% range if the enterprise business was to come back and in at least somewhat of a meaningful way?  Thanks.", "Patrick W. Whitmore", "Well, obviously it\u2019s not an absolute.  There\u2019s going to be times when you can be above it.  But I mean, for planning purposes to run our business we think longer term we should be in that 22%-26%.  So we have spot points below or above it, something anomaly that you might have a strong quarter, because of an enterprise free fresh.  But that\u2019s not how we\u2019re going to plan our business.  So, always an opportunity, but certainly not planning for that.  ", "And looking at the year, obviously, going from 22%-26% you can certainly lean towards the higher end of that if you\u2019re coming up with the numbers that we\u2019ve talked about.  And I think you can model that pretty quickly, actually, with the $1.90 we lay in there.", "Scott Craig - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Okay.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question will be from the line of Aaron Sharma from UBS, please proceed.", "Aaron Sharma - UBS", "I was just wondering if you could provide some color on the strength in the consumer market during the quarter?  It seemed like there was a nice bounce-back, I just wanted to get some details on where you're sitting in the market and how sustainable this is in 2010?  And also how we should look at your business going forward when factoring both share gains as well as overall market growth rates for the different segments?  I just have a quick follow up after that.  Thanks.", "Patrick J. O'Malley", "Yeah, I think Aaron, the CE markets have held in there.  They\u2019re not back to the same levels that they were at one year back.  But to your point, I think the DVR and gaming markets  \u2014 our perception of them, we don\u2019t participate as fully as we might at once done in the gaming markets.  But I think in the DVR and the gaming markets both the volume is \u2013 you could pretty much figure out from the delta between our TAM guidance and the desktop notebook and enterprise and then the overall TAM guidance what the delta is.  And there\u2019s some portable \u2014  some 1.8 inch markets that are still represented.  And I think there not zero.  They\u2019re not at the historical levels that they were a year ago.  But they\u2019re maybe been, I\u2019ll say, 70%-80% of what they were before.", "Aaron Sharma - UBS", "Gotcha, and just in terms of mix, I\u2019d say over the next 12-18 months, I mean, should we just expect that to grow with kind the market or should we \u2013 just when in terms of factoring in share games and potential for that?", "Patrick J. O'Malley", "No.  I think it\u2019s going to grow roughly with the markets.", "Aaron Sharma - UBS", "Okay.  And then really quickly, just in terms of linearity, how would you describe it for the September quarter versus prior quarters.  And thus far into October, I know it\u2019s tough, but any idea how December may play out in terms of linearity versus prior years?", "Patrick J. O'Malley", "Yeah.  The September quarter was one of our better quarters from a linearity perspective.  It goes back to the comments that Steve made earlier.  You know, I think that\u2019s indicative of supply and demand being in balance and how the customer base are reacting \u2014 the entire supply chain, inbound and outbound, are reacting in light of the macroeconomics.  So, September was a very good quarter.  I won\u2019t comment on this quarter.", "Aaron Sharma - UBS", "Okay.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.  And our next question will from the line of Kevin Hunt, please proceed.", "Kevin Hunt - Unidentified Company", "Yeah.  I just want to follow up on that consumer question.  Your performance in consumer was actually the strongest sequentially of any year unit's performance.  And is there any dynamics you can assess there why you may have been doing better than others out there?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Well, I think the DVR market, like we said, where we have a lot of well established customer relationships, has performed like I said stronger in most inside of this economic recovery.  The gaming market, to your point, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d say relatively speaking we\u2019re better than everyone else because we haven\u2019t participated as much as we did historically in that market.", "Kevin Hunt - Unidentified Company", "And one follow-up on this Windows 7 cycle.  I mean, how much have you seen in terms of availability of forecast from the PC OEMS in terms of what they\u2019re expecting for this launch for this quarter?  And it sounds like you\u2019re assuming, really, not much in for 2010 at this point.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yeah.  I mean, again, I don\u2019t want to speak for our customers because it\u2019s easy enough for you guys just to get it straight from their mouths.  But I think what we have said as P&R modeling that we provided for you, we don\u2019t have built into their big refresh cycle being driven by Windows 7.  ", "And on the other side of that, I would say that the anecdotal evidence that we\u2019re getting, which of course for us would be second hand, maybe first hand if it\u2019s from distributors that are starting to address the Windows 7 market.  We\u2019re certainly getting more indication that Windows 7 will be a more positive impact to the PC refresh cycle than maybe has been previously predicted.", "Kevin Hunt - Unidentified Company", "Okay.  Thank you.  ", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question will be from the line of Aaron Rakers, please proceed", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Yes.  Thanks, guys.  I got a couple questions.  I guess the first one I think about the model, the 520 million of fully diluted shares.  Can you give us some color?  I have people start to think of the 220 earnings number what the \u2013 how we should think about the fully diluted share count here as we \u2013 I would anticipate the stock to potentially see a favorable reaction here.  Just any help on that, kind of, relative to the share price would be helpful.", "Patrick J. O'Malley", "Well, right now, we\u2019re just using the 520, I mean, we don\u2019t want to really get into predicting what the share price would do.  But, obviously, we do have options out there that are above the price we\u2019re at today.  So they will go into the calculation for that.  But I think we\u2019ve taken the largest portion of that dilution through this rebound.  But there\u2019d still be some level of dilution with those options that are underwater today that were \u2013 if the stock were to continue to accrue.  But I would use the 520 because that\u2019s how we\u2019re using for modeling purposes.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Take one more question, I think.", "Operator", "Sure, our next question will be from the line of Keith Bachman from the Bank of Montreal, please proceed.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "", "Yeah.  Thanks, guys.  Just one quickie for you, Steve.  Could you just do a little color on how you think the industry ended inventory levels for September quarter?  I think we all think it\u2019s low, but characterization.  But more importantly, you talked about getting the three month quarter.  If we do get a three month quarter how does that play down in terms of ending December level inventories?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I think the industry ended inventory levels low, maybe even very low.  I think the customers\u2019 inventory levels are low, maybe even very low.  I think if the December quarter plays out as a solid booking through December we\u2019ll be exiting the year with very low inventories.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "And Steve, just take that one step farther, therefore, the normal seasonal patterns for the March quarter would be an inappropriate conclusion if you follow that line of reason, correct?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I mean, it could be again, yeah.  March quarter\u2019s always \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to say.  I mean, the March quarter is an interesting quarter if you look at it over the last 15 or 20 years.  It can be slightly down, slightly up, flat.  ", "But I think your point is if this is against exiting within inventories and strong demand through December against a general economic environment that's improving, then yes, we could see the March TAM be up from December.  And then you have the issues with respect to capacity that we think would be pretty significant in terms of the industry continuing to chase that.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay.  Thanks, guys.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Okay.  I just want to thank everyone for calling us today.  And obviously thank all our shareholders for their support as well and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.

On the call with me are Pat O'Malley, our Chief Financial Officer;  Bob Whitmore our Chief Technology Officer and Head of R&D and Manufacturing Operations and Dave Mosley, Head of Sales and Product Line Management. ", "Over the course of calendar year 2009 the technology industry has improved faster than the broader economy and the storage sector has outperformed almost every other sector in technology. As a result the demand for storage continued to accelerate throughout the calendar year. Given Seagate\u2019s breadth of product line we have been able to adjust our production schedules to meet this accelerating demand for storage as the global recovery broadens. ", "Our strong performance in our second fiscal quarter was influenced by many factors that allowed us to deliver financial results that far exceeded our guidance at the beginning of the quarter. When we discussed our first fiscal quarter results three months ago we also discussed our approach to planning for the December quarter. We indicated there would be variability in a number of factors that could positively impact the quarter. While two of those assumptions did help us achieve better than expected results we expect the other two variables to provide additional opportunities throughout the calendar year 2010. ", "First, the demand profile across our entire product line was linear throughout the quarter and we did not experience the dramatic decline during the last two weeks in the quarter as we did in the December 2008 quarter. Second, our assumption for enterprise storage demand proved to be conservative as demand accelerated throughout the quarter. Those two factors positively impacted our results in the December quarter. ", "Third, we indicated that the Windows 7 refresh would likely accelerate PC demand. We do not believe there was a meaningful refresh cycle reflected in our Q2 results. However, we still expect this to be an opportunity for us throughout this calendar year. ", "Fourth, we were not planning for a robust economic recovery in the United States or Europe during the quarter. We now expect a broader global economic recovery to occur in the second half of calendar year 2010 and we believe this recovery will result in a higher probability for a broad based commercial refresh of information technology products including storage devices. ", "Throughout the quarter we continued to have very strong demand for our high capacity, high performance products in both the notebook and desktop markets. In addition the enterprise market experienced the second consecutive quarter of double digit growth. The combination of increases of demand across our portfolio with the stable pricing environment resulted in gross margin of 30.5% and provides strong momentum as we move into calendar year 2010. To the extent these market conditions continue we expect the company to operate above our stated target range for gross margin percentage. ", "We achieved revenue in the December quarter of $3 billion, a 33% increase year-over-year and a 14% increase sequentially. Net income was $533 million resulting in $1.03 of earnings per share. We also continued to strengthen the balance sheet generating operating cash flow of $753 million and repaying $246 million in debt. ", "We believe the TAM for the December quarter was approximately 160 million units. At these demand levels the industry experienced constraints throughout the supply chain. As we plan for the March quarter we are assuming muted seasonality with a TAM in a range of between 155 and 160 million units. ", "Throughout the calendar year we anticipate ongoing component constraints across the supply chain including internally sourced components which we believe will constrain disc drive supply relative to demand. In this environment we expect to make capacity additions although our objectives will continue to be maintaining the balance of supply and demand while optimizing our production volumes and product mix to meet customer needs. ", "Finally, I want to emphasize that while we are experiencing a robust demand environment and we have a strong product portfolio based on our technology leadership there is still room for improvement at Seagate in all operating, technical and support functions. We remain highly focused on excellence throughout our company and delivering the best products to our customers and achieving strong financial performance for our shareholders. ", "With that let me turn the call over to Dave to discuss the specific market dynamics for fiscal Q2 and going into fiscal Q3. ", "William David Mosley ", "", "Thanks Steve. Seagate shipped 49.9 million units during the quarter representing 36% annual growth and 8% sequential growth. We believe the overall industry shipped approximately 160 million units. Linearity held strong from October all the way through the quarter end. The strong demand reflected an intense customer appetite for our notebook and desktop product lines particularly at 500 GB and 1 terabyte capacity points and high performance 7,200 RPM configurations. ", "In addition we experienced accelerated demand for our 15,000 RPM enterprise products throughout the quarter. These demand conditions resulted in an improved product mix that combined with strong unit demand and improved factory utilization to drive continued margin improvement. ", "Now I will give some detail on the individual markets. The TAM in the mission critical space for the December quarter was approximately 7.5 million units up 14% quarter-over-quarter and 8% year-over-year. Seagate shipped 4.6 million drives for mission critical server and storage applications during the quarter maintaining its leadership position. Mission critical drive shipments of 3.5 inch 15,000 RPM products were stronger than we anticipated throughout the quarter owing to an improving picture in enterprise storage systems. ", "Seagate\u2019s portfolio scale and leverage allowed us to efficiently meet these demand increases for our enterprise customers. As with last quarter this represents strong sequential growth and as this market returns to historical levels or greater Seagate as the market leader will benefit. The TAM in the desktop market for the December quarter was approximately 64 million units, up 7% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. We believe we maintained our leadership position in this market shipping 25.1 million units, up 8% from the September quarter. ", "Seagate clearly leads the industry in component volume shipments of capacity points at or above 500 GB per disc in the desktop market. Over 85% of our desktop products shipping during the December quarter were of this configuration signaling that the product transition we have discussed in our calls for the past three quarters is now complete. ", "For the March quarter we expect the desktop TAM to be flat sequentially. The overall TAM in the mobile compute space was approximately 71 million units in the December quarter, up 10% sequentially and 53% year-over-year. Seagate shipped 14.8 million units, an increase of 7% sequentially and 95% from the year-ago quarter. ", "During the quarter Seagate benefited from delivering high capacity and high performance drives, particularly 250 GB per disc products and 7,200 RPM products. Our consumer electronics and retail product lines also took advantage of these capacity points. We expect the TAM in the mobile compute space in the March quarter to be slightly down sequentially. ", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Bob to provide an update on our operations and product development. ", "Robert Whitmore ", "", "Thanks Dave. Our focus in R&D and operations continues to be in executing time to market, product introductions, staging technology for the future and supplying our customers with products in a robust demand environment. Today I will give an update on products, technology and capital investment. ", "We continue to have a very high priority on new product execution, customer qualifications and product transitions across our portfolio. The 3.5 inch, 15,000 RPM mission critical enterprise product line continues the transition from a 450 GB product family to a 600 GB product family. We have substantially completed customer qualifications and are increasing to volume production. In addition we have completed development and started qualification of the industry\u2019s first 600 GB 2.5 inch 10,000 RPM mission critical product. ", "For business critical/cloud applications we continue to ramp the industry\u2019s first 2.5 inch 500 GB drive and customer qualifications have been completed. Qualifications of our 3.5 inch 2 terabyte 7,200 RPM business critical products have been achieved at its selected OEMs and are also entering volume production. ", "As for our notebook products we proceeded with OEM qualifications and production ramps for our 320 GB per disc product as well as the industry\u2019s first ultra thin 7 mm high notebook product with a number of qualifications complete. ", "Finally, in the desktop market we continue to focus on yields and output of our widely accepted 500 GB per disc product line. Additionally we have now started to ship our first 667 GB per disc 2 terabyte product into the retail market and will continue to increase production throughout this quarter. ", "Now I would like to make a few comments on technologies we are staging for future product generations. We continue to invest the appropriate resources and capital throughout the development and manufacturing infrastructure to insure that the technology and product leadership extends well beyond our current offerings. These investments are delivering results that give us increasing confidence in the extension of conventional perpendicular recording to sustain the aerial density growth rate for the next several product generations. ", "In addition, we continue to invest resources and capital towards technologies that will take us well beyond conventional perpendicular recording. Over the past several quarters we have made considerable progress in demonstrating recording capabilities with several advanced technologies. We believe this positions us well for future product integration. These demonstrations underpin a cost effective, magnetic recording solution that leverages our existing capital and is extendable for the next decade. ", "Finally I will make a few remarks on capital spending. It is important to note that our total capital investments supports our advancement of technology, production maintenance and increased supply. We believe our baseline capital spend is $450-550 million per year with no increase in drive output. We have aligned our current capital plans with industry analyst forecasts of a 650-670 million unit TAM for calendar year 2010 as well as customer demand for our high performance, high capacity product. ", "No significant share shifts are assumed in our planning assumptions. Therefore we have raised our fiscal 2010 capital spending to approximately $750 million which we believe maintains a fundamental balance of supply and demand given the mix of our products. Moving forward we will continue to evaluate business requirements and carefully raise or lower our capital investments to the appropriate levels. ", "In summary our operations and development teams remain focused on delivering time to market products, staging technologies for the future and increasing output and efficiencies throughout the supply chain. ", "Now I will turn the call over to Pat. ", "Patrick O'Malley ", "", "Thanks Bob. You will find the company\u2019s press release, 8-K and additional financial information related to Seagate\u2019s financial performance and other supplemental information in the Investor Relations section of Seagate\u2019s website at Seagate.com. ", "I will start with some comments regarding the fiscal Q2 results, then touch on the balance sheet and close with our March quarter outlook. ", "For the December quarter Seagate\u2019s unit shipments were 49.9 million, up 8% compared to the prior quarter and up 36% compared to the year-ago quarter. Revenue for the quarter was $3.03 billion, up 14% from the previous quarter and up 33% year-over-year. ", "Gross margin for the December quarter expanded to 30.5%, an increase of roughly 600 basis points compared to the prior quarter due to a stable pricing environment reflecting tight industry supply, the shift of the company\u2019s higher capacity, higher performing drives in the desktop and notebook markets and an increased demand for enterprise class products and improving factory efficiencies and utilization. ", "R&D and SG&A totaled $337 million for the December quarter essentially in line with our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. The cost of restoring salaries previously subject to the company wide salary reductions implemented last January and funding of performance based variable compensation plan are included in the December quarter\u2019s results. The tax provision for the December quarter was a benefit of $6 million due to favorable adjustments due to favorable adjustments related to recent tax legislation changes and other tax adjustments. For the balance of fiscal year 2010 we are now using for planning purposes a tax rate of 3%. ", "Moving onto the balance sheet, at this time last year Seagate had a net debt position of approximately $1 billion. Conversely because of strong cash generation over the last six months the company now has a net cash position of approximately $200 million. Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $2.2 billion at the end of the December quarter, up $418 million as compared to the September quarter. Cash flow from operations was $753 million for the December quarter while free cash flow was $650 million. ", "The [match core] 6.8 convert reaches maturity in April of this year and we expect to use cash for approximately $80 million to retire this debt. Beyond the April maturity the next debt occurs in October of 2011 and currently has a principle amount of approximately $560 million. All of Seagate\u2019s cash is fully accessible without meaningful tax implications to service our debt. Depreciation and amortization from the December quarter was $192 million including approximately $10 million of purchase intangibles amortization. ", "Now I would like to update the outlook for the March quarter. As we did last quarter we will first discuss the key assumptions on which we have based our outlook, the Variability surrounding Chinese New Year. Pricing trends will reflect the balanced supply and demand environment and Seagate will continue to lever time to market products. ", "Consequently for the March quarter the company expects the following: Industry unit TAM of 155-160 million. Revenue of approximately $2.9 to $3.1 billion. R&D and SG&A costs of approximately $340 million. Other income expense of a net expense of approximately $35 million. A tax rate for planning purposes of 3%. An outstanding share count of approximately 530 million and GAAP earnings per share of $0.88 to $0.92 which includes approximately $0.02 in charges related to purchase intangibles amortization expense. ", "It is important to note that the impact of modeling a 3% tax rate and a higher share count for the March quarter is approximately $0.06 per share when compared against the December quarter financial results. Based on results for the first six months combined with our view of the March quarter and beyond it is clear that our financial results for fiscal 2010 will greatly exceed the annual outlook we provided in October. ", "Given the current tightness of supply and how this may extend throughout the calendar year, we feel shareholders are better served by Seagate providing outlook for the June quarter at a later date when our customer base is sufficiently underpinned. The March quarter outlook does not include the impact of any potential new restructuring activities, future mergers, acquisitions, financing, dispositions or other business combinations the company may undertake. The company\u2019s policy is to refrain from commenting on such activities. ", "That concludes my remarks for today. Steve? ", "Stephen Luczo ", "", "Thanks Pat. Entering calendar year 2010 we believe we are in a strong position from a product, technology and operations standpoint and we are very well positioned for the demand opportunities we expect throughout the remainder of the calendar year. ", "I want to thank our employees for their continued focus on achieving our goals. I would also like to thank our customers, suppliers and partners for their ongoing support and confidence in Seagate. We are ready to open up the call for questions. ", "Question and Answer Session ", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets. ", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "I have two related questions if I could. Pat, based on the TAM you provided for March of 155-160 million could you talk a little bit about what the inventory assumption puts and takes are there? In other words are you assuming there is some replenishment from what I think is a fairly dry inventory situation throughout the channel? Or if you could just talk a little bit about the assumptions behind the TAM. ", "William David Mosley ", "", "Our visibility into our OEM customers and what not is limited to the hubs and we believe that product is getting pulled through fairly well. I don\u2019t think there is an inventory replenishment consideration there. In the channel we are just under four weeks which is pretty typical for us. So I would say there may be some other backlog in smaller channels worldwide that bears watching especially earlier in the quarter here but we don\u2019t see a big inventory imbalance. ", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "So in other words the same amount of inventory at the end of the March quarter so it really is demand you are talking about for 160? ", "William David Mosley ", "", "Yes. ", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "My follow-up question if I could, I want to try to understand as you are increasing your expectations for capital or CapEx you talked about the TAM being about 160 million units here in December, how is Seagate and how is the industry lining up for the second half of the calendar year in terms of increase in production units? How do you think the industry is shaping up for total CapEx as we look at the second half of calendar year 2010 please? ", "William David Mosley ", "", "We can\u2019t really speak to the industry. For us, like I said, I think most of the industry analysts are coming in at you know 650-700 or maybe 650-670 as a tighter range on demand for drives throughout calendar year 2010. That clearly accelerates in the September and December quarter and obviously the industry has no ability today to achieve those types of TAMs in the September and December quarter. If you want to put numbers like 170 or 180 or whatever you have to get to the 650-670. ", "I think from Seagate\u2019s perspective therefore we are trying to put capital to work that is consistent with that type of growth. I think the equation gets much tougher obviously because while we control a lot of our own destiny, more than any other drive company, there is obviously an upstream supply chain that has to address this as well and I think it is obviously tougher for some of the upstream supply chain companies to maybe put capital to work quite as quickly. ", "So we still believe throughout calendar year 2010 supply is going to be short of demand throughout the calendar year. We are going to have to work pretty hard to be lined up for September and December. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Kathryn Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley. ", "Kathryn Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "You commented on notebook and desktop trends for March but you do you have a view yet on how much of the strength in enterprise during the fourth quarter was budget flush or catch up from a slow first half versus the beginning of a longer hardware upgrade cycle that continues into March and June? ", "Stephen Luczo ", "", "I think it is hard to say just yet. I think clearly we now have two quarters of enterprise growth that have been pretty strong. We are still not at the historic levels of the mission critical enterprise TAM which I think was about 8.3 million units. Clearly in notebook and desktop and notebook we are above those levels at this point. Another data point is good. That says it is more than just a budget flush. ", "We expect that the March quarter is showing strength. Certainly I think the bigger point from our perspective and it kind of relates to the prior question is if you ask me do I think the demand for the 2010 calendar year enterprise is going to be substantially above 2009 the answer is yes and we believe that Seagate is going to be able to maintain or even perhaps grow share given our portfolio of products. ", "Kathryn Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "So the growth in demand is clearly there it is just a matter of what seasonality looks like as we go? ", "Stephen Luczo ", "", "I think that is right. And clearly once the large system companies provide more clarity on what they see going on that is a better data point. Certainly the discussions we are having with them over the calendar year 2010 indicates strength over the calendar year. ", "Kathryn Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "As a quick follow-up for Pat, last time you were running at this headcount OpEx was $26 million higher. Is the difference systemic changes you made during the downturn that carry into fiscal 2010 and 2011 so that we don\u2019t see a big uptick in OpEx or is there some catch up spending to do? ", "Patrick O'Malley ", "", "No, I think all the catch up spending you see is now baked into our financials whether it is the restoration of salaries, whether it is the reinstatement of variable comp plan, that is all the in the $337 million so the savings above and beyond that is systemic. It is structurally taken out of the business. So if you see an OpEx increase hopefully it will align with where we need to make increased investments whether it is in research and development. We will continue to try and leverage our OpEx at this level with very tactical investments in that area. ", "Stephen Luczo ", "", "I would say if anything our management focus is continuing to get more leverage out of OpEx and continuing to work that number as tightly as we can. So we are not giving up on our OpEx either as a percentage of revenue or even the absolute dollar amount.

I think it is the highest quarter you have ever had in terms of the gross margin and it looks like you are guiding to somewhere around 28.5% gross margin at the midpoint for the March quarter. Obviously December is higher than your long-term target range. I know you have said it would be higher going forward but how sustainable this year is sort of that 28.5% number? What are you thinking about in terms of calendar year 2010? Are we consistently in the 28-30% numbers throughout the calendar year as we have supply and demand imbalance? ", "Patrick O'Malley ", "", "Given the last caveat, you said all things being equal the answer is yes. But I think that is why we have indicated that even for the June quarter we want to get more data. We are lining up with customers through the calendar year now in terms of availability of supply. So we probably have better visibility than the company ever has, certainly in my two tenures. I think your basic assumptions are right. ", "In the March quarter obviously it is a function of as we said of some muted seasonality and some variability around Chinese New Year. To the prior question about how much acceleration is in enterprise and does that continue or is it muted. We are still sorting that all out but your general point is I think on target that we would expect to be above that range through the calendar year.

", "Patrick O'Malley ", "", "I would say we start getting the supply base revved back up to support that. Obviously there is a staging effect. One, we have to bring the longer lead items in first which we started doing this first quarter. We saw a small step up in CapEx which would be your media and head components. As we get closer to September as Steve characterized the step up in your end demand we will bring on the last of the supply chain. So I would characterize over the next few quarters we would like to be at somewhat fairly linear over the next spread as opposed to one big jump to be ready for September. That is how we are planning to bring it more linear over the next two quarters.

What do you see as the dynamic there? Do you just see a particular end markets that are just looking for the capacity? What do you expect over the next 12-18 months in that space as demand seems to be resurging? ", "William David Mosley ", "", "Quite a few dynamics. A couple of points. First, there are things like all in one computers which are quite compelling to high end consumers and are driving some demand. There is also from probably the biggest item is the fact that there continues to be a strong channel for replacement, refurbs and things like that and that is very robust out in the world as 3.5 based replacing desktop tower hard drives. Then I think the other dynamic is we believe there is an increasing number of 3.5 inch products going into custom systems. I could call them home [Navs] but that may be too sweeping a generality. ", "That dynamic we definitely see inside the channel as well so it is a compelling capacity for the value play to the end customer. That is usually via service to the channel. I think the other thing to keep in mind is there are the inklings of a commercial refresh. I wouldn\u2019t say it has taken hold yet but we are definitely seeing that kind of strength in the commercial segments that speak to our interest. That is why 3.5 inch really hasn\u2019t come down as hard as maybe what we foresaw or other industry analysts would have foreseen a couple of quarters ago. ", "Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "So if we get into the second half of the year and a corporate refresh actually does start to take place, do you see 3.5 inch actually being part of this industry tightness as well since so many had moved their production capabilities over to the 2.5 inch side?

So we first have that foremost and we will certainly want to have cash for that. As cash increases above and beyond that we are always looking at the capital structure and how to best serve our shareholders whether it is through repurchase or dividend.

The second element of it is you are going to have to maybe carry some inventory into the September quarter as you build up and install your capacity base so you have that capacity and support online. ", "So depending on how well you bring that capital in or how it could be provided the industry may have to carry some inventory out in the June quarter. ", "William David Mosley ", "", "Or conversely more and more some of the customer dialogue we are having is that the customer may carry that inventory to make sure they have it going into the back half of the year because they are worried about availability of supply as well. So that may actually talk to a different dynamic in the June quarter of actual sell out into customers preparing for the back half of the year. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird. ", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird", "First on ASP into the March quarter should we expect that to be about flattish at 61 or maybe down a dollar? ", "Patrick O'Malley ", "", "[inaudible] where your margin will be down a bit. I think your models are correct with it being down. ", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird", "A question on capacity points, when should we expect to see notebook 1 terabyte, desktop 4 terabyte? Is that second half of calendar 2010? How important are those capacity points to profitability? ", "William David Mosley ", "", "It is not second half of calendar 2010 for those capacity points. I think not really relevant to calendar year 2010. ", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird", "Does that matter much for profitability? The kind of new\u2026", "William David Mosley ", "", "Not in current models. No. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Stephen Fox \u2013 CLSA. ", "Stephen Fox \u2013 CLSA", "Just a clarification on pricing, if you look at like for like pricing are we talking about flattish pricing continuing throughout this calendar year or would you expect to see a return to more normalized pricing maybe at least in the June quarter? Then secondly, if you continue to underestimate demand maybe in the back half of the year what is the opportunity to meet that demand through improved deals and throughput? ", "Stephen Luczo ", "", "I will tag team on the first one and hand it to Bob on the deal improvements and your second question. Obviously on the pricing environment with the technology portfolio leadership we certainly have some leverage on that where we could provide value but as long as the supply/demand stays in relative imbalance whether you call it flat or benign pricing should be maintained whether it is the March quarter or the June quarter. ", "Robert Whitmore ", "", "Could you repeat the second part of your question? ", "Stephen Fox \u2013 CLSA", "Just curious, obviously it is hard to predict what type of cycle we are in right now. If you are underestimating demand for the second half of the calendar year relative to your capital right now is there an opportunity to still meet some of that through better yields and throughput or is that something that is going to take longer? ", "Robert Whitmore ", "", "We are driving yields up all the time and it is part of our plan to do that. ", "Stephen Luczo ", "", "But you probably don\u2019t have the upstream supply chain to make it all work. I think if the demand profile is above the 650-670 range it is going to be really difficult for the industry to respond to that. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Kaushik Roy \u2013 Wedbush Morgan. ", "Kaushik Roy \u2013 Wedbush Morgan", "Can you give us an update on solid state drives? How many units you have shipped so far or when you can come up with [SAS assistee]? Then what are your expectations for the calendar year? ", "Stephen Luczo ", "", "I won\u2019t speak specifically but what I will say is this, the early samples that we have shipped out have been very well received. Pleasantly surprised I would say relative to the tradeoffs we have made in reliability, performance, cost and capacity. Of course you know about the right endurance challenges that these drives have. I think we are engineering with that in mind foremost to make sure it meets enterprise reliability grades. ", "The SAS offerings will be later this year. I think we will continue to develop exactly what the customer\u2019s need timing wise and need for launching their systems. So that is what we are really focused on right now. ", " ", "Kaushik Roy \u2013 Wedbush Morgan", "And your revenue expectations for this calendar year? ", "Patrick O'Malley ", "", "Very small. We won\u2019t give the revenue expectations but it is still a ascent market. Very much so. ", "Kaushik Roy \u2013 Wedbush Morgan", "Can you talk about the pricing environment in the enterprise segment? When you talk to OEMs are you seeing them putting more pressure as entering the enterprise segment? ", "William David Mosley ", "", "I think we believe that we have a very broad portfolio of course and I think we have the right offerings for the customer right now. Obviously we talk about what the customers need in order to hit their goals as well all the time. So with the breadth of our portfolio it is really the way we address the market. I won\u2019t speak specifically\u2026", "Stephen Luczo ", "", "Our OEMs are always very tough to negotiate with on the price side. That hasn\u2019t changed. We respond to that by having a very broad portfolio which allows us to create value for our company by the broadness of our portfolio which no other company really has and we don\u2019t expect will have for a number of years. They are tough negotiations but I would caveat that again though in the current supply/demand situation most of our large OEM customers are highly focused on availability of supply particularly with our product leadership across the portfolio but especially in the enterprise space. So the discussions clearly have focused on ability of supply and obviously we meet the cost targets they need to drive the revenues they are trying to achieve as well. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah - Brean, Murray, Carret & Co.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean, Murray, Carret & Co.", "I believe you made a comment in the prepared remarks there was still room for operational improvement going forward. I am wondering where that might occur and if we might expect to see it at the gross margin line, OpEx, leverage, how it might show up. ", "Stephen Luczo ", "", "I think in both spots. I think we executed well in the quarter and we have a nice portfolio but the reality is we are kind of running at stride now and the question is how do you extend that. Whether or not it is as you say OpEx leverage or improving yields faster in the factory. There is obviously we are concerned about meeting demand. So yielding increases at the component level or the factor level, getting better test times, all that stuff results in us being able to meet customer demand that is in excess of supply right now which we have margin impact as well as obviously operating ratio impact. We believe there is definitely improvement in front of us and that is what we are off to do. ", "Ananda Baruah - Brean, Murray, Carret & Co.", "Where do you view the next significant capacity point battleground? The enterprise, desktop, notebook? I guess with the timing of those do you expect them to be and I guess how do you see yourselves in light of what is going on in the server extended marketplace to be? ", "Stephen Luczo ", "", "I\u2019m not sure I understand the question. ", "Ananda Baruah - Brean, Murray, Carret & Co.", "Where do you see and when do you see the next significant capacity battleground taking place? What do you see those capacity points as being? ", "William David Mosley ", "", "Like Bob went through in his section we have in enterprise we just launched two new 600 GB products, one 2.5 inch and 3.5 inch, 10,000 RPM and 15,000 RPM respectively that will be ramping throughout the rest of this calendar year. I think that will be the focus item for the enterprise market. In desktop 1 terabyte and 500 GB will continue to be really strong I think throughout the rest of the year. Then Bob talked about the 2 terabyte products that we are ramping right now. Specifically for business critical applications or cloud applications and also a desktop version of that which is really the next generation capacity point that he mentioned. ", "Then in the notebook we see strength at 320 GB and 500 GB. I don\u2019t think that is going to markedly change. It might shift a little bit between one and the other but I don\u2019t think maybe to one of the earlier questions I don\u2019t think it will go significantly north of that in calendar year 2010. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets ", "I had a question I think at 50 million units right now you are probably running at full capacity. How high will you be able to ramp the unit production number as you add on about $750 million of CapEx in fiscal 2010? ", "Patrick O'Malley ", "", "I think what we said is it is highly dependent on mix. We expect the TAMs for the year to go up by 15-20%. Our share is going to be constant. So we think we ought to be able to meet that TAM increase. That is what we are planning for. ", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets ", "What would the trigger be to add capacity beyond that to possibly gain more market share or target incremental demand that may come up in the back half of the year. Would you need to [audio break] in March? ", "Stephen Luczo ", "", "I don\u2019t think we would put any capacity in place to assume taking market share unless there was a product leadership that made that obvious or a strategic relationship where we were actually lining up capital for specific customers. Again, I think we are looking at the industry outlooks and matching our supply to that. Those outlooks basically are very compatible with the customer input we are getting in terms of what the rest of the year looks like. If there was obviously a delta between that and what we are seeing one direction or the other then we are obviously going to obviously either lower or increase capital but it is going to be in response to customer requirements for sure. ", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets ", "It sounds like most of the incremental capacity will come live in the end of June or early September quarter timeline. Is that fair? ", "William David Mosley ", "", "It will be throughout the calendar year really. ", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets ", "Inventory was up a little at 3.5-4% sequentially. Was there anything specific that drove that? ", "Patrick O'Malley ", "", "No it was just booking into our supply chain with our customers. We are very happy with the terms [of 13] and lining up to what the January supply and we felt that was the appropriate level to carry. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Christian Schwab \u2013 Craig-Hallum Capital Group. ", "Christian Schwab \u2013 Craig-Hallum Capital Group", "You mentioned earlier some of the OEM customers going into the second half could be slightly cautious and fearful about securing enough product for demand. Should we assume you are starting strategic relationships or discussions with those OEMs or was that just a point suggesting that possibly that may occur in June? ", "Stephen Luczo ", "", "I would hate to endorse a word like fearful. I would hate to think our customers were going to fear us. Like I said last quarter or even the quarter before. Whenever there is supply/demand imbalance the drive industry really becomes strategic. I think there is something much more fundamental going on here which is with the economic downturn and the reduction that people saw across most every product area in the world, the demand for storage continued to accelerate in terms of capacity and number of units to the tune where 2009 was 100 million units greater than people thought at the beginning of the year. So one I think what people recognize is the demand for compute and the demand for storage in particular is pretty fundamental and I think that has people rethinking their outlook going forward. ", "Secondly I do think people are realizing that the entire supply chain as it relates to drives has changed dramatically over the last 4-5 years. The companies that obviously have large R&D budgets and the ability to invest in capital and capital equipment that drives R&D and production have scale advantage. I think we are seeing that. I think our customers see that. Then yes, we do have discussions that certainly extend several quarters out about availability of supply. I think it is a fundamental change that our customers are understanding. I don\u2019t think they are afraid of it. I think it is just a new world they are planning to and it obviously helps us in terms of capacity adds and technology roadmaps and things like that. I guess I do believe it is more of a partnership going forward in terms of certainly the very large computer companies. ", "Christian Schwab \u2013 Craig-Hallum Capital Group", "It appears given the consolidation and the less number of suppliers and the expansion of storage in particular hard drives above and beyond just selling into PCs that there seems to be some structural change going on within the industry. Is that fair to say? I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth. ", "Stephen Luczo ", "", "I think there is structural change that has been going on for 20 years. Consolidation I think has an implication of a lot of proactive activity. I guess I call it rationalization or that the industry is clearly always laying supply and demand, adequacy of investment and technology leadership wins. I think we are seeing that. I think the second point is probably the even more relevant one and that is the application space has changed so dramatically over the last 20 years. Again this didn\u2019t just happen last week. The compute environment has gone from a glass room to kids with little things in their hands that have 16 or 32 gigs of storage that gets probably backed up three different ways on disc drives. ", "I think the application set has changed dramatically in both commercial and consumer environments and I think clearly the entire supply chain has changed. Then the technology is getting harder. So if you don\u2019t have big resources to put in advancing the technology you are not going to stay in business. I think that is what has happened and gets termed as consolidation.

My name is Amity and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time all participants on a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks there will be a question and answer session.

Please go ahead.", "Steve Luczo", "Thank you, Amity. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Pat O'Malley, our Chief Financial Officer; Bob Whitmore, our Chief Technology Officer and Head of R&D and Manufacturing Operations and Dave Mosley, Head of Sales, Marketing and Product Line Management.", "Entering the March quarter we discussed a few underlying assumptions on which we based our financial outlook, including a muted seasonal pattern with variability around the lunar New Year, pricing trends that would reflect balance supply and demand, and the Seagate would continue to deliver time to market products.", "With respect to demand in the March quarter the total available market countered seasonal patterns and grew to approximately 163 million units, higher than our original expectation of 155 to 160 million units. The 163 million units were likely short of unconstrained demand. As indicated by low inventory levels, in our OEM and distribution channels.", "As expected, we experienced variability and demand during January and February, particularly, around lunar New Year for notebook drives. As was the case last year, demand for Seagate products increased and sustained throughout the month of March.", "Pricing in the March quarter was as we planned. As a result of a relatively balance supply and demand profile throughout the quarter. Additionally, channel inventory levels for Seagate products remain at around three weeks across all geographies and across all product offering. Finally, as planned, Seagate continue to shift time to market products in all markets with the broadest offering in the industry.", "Consistent with our expectations we delivered strong operational and financial results. Revenue in the March quarter reached $3 billion, a 42% increase year-over-year. Net income was $518 million resulting in $1 of diluted earnings per share.", "While the financial and operating results were strong, there were internal supply chain constraints that impacted our mix optimization early in the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $577 million in the quarter and we repurchased approximately $250 million of our common shares.", "As we plan for the June quarter, we are expecting the TAM will be 155 million units to 160 million units. However, there is some growing evidence that the seasonal declines in the notebook and desktop markets historically associated with the March and June quarters are diminishing. Due to the continued growth in Asia-Pacific demand, back to school bills occurring earlier in the summer, as customers attempt to optimize their supply chains and dynamics around lunar New Year.", "Given the strength of the March quarter, and our current outlook for June, we are also more confident in our estimate of a calendar 2010 TAM of between 650 million units and 670 million units.", "As stated previously, our TAM outlook for the calendar 2010 does not include a significant commercial refresh cycle. However, we do believe there are early indications that the commercial refresh cycle has begun as evidenced by the strength in the 3.5-inch product TAM.", "Additionally, we believe it is increasingly likely that our broader economic recovery in the United States and Europe will occur later in the calendar year, resulting in a potential for increase in demand above our current forecast of 650 million units to 670 million units. We still believe, however, that the HDD industry is constrained to a total output of around 670 million units given capacity, yields, component supply, technology transitions and capital deployment schedule for the remainder of calendar 2010.", "Consistent with this outlook, we anticipate price erosion to be lower than historical patterns primarily due to tight supply for the remainder of the calendar year. Consequently, many of our OEM and distribution customers continue to emphasize supply availability as their primary concern in our discussions for the June quarter and through the remainder of calendar 2010.", "We remain focused on continued improvements across our global operations, delivering the best products to our customers and achieving strong financial performance to our shareholders.", "I will now turn the call over to Dave to discuss specific market dynamics in fiscal Q3 and going into fiscal Q4.", "Dave Mosley", "Thanks, Steve. First, I will provide some commentary on the overall industry during the quarter. We believe the HDD industry shipped approximately 163 million units during the quarter. Total shipments were dictated by the supply capability of HDD makers and the respective unit optimization across certain markets.", "Contrary to the last two quarters, total 3.5-inch unit shipments surpassed 2.5-inch unit shipments. OEM 3.5-inch poles were strong and the desktop channel business exhibited typical sales patterns in the March quarter.", "Conversely, overall, industry demand for 2.5-inch drive in January and February was impacted by notebook component and labor availability. But the situation quickly improved in March. These two dynamics allowed 3.5-inch to outpace 2.5-inch unit demand.", "We believe the HDD industry managed inventory appropriately from March quarter. And that Seagate specifically exited the quarter was channel inventory for desktop notebook and enterprise drives close to three weeks, which is below historical level.", "Looking at our market performance, Seagate shipments grew 31% from the year ago quarter to a record 50.3 million units demonstrating continued HDD demand resilience against the macro economic background.", "We continue to meet our customers demand for high capacity, high performance product configurations across all markets. Seagate delivered over 70% of its unit shipments to OEM customers during the quarter.", "Now, I will give some detail on a few key markets. Seagate shipped 5.1 million drives for mission critical server and storage applications during the quarter, representing an 11% increase quarter-over-quarter. We extended our leading share position as we believe the total available market in this space was essentially flat from the December quarter.", "These shipments were slightly higher than we had planned at the beginning of the quarter as our products experienced strong demand and with our flexible supply chain we were able to take advantage of competitive execution issues.", "We believe that the demand picture for enterprise storage systems is continuing to improve and expect to effectively meet that growing demand throughout the remainder of the calendar year. We expect the TAM for mission critical enterprise drives to be slightly down in the June quarter consistent with seasonality. And we expect our share to be more consistent with historical levels.", "The TAM and the desktop market for the March quarter was approximately 65.1 million units, up 4% sequentially, and up 24% year-over-year. Seagate shipped 24.6 million units in this space. For the June quarter we expect the desktop TAM to be flat sequentially.", "Seagate shipped 13.7 million units into the mobile compute market, an increase of 54% from the year ago quarter. The overall TAM in the mobile compute space was approximately 71 million units in the March quarter, essentially flat sequentially and up 65% year-over-year.", "We expect the TAM in the mobile compute space for the June quarter to be seasonal and slightly down sequentially. That said it is possible that the TAM for the June quarter for 2.5-inch mobile drives could be higher sequentially because of the supply chain optimization. In addition, depending upon the demand profile of June we may have the opportunity to build some inventory to serve customer demand in the back half of the calendar year.", "Finally, we believe that the retail market for both Seagate branded products and for the external Box Builders that we service saw relatively flat demand quarter-over-quarter, with high growth in Asia tampered by seasonal slowdowns in the U.S. and Europe.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Bob to provide an update on our operations and product development.", "Bob Whitmore", "Thanks, Dave. The focus in R&D and operations continues to be on executing time to market, product introductions, supplying our customers with products in a robust demand environment. Today, I will give an update on products, operations, component supply and capital investments.", "I will start with a brief overview of new product development. In mission critical enterprise we move forward and transitioning the 2.5-inch 10,000 RPM product line from 450 GB to 600 GB. We have completed most customer qualifications and are increasing volume production.", "In business critical and cloud applications we continue to increase our output for a 2.5-inch 500 GB and 3.5-inch 2 terabyte product lines. As for the desktop market, we continue to optimize an increased production of the 500 GB per disk product line as well as starting the transition to 667 GB per disk.", "Finally, in notebook, we continue to qualify in increased production of our 320 GB per disk and new 7 mm 250 GB product lines. Additionally, we have now shipped the industry\u2019s first 7200 RPM product, a 375 GB per disk into our retail business and are shipping to OEMs this quarter.", "Overall, we continue to make good progress on new product introductions and execution and time to market deliveries for the broadest portfolio in the industry.", "I will now give some detail as it relates to operations, supply and capital. As mentioned earlier, we continue to run our operations in a fully utilized manner throughout the quarter. Inventory turns for the quarter were approximately 12.5, well within our target range of 11 turns to 13 turns. Raw materials and components were up over quarter due to the strategic replenishment of our component and supply lines to more normal levels and in anticipation of growth in the upcoming quarters.", "Similar to the previous quarter, the supply chain was generally tight for Seagate and the industry. We expect that trend to continue for this quarter and for the remainder of the calendar year. Critical components continue to be the supply of glass substrates, finished media and heads. Despite having this pressure in the supply chain we are underpinned to support the current financial outlook and well positioned to meet the increased demand through the end of the calendar year.", "Finally, I will make a few comments on our capital investments. Today\u2019s robust demand environment and the broad acceptance of our products require capital investments that line our capacity to support 650 million units to 670 million units industry TAM for the calendar year 2010. This represents a year-over-year increase of 15% to 20% and is in line with third-party analyst growth estimates.", "As we have discussed in the past capital investments are a function of revenue growth opportunities, the need to support customer requirements, along with future technology transitions, and aerial density advancements. As such, the capital planning process is dynamic and we will continuously evaluate business requirements and raise or lower our capital investments properly.", "In summary, our development and operation teams remain focus on delivering time to market products, staging technologies for the future and increasing our factory output and efficiency throughout the supply chain.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Pat.", "Pat O'Malley", "Thanks, Bob. You will find the Company\u2019s press release, 8-K and additional financial information related to Seagate\u2019s financial performance and other supplemental information in the Investor Relations section of Seagate\u2019s Web site at seagate.com.", "I will start with some comments regarding the fiscal Q3 results, then touch on the balance sheet and close with our June quarter outlook. For the March quarter Seagate reported shipments of 50.3 million units and revenue of $3.05 billion, up slightly as compared to the prior quarter and up 31% and 42% from a year ago period respectively.", "Gross margin for the March quarter was 29.6%, roughly 40 basis points better than our midpoint guidance implied. R&D and SG&A totaled $329 million for the March quarter better than expected due to R&D spending that shifted to future quarters and discrete items benefiting SG&A.", "The tax provision for the March quarter was $4 million as compared to a benefit of $6 million in the prior quarter. We continue to use for planning purposes a tax rate of 3%. Note that the June quarter is our fiscal year end and any adjustments are required to our annual book tax rate will be reflected in the provision for the quarter.", "Moving now to the balance sheet, cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments totaled $2.4 billion at the end of the March quarter, up approximately $117 million as compared to the December quarter. Cash flow from operations was $577 million, capital investments were $108 million and free cash flow was $397 million.", "In late January, the Board approved an anti-dilution stock repurchase plan. Under this plan, the company repurchased 13.5 million common shares for approximately $250 million during the March quarter.", "Over the next 18 months we will continue to reshape the capital structure of the company with a primary objectives been an overall debt level of $1.5 billion to $1.75 billion and a fully diluted share count of 500 million shares or less.", "Now, I like to update the outlook for the June quarter. The key assumptions on which we are based our outlook are a historical pattern for unit demand which for June quarter is down 2% to 5% sequentially.", "Pricing trends better than historical for June quarter, reflecting a balance supply and demand environment. And our competition will likely improve the current enterprise class product offering and Seagate share in this market will trend closer to historical levels.", "As a result, for the June quarter the Company expects the following", "Industry unit TAM of 155 million to 160 million. Revenue of $2.85 billion to $3.05 billion. R&D and SG&A costs were approximately $340 million.", "Other income and expense of a net expense of approximately $35 million. A tax rate for planning purposes of 3%. Outstanding share count were approximately 520 million and GAAP earnings per share of $0.81 to $0.85 per share which includes approximately $0.02 in charge related to purchase intangible amortization expense.", "The June quarter outlook does not include the impact of any potential new, restructuring activities. Future mergers, acquisitions, financing, dispositions for other business combinations that Company may undertake, the Company\u2019s policy is to refrain from commenting on such activities.", "That concludes my remarks for today. Steve?", "Steve Luczo", "Thanks, Pat. I believe we are well-positioned to meet the strong demand profile we expect for the remainder of the calendar year. I want to thank our employees for their ongoing commitment and hard work. And I would also like to thank our customers, suppliers and partners for their ongoing support and confidence in Seagate. Amity, we are ready to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Kevin Hunt with Hapoalim Securities. Please proceed.", "Kevin Hunt \u2013 Hapoalim Securities", "Hi, I\u2019ve had a couple things. I might have missed it, but did you guys say gross margin range for next quarter?", "Pat O'Malley", "No, we didn\u2019t say that. It would imply that we\u2019re slightly down on our gross margin this quarter.", "Kevin Hunt \u2013 Hapoalim Securities", "Okay. And your side of the puts and take on what would be moving down or up, what you\u2019re expecting?", "Pat O'Malley", "It\u2019s just probably the mix of the enterprise as I said we\u2019re going to historical levels in enterprise versus this prior quarter and some positive on the mix of our other product segments.", "Kevin Hunt \u2013 Hapoalim Securities", "Okay. And then one other, Bob, you touched briefly on the branded products, but in terms of like, assuming that\u2019s what you\u2019re referring to is in the CE product category list in that, looks like it was very strong in a quarter. Any additional kind of color there, what might have been going on throughout that?", "Bob Whitmore", "What are you talking about specifically? CE is different than branded.", "Kevin Hunt \u2013 Hapoalim Securities", "Oh that\u2019s I\u2019m saying. I didn\u2019t hear you saying anything about CE. So I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re talking?", "Bob Whitmore", "No, we didn\u2019t talk about specifically. I can give a little bit more color I think Kevin. The CE breaks basically into the DVR market, the gaming market; we participated in both and did quite well in both. I think we believe our DVR products were the share leader in DVR and then we started participating in some of the gaming markets as well and did over a million drive in games.", "Kevin Hunt \u2013 Hapoalim Securities", "Okay. And that seems like kind of counter seasonal or not normal for a March quarter but that there maybe not so much in the DVR market, but on gaming at least, so is there anything different going on there in the trends in that market or?", "Dave Mosley", "I don\u2019t think so. I think it\u2019s just fairly expected. I think seasonally and some of those as we talk about a number of times some of the supply chain optimization happen, market segments to market segments also.", "Bob Whitmore", "Its better you talk to our customers about what they\u2019re doing, what their builds and profiles versus us having talk about it, Kevin.", "Kevin Hunt \u2013 Hapoalim Securities", "Okay, all right, thanks a lot, guys.", "Dave Mosley", "There\u2019s nothing really a seasonal about it.", "Kevin Hunt \u2013 Hapoalim Securities", "Okay, thanks you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Please proceed.", "Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "Thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions. First, kind of a bigger picture question on the structural changes in the industry. What have you seen over the past year that really industry needs to understand when it comes to changes in seasonality or mix or production capability as opposed to maybe some of the historical rules of thumb on approaching the group whether it comes to CapEx or pricing or the channel or any help would be appreciated?", "Steve Luczo", "Well, I think, Rich, depending on how you define the industry, I think if you look at the supply chain and clearly, the supply chain has changed structurally and the drive industries changed structurally and our customer bases changed structurally. And if you look at who recognizes that in the industry participants I think it\u2019s all the players, how the supply chain is allocating capital and aligning with drive companies and how our customers are aligning with us.", "I think all those relationships have changed pretty dramatically over the last three years to five years, I mean in general, what\u2019s happened over the last ten years is that the drive industry was a lot more fragmented ten years ago and the customer base was lot more consolidated. And now the drive industry and the supply chain is consolidated and the customer base is actually more fragmented both with respect to of OEMs and then clearly with respect to new categories like CE being huge now and the retail business.", "So I think that the industry has probably responded fairly well and as you say, it\u2019s changing the demand profile throughout the year and its one of the things that along with the growth in Asia, we\u2019ve certainly seen more linearity within a quarter and we\u2019re starting to see more linearity even across a calendar year although early the back half of this year seems to be certainly setting up for some fairly decent growth That could be economic as well as normal kind of September-December quarter trend.", "I think the investment community just depends I think the analyst community is in terms of the industry analyst I think have been probably on the subject fairly well, I mean I think John Monroe has been writing about it for well over a year now. I think the sell side analyst some get it and some preferring to PEs and earnings valuations that are historically based which maybe as an appropriate. And I think on the buy side stocks are trading at 30% to 40% below PE levels that they were off when the industry was more fragmented with fewer customers. So probably either a different analysis or a lag in terms of believing that something really has structurally changed. But I think it\u2019s probably just more execution by the industrial help make that clear.", "Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "Okay, then secondly, I guess more a tactical question on what happened in the March quarter when it comes to the enterprise. What were you seeing from a competitive front and how were you able to meet the demand so quickly? Because that\u2019s something happened towards the end of the quarter, with that product you\u2019re staging for Q3 demand and you\u2019re able to fulfill it or any color would be good?", "Dave Mosley", "No, I\u2019d say, we keep healthy supply chain always on enterprise to start from pretty much the start of the quarter onwards, just strong hope for our products, both the 2.5-inch and 3.5-inches by the mission critical alliance. And we believe that was due to competitive execution issues that our share was higher than we expected going into the quarter.", "Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "Have those issues been resolved with this competitor?", "Dave Mosley", "I\u2019m clear right now. You said competitor, Rich, I don\u2019t know that it was a competitor, should have been more than one competitor.", "Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "Okay great, thank you very much.", "Pat O'Malley", "And Rich, be clear we\u2019re guiding that they will \u2013", "Dave Mosley", "(inaudible)", "Pat O'Malley", "Right. So, we\u2019re making the assumption that\u2019s going to be the case. So as they\u2019ve said we keep a healthy supply chain there and we opportunistically and structurally support that and it came our way.", "Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "Okay, thank you.", "Dave Mosley", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes of Barclays Capital. Please proceed.", "Ben Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Hey, thanks a lot. Could you talk a little bit about the linearity of the quarter, in particular, there were just some speculations out there about availability picking up in March. What was that true and did you see any competitive drive availability that impacted the market towards the end of the quarter or was all that speculation kind of overblown and I have just a follow-up? Thanks.", "Steve Luczo", "Ben, I said in my comments that I think it was a fairly seasonal or fairly typical March quarter and some of that does come especially in the channel to be higher in March than it is in January. We also saw some, I will call it some natural muting before Chinese New Year, in January in particular, because of component constraints on notebook. So I think that did drive some different linearity behaviors and what we saw for example, in the December quarter.", "I think we had some mix issues of our own as well that you could be interpreted various different ways in January but we made that up by March. So in aggregate I think the quarter ended up fairly predictable and fairly typical historically. As a matter of fact I think the inventory levels are probably lower than what we would generally see historically. So that\u2019s why we said everybody behaved themselves.", "Ben Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital", "And then my follow-up is with regard to the calendar second quarter, I mean, you\u2019re guiding units down, 2% to 5% but you also said a lot of things in your comments about how it could be better than that. So I guess what are you trying to say have you seen indications from your customers that it probably is better but you just going to guide it down 2% to 5% and what exactly are you seeing that gives you the confidence that it could be a little better than that?", "Dave Mosley", "I will try in this way. So, this is seasonally down that much. I think most of the customers right now because of comments that we\u2019re all hearing together are a little bit gun shy about carrying inventory at the end of this quarter and so on and so forth. But they see a big back half of the year and people are fairly consistent in that. So they will be worried about supply as well. So our guidance is that as we go up through a step function into the following quarter we\u2019re going to watch very carefully, manage our inventory very carefully, if we see the opportunity to allay some of those fears, especially take advantage of supply chain optimization, get things on board up against back to school and so on, we will do that, we will do that with our customers as we approach June.", "Steve Luczo", "And I think the other kind of unknown variable is the historical patterns up until maybe last one year or two years haven\u2019t really encompassed the level of demand that we get out of Asia Pac that we do now. And because those economies are so large and are growing so quickly that they can also tend to offset what might be \u201cA typical seasonal decline\u201d that was mostly a U.S. Europe phenomenon or the 20 years that we look at historically. So talking to a lot of the producers whether or not it\u2019s OEM or ODM, they will make those decisions sometime in the May to end of June timeframe and depending on how really they make them a good it could positively impact June in a way that we haven\u2019t seen historically.", "Ben Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital", "All right, thanks and one final if can just impose is you mentioned that the industry analysts generally see demand increasing 15% to 20%, but I would think that investors are really thinking at the PC markets up around 20% this year, and you\u2019re increasing TAM 15% to 20% I mean do you think there is a chance that disk drive capacity could hold back the growth in the PC market this year or things that type or are things that have potentially to, do you have a potential to meet demand if indeed 20%, 20% plus is, is possible in the PC market?", "Dave Mosley", "Yes, again, I think we\u2019re mixing and matching between overall TAM versus PC and then between desktop and notebook. I think right now the industry is fairly well aligned to the growth that that\u2019s the customers are forecasting. On the other hand if demand is stronger either because there\u2019s a commercial refresh cycle that stronger than people are booking in or if the Europe and the U.S. pick up in ways that are currently forecasted than it could be a struggle, I mean right now though it feels everybody is kind of go and flat out and meeting the demand or maybe just shy of the constrained demand that\u2019s there.", "Ben Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JP Morgan. Please proceed.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013JP Morgan", "Yes, thank you, good afternoon. A couple of questions. First, I want to follow up on Dave\u2019s comments earlier about the supply chain optimization that could potentially help Seagate build inventory in the June quarter. Just kind of curious how that could happen? Can you give us a little more on the puts and takes if the industry is so constrained how you could suddenly build inventory for the September quarter?", "Steve Luczo", "Why we buy and build inventory for the September quarter, that\u2019s what I would say in with supply chain optimization. I think what we would do is we would look out into July, August timeframe and say we\u2019re going to have to build inventory up against that at the back end of this quarter down. The question is then relative to outbound supply chain and ocean freight and things like that what do we want to do is to optimize say a six month look at this from Q4 into Q1, we would certainly take those opportunities where we could.", "Dave Mosley", "I think the point is that if June is stronger than what we\u2019re thinking we\u2019re going to be flat out, we\u2019re not going to have the opportunity to build inventory that we could use in September or December. If June is seasonal or if it\u2019s weaker we probably use that as an opportunity to build the inventory in September and December because the back half ramps are pretty extreme.", "Steve Luczo", "More clarity?", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013JP Morgan", "Yes, that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019m trying to get a sense in terms of the wiggle room so that was helpful there \u2013?", "Steve Luczo", "It\u2019s not a lot but we\u2019ll take what we can get.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. And then the other follow-up is commentary on CapEx. Should we still stick with the 700 million bogeys for the fiscal year and then how should we think about the next two quarters out there as far as making the balance 2010, I guess still be around 20% or so for CapEx growth for the calendar year?", "Steve Luczo", "I think that the 750 number is still about right and no change really to 2010. The number we gave you for 2010 was again against 650 to 670 TAM which is kind of we think that the industry is capped out. So doesn\u2019t make sense to invest capital beyond that the whole supply chain can handle it.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Sure. And just lastly, Steve, clearly, price has been a big topic for lot of investors out there and it seems like you kind of some of the bare mongering out there in terms of pricing not going to be under as much pressure we see at. Any sense in terms of Seagate or other participants able to bundle with some of the key OEMs to kind of lay their concerns about constraints from a component perspective and is that kind of give you a pricing umbrella there to help out?", "Steve Luczo", "Not sure I understand the question. Can you \u2013?", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "I\u2019m just trying to get a sense in terms of from a pricing perspective. Just given how you and WD are a lot better position right now versus Hitachi and Fujitsu with some of their technology issues are you guys able to guarantee more volume to certain OEMs and thereby they give you better price?", "Steve Luczo", "Look, the pricing is highly competitive, always will be in this industry. And we understand that getting all of our technologies whether or not at the semiconductor or disk drive or PCBA or anything else is how we drive demand. So I think pricing is in balance now with the level of our technology and the capacities that we have. And for sure, we believe that our model which has two huge elements to it. One is a very broad product portfolio and two is a highly integrated supply chain work in our favor when demand and supply are tied at they are right now, when I think our customers recognize it as well.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Fox with CLSA. Please proceed.", "Stephen Fox \u2013 CLSA", "Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could take into the enterprise market a little bit. I understand what you\u2019re talking about with competitive dynamics, but there\u2019s been a lot of evidence that we\u2019re more in a cycle on enterprise class type of products. If you look at your last four quarters I don\u2019t know if that give you the numbers but they\u2019ve been sequentially up significantly four quarters in a row. Why wouldn\u2019t you continue to expect that in the June quarter? I know you won\u2019t be conservative, but is there a chance that we can continue to see strength in the cycle or is there something else that you\u2019re seeing?", "Dave Mosley", "Well, I would say if I go back four quarters we were really hitting at the time what we talked about with the bare refresh rate. I mean there was really not that growth. So how much replenishment went on over the last couple of quarters is one way to look at it. We\u2019re still not theoretically back to where we\u2019re before, the macroeconomic front sharpened. I do think that there are possibilities people are talking about certain refresh, there are possibilities in storage for more growth. I mean we\u2019re not really baking that in and we don\u2019t think it would happen in the June seasonal quarter anyway but we\u2019ll react to it if it starts.", "Stephen Fox \u2013 CLSA", "And definitely where you wouldn\u2019t be constrained if you saw upside to your expectations right now?", "Dave Mosley", "No.", "Stephen Fox \u2013 CLSA", "And then last question can you just talk a little bit more I think you mentioned that external demand it was especially strong in Asia. I mean is there something in particular that\u2019s driving that now as opposed to what you\u2019ve been seeing in North America or is just that similar dynamics that have moved further East?", "Dave Mosley", "I think some of the models are developing quite well in Asia and even if you just look at PC demand it was hardly down quarter-over-quarter. So it\u2019s really back to Steve\u2019s comments around the lunar New Year. Some of those behaviors we\u2019re seeing are driving our calendar Q1 to be fairly strong actually and I think the retail markets are taking advantage of that as well.", "Stephen Fox \u2013 CLSA", "Great, thank you very much.", "Steve Luczo", "Hey, Amity, we\u2019re going to take two more questions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. Please proceed.", "Jayson Noland \u2013 Robert Baird", "Yes, thank you. A follow-up question on inventory build expectations for the June quarter I guess against the guidance are you expecting it channel inventories to come up a bit off of a three-weeks or just more color there would be helpful?", "Dave Mosley", "I would say we model in, Noland, we will have to see how it runs at against the end of the quarter so we\u2019re not expecting to do it. I wouldn\u2019t look at it as channel inventories as much as I would look at a CE held inventory against the build. So what we hold in West maybe around finished goods. If we\u2019re really going into a calendar Q3 this is as big as what we forecast.", "Jayson Noland \u2013 Robert Baird", "Steve, anything else you could add around some of the early trends you are seeing on the commercial side? You said 3.5-inch pull through is pretty good.", "Steve Luczo", "I think there\u2019s obviously been an enough tech companies reporting this week whether or not it was Intel last week and Apple today and it certainly seems like that there is evidence out there is a commercial refresh starting to occur I think people have been fairly consistent, for the last quarter or two that to say that this on the server side they\u2019ve seen that happening, now the question is how does that flow through to commercial notebook and desktop. Starting if you look it\u2019s certainly CIOs are getting more confidence in deploying new technology given frankly, how well be installed basis.", "Jayson Noland \u2013 Robert Baird", "Last question from me, Pat, should we expect ASPs to be down a dollar to end of the June quarter?", "Pat O'Malley", "I think probably somewhat less than that, but it\u2019s a mix but I would just say within that range are better.", "Jayson Noland \u2013 Robert Baird", "Thanks, gentlemen, congrats on a quarter.", "Steve Luczo", "Thanks very much. Last question.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks, guys and congratulations as well. Two questions from me. Number one, I know it looks like according to my estimates the CapEx came in a little bit shy what I was previously estimating. Did you guys give an updated CapEx assumption for the full year, any thoughts as you look in the fiscal 2011? And then I do have a follow-up.", "Dave Mosley", "No change to what we\u2019ve been saying for 2010. It\u2019s too early to talk about 2011. We\u2019ll see where we\u2019re at in terms of later this summer in terms of what the September and December quarter feels like and then if you\u2019re looking at a normal growth off of 2010 of call it 10% to 12%, then we will deploy capital as appropriate.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "And then the follow-up would be it looks like your notebook business down 7% or so in shipments versus the industry of flat sequentially. Maybe you guys were more heavily impacted by some of the component shortages. Maybe you can help us understand that a little bit relative to again the flat industry count?", "Dave Mosley", "No, let\u2019s be clear, so the component shortages weren\u2019t inside of our supply chain. They were under notebook supply chain on the outbound. They happened early in the quarter. We impacted somewhat slightly but I wouldn\u2019t say that we were very far off of our plans going into the quarter.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "And then I will sneak one last one in here. Any update on SSD strategy?", "Dave Mosley", "No change. We think it\u2019s going to be an important business for us and we\u2019re hard at look at it and we feel good about our product road map.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, thanks, guys.", "Dave Mosley", "Thank you. All right, thanks, everyone. And we look forward to talking to you in the next quarter.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.

My name is Amesia and I\u2019ll be your coordinator for today. ", "At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions).", "As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.

Please go ahead.", "Steve Luczo", "", "Thank you, Amesia. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Pat O\u2019Malley, our Chief Financial Officer; Bob Whitmore, our Chief Technology Officer and Head of R&D and Manufacturing Operations and Dave Mosley, Executive Vice President of Sales, Marketing and Product Line Management.", "Beginning with today\u2019s call, we are implementing a new format for our quarterly results announcements. As you have hopefully already seen, we have posted supplemental information about the quarter on our Investor Relations website.", "The majority of the information that Dave, Bob and Pat have previously conveyed verbally on our earnings conference calls is in that document which we posted about two hours ago in order to give investors and analysts time to review it.", "Our goal with this format is to give all of you more time with the basic factual information about the quarter in a form you can download yourselves. And then focus the call on topics and issues that are most important to you. At the end of my prepared remarks, we will address a few questions of particular interest to our investors and then open the call up for questions. ", "I want to start with a few observations about the fiscal year that we just completed and then turn to fiscal Q4. For the year, we saw record shipments of 193.2 million units, record profitability of $1.61 billion, record operating margin of 15.3% and record diluted earnings per share of $3.14. We also generated nearly $2 billion of cash from operations enabling us to continue to strengthen the capital structure by improving our net debt position by $775 million and repurchasing $584 million worth of Seagate common stock.", "We also had a series of important product announcements this year including our successful entry into the Enterprise SSD market with our Pulsar product, our ground breaking Momentus XT solid-state hybrid laptop drive and the high versatile GoFlex family of external storage products.", "These products are expected to broaden our product leadership and provide opportunities for incremental revenue growth in fiscal year 2011 and beyond. We introduced these and many more products while successfully managing through a volatile supply and demand environment and continuing to improve the fundamentals of our business.", "Global demand for storage remained strong throughout the year, reflecting the pace at which digital content and information is being created.", "However, in the June quarter, demand throughout the industry began to slow and exhibited linearity more typical of the June quarter. The biggest issue that we faced in the quarter was that the broader macroeconomic conditions deteriorated during the quarter, particularly in Europe. The economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe and to a lesser extent the global freight interruption due to the Iceland volcanic eruption caused inventory disruption and contributed to an industry TAM near the low end of the expected range. These effects were more pronounced in the consumer market versus the commercial market which in turn negatively impacted mix and pricing. ", "In addition, we believe the economic slowdown resulted in a supply demand imbalance in the quarter of approximately 5 million units. While most industry participants including Seagate reduced production from the prior quarter against the decreasing TAM, there was at least one competitor which significantly increased production during the quarter. As a result, pricing and channel inventory and certain capacities were negatively impacted in the quarter versus our expectations.", "Despite these challenges, we generated revenue of $2.66 billion and gross margin of 27.4% and produced the highest operating profit for Seagate in the June quarter. This was also our fourth most profitable quarter in Seagate history. In addition, Seagate ended the quarter with four weeks of inventory on hand in the distribution channel with the inventory balance across all of our product lines. While we continue to expect that demand will strengthen as we progress the relative remainder of the calendar year, there are many conflicting data points concerning the strength of second half growth. ", "On the negative side, there was a deceleration in hard drive demand in the June quarter. Negative macro economic events impacting exchange rates, availability of credit, and other forms of liquidity, the US Commerce Department reported lower than expected retail sales for the month of June and the recent Federal Reserve forecast of slower second half growth in the United States.", "On the positive side, there was increased indication that the corporate technology refresh is accelerating and certain bellwether technology companies that have longer lead time visibility than Seagate have recently forecasted strong growth for the second half of 2010. Overall, we still believe that the industry TAM for the full calendar year will be approximately 650 million to 670 million units. However, given the mounting negative influences I just discussed, we have shifted our view from one where we might be accelerating through the second half of 2010 to one of more modest momentum.", "For the September quarter, we are planning for the industry TAM to be between 165 million and 175 million units. Our key underlying assumptions for our September quarter financial outlook include: no additional slowdown in consumer spending on technology; no meaningful shifts in market share with Seagate expecting to hold about 30% share. No attempts to shift market share through over-production or aggressive pricing, weeks of inventory on hand to remain apt or around current levels, and that the cooperate technology refresh cycle will continue. ", "Given the uncertainties around second half growth and the historical linearity of September quarters, we believe it is prudent to plan our business with what we hope is a conservative forecast with the ability to respond to upsides, if demand proves to be at the high end of our forecast. As such, we expect revenue of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion and gross margin as a percent of revenue at or near the low end of our target range of 22% to 26%. ", "Given that Seagate\u2019s business is over 70% OEM, we are pricing contracts and negotiated well in advance of the quarter. A large part of our business was insulated from price declines in the June quarter. Therefore, we were able to effectively manage our gross margins in the June quarter. In the September quarter however, the aggressive pricing environment now carries through to our entire product portfolio and will have a more pronounced impact on our gross margin.", "We believe that being closely aligned with our OEMs is a strategic benefit to Seagate over the long term. Finally, we expect R&D and SG&A for the September quarter to be flat sequentially. ", "Before we open up the call for questions, we will address the questions I referenced earlier. I am going to take the first question which is we\u2019ve had a lot of calls from investors inquiring about the success of iPad and other types of tablet or slate devices and what the possible impact might be on the demand for hard disk drives. ", "I think and I haven\u2019t had the opportunity to listen to the Apple call yet other than to look at the top line results which obviously were impressive and obviously the iPad sales were impressive as well. It\u2019s still our belief that devices like this which, are for the most part I would contend not really compute devices but maybe more content viewing devices. They obviously have some capabilities for compute, but on the most part it\u2019s a content viewing device. We still believe that those devices [Audio Gap] at the end of the day increased requirements for storage throughout the eco system, and in particular if they are going to be used for content rich video as wannabe applications that\u2019s being pursued with those devices, maybe a better example is the Cisco slate which is certainly being targeted more in the business environment to enable TelePresence, which again we think is going to drive a lot of back end storage throughout, not just the server but the storage subsystem architectures. ", "To the extent of those devices cannibalized notebook market, which again the notebook systems vendors would have a better view on it than us, then clearly it has a potential for impacting hard disk drives. But to date, we just don\u2019t believe that a lot of people are buying those devices to sub-plant what they were doing with the normal computers. So, our view on it still is that we think this is a net positive for the storage industry and we also believe by the way that those devices, not speaking to the specific products, but at the end of the day will obviously have access to external storage in one or more forms that will follow a benefit to Seagate and any other drive company that\u2019s in the retail business. ", "Second question is why will September gross margins be well below the run rate of the last three quarters, and one made a recovery to the mid to upper end of the target range occur? And I\u2019m going to turn that over to Pat and perhaps to Dave, to weigh in on that.", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "Thanks Steve So, I\u2019ll address that two aspects; one, just the gross margin bridge from where we performed over the last fiscal year to where we expect to perform in the September quarter, and you know, a simple break down on that is that what we are seeing in the September quarter vis-\u00e0-vis, coming out the fourth quarter is that the historical trends for pricing across the whole portfolio or above the norm, not offset traditionally by a mix up in product. So, that itself is probably having the more significant portion of the detriment on our gross margin percentage.", "The other aspect is lower production volumes in the month of June in particular and the early part of the quarter because given the cautious outlook we are going to manage inventory just throughout the quarter very tight, is leading the higher production cost unit for those products going out in this quarter that long term we think we can certainly manage by giving the cautious outlook in this quarter. We certainly want to be prudent with inventory and which could lead to higher per unit cost.", "Now as part of recovery, when the margins could accrete back to the higher end of the range, obviously you have to make some assumptions that the macro economics of the US consumer and the Euro-zone, whether that\u2019s in the countries or just the currency of the Euro. If they stabilize or strengthen, we certainly think that would be an adder to the margin and also with production being brought in line with demand. So having that a balanced equation and with no attempt for share gains by any competitor without really product advantage, so having a balanced price environment with supply and demand.", "I don\u2019t know, Dave do you want to add to that?", "Dave Mosley", "No, I think I am okay.", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "", "So you want to me to segway into the third question which is somewhat related. How much did supply exceed demand in the June quarter and what is the expectation for the September quarter of upstate mostly going in on that.", "Bob Whitmore", "", "Yes. This is addressed in the supplemental that Steve referenced earlier. If you haven\u2019t had a chance to read it yet, we quantify it and said its five million drives where supply exceeded demand and we\u2019re actually moved in the quarter. Putting an exact number on this is always difficult but I\u2019d say this, I\u2019d break it into really two dynamics. One, very early in the quarter, where the consumer demand particularly in Europe sell-off very quickly. A particularly high caps, so mix was effected as well and there are a lot of dynamics for that. There\u2019s various components, pricing that effect these things and obviously consumer sentiments and other big driver for these shifts that we see going on.", "At that time, I believe that people were still putting out units above what the two demand signals were and putting them into that region and then therefore, starting to move, tried to move those units with price. And so, obviously, when that\u2019s happenings, we\u2019ve got to keep an eye on it to pass comments before we\u2019ve got to make sure that we ratchet back production as quickly as possible to make sure supply and demand stay in balance. The industry always needs to a better job at that. At the back end of June, it\u2019s a little bit different as typically this quarter, as Steve referenced, the linearity of 50% of the quarter is done in the month of June.", "I think we\u2019re even a little bit higher than that this time and in my opinion right now, some of the deals that were taken, that I saw taken probably really could have been fulfilled at July, supply it anyway. So I think, I think not controlling production there at the back end is probably causing some of those other behaviors also. So that\u2019s why, that\u2019s how I\u2019d rationalize five million. It\u2019s a fairly easy number, maybe a tad higher than that even. We probably have to get through the first few weeks of July into August to probably see exactly what the, how the dynamics should have played but, that\u2019s our opinion on it for now.", "Steve Luczo", "", "Okay [Amesia], we are ready to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And the first question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Please proceed.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Thank you good afternoon, a few questions first the relative to history when one of the stereotypes people use were really formed. How quickly do you think that Seagate and the industry responded to those changes in demand may clearly if you exceeding it four weeks inventory, you responded to the difference in demand relative to the guidance you have provided so and any comments there will be helpful?", "Steve Luczo", "I think that\u2019s a good point Rich, just as look at the 3.5 inch inventory in the channel for example going out. We talk about this in our supplement a bit. The industries still not bad shape historically, its just over four week. So the industry has responded just didn\u2019t respond quickly enough at the start of the quarter in particular in some capacity points, the high capacity points that I made reference to earlier but I do think that over the course of the quarter there was definitely control in place. ", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "", "Rich this is Pat, I would say historically the historical perspective, it may have taken up to two quarters before so as much as we may have liked to have seen a quicker response, it is getting tighter and so as they\u2019ve said we saw signs of the inventory coming in back in line by the end of the quarter.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay and in terms of the question we always get us on trough earnings potential, if you look at your current and projected platforms, the cost basis on those are more normal gross margin range. What do you think both for Seagate and the industry the trough earnings really are? I mean do you think the industry has moved beyond where the trough is negative?", "Steve Luczo", "Yes. I mean I think what we are talking about where we are going obviously the key is you know Rich in this industry it is product transitions and you know product positioning with true technology is held one competitor outweighs the other and as the supply demand stays and balances the second. And I think as to your first question as the industry saw, was getting ahead it pulled back, so I think to Steve\u2019s point a quick yes is sufficient because I think the industry is trying to manage to a tighter range in the profit pool.", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "I think Rich the difficult thing the rest of this year and really in the fiscal year 11 is against what macro economic environment and I think fiscal year 11 for the drive industry on the whole is, it\u2019s a challenging year because most of us are in-product transitions which means the products we are shipping are going probably stay in production for the mass amount through the fiscal year and what we are doing is developing next generation technology under that. ", "You don\u2019t see that in terms of the benefit of a ramp really till the end of fiscal year 11 and then probably really in to fiscal year 12. That\u2019s a tough enough environment to manage yourself in, from a cost perspective in a growing environment and with the industry participants matching supply and demand. When the macro scenario is more volatile then you have to have the ability to either change your mix or change your bills pretty quickly, and I would say that this quarter showed that some of the industry participants have those controls in place and able to respond quickly change mix, reduce build and maybe not the entire industry is there but this is a lot better than it has been historically yes and we believe that it gets a lot better, you know over the next year or two as well as, as companies continue obviously to streamline their operations, it doesn\u2019t help anyone to over billed on a sustained basis because as we all know you can\u2019t sustain market share gains by over-building and pricing, its all about new products.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay. Then just a last one on the buyback, is there anything left on the buyback that you have out there for the Anti-Dilution and any thoughts on, you should still be generating a significant amount of cash flow in fiscal 11 and any comments there?", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "Yes, rich in January [due] formally with the board approves for the management to execute an Anti-Dilution plan given what the shares outstanding and the outstanding options. We still have ability to continue buyback shares if we deem that appropriate and we probably would have at a run rate what we just accomplished in the last quarter we probably had a couple more quarters of that if all things were in line, i.e. the stock prices and a few other variables, but we do have more ability to buy back shares under that board authority. ", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with Nobel Financial. Please proceed.", "Mark Miller - Nobel Financial", "Just wondering as you noted the OEM pricings is going to cast and stone I assume there is no ability that putting in much will exist throughout the whole quarter. My question is more about, do you anticipate the channel pricing to be more aggressive this quarter or than it was last quarter was it the channel pricing non-linear was more of the pricing erosion seen at the very end of the quarter?", "Steve Luczo", "I definitely think things stabilized, it wasn\u2019t just the back end of the quarter, it was also the very front of the quarter because of the dynamics I mentioned earlier but, I definitely think things will stabilize into this, calendar Q3 and beyond. Just simply because they\u2019ve already come down to levels, if you look at the various capacity points and as Steve said, you know what products are playing there, there\u2019s not any major industry transitions coming for the next couple of quarters foreseeably, so I just don\u2019t see the cost coming out, so I think those pricing points will stabilize.", "Mark Miller - Nobel Financial", "And the OEM pricing will probably be as you just said it in the auctions a few weeks ago was that correct or there is very little latitude that\u2019s going to change, is that correct? ", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, that\u2019s correct.", "Bob Whitmore", "Yes and then of course they will reflect above the aggressive pricing that occurred in the June quarter mark.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman, The Bank of Montreal. Please proceed. ", "Keith Bachman - The Bank of Montreal", "I was hoping if you could talk about your expectations on the enterprise side of your business for not only September quarter but December quarter. What\u2019s the feedback from the demand side and then more specifically, what are you thinking about potential share shifts in this part of your business and I have a follow-up please.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, I think in terms of share shifts again, last quarter I think it was or the quarter before you know we hit a very high market share which was as we indicated pretty reflective of lack of execution and one of the big enterprise players and we expect to hold that. However, we do believe that the 62% of share that we\u2019re operating in is probably the right share for Seagate and we probably expect to hold that share and potentially do a little better if there\u2019s execution issues which tends to be in the enterprise because it\u2019s a difficult portfolio.", "I think in terms of demand, maybe just a little bit cautious still in terms of the cross currents that I indicated before against I would say it\u2019s the one area where there seems to be recurring theme of strength whether or not it\u2019s out of Intel or whether or not it\u2019s out of IBM, or we\u2019ll see what we hear from some of the other systems level companies. But maybe we\u2019re a little more cautiously optimistic about enterprise in the September quarter. And then, clearly through the end of the year and through calendar 2011, we would expect that to be impacted by the refresh, the corporate technology refresh, and that\u2019s going to be probably more a function of just what\u2019s the macro scenario if you\u2019ll like. ", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "", "Most of the comments that we said about consumers don\u2019t really hold in the enterprise it\u2019s been fairly, I\u2019ll call it seasonal off the levels that we\u2019re at right now, but seasonally up to just slightly, and that goes for the mission critical and business critical products that we\u2019re talking about so. ", "Keith Bachman - The Bank of Montreal", "", "And I would assume given your share and what not that prices have been fairly stable in the enterprise?", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "Yes, I think there\u2019s been some aggressiveness there as well. A big picture I think Seagate has a really strong broad portfolio and our OEM customers understand that so, we can manage it.", "Operator", "", "And the next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask a couple of clarifications and then a question. Did you guys provide EPS guidance? I\u2019m not sure if I missed it.", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "", "No, we gave enough of the assumptions I think you can come up with a good range Sherri.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "And then on the growth margin, I just want to clarify; you said you\u2019d be at the low end of your 22% to 26% range?", "", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "That\u2019s how we are planning our business for this quarter to be conservative. We certainly as Steve said, we hopefully we had a conservative forecast based on everything that we see, but we just want to manage a business on that level of optics right now given the level of uncertainty that as Steve called cross currents that we are getting.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, I mean I think it\u2019s definitely prudent to be conservative right now, but I guess if I think about the gross margins when you go from the June to the September quarter, we\u2019ve never seen a 500 basis points decline in gross margin. Typically the margins are up, pricing was a bit worse, there\u2019s a lot of movement in pricing in June, so I\u2019m trying to get a better understanding of why that might be down so much.", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "Generally, the pricing in the September quarter over the last couple of years has been fairly benign, and I would say that given the June dynamics, we are certainly the channel where we\u2019d be somewhat insulated because we have over 70% of business OEM, that sort of crossed the whole portfolio, so I would say that September is not, I would not call it a traditional pricing quarter for a September quarter.", "Steve Luczo", "I would say that a typical September quarter, not to overly beat a dead horse, but a typical September quarter doesn\u2019t have as many of the cross currents that we are currently facing right now. I mean we\u2019ve definitely transitioned I think from an environment that three to five months ago most CEOs of technology companies were planning for the upside and reacting to the downside and I would say that most of them are probably shifted more to a plan for the downside and be able to react to the upside.", "Seagate certainly has the operational flexibility to address that TAM that is at the high end of the range or frankly even higher than the high end of our range pretty quickly, and if that\u2019s how it turns out, great. On the other hand, there was certainly enough going on in the June quarter and pricing that occurred at OEMs and in the channel that make us believe that, that\u2019s a more prudent way to address the quarter from an investor perspective is to say that we are going to be at the low end of the range, and if things turn out better than that, then that\u2019s great.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Then in terms of the CapEx, you mentioned in the supplemental information that there is some stuff that was deferred, you will pay the cash in the September quarter I wanted to get a sense of how much cash will there be that you are spending on CapEx in the September quarter? So, roughly how much will CapEx be in September and then also because of the lower demand environment we saw in June, did you adjust your CapEx plans down for the calendar year?", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "One, on the latter we have continually adjusted our CapEx, what we see, what production line, so, Bob would comment but we, currently we have a fairly dynamic capital planning process, even with long lead times we try to manage at. We have a cash based receipt method. So, I\u2019d say what rolls over, we might have some that we buy, and September rolls over and we will manage the CapEx about 6% to 8% of our revenue. We think that\u2019s a long-term model to stay in technology production at a healthy level to support the business. ", "So, as opposed to the number, we will just manage it within that range. ", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, but to answer your question our capital budgets have come down significantly, whether or not they are significantly relative to the models the street has, I don\u2019t know, because ours are obviously very dynamic and again when we were entering the quarter, there was a possibility as you may remember that we actually felt we would be at or above a 165 million units for the June quarter and then accelerating through back half of the year that was driving an expectation of a lot of capital. I think the dynamics have changed and up to the point now where we have definitely addressed our capital and reduced our budget significantly.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "Obviously I think everybody as you know touched on the pricing dynamics and on the context of gross margin but what I would like to understand is the second point on their gross margin impact going into the quarter and obviously it sounds like more fixed cost coverage from a production standpoint eclipsing what was slower production in June. So can you help us bridge the gap between let\u2019s say 27.4% down to let\u2019s call it 23%, how much of that is associated with that fixed cost coverage dynamic?", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "", "Roughly 50-50 with the pricing mix and the fixed cost dynamic would be other 50-50. As Steve said is, if we have upside we certainly have to go manage that but given that we see a long-term growth in the industry. We could certainly shed fixed cost but that wouldn\u2019t be the wise thing to do in the short term. So, we will manage the business conservatively until we see line of sight where maybe upsides or if there are, we will manage that through the quarter and try keep inventory tight which will drive to a higher production cost through the beginning part of the quarter. That\u2019s our assumption in the model.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And additionally, I thought one comment that you had made was that, one competitor and I think we all know who that might be, continues to add production capacity, you actually said through the quarter. Are you guys saying that hasn\u2019t necessarily changed despite the challenges that the industry had seen or did that start to show some improvement, let\u2019s say late May into June? And then I have one final question.", "", "Dave Mosley", "I think we talked about adding and continue to build not adding capacity. ", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, whether or not they added capacity or not, I don\u2019t know. But I mean, from our perspective in the down term of 8%, it doesn\u2019t really make sense to be up and build by 10% plus depending on how you account for the last 500 million drives that got shift. And I think that that behavior, it seemed like it took a long time for that competitor to adjust to production and whether or not that was a control issue or a goal to take market share for revenue growth or some other dynamic, we don\u2019t understand. And how they are going adjust next quarter, obviously we don\u2019t know, that\u2019s why we are competitors. But, its just hard to say right now, Dave I mean\u2026", "Dave Mosley", "", "Its all right, I think you said it.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, fair enough. Final question for me is more of a longer term side. Aerial density and I think you guys talk about lack of kind of meaningful platform transitions through the next couple of quarters. Can you remind us Seagate\u2019s thoughts as it pertains to aerial density growth slowing and how that relates to underlying fundamental dynamics in the hard drive industry?", "Steve Luczo", "", "I\u2019ll let Bob handle that.", "Bob Whitmore", "Aaron, I don\u2019t know if you remember a couple of quarters ago I gave an update of where we thought we were aerial density-wise and at that time I said that we continue to invest to stay on what I\u2019ll call industry trajectories of aerial density, what we expect the compounded annual growth rate to be. And I said that we are happy with the way things were going that the results were in line with those trajectories and I\u2019d say six months later we feel the same way. We continue to see our internal components demonstrated at a rate that will keep us on track with what I\u2019ll call again traditional trajectory, so we don\u2019t see that obvious fundamental shift in the way we have to do business as it relates to aerial density.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. Please proceed.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Yes, thank you. There has been some talk in the distributor channel of HDD prices coming up in the September quarter and that\u2019s obviously not in your guidance, is it even possible that we would see more price stability in September? I guess it\u2019s somewhat surprising that 5 million drives would cause that sort of a decline in June. ", "Dave Mosley", "", "I know what I think you are referring to about channel pricing behaviors that are stabilizing. What I\u2019d say at this point right now is just stability, which is good. The clients were so dramatic at the start of last quarter that I think the exit points that we have being stabilized and in some cases raised like you are seeing, is evident for the fact that our model is probably stable from here. That\u2019s exactly what the biggest driver last quarter, and I think some to watch this quarter if you can. ", "", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "And Jason, we are not saying that 5 million caused this impact. As Dave said, it started early in the quarter and continued through. So the pricing environment just didn\u2019t end on those 5 million drives.", "Dave Mosley", "", "I think Jason you have to look at it from a little bit different perspective. Early when in the quarter, April, May timeframe, when consumer is so soft and people are just trying to get the early part of the quarter moving. They know that June is going to be big too so its really hard to see what the ending trajectory is, right. That\u2019s setting those knobs properly as I think some of the, and versus the inventory that people had in the chains, that\u2019s the thing we are questioning right. Now we ended as an industry with okay inventory levels but obviously the price is set where it is. Now as we see, as we enter the next quarter, seeing people stabilizing those pricing and in some cases saying, this isn\u2019t good economics for me, I am going to raise the prices, I mean that makes sense to me. But I don\u2019t see that trend going on a lot. I guess that\u2019s it.", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "Yes, but I\u2019d also caution you not to just count the impact of 5 million units too much. I mean when the industry was 5 million units short consecutive for three or four quarters you saw price stability that we haven\u2019t seen in a decade. So, 5 million units of over production especially since most of its going into very limited customer base, it\u2019s a lot of units to be all of a sudden trying to move and you have to remember that those prices are very transparent not withstanding, this is just a special deal for you, and it impacts pricing across the board very quickly.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "", "Okay, I appreciate the color there and last question from me is Dave you mentioned new products and we heard Momentus XT was on allocation. It sounds like an interesting product. I assume a nice margin profile. What\u2019s demand like and are you seeing OEM qualifications?", "Dave Mosley", "Yes, I mean we are really excited about the product. We have indicated I think for about the last year that we believe that the hybrid drives whether or not, ultimately that\u2019s what we should be calling them, but drive where you basically utilize silicon technology in combination with HDD as probably by far in a way a better solution for the vast majority of client computing. I think in enterprise clearly there is a play for SSDs which Seagate feels very good about its roadmap right now. But in the mid-range of enterprise and clearly in the client, the hybrid drive has basically all the benefits of an SSD. In fact you might argue some that you can\u2019t do with an SSD because you can actually cash between the rotating media and the silicon, then of course with the costing capacity advantages of HDD. So, we do feel good about it. ", "It\u2019s a very interesting question about OEM\u2019s, there are classes of OEM customers who basically you can\u2019t even finish the presentation and they understand it, and they run hard. There are others who I think are stuck more on some of the cost benefits if you will. But we feel really good about the product and I think as I have said on occasion looking out five years I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if 80% of our portfolio is hybrid.", "Operator", "And the final question comes from the line of Kathy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.", "Kathy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "What does linearity looks like in Europe? Did you actually see some stabilization in June and early July or is it still continuing to decelerate?", "Dave Mosley", "It stabilized to the lower numbers what we kind of amended through the quarter Kathy and I would remind not holding the fence its still not great going into the following quarter now. We know a lot about vacations and consumers and affecting consumer behaviors in Europe through the month of July but I am still very, very cautious on what the true demand is. ", "You know there is indications and we are watching, Steve made comments about this in his script there that calendar Q4 may actually tick up in Europe but I think we\u2019re going to have to get solidly into August probably before we know what the consumer spending patterns are in Europe and whether they have started to recover.", "Kathy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "And to that point, we\u2019re coming off low base just given consumer weakness in calendar 2Q and 3Q and then for drives in particular as it relates to the inventory adjustments and as we look into the calendar fourth quarter you have Europe coming back seasonally. ", "We talked about commercial enterprise being a recurring theme of strength. Is there a potential set-up where fourth quarter unit seasonality could be even better than we have seen in past years? I know there is a lot about stuff going on and you don\u2019t want to make a heroic call but is there a potential set-up for calendar fourth quarter strength here?", "Steve Luczo", "", "I think maybe Kathy and I think that the only one piece of (inaudible) control out there and so is supposed to wishful thinking is the strength of Intel numbers. And obviously Intel has a 13 week lead cycle or more and they\u2019re certainly seeing a different scenario than we feel because we\u2019re at the closer end of the integration chain and they just do that, that\u2019s indicative of a possibility of strong demand and people obviously aren\u2019t going to walk away from Intel because if they close down a fab, that\u2019s something that shuts off supply for six months like what happened a year ago. And so, yes there\u2019s a possibility of that and again, its just back to how did the industry manage itself in terms of inventory in the channel and supply and demand and overall production capability. ", "But we certainly wish that we could get better visibility earlier in the September quarter but the nature of the September quarter is you don\u2019t get great visibility probably till mid to late August but I think that at least there is a shot of that for sure. ", "Kathy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "And then, as it relates, just last question on gross margin, same sort of play on the fourth quarter, the industry is going to hopefully take care of the extra five million units. If you end up seeing a mix shift back to enterprise and prices stabilize at these new lower levels, could we actually see gross margins kick up nicely sequentially in December?", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, I think so. ", "", "Kathy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Okay thank you.", "Steve Luczo", " ", "Right, I\u2019d like to thank to everyone for joining us on the call today.

My name is Stacey and I\u2019ll be your coordinator for today.", "At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. This conference call contains forward-looking statements including, but not limited to statements related to the company\u2019s future operating and financial performance in the December 2010 quarter and thereafter, and includes statements regarding customer demand for disk drives and general market conditions.", "These forward-looking statements are based on information available to Seagate as of the date of this conference call, but are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements.", "Information concerning additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K and Form 10-K/A as filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on August 20, 2010 and October 6, 2010 respectively.", "These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the company\u2019s views as of any subsequent date and Seagate undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made", "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host to Mr. Steve Luczo, CEO. Please go ahead.", "Steve Luczo", "Thank you, Stacey. Good afternoon everyone and thanks you for joining on the call today, sorry about the delay. On the call with me from Seagate are Ken Massaroni, our General Counsel, Pat O\u2019Malley, our Chief Financial Officer; Bob Whitmore, our Chief Technology Officer and Head of R&D and Manufacturing Operations and Dave Mosley, Executive Vice President of Sales, Marketing and Product Line Management.", "Also on the call today are Larry Sonsini of Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati and Joe Perella of Perella Weinberg Partners. Today, we are continuing with the new format that we began last quarter and we have posted detailed supplemental information about the quarter on our Investor Relations website.", "Due to the announcement we made on October 14th, 2010 concerning the preliminary indication of interest regarding a going private transaction, there are some additional requirements with respect to today\u2019s call. First, the company will not at this time be providing any additional information regarding the aforementioned announcement.", "Second, in order to comply with regulatory requirements, the company will not provide, discuss or answer questions regarding the outlook for the December quarter or any future fiscal periods. And, finally, the company will not be participating in individual meetings with investors or analysts either in-person or via conference call until further notice, again due to the regulatory requirements.", "Seagate entered the September quarter with the following key assumptions for planning purposes. First, that we would not see any additional slowdown in consumer spending on technology generally. Second, that we would hold the market share levels of approximately 30% with which we entered the quarter. Third, that we would not see attempts by competitors to ship share through aggressive pricing. Fourth, that inventory on hand would remain flat quarter-over-quarter. And, finally, that the corporate technology refresh that we had been experiencing going into quarter would continue.", "We did experience some additional weakness in the consumer markets particularly in the United States and in Europe early in the quarter. Primarily as a result of this weakness, the total available market for the quarter was approximately 165 million units, which was the low end of our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. We did however see some early signs that consumer activity is beginning to improve in early September. Additionally, industry market share remains substantially unchanged. However, pricing remained aggressive across all of our product lines, customers, and geographies.", "As noted in the Western Digital conference call yesterday, the week 13 industry shipments in the September quarter were significantly higher than the prior 12-week average. While we believe this to be an accurate description overall, Seagate was under represented during week 13 and week 12 as compared to a level of the first 11 weeks of the quarter. Dave Mosley can provide more details during the Q&A session if required.", "Turning to our September quarter results, we reported first fiscal quarter revenue of $2.7 billion in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.37 on shipments of 49.2 million units. Gross margin of 20.4% was below our target range due to the aforementioned market dynamics, which impacted our ability to deliver earnings within the target range we provided at the beginning of the quarter.", "Our balance sheet remains strong. Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash totaled $2.2 billion. Long-term debt include current portion was reduced by $328 million to $2.2 billion at the end of the quarter with the redemption of the Maxtor convertible notes.", "Stacey, we\u2019re ready to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed.", "Keith Bachman \u2013 Bank of Montreal", "Hi, good afternoon, gentlemen. I wanted to try to get two questions if I could. Could you just give your views on how much incremental inventory? You guys, I\u2019m sure listened to WD last night. What\u2019s the channel look like? What\u2019s the inventory status look like as you look out across the industry? And then, I had a follow-up, please.", "Dave Mosley", "Hi Keith, this is Dave. Inventory was below four weeks and channels as we usually model and we made reference to the assumptions going into the quarter of inventory, exit\u2019s being about that same level. So we feel pretty good about that.", "Keith Bachman \u2013 Bank of Montreal", "And what about at the OEMs?", "Dave Mosley", "Well, we don\u2019t have a whole lot of visibility into JIT hubs and the like. And we\u2019ve talked about that before. But we have no reason to believe that their inventory issues.", "Keith Bachman \u2013 Bank of Montreal", "Because I\u2019m sure you heard WD last night say there was probably an extra 5 million units that was sitting at the OEMs. It doesn\u2019t sound like you would agree with that line of reasoning.", "Dave Mosley", "I think what they talked about was a big shipment week in week 13 and as Steve \u2013 Bob talked about in the comments, we were under represented in that.", "Keith Bachman \u2013 Bank of Montreal", "Okay.", "Dave Mosley", "And so even actually into the week 12. I think there\u2019s a few different dynamics which is going on that we see. One is golden week in China, if that\u2019s somewhat. There is also some shipments that are done within say some of our competitors too there mother ships if you will to with some of their internal customers. So we\u2019re still trying to triangulate that.", "But what we definitely feel is that as far as notebook in particular where we saw one of the big shipment weeks there in week 13, we were dramatically underrepresented versus what we had seen in the prior 11, 12 weeks of the quarter, even if you go back to week 12. And then, we exited with our inventory under two weeks going into October something.", "Keith Bachman \u2013 Bank of Montreal", "Okay. Well, I wanted to sneak one in with Pat then. On the CapEx, Pat, it was a little higher than \u2013 that we were thinking for the September quarter. I know you said it would be up due to some slippage from the previous quarter. But is there any color you can give us about that? Or is there any comments you can make as it relates to your anticipated CapEx plans?", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "Yes, so let me address that. One, the number you see of the 358 is the cash. We sort of hinted at that last quarter that what you saw coming at our CapEx last quarter was the cash in that bubble rollover. So just was the number that we or just to give a clarity. Our actual receipts were only $195 million.", "Keith Bachman \u2013 Bank of Montreal", "Okay.", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "And that was done significant from plants, so we are decelerating. I won\u2019t go into the forward looking for the rest of the year. But just for the quarter, those receipts were $70 million less, so we \u2013 it is in a deceleration mode, so that was really the cash bubble that came through on the Q4.", "Keith Bachman \u2013 Bank of Montreal", "Okay, thanks Pat.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan", "Yes, thank you, and good afternoon. There is a couple of question if I could. I just want to get a sense in terms of where Seagate views the opportunities for cost takeouts or the need for further investment where there is an SSD or other adjacent markets. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense just given the recent announcement last week where the LBO or the PE folks would see the value proposition line?", "Bob Whitmore", "Yes, sorry we can\u2019t. As I\u2019ve mentioned in my preamble we can\u2019t reference anything with respect to any possible transaction with the private equity firm.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan", "I guess, and maybe another way to ask the question is, given the recent secular slide within hard disk drives over the last six months, we don\u2019t know how pricing when it does [inaudible] for a while unless demand picks up. It seems like this could have last a little longer just given what we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace and also with the competitive dynamics a lot more tenacious than years passed and certainly there is no a disk drive manufacturer who can\u2019t compete right now. Is there any sort of impetus on your part where you think that you need to accelerate investments into different markets, i.e. SSD and maybe with your Samsung announcement back in August?", "Bob Whitmore", "I think that we have indicated that we think there\u2019s plenty of area of potential for growth in the drive industry with respect to R&D investments and whether or not it\u2019s SSD or the announcement last quarter of our hybrid drive. Those would certainly be examples of that, yes.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. And then my other question revolves around the enterprise business right now. Just in terms of the recent changes with Microsoft Exchange 2010, it seems like fiber channel drives do not need to be the cornerstone if you will for serving Microsoft Exchange environments. We keep seeing more and more SAS and SATA drives underpinning NAS and SAN deployments. How should we think about the enterprise profit profile going forward for Seagate and for the industry? Is it something that could be undercut going forward?", "Bob Whitmore", "No, and again, we can\u2019t make any forward-looking statements about profit pools or as it might impact Seagate.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan", "Have you been seeing changes recently though in the mix?", "Bob Whitmore", "I think historically we\u2019ve \u2013 I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve talked about or if that we\u2019ll be prepared to talk about shifts amongst our customers in terms of interfaces. Dave, is there any kind of general color you want to add?", "Dave Mosley", "I will just answer it, over the last few quarters, no. Macro trends is what we can\u2019t talk about going forward.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.", "Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yes, thanks. I wonder if you could provide your thoughts around whether you think that industry can put on the brakes around some of the CapEx orders that were put in place back in the fourth quarter of last year and first quarter of this year. Do you think that some of that can be cancelled and/or pushed out enough that that the industry can manage through a better supply and demand environment over the near term or does that equipment have to ultimately be accepted?", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "Kathy, this is Pat. Fortunately or unfortunately we\u2019ve been through these cycles and we\u2019ve worked with our vendors. We certainly have strategic relationships with them. We try to give them long lead time but we do push out do cancel and manage that to get to the right size of the business. So the industry is capable, Seagate is certainly capable and I believe the industry and Seagate have put plans in place to handle it to get the demand and supply what we believe closer inline.", "Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, and then WD had somewhat of a negative bias as it relates to the week 13 activity into the OEMs. But if you take another view, if OEMs are willing to accept inventory, if they\u2019re doing more airfreighting heading into the fourth quarter, there may be a more positive read that they\u2019ve seen something on the demand front that\u2019s more encouraging going into the holiday period, not asking as it relates to CA but just the overall demand environment for IT.", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "Yes, I\u2019m not exactly sure what the question is, I think in general I would confer with the way that Western Digital characterized it is probably over edge in week 13. And that\u2019s my general read on it.", "Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, so more a function the OEMs taking advantage of pricing, not necessarily seeing a demand uptick?", "Steve Luczo", "Well I think it\u2019s a broad brush to say the OEMs. We\u2019ve got a tick and tie exactly where all the units and I think its maybe too broadly speaking to say it\u2019s the OEMs.", "Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital. Please proceed.", "Ben Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Yes, I have two questions. First of all, could you just talk a little bit more about pricing on the client side? How was it particularly towards the end of the quarter or why were you underrepresented in that surge of units, was it due to pricing at the OEM level being super aggressive or was there something you didn\u2019t like out there in marketplace with regard to pricing. If you could just talk a little bit more about that the price trend throughout and quarter and why you didn\u2019t participate at the end and then I follow-up proceed if you don\u2019t mind.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, let me characterize a little bit differently, I mean there may have been some deals that were done at the end of that contribute to week 13 that we didn\u2019t participate in. I\u2019d say it a little bit differently, we have line of sight of some of the OEMs that we service and those are the ones that we were tied off with pretty well. There were couple of other dynamics that happened. I think given some factory slowdowns in Golden Week in China. There were some natural next quarter activities that were actually pulled in because of that. Then there was actually some deals that happened and as I made referenced to this earlier before where people in some sense had to buy full model or they shipped to other places inside of their old corporation.", "So it\u2019s really hard for us to triangulate back through all those things and say which contribution means what part of it. But in general I would say that Seagate made an effort not to participate in some of those quarter end deals to \u2013 because we\u2019d seen competitive pricing all quarter long, we realized that we don\u2019t want to do that at the end of quarter, so.", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "Ben, this is Pat. The pricing as you know you heard yesterday and you obviously see there is financials today whereas aggressive the whole quarter. So not participating in pricing for a certain deal is probably not a fair characterization. We talked to begin in the quarter, we\u2019re going to hold share, we did hold share. I think there was much \u2013 not much movement in share but we got a fair look at our business and we made what we think is the proper decisions to maintain share and get the right coverage in each of our OEMs and district channel partners but it was aggressive through the quarter.", "Ben Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Through the quarter and not necessarily more so at the very end.", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "That\u2019s correct.", "Ben Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Then Steve, I just wanted to ask you philosophically I mean I got to ask about Apple, today they announced the $999 64 Gig MacBook Air and Steve Jobs made a comment that he thought all notebooks were going to move this way. And I think he was referencing without the disc drive. And I was just wondering, is he right, is he early, is he just and are you seeing any other on the main stream PC market anybody kind of adopting Apple\u2019s curve which seems obviously as usual they\u2019re early on and early adopters. But I was just wondering what your thought on that announcement and whether you thought that would change the adoption curve for the industry or its wishful. Thank you.", "Steve Luczo", "Well look, I mean obviously Steve sits in a position that only Steve sits in, in terms of the offering that they provide to their customers and its obviously pretty competing. I would say though that from what we know of the offering for example Apple, the percentage of their units that they sell with SSDs versus HDDs is a tiny fraction. I think it\u2019s under 3%, certainly under 5%. Obviously this isn\u2019t the first product that they\u2019ve had. I have and Air book with an SSD unit that I\u2019ve had for I guess a year and half now. And I think, there are certain things that are certainly very nice about it. And other things that are little bit frustrating and a little bit frustrating parts are the cost and the lack of capacity.", "I spend a lot of time cleaning out files so I can make room for not a lot of content to be honest with you. I think are there some users that can operate net environment and be happy, I think the answer is yes but I think as Seagate introduced hybrid drive last quarter, you get basically the features and function of SSD at more like disc drive cost and capacity. And in fact with the additional layer of cashing we believe that, downstream from a product perspective there will be performance advantages to SSD whether or not that has to do with instant on or application load or what a load looks like year or two after you, you have your product versus that day you buy it.", "I can tell you that my SSD drive takes about 25, 30 seconds to boot now versus the 12 seconds when I bought it. And that\u2019s just an issue more related to OS than it is specifically to the technology but again with the hybrid there is things that you can do it alleviate that so your boot times are actually as compelling one and two, three and four years down the road.", "So I think that\u2019s where mainstream notebook computing is going if that\u2019s what your question is no I don\u2019t, do I think that Apple will be successor with that product absolutely, because Apple is successful with all their products. And so it\u2019s a very compelling company and a compelling value proposition within their value chain. But again we just view it as more devices that are computing in eating data and if they\u2019re low capacity on the edge that means they need a lot of storage pipe and down close to the edge and whether not that\u2019s in a mash box or code in the cloud or in a local cloud. Those are all markets that we serve. So the more that people do creative things with computers and devices were all four and Steve certainly at the forefront of that.", "Ben Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham and Company. Please proceed.", "Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham and Company", "Thank you. Good afternoon. Thanks for the extra detail on the 13th week. But I did want to ask Pat one question, in terms of the I guess the ending of the early paid discounts with channel, did you have to come up with some other type of offset to be cost competitive, price competitive with your peers, you still offer those discounts? And did if effect gross margins at all in the quarter?", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "No the \u2013 well the fact that we had extra carrying days of DSO, you could marginally argue there is little cost but clearly what we saved in our order pay was a positive financial in we didn\u2019t have to add any extra programs to offset that. In face we were the only one at offered it before. So it was I\u2019d say a net positive to us other than what\u2019s manifested in the DSO.", "Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham and Company", "Okay and then obviously everyone keeps harping on the tell the angle and if we\u2019re going to go on talk about what segment of the drives universe really plays within the netbook space and the low-end notebook space. You\u2019re really talking about what, 250 gig and below, I mean do you \u2013 are you willing to provide a percent on how much of your business may go into notebooks. Do you have that kind of netbooks on say, do you have that kind of visibility and any comments on how we might be able to quantify the total TAM that\u2019s at that low end?", "Steve Luczo", "I guess just to make sure I understand the question Rich is that so going forward what capacities, what netbook capacities would be offered by the market? Is that what.", "Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham and Company", "My understanding is that the maximum netbook capacity for Microsoft is basically 250 gig, right? I don\u2019t know if there is even 160 shipping any more but 250. So you could argue that number of netbooks have at least 250 gigs so that you can add that in and then subset of new low-end notebooks. What do you consider a low-end notebook capacity points like for example.", "Bob Whitmore", "Yes, let me try it this way. So I think we obscure a little bit what we can net book and what we call low-end notebook to your point and what the capacity point is. I don\u2019t think there is a unique value proposition for somebody who has say for example 250 gigabyte in a consumer device, sometimes people will fill up that up fairly quickly and other used cases they won\u2019t.", "I do think that that what you\u2019re seeing in the tablet space is, is putting a lot of pressure on innovation, thinner, lighter, power savings, and to the point capacity as well to just value differentiate. I think there will be other also be lost cost sensitivities there.", "So if you can continue with the productivity device to provide a value proposition at a price point, I\u2019d pick up price band if you will that that we would call net books traditionally and people can innovate to still provide a compelling device there. It may have \u2013 it may have more capacity in it. And that\u2019s I think from an innovation perspective what the devices are really driving.", "Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham and Company", "Okay. And, just lastly, on your own hybrid drives, there is a lot of interest around them. But traditionally in order to really have a large market you need to have multiple sources. Do you expect anyone else to launch a hybrid drive? And then, secondly, would you expect to license out your code that makes it so I guess workable in a system?", "Bob Whitmore", "Yes, we would certainly expect that there will be competitors launching hybrid drives. I guess the question which is what\u2019s the nature of it? Is it \u2013 is it just the piece of silicon between the DRAM and the disk or is it more to that?", "And I think that lends to your second question, which is, we have a lot of IP in this area and a lot of know-how in a lot of investment that\u2019s occurred over several years and no we\u2019re not planning on licensing that.", "I\u2019ll tell you when we\u2019ve got \u2013 we believe that\u2019s why our drives have performed the way they are and what the opportunity is as we basically take advantages of some of our algorithms with some of the people that are developing OS or applications on them.", "Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham and Company", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi, thank you. It looks like you guys \u2013 your share was relatively flat this quarter. You commented that you thought your share was flat. Western Digital thought their share was down a little bit in the September quarter. Who do you think is gaining share in the market at least in the September quarter?", "Bob Whitmore", "I think all data points aren\u2019t yet in Sherri. So obviously we\u2019re watching the ones, the data that we have, and then the data that was announced yesterday. But I don\u2019t think we really know all the answers just now.", "Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay.", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "There was some major shifts that like it was in the Q4.", "Bob Whitmore", "That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.", "Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then, in terms of OEM pricing, which was determined in September for the December quarter, would you characterize it similar to Western Digital that it was competitive and OEMs were taking advantage of the fact that the market was a little bit softer?", "Bob Whitmore", "Yes, I think that would lead to a forward-looking statement in one form or another, so we\u2019re going to avoid that one.", "Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thank you.", "Bob Whitmore", "Yes, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Yes, thanks for taking the questions. A couple as well. First of all, you guys had commented that desktop, your inventory and the channel was less than four weeks, what do you think the overall inventory looks like for the industry as a whole?", "Bob Whitmore", "It is slightly higher than four weeks I think.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, slightly higher. And in the context of you being underrepresented in week 13 relative to Western Digital, when you look at that over the average of the prior shipments for the 12 weeks, how does that compare to what you\u2019ve typically seen in prior September quarters?", "Bob Whitmore", "Sorry, Aaron, I didn\u2019t say relative to Western Digital. I said relative to the rest of the industry. And we don\u2019t have very good visibility into exactly what they shipped in week 13.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, fair enough. But for you guys how would week 13 stack up to prior year\u2019s week 13 for the September quarter?", "Bob Whitmore", "Right. Let me just give you a quarter-over-quarter. In my opinion, the industry had some behaviors like this in week 13 of the June quarter. And so that was about 15% shipped in week 13 in that quarter.", "We believe about 18% of the 165 million unit TAM they\u2019re about shipped in week 13 of this last quarter, again some of it because of golden week preparation in factory, logistics that are going on in week one.", "Some of it\u2019s because everybody phased up and the first was a Friday and so everyone\u2019s end of quarter have effectively became the same day. I mean there\u2019s little dynamics like that, but still, that\u2019s why I \u2013 holding the central pieces, I just say, we are underrepresented.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, final two questions. What is your current capacity in terms of production on a quarterly basis? And then, if you can help me understand just real quickly the fully diluted share count decline relative to what your guidance was for the quarter?", "Bob Whitmore", "So, from a capacity point of view, I think like we talked about we a few quarters ago we\u2019re looking at a little bit higher output for these quarters. We\u2019ve dialed that so that we\u2019re pretty fully utilized at the production levels that we\u2019re at. So that\u2019s what our run rate is today.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. So you\u2019re effectively 95% plus utilization?", "Bob Whitmore", "Yes, in that range.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And then, the share count?", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "Share count is the average price of the stock of the quarter.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, fair enough, thank you.", "Bob Whitmore", "Yes. Okay, Stacey, why don\u2019t we take two more questions?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Hunt with Hapoalim Securities. Please proceed.", "Kevin Hunt \u2013 Hapoalim Securities", "Hi, thank you. I have a couple of questions actually. First, on just to kind of can you drill down more into the gross margin, do you agree with Western Digital comment that 5% like-for-like price declines were occurred in the quarter? And if that\u2019s true, it seems like you still have \u2013 you still sort of had a higher gross margin based on my math, so can you maybe break down what all the factors are contributing there?", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "Western Digital referenced 5% for the next quarter, not this \u2013 the quarter just happened, they just discussed in excess of 8% for this current quarter just ended. So our pricing was \u2013", "Bob Whitmore", "Just to be clear, WD referenced in excess of 8% for the September quarter. They talked about 5% for the December quarter.", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "Correct. So with that 8%, ours was in that range, it was very like I said throughout the quarter that was the primary miss of our earnings and revenue. Primary was the pricing and then we expected the midpoint of the TAM for our volumes, so you can from 165 to 175 we had a shortfall there in revenue and gross margin, but clearly the biggest impact was the pricing in those ranges of that WD recorded for the September quarter.", "Kevin Hunt \u2013 Hapoalim Securities", "And if you go back to \u2013 so I mean you indicated going into this quarter, you had expected a pretty aggressive pricing, so you are saying it was maybe incrementally above that, so you might have been looking say five or eight?", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "Yes, it was probably closer to six, closer to eight. But, yes, that was little less than six, right, that\u2019s correct.", "Kevin Hunt \u2013 Hapoalim Securities", "Okay. And then \u2013 thank you. And then the second question I had was I just wanted to kind of clarify and understand here on the comments about the 13 week here, [inaudible] you didn\u2019t think there was any inventory you kind of give out various explanations of why there might have been an higher shipments. But I just want to make it clear, you are saying that it\u2019s not because everyone just piled everything into inventory?", "Bob Whitmore", "I guess we \u2013 what I would say relative to everyone piling in an inventory, I mean we don\u2019t have visibility in the OEM inventories at all. So we \u2013 all we know of what Seagate inventory and Seagate sell through is that makes sense? Inventory was under four weeks and where we can see our inventory.", "And with respect to our participation in weeks 12 and 13, we were under represented versus the average for the first 11 weeks. We can only talk to Seagate. There was an industry and there is an industry dynamics that show that week 13 was substantially higher than the average for the 12 weeks and was higher than it typically is.", "Kevin Hunt \u2013 Hapoalim Securities", "Okay. But it sounds like you \u2013 sounds like \u2013 I mean Western Digital clearly made the conclusion that that was all into inventory. But it sounds like your conclusion is not that. Am I getting this right or \u2013?", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "It was clearly going into the sell-ins inventory. That last week I mean probably \u2013", "Bob Whitmore", "I think we are making a different point. It\u2019s our product.", "Kevin Hunt \u2013 Hapoalim Securities", "Okay. But you are saying that there is potentially a lot of inventory at OEMs. You know you don\u2019t have visibility to that.", "Bob Whitmore", "The inventory went somewhere.", "Kevin Hunt \u2013 Hapoalim Securities", "Okay. And then, I will try this one, the last one, you said you won\u2019t comment on the LBO talk, but can you \u2013 I mean there was talks two , three months ago that you had an LBO offer. Can you maybe help us understand what legally is your client have this whole production you\u2019re going through now versus two or three months ago?", "Bob Whitmore", "I don\u2019t think the company ever said anything two or three months ago about any sort of transaction. I think there may have been some rumor published in a publication which obviously the company never commented on. But the company has only made one statement with respect to indication of interest and that was the one that we made on October 14, 2010. Larry, do you want to answer the question as to the regulations around disclosure?", "Larry Sonsini", "I think it\u2019s best that we have no further comment on that subject.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Jason Nolan \u2013 Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.", "Jason Nolan \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay, thank you. Just two quick questions, Steve or Pat did you cut back on production in the September quarter?", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "We aligned our production to head our customer demand. So obviously we were aiming for the midpoint of the TAM. We certainly missed on that element, so we aligned our supply. You could see our returns got better. So I think we managed our inventory pretty well.", "Jason Nolan \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay, it makes sense. And then the last question from me is Steve you had mentioned competitive actions in the June quarter, I heard the market and I guess my question is, is the price aggression a function of competitors trying to take share or is it just a normal reaction to the supply demand imbalance?", "Steve Luczo", "I think it was a combination, I really do believe it was combination was I think the industry lining up for TAMs in the June and the September quarter that didn\u2019t materialized. And then certain competitors being late to adjust production and therefore the movement of the product was facilitated by price. I think the industry is doing its best to adjust that as quickly as possible.", "Jason Nolan \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "That makes sense. Thank you.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, thanks. All right, everybody I\u2019d like to thank you all for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter and the before I depart, I want to make sure that I complement the employees of Seagate as always as well as our suppliers, our customers.

", "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Steve Luczo, CEO. Please go ahead.", "Steve Luczo", "Thank you, Melanie. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Pat O\u2019Malley, our Chief Financial Officer; Bob Whitmore, our Chief Technology Officer and Head of Research & Development and Manufacturing Operations; and Dave Mosley, Executive Vice President of Sales, Marketing and Product Line Management. As we've done for the past two quarters, detailed supplemental information about the quarter has been posted on our Investor Relations website. In addition, we recently completed a number of studies that represent Seagate's point of view on tablets and mobility, SSDs and flash, cloud computing and the demand for storage over the next decade. In total, there are eight documents that provide an excellent basis for important emerging storage trends. You can find these documents now on Seagate's Investor Relations website on seagate.com. I will review the results for the December quarter, address a few of the questions that we know many of you have, and then we'll open up the call to question and answer. ", "As you may recall, we've reported our second quarter business outlook in November, as opposed to providing it with our first quarter results in October. In our outlook for the December quarter, we noted the following: Demand for hard disk drives had improved from the summer early fall; expectations for the total available market was approximately 170 million units; and supply and demand appear to be well balanced with the company's inventory across all channels at or below targeted levels. As a result, we forecasted at least $2.7 billion in revenue and gross margins as a percent of revenue of at least 19.5%. ", "While the total available market for the quarter was in line with expectations at approximately 168 million units, disk drive shipments had a greater than seasonal slowdown in the last two weeks of the quarter. In particular, Seagate experienced a slowing of demand in the Asia-Pacific distribution channel during the last two weeks of the quarter and elected to reduce shipments and maintain our pricing discipline. Seagate met its revenue and gross margin target of $2.7 billion and 19.5%, respectively, due primarily to a greater than expected increase in the average storage capacity per drive shipped in all markets. The December quarter results also included the impact of additional customer support costs associated with our long-term supply agreements. The negative impact to gross margin percentage was approximately 170 basis points, and we are confident that the impact is fully reflected and contained within the December quarter results. For the December quarter, we also reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.33, even with a higher than anticipated provision for income tax. ", "With respect to our capital structure, the focus of the board and management continues to be on regularly evaluating ways to optimize the balance sheet in light of current and future capital market conditions and the current and future operating environment. Importantly, Seagate continues to focus on maximizing shareholder returns, while maintaining the flexibility for continued investment in a broad range of storage technologies as required by our existing and evolving customers. ", "Pursuant to this plan, the board in November authorized the company to repurchase an additional $2 billion of ordinary shares. In December, we used $305 million to purchase 21 million shares. Also during the quarter, we issued $750 million of senior unsecured notes. The board and management are continuing to evaluate alternatives beyond the stock buyback, including, for example, distribution of a quarterly dividend to increase shareholder value from our company's consistent and significant cash flow. This reflects our long-term confidence in the demand for disk drives in the Internet-based computing environment that is positively impacting both commercial and consumer storage demand. As an example, in the December 2010 quarter, Seagate experienced a 31% increase per drive average capacity shipped year-over-year. We believe this is further evidence of the need for the company's affordable mass storage products for the expanding user base that utilizes media and data-rich content. ", "Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash totaled $2.9 billion, and long-term debt including current portion also stood at $2.9 billion, with most maturity dates evenly distributed approximately every two years from 2014 to 2020. ", "As we look forward to the next quarter and into calendar year 2010, we continue to strive to provide guidance that accounts for the global macroeconomic environment and the changing competitive dynamics in our industry. With that perspective, we expect the following conditions to shape the March quarter: The industry has marginal excess capacity; the industry has limited volume of new products; continued muted consumer demand for PCs; strengthening commercial demand for PCs against the backdrop of the typical seasonal patterns of a March quarter and strengthening enterprise demand. ", "For the March quarter, we are planning for the industry TAM to be between 155 million and 165 million units. We expect revenue of $2.55 billion to $2.7 billion and gross margin of 18% to 19%. The outlook for the quarter is influenced by less visibility and demand post-Chinese New Year. In addition, gross margins remain under pressure as cost of many upstream materials have not declined at rates equal to the price erosion experienced in calendar 2010 and expected in calendar 2011. ", "On a longer-term basis, we believe that the commercial and enterprise markets will be strong throughout calendar 2011, especially as the commercial refresh continues in large enterprises. In addition, we believe that the demand for consumer and commercial mass storage will continue to accelerate as required by the introduction of many more devices creating and consuming real-time data and rich content. ", "Finally, we are encouraged with our new product offerings in every market we serve. And we expect those new products will contribute to margin expansion in the second half of calendar 2011. ", "Before we open up the call for questions, we will address the questions I referenced earlier. The first is, when does the company return to its targeted gross margin range? There are three primary factors that will influence when we return to our targeted margin range: the timing of Seagate's transition to new products; the timing of component cost declines approximate to HDD price declines; and overall industry supply demand alignment. ", "Since we have most direct control over our new product introductions and they are most likely to result in gross margin expansion, I will address the calendar year 2011 new product transitions for Seagate first. We are starting the qualification process with our customers for three new enterprise hard drives, including industry-leading products for both mission-critical and business-critical applications, as well as our second-generation SSD products. In addition to the adoption of our solid-state hybrid drives, we have a series of new client storage products coming to market this year in both the 2.5- and 3.5-inch form factors. ", "And finally, we have just released the new line of GoFlex products designed for the Mac community and announced a Certified GoFlex Storage System, which provides a standard that allows device manufacturers to build a wide variety of consumer products such as media players, set-top boxes, computers and televisions, with a slot to support removable GoFlex external hard drives. ", "We expect contributions from our new product transitions in the second half of calendar 2011. But with respect to the cost of supplied materials, we believe that the biggest opportunity for cost reduction occurs at the time of our product transition. Although based on yesterday's WD call, we clearly have work to do with respect to our supply base and calls to our suppliers as you might imagine began this morning. ", "With respect to supply management against demand, we will note that in addition to consistently stating the need for industry to focus on this alignment, Seagate again demonstrated its focus on this alignment by having slightly lower shipments against a TAM that slightly increased. ", "The second question is what is your view on tablets and how they may be impacting, negatively or positively, the HDD industry? Long term, we believe tablets and other mobile devices like Smart phones are and have been net positives for the hard drive industry. During the last 30 years, whenever new devices are introduced that consume or create a great deal of rich data like video, it has been a positive for the storage industry. In this case, Smart phones and tablets need to stream data, and a significant portion of that data will be consumer-generated content, mostly video. Therefore, as these new devices consume significant amount of data and content, users will expect the same experience that they've grown accustomed to with other consumption devices. ", "It seems clear that in order to deliver that overall experience, the most affordable and proven solution is the utilization of disk drives as a caching device throughout the network. Whether the storage is in a NAS box in your home, in the cloud, or in a local cloud, Seagate provides products for all those markets. ", "The final question is how aggressive will the company be buying stock back, given the outlook for the March quarter? The board authorized a share repurchase plan based on its confidence in the company's long-term prospects. Based on our current view of the March quarter, you can expect that at the current price range, the company will be actively repurchasing shares. ", "Melanie, we're now ready to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG", "I wanted to get a sense of what you felt like the operating expenses would do in some of the other lines. And if you'd be willing to give an EPS number? I'm coming out somewhere around, I don't know, $0.22 as a midpoint, but I wanted to make sure I was in the right ballpark.", "Steve Luczo", "I'll let Pat respond on that.", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "Sherri, our model has been \u2013 I think Steve gave all the elements to it. I wouldn't expect a major change in your operating expense. Though, given the taxes, I won't discount your model \u2013 on the margin may be slightly different but I think you're using the right data elements.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG", "And then Steve, I was hoping you could give us an outlook for the full year. I think Western Digital commented last night that they thought the industry units would be a little below $700 million, which doesn't seem like very strong growth. It's, I don't know, 6% or 7%. Do you guys have similar views on growth this year or do you think it will be closer to something like 10%?", "Steve Luczo", "I think it's too early to say, really. I mean, I think there's a lot of variability around calendar 2011 that runs probably in a few different vectors. One clearly is when and if and how strong the consumer demand picks up, and I think that's just a function of overall economic environment. I think the refresh cycle that's occurring in the enterprise has the potential for remaining at the pace today or potentially accelerating. You know, we're seeing strength in the enterprise market, and we have, and it seems to be building. So I just think depending on how those things play out through the summer, it's just hard to make a call here in January what 2011 looks like, given the dynamics at the macro level that are still present in the world. I think the way I think about it is visibility has probably gotten better, but most of the OEMs are still \u2013 they're pretty nervous and if they see any sort of slowdown, they pretty much cut back on the supply chain quickly. So I think until we get a lot more confidence that there's a sustained recovery, it's really hard to make a 2011 projection. And right now, we would probably look more towards the Gartners of the world and see what they're saying and probably play our planning off of that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rick Kugele of Needham & Company.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC", "First, when it comes to hybrid drives in particular, what do you see is the market opportunity now that you've had a product out there for a bit? And what percentage of your mix do you think ultimately is appropriate for hybrids just in general?", "Steve Luczo", "Well, I think clearly, the experience that we've had with the devices to date has been very favorable, ahead of expectations, the interest by a wide breadth of OEMs is fairly substantial, and that goes in a wide variety of devices, whether or not it's notebook or desktop or even tablet or even external. So I think the issue around delivering performance that has kind of SSD performance but just drive cost and capacity is a pretty compelling proposition. And I think the second generations of products that we'll be launching in the future will probably close that gap substantially and maybe even have it be at parity. What's interesting about hybrids is you can actually get performance that exceeds SSD with cooperation on the OS level or system level with some of the hardware or systems companies, and that's starting to develop as well. So I think longer-term, Rich, you're going to see that in five years or seven years or something like that, probably more than 80% of our products are going to be some form of hybrid drive. And that, by the way, isn't just driven by a need for the user experience but there's a lot of advantages from an aerial density perspective that have us pursuing that technology as well.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC", "And then in that vein, you've highlighted a lot of detail on your new product introductions for later this year. Can you give a sense on what you think maybe the merchant supply market is able to deliver relative to your technologies? And any thoughts on the timing of the rest of the space? And whether or not that's going to lead to a greater period of margin expansion for you for a period of time?", "Steve Luczo", "Merchant, meaning the competitors?", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Yes, I guess there's just one, right?", "Steve Luczo", "Well, I think the trick on hybrid, which once you start using these systems and integrating them, it's not as simple as obviously as just putting a piece of silicon between the DRAM and the HDD. There's a lot of work that has to do with how you manage what happens with the flash and how data's handled between the various levels of caching in the drive. And frankly, you've been in the system as we get into this with some people that control OSs or at more of the system level. So we've been at this for a few years. So while I would expect our competition will likely introduce some sort of product to take advantage of the performance attributes of hybrid, we feel pretty good about our technical lead right now. So I don't know that we see a big competitive threat on the horizon. On the other hand, I'll tell you that we're approaching this market in a way that makes it attractive for our customers to utilize the technology, because as I said, there's lots of advantages from an aerial density perspective as well. So point being that there's not markup on top of markup in terms of the cost associated with these drives. It's basically an opportunity for us to just increase the user experience as opposed to expanding overall margin.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC", "Can you elaborate a little bit around the long-term supply arrangement hit to gross margins, which looks one-time in nature? I don't know how The Street's going to deal with it, but any color that you could provide?", "Steve Luczo", "I'll let Dave \u2013 you want to go into that little bit more detail?", "William Mosley", "Sorry, Richard, talking about the. . .", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC", "The additional customer support costs that dinged gross margins.", "William Mosley", "Yes, I'd say the vast majority of these additional support costs relate to certain customers with whom we have long-term supply arrangements and who are not satisfied with performance of a limited portion of a drive family shipped over two years ago, when we've accrued for these costs associated with this issue and it's all focused on keeping that high level of customer support. So that's why we're fairly confident as Steve said in his comments about it being contained in the last quarter.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC", "So it's really almost just a warranty expense.", "William Mosley", "More reverse logistics expense, I would say.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.", "Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Just to start, can you go into a little more detail, Steve, around what drove the demand shortfall late in the quarter?", "Steve Luczo", "I'll let Dave talk to that. Again, we kind of pointed out that we seem to feel it mostly in Asia. And I'll let kind of Dave talk to it and in the channel.", "William Mosley", "Yes, I'd say that first of all, October and November were fairly strong. Seasonally, we could get into arguments about calendar Q4 and how they usually end relative to the next calendar Q1. But what I would say is that our view is the channel continued to move fairly well in the Americas and in EMEA. But in the Asia-Pacific region, the channel slowed down. And I don't think that's long-term demand but I do think there's some temporary issues that people are getting through in that region around Chinese New Year and how much do we have to build around some competitive positioning, not just in hard drives but in other components as well. And I think the industry is going to have to get through that with a, frankly, larger than what we would desire inventory in the channel in Asia. It may blow through in three weeks. It may take a little bit longer than that, but there's certainly that uncertainty now. We're less exposed to that because of our OEM share than maybe some other people, but it's certainly something that we noticed started in early December. I don't think it's long-term demand in Asia. I mean, you've got to subscribe to a really different thesis if you think that this goes out six to nine months in APAC demand.", "Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "And it's consistent with the IDC, Gartner commentary about the fourth quarter as well.", "William Mosley", "Yes.", "Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "And then just a follow-up for Pat, as it relates to the lower declines for upstream components, is that a function of tight supply? Or is it just a limited ability to write down the cost curve this late in your product cycles?", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "It's the second. That's what I'm saying, the bigger opportunity obviously for us is, as we transition our new products, that's obviously when: one, those are designed as cost-reduced products to begin with; and then of course, as you ramp volume and yield, you have the opportunity to obviously to move down price groups, that notwithstanding. Apparently, we have work to do in the quarter on our current cost of supplies as well.", "Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "And as we go \u2013 just as a follow-up to that, as we get into the calendar fourth quarter, any estimates for what percentage of the products you ship will be the new products?", "William Mosley", "Yes, not until the second half of 2011. We're in qualification in a lot of the portfolio right now, and that continues through the first six months of this year. But in terms of starting to really ramp across the portfolio, it's really the second half of the calendar year. Again, it's kind of Seagate's strength is the ability to really ramp across an entire portfolio that expands all the markets that we do. Some of it comes now, some of it comes in the June quarter, but until it's really hitting on all cylinders, it's the second half of the year.", "Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "And could you be 50% plus of shipments in December kind of platform?", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "It's akin to what we talked about a couple of years ago where we called the desktop transition, for example, quarter-over-quarter in these calls, we would tell you how much of the products have transitioned. To Steve's point, we won't begin that until probably late second or third calendar quarter.", "Steve Luczo", "But either all our products, all our products will at least be in qualification. All our new products by that time and the vast majority will be in volume shipments by the fourth quarter of '11.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Steve, can you talk a little about how should we think about the March quarter in terms of is it going to be more front-end loaded? I heard you talk about Chinese New Year. So could you just talk about if it's more front-end loaded than the usual? And how should we think about that?", "Steve Luczo", "I think how we're thinking of it is it feels more front-end loaded because we don't have a lot of post-Chinese New Year's visibility. Whether or not it ends up being front-end loaded or not, hard to say, right? But right now, I would say, it feels more front-end loaded.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And with that said, how are the fulfillment rates in terms of customer A1s, the 100 drives? Are they taking 100 drives? Are they taking less or are they asking for more, actually?", "Steve Luczo", "Not sure I understand the question.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Just in terms of when you say it's front-end loaded, I'm just trying to get a sense of current demand, are you seeing any structural nuances or changes to your fulfillment rates in terms of, let's say, a major OEM tells you six weeks ago, they wanted to get 100 disk drives, for example, in the third week of January. When the third week of January comes around, are they taking 100 disk drives or they're asking for less?", "William Mosley", "It really depends on which product we're talking about, Mark. This is Dave, by the way. I would say broadly in enterprise and business-critical, the answer to your question is yes, the polls are very strong. I think as we go into notebook, there are other dynamics up against building out \u2013 and by the way, Chinese New Year's is three weeks earlier than it was last year, relative to the quarter. So we have to watch those dynamics as people do builds and then, frankly, line changeovers during the time that the downtime in Chinese New Year, if you will. There's a lot of dynamics around that. I think notebooks' probably less predictable there. And the PS OEM poll rates are about what we expected. So January's coming in at the same predictable clip, I'll say, with one caveat on the upside and one caveat to watch for.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then the longer-term question, we're getting a lot of questions from investors around enterprise, particularly business-critical, not so much mission-critical but business-critical, in terms of the opportunity to move more and more away from Fibre Channel to SATA or SAS. Can you talk a little about how investors think about the competitive dynamics potentially changing here where Seagate's had the runway for a long time? Can you still run the table going forward?", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, it's a good question. I'm going to let Dave answer, but I think what we've seen in the last couple of quarters, we feel pretty good about in terms of the transition, I would say, to SAS, I think versus SATA. And I'll let Dave talk to it but we're encouraged by the trends because SAS obviously is an interface where we have a lot of expertise.", "William Mosley", "I mean, obviously, we led Fibre Channel, we led SAS, we led the 2.5-inch transition from 3.5-inch and so we have this history of leading products in the enterprise. I feel really good about the diversity of our portfolio and that's needed, I think, to play across a large scale in the enterprise, not just form factor or interface, but also spin speed and things like this. Relative to SATA versus SAS, I would say that people get confused by the quality of service of the drive, the expectations of the end user, not just the interface so there's a lot of people that see the difference on the spec sheet of the interface but they need to see what are the expectations for the drives and its duty cycle, if you will, over a long period out in the field and that's something to watch out for. We feel pretty good about our portfolio right now. We think we're launching leading products all the way across the portfolio, 15K, 10K products. We feel really good about our business-critical offerings as well in 2.5 and 3.5 on SAS already, there's other people who've announced, but we're basically the only person shipping SAS in large volume across business-critical. So it's not to discount any competition, but we know we've made the investments and we feel really good about the new products we're launching.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ana Goshko with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Ana Goshko - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I wanted to ask you for your updated thoughts on capital structure and capital structure strategy. I know in the past, particularly after the kind of events of 2009, you had talked about the target leverage as being a total dollar amount of debt, given the cyclical nature of the business and the industry. So wondering where you are now in terms of thinking of how leveraged you're willing to take the company? And how much cash you believe you need to keep on hand?", "Steve Luczo", "Sure, I think in terms of how much leverage, I mean, obviously, it's a function of outlook and performance and so on and so forth. But I think $1 billion in cash is what we feel is more than adequate to have on hand to run the business and whether actually, not just short-term downturns or probably even longer than the short-term downturn. I think in terms of the debt level that the company can carry, I think there's no question that the company, at today's interest rates, that the company could carry $3 billion to $4 billion of debt, depending on maturity structure. And so I think \u2013 today we\u2019re at $2.9 billion with $560 million coming due in November of next year. It means we have debt capacity if we feel that the debt markets are attractive and if we can finance it in a way that we don't have a wall of debt. So the issue that we ran into in 2008, when we stopped our dividend and scrambled pretty hard was really more a function, not really of our view on long-term cash flow as much as there was just big slugs of debt coming due in very short periods of time. Obviously, done against a backdrop of not a lot of liquidity debt or equity in the world. Today, I think we've done a lot of work over the last two years to restructure the balance sheet. I mentioned the maturities extend every two years starting in 2014. There's no massive wall of debt. The debt markets certainly are healthy. I learned that through our privatization exercise. And I think we feel good about being able to manage what we have and opportunistically doing more if we feel like we have to.", "Ana Goshko - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Just on the comment on considering the recurring dividend. Obviously, the downside to that is, it's more difficult to dial up and dial down depending upon interest rate conditions. So just wondering how advanced you are in your potential commitment to recurring dividend? And if so, kind of what size or magnitude you've considered?", "Steve Luczo", "Well, I've been doing a lot of work on this, and it just seems again, if you believe that the company has the ability to consistently generate cash flow, which if you look at us over the last five or 10 years, on any kind of quarter-to-quarter or rolling four quarter basis, I mean, the company generates a lot of cash through, by the way, a couple of pretty hairy downturns and a couple of acquisitions that ate up a lot of capital. And a lot of what it seems that investors are asking for is that if companies have free cash flow that is consistent even against their investments that they need to make in capital and technology, that some decent percentage of that we should probably return to shareholders, and that's what we're investigating. What is the current research saying? It kind of gets somewhere between 25% and 50% of free cash flow is what shareholders would like to see returned. We're not saying that we're going to come out at the high-end of that range, but I think this is under consideration and I know I mentioned it in the call, and we feel pretty confident that we can return to shareholders in various ways. Whether or not it comes in a dividend or not, we're not prepared to state just yet, but it's certainly on the table and we think it's an attractive alternative.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bill Shute with Goldman Sachs.", "Richard Schutte", "I have a quick cash question as well. WD is obviously talking about potentially using their cash for strategic purposes or strategic acquisition, and you guys are obviously clearly focusing on returning cash to shareholders with leverage. Are there potentially strategic opportunities for Seagate to use their cash for? Or do you feel your current R&D pool is pretty much adequate for your long-term goal?", "Steve Luczo", "No, I mean, I think there could be. I think the point is we feel that we have a lot of usable cash. We have the capacity to raise money through the debt markets and we generate cash. So I don't think we're limiting any alternative that we have strategically. Whether or not that's investing in the company or acquiring other technologies, it's just that I think that when you take all that into consideration, there's still the potential for return to shareholders. That being said, I guess that's all I'm saying then.", "Richard Schutte", "And maybe I missed this earlier, but can you comment on what you're seeing with HDD inventory management amongst your TLEM partners?", "Steve Luczo", "Yes. We were not going to comment on our customers.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Pat, could you comment on the inventory levels that you guys think is out there, both at the channel as well as the OEMs? I know the OEMs is a bit murky but I just want to get your thoughts there, particularly against some of the comments that WD made last night and I have follow-ups, please.", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "We generally manage our channel in a tight range, so we feel fairly comfortable with where that is as Steve and Dave both eluded. We actually slowed down our push into the end of December, channel inventory in Asia-Pac, to manage it as opposed to going after our pricing to maintain our discipline, our supply chain management. But we've monitored that and we feel that the channel level's appropriate. Could it come down? Obviously, its run lower but we don't think it's in a danger zone that would impact our ability to manage that channel reasonably well. On the OEMs, many of them have hubs in front of them [ph] and we monitor that very closely. So that part, we feel very comfortable. Now they're holding it on the back end. Don't really get all that visibility, but we do get signals from our OEMs, and as Steve said, they're cautious, but we're tied into their supply chain, and we work that fairly aggressively with them. So if folks are holding excess inventory, there\u2019s going to be issued an in marginal manifested, but from our standpoint, we keep a pretty tight eye on what they have or believe they have and stay very close to them to make sure we're lined up with them.", "Steve Luczo", "Maybe to state it a little clearer with respect to the OEMs, and we don't see an OEM situation of some millions of units of PCs of excess inventory. We don't see that.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "And how about \u2013 I don't think you talked about what your pricing considerations are or your anticipated pricing for the March quarter, and I just want to get your thoughts there.", "William Mosley", "Clearly, it has muted from where it's been so that's the good news. And I think that lines up with the supply and demand getting better, but obviously, it's on the backdrop of two heavier than usual pricing quarters in front of us that's typically slower. It goes back to Steve's comment of, you still have marginal [ph] pressure where raw materials and not being able aggressively to cost out, but it has muted down and it's probably a seasonal average.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, I think that the analyst community just has to take a hard look at what happened last summer still in terms of the quarter-to-quarter price takedowns and what that would've been relative to \u201cmore typical price takedowns. \u201d So that even if you have things flattening, if you have them flattening after three quarters of 6% versus 3%, you're still fighting an uphill battle and against the backdrop of no new products really that the industry is offering. So against the TAM that's flat and no new products, it's just tough to be looking at share gains. People should obviously be managing their P&Ls to keep their factories as full as possible, watch capital, and it's going to \u2013 until we get to the next set of products, it's going to be tough to see big margin expansion.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Can I sneak in one more just on CapEx. Pat, is how should we be thinking about it? Usually, you guys provide some ranges of CapEx. I just wanted to hear your thoughts, if not for the first half of the year, maybe just for the March quarter.", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "I think our models 6% to 8% is still intact. That's how we try to manage the business. And obviously with some of the lack of visibility Steve talked about, we'll be a little tighter on that, but we'll certainly monitor to grow where appropriate but we're keeping in that range of 6% to 8% \u2013 is still our model.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rob Cihra with Caris & Company.", "Robert Cihra - Caris & Company", "It seems like there've been some CapEx cuts, there are a lot or a little, including on the component side ever since really, I don't know, I guess, summer. Do you think there's a chance that even with the soft PC market by the second half this calendar year, you actually see the industry back to being pretty tight, just given the CapEx cuts? Or do you think CapEx has been cutting off or that's too optimistic?", "Steve Luczo", "It's a really good question, and it's kind of one of the reasons that I said the industry is, I guess, it has marginal excess capacity. I think that there's probably too much focus on an assumed drive capacity by the industry as opposed to what's really going on at the component level. And when you think about, at least, our experience of 30% increase in average capacity of drives shipped, that means a lot of heads and disk had to go into that. And so to your point, a lot of capacity is being utilized at the component level. And if we have a continuation of that type of capacity growth against even some marginal end demand growth in units, it's going to strain, I think, the component area quicker than people probably have modeled.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Steve, any more color you can give regarding a commercial refresh? I think you said it could accelerate this year 2011.", "Steve Luczo", "I mean, I think just in general, I think we started talking about it in the fall quarter or even maybe a touch even in the June quarter that we saw a pick up as the commercial refresh expanded into the server market and storage. And we're starting to see more evidence of it even on the client side, both desktop and notebook. And there just seems to be no indication right now that, that's slowing down, or if anything, maybe budgets are getting a little freer on the IT side, and people are starting to do kind of full company deployment of new assets under IT infrastructure.", "William Mosley", "I'd say that as we go through year-end budgets, the spend was based on 2010 budgets, and now, we've got a good look into the new year of what 2011 IT budgets are, for what that's going to be for enterprise systems and so on. I think on the PC side, the notebook side, the commercial refresh there as we've commented before, it's always ongoing to some extent. There's ancillary data out there that says it's accelerating, and I think everyone likes to believe that because the new systems are compelling price points and capabilities with the operating system refreshes and so on, and a lot of people are running on older PCs, but I would say quantitatively, it's really hard to pin that one, the PC one down in particular. We hear the same ancillary data that other people do.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "And last question for me on aerial density. Is it fair to say you guys are comfortable with a 30% to 40% annual gain if you look out three to five years plus without a transformational CapEx investment?", "Steve Luczo", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "First question for me would be on the gross margin line. I just want to be clear. You guys are talking about a 170 basis point impact that will be contained in this quarter, but you're guiding to an 18% to 19%, so at the midpoint, you're effectively guiding close to a 300 basis-point drop on a like-for-like basis on gross margin into the March quarter. I'd like to understand if that's how you want us to see that, in particular, what the puts and takes are in particular to that level of a decline on gross margin, like-for-like.", "Steve Luczo", "I think that is a fair way to look at it, and where the vast majority of that erosion comes from on the margin impression, really is almost all prices falling into the bottom line as we have very limited ability to continue to mix up. We mix up very strong already and also cost takedowns. As Steve said, we'll continue to push that and see what we can get out of that, but that's the large vast majority, over 2/3 of the compression.", "William Mosley", "Maybe just stated this a different way, that outlook is with a view of not a lot of takedowns in cost of supplies and not a view of continued mix-up in capacity. If even one of those things happen then obviously, then that would change the margin structure.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And the final question, the follow-up for me, I know you guys talked about a slowdown in the final couple of weeks to the quarter and a conscious effort to not participate in some market segments. So one thing that sticks out for me is that you guys have falling down to a six-year, even depending on what math you use, a sub-60% share position in the enterprise, mission-critical space. Is that a space that you guys actually decided constantly to step out of some opportunity? Or is there another competitive dynamic going on in that enterprise market?", "Steve Luczo", "Aaron, we didn't step back from it. I think the competitive dynamics is about the same as it has been for the prior couple of quarters. I think if you go back all the way to the front of last year, we had some competitive stumbles that caused us to be way above profile. I think we're kind of at profile right now. Again, the products are getting \u2013 the entire products that, not just the Seagate products, but the entire products that are getting longer than the two that need these refreshes.", "Steve Luczo", "I think we've been pretty consistent saying that we think our enterprise market share our \u2013 given the nature of our customer base and our product offering, is probably in the 58% to 62% range. And if it gets way above that, it's usually because of an execution issue on behalf of our competitors. And if it gets way below that, it's probably an execution issue on us. So we feel that we're kind of in our range, and we might even argue \u2013 there's a lot of confusion about what the right TAM was for mission-critical enterprise\u2019s last quarter. So I think we still feel we're in the 60% range and we feel comfortable in that range. Okay, I'd like to thank our employees for their ongoing commitment and hard work, and also of course, our customers, our suppliers and our partners for their ongoing support and confidence in Seagate. Thank you all for joining us on the call today, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

Mr. Luczo, you may proceed.", "Steve Luczo", "I'm sorry about that. First of all, I just want everyone to know that I'm calling in from Singapore and to apologize that the transmission isn't as clear as it normally is. Good morning, and thanks for joining the call today. On the call with me from Seagate are Pat O\u2019Malley, Seagate's Chief Financial Officer; Bob Whitmore, our Chief Technology Officer and Head of Research & Development; Dave Mosley, Executive Vice President of Operations; Rocky Pimentel, Executive Vice President of Worldwide Sales and Marketing; and Ken Massaroni, our General Counsel. ", "I'll focus my remarks on our strategic thinking and the benefits of the Samsung transaction, and Pat will address the transaction details and the financial implications. As you've seen from our press release, in addition to discussing the strategic relationship we have entered into with Samsung, we will also use the later portion of the call to review our fiscal third quarter of 2011 financial results and our outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter. We will not be hosting our previously scheduled call this afternoon. ", "To begin, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to all of the management, employees and advisers who have worked so diligently over these last several months to structure these transactions and agreements. Through a series of transactions and agreements announced today, Seagate and Samsung are significantly expanding and strengthening our strategic relationship by further aligning our respective ownership of, investments in and sharing of key technologies. By aligning in this way, we expect to achieve greater sale and deliver a broader range of innovative storage products and solutions to our customers, while facilitating our long-term relationship with Samsung. ", "The elements of the relationship, each of which I will speak to in more detail, include: Samsung combining its HDD operations into Seagate; extending and enhancing the patent cross license agreement between the companies; a NAND flash memory supply agreement, under which Samsung will provide Seagate with its market-leading semiconductor products for use in our enterprise SSD, solid-state hybrid drives and other products; a disk drive supply agreement, under which Seagate will supply drives to Samsung for its PCs, notebooks and consumer electronics; extended cooperation between the companies to co-develop enterprise storage solutions; Samsung receiving significant equity ownership in Seagate; and a shareholder agreement, under which an executive of Samsung will be nominated to join Seagate's Board of Directors. ", "The combined value of all of these transactions and agreements is approximately $1.375 billion, which will be paid by Seagate to Samsung in the form of 50% stock and 50% cash. The primary objective of our new relationship, anchored by these agreements is to enable both companies to better align current and future product development efforts and roadmaps, accelerate time-to-market for new products and position the companies to better address rapidly evolving opportunities in a variety of markets, including mobile computing, cloud computing and solid state storage. ", "Specifically, we will be able to optimize resources of both companies to advance technology on behalf of our customers. This will increase our responsiveness to customer needs, accelerate the adoption of next-generation technology, speed innovation and allow customers to benefit from an important technology transitions. In addition, through the mutual supply agreements that are part of our strategic relationship with Samsung, Seagate secures an important source of a leading edge NAND flash supply, as well as early visibility into the development of next-generation NAND technologies. This will be very valuable to Seagate, as we continue to execute on our strategy of developing SSD and solid state hybrid product offerings. These agreements also position Seagate to be a more significant supplier of disk drives to Samsung for their broad offering of products. ", "Once this transaction is complete, Samsung will have a significant ownership position in Seagate and the right to nominate an executive of Samsung to join Seagate's Board of Directors. This further underscores the high level of alignment between our companies and position Samsung to benefit, along with Seagate's other shareholders, from this enhanced relationship, as we execute together in the future. The key aspects of the agreements that I want to highlight is that we are acquiring only those elements of Samsung HDD operation that Seagate needs in order to achieve greater scale and efficiency. Together with Samsung, we have been thoughtful in identifying the assets, infrastructure and people that we need to drive scale and innovation, which we expect to be able to leverage to enhance our future products and accelerate innovation. ", "Elements of the HDD operations that we do not need will be retained and redeployed within Samsung. Because we have structured the transaction this way, we do not anticipate significant restructuring cost, and we expect to achieve significant reduction of overall operating expenses for the combined businesses while maintaining the integration cost and distractions -- by minimizing the integration cost and distractions that have been associated with other transactions historically. ", "To help us accomplish that smooth transition and minimize distractions and disruptions, as well as restructuring charges, a number of support and transition functions will be temporarily provided by Samsung to Seagate. We will be focused on achieving a timely closing of all elements of this enhanced strategic relationship. We anticipate that the revised IT, cross-licensing agreements and the NAND supply agreement will be become effective this quarter. The other elements, including the acquisition of Samsung's HDD operations, the equity investment by Samsung and Seagate, and the HDD supply agreement will be driven by the regulatory approval timetable. For those elements, we are targeting closing by the end of calendar 2011. With that, I will turn the call over to Pat.", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "Thank you, Steve. First, to summarize the key terms of the transaction, we believe that the consideration of structure in a way that is optimal for both parties. Under the terms of the agreement, Samsung will receive consideration consisting of 50% Seagate ordinary shares and 50% cash. Upon closing, Samsung will receive Seagate ordinary shares valued at $687.5 million. Specifically, they will receive 45.2 million shares, or approximately 9.6% ownership of Seagate, based on Seagate's 30-day volume weighted average stock price prior to signing. Samsung will also receive $687.5 million in cash. The amount of cash paid is consistent with Seagate's balanced capital deployment strategy which also encompasses the recently declared dividend, ongoing share repurchase and recent debt price refinancing. I like to emphasize that the $1.357 billion represents the value of all the elements of this transaction, including the HDD operations, cross licenses and supply agreements. However, even if you just consider the HDD operations alone, which are capable of producing 18 million units per quarter, this is a highly effective use of capital in line with our overall capital deployment strategy. We expect our capital budgets to remain at a level we have discussed previously of 68% of revenues going forward. ", "During calendar 2010, Samsung's HDD operations shipped approximately 66 million units and had $3.1 billion of revenues. We anticipate that summary balancing by customers may happen in connection with this transaction, but we will be focused on maximizing revenue retention. We expect that any revenue attrition will be mitigated because Samsung's customer base, which includes a significant volume of distribution channel customers, has a relatively little overlap with Seagate's customer base. In addition, the supply arrangement with Samsung will enable continuity of demand. So we are confident that we can manage and limit revenue attrition effectively and achieve an attractive return profile. As a result of the transaction structure, Seagate expects these transactions and agreements to be meaningfully accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share and cash flow within the first full year following the closing. With that, let's now shift to the March quarter financial results and the outlook for the June quarter, and then we'll open up the call to Q&A.", "As we have done now for the past several quarters, we have posted detailed supplemental information about the quarter on our Investor Relations website. Seagate reported revenue of $2.7 billion and non-GAAP gross margin of 19.2% for the March quarter, both at the high-end of our January forecast. The company also reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.25 per share. Earlier this month, Seagate announced that the board had approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share. The establishment of the quarterly dividend is an important milestone for the company as it reflects the strength of our balance sheet and a strong cash generation ability of our business. Additionally, it demonstrates the confidence that the board and the management team have in the company's ability to generate free cash flow on a sustained basis. No change is anticipated in this dividend in policy in light of today's announcement. ", "During the March quarter, we repurchased 29.5 million shares for approximately $405 million. This leaves approximately $1.6 billion remaining under existing share repurchase authorization, and we anticipate no change in authorization program in light of today's announcement. We expect to maintain a sufficient cash balance that will enable the company to respond quickly to changes in market dynamics, take advantage of unexpected opportunities, and provide flexibility for future investments and growth. The goal of our capital structure strategy is unchanged: to maximize shareholder returns, while maintaining the flexibility to invest in a broad range of storage technologies to serve our customers. ", "Turning to the June quarter outlook, the impact of the Japan earthquake and tsunami in March is still affecting the PC supply chain, and in particular, it's constraining supply of hard disk drives due to specific component shortages, power issues and transportation issues. Seagate has not been materially negatively impacted by these issues to date. While we do not anticipate component shortages directly attributed to the tragedy in Japan to impact Seagate, we are closely monitoring the situation. As of now, we expect the situation to be volatile for several months. As such, we are planning for June quarter industry can to be flat to slightly down as compared to the March quarter. The June quarter outlook does not include the impact of restructuring activities, future mergers, acquisitions, financing, dispositions or other business combinations the company may undertake. The company's policies refrain from commenting on any such activities. As a result, the outlook for the June quarter is approximately $2.7 billion, OpEx is flat to the March quarter, a tax rate between 3% and 10%, diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.19 to $0.23 per share. We are now ready to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] ", "And your first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "First question for me is, I understand that you guys are talking about the dividend and share repurchase. How do we look, post this deal? How does the balance sheet, how does the capital structure look? How much data are you willing to put on the balance sheet, just kind of any framework of how we should think about that?", "Steve Luczo", "I'll give a brief answer, and then, Pat, you can fill in. As indicated, the deal is really -- the whole transaction is actually being financed with cash from our balance sheet that we currently have, as well as equity. And I think risk ratio -- cash generation capabilities of the company, we certainly feel that the transaction will be financed in a manner that will not change any of the elements with respect to the dividend or the long-term buyback program that we've had in place. That being said, we're not commenting on any future financings we might take , it is not necessary at the course of this transaction but just as a course of our normal balance sheet management. Pat, you want to...", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "Yes. The only thing I'd add is today we're $2.9 billion. We also have structured debt due in October. With this transaction, we're comfortable with both coming off the balance sheet, but we're also very comfortable with the level of debt we have today.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And then as a follow on, I think you referenced $18 million as kind of the capacity that Samsung offers. I think there's been stories out there, some indications out there, that Samsung does leverage TDK as a manufacturer of a portion of their hard drive business. Can you say how much TDK -- is TDK included in that 18 million number or is that just the capacity that has been the manufacturing capacity within Samsung?", "Steve Luczo", "Right. I'll answer the question, no, the 18 million units in the $3.2 billion is representative of the total output of Samsung that they have seen all through the relationship with TDK/SAE, as well as the assets that they own and operate directly.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And how much do they -- how much of that is TDK?", "Steve Luczo", "We're not breaking that up, but we're basically having access to both of those asset bases.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And then final question for me is on your guidance, are you assuming -- in your preliminary results, you talked about distribution inventory levels running below the targeted range. Is your guidance assuming any replenishment at all of distribution inventory levels? And if you can tell us what those levels currently stand at?", "Steve Luczo", "I'll answer part of that, and I'll ask Dave Mosley, probably, to answer the other part of it. I just think, in terms of what might happen during the quarter, it's very fluid right now. The supply situation is constrained, and therefore, ability to drive inventory levels to what might be considered more normal levels would probably be difficult. So, Dave, you want to add anything to that?", "William Mosley", "We're not anticipating any significant replenishment. We finished below our targeted four weeks. But from our perspective, things were -- in the channel were lower than what we expected. But a lot of that was the strength of the last five or six weeks of the quarter, so I think it's really hard to forward forecast given all the disruptions we talked about.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Barclays.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "Steve, can you talk a little bit more about Samsung's earnings potential? I mean, you're saying it's accretive. It could be meaningfully accretive, any numbers around that. And in particular, what are Samsung's gross margins? And then I have a follow-up.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, I'm going to let Pat answer that in more detail. But we are not prepared to talk about specifics on the earnings model yet. And we have a lot of work to do in the interim period. And of course, we're also subject to regulatory conditions in terms of the type of work that we can do with Samsung until the transaction is approved by the various regulators throughout the world. But based on what we know and what the opportunities are around leveraging the infrastructure and the fact that it's a pretty capital light operation that we do believe will be meaningfully accretive. Pat, you want anything else to add?", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "You're absolutely right, Steve. We're leveraging through the structure they had, we certainly scale with our own components, further scale with their own components. And as Steve said, one of the very asset light business would fit in very well with our strategy that we can leverage more and their operating expenditures we certainly could lever that. So we see many vectors of leverage in this. A very well known structure that within the first full year, it strikes us to be meaningfully accretive.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "In terms of gross margins, going forward, I think it's pretty well known that they're not -- given their lack of enterprise exposure, etc., it'll be meaningfully below where you're at now. And so with lower gross margins, we still get you at least in the beginning, we get you meaningfully accretive.", "Steve Luczo", "But, Ben, you're taking that under the construct what their scale and leverage was. I mean, they were very -- as a design team,  very, very efficient. They just didn't have scale and leverage. Now you put that in our business, you can't take their gross margin as they're operating today and lay them into our financials because we're going to get scale out of theirs, which they lack. They don't lack design capabilities or manufacturing capabilities, they just lack scale.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. Then just a little bit more on pricing, can you talk about, on the industry with regard to the quarter in your guidance, Steve and Pat, what happened with pricing towards the end of the quarter? It sounds like there was surge in business. It sounds like distributors, especially looking for product in cases of shortage. And can you talk about what pricing does specifically and how you see pricing in the June quarter? That would be great.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, I think the quarter, it wasn't a surge in demand due to a concern about supplier alert. There is constrained supply. And a lot of course the pricing  negotiations with their OEMs have already been concluded prior to the disruptioning of the supply chain. And of course the channel is more typically a spot market and is basically the evidence of the supply/demand tightness right now, that the pricing has firmed relative to where it was.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "And in June? What are your expectations of pricing?", "Steve Luczo", "Again, I think, as we indicated in the call, we expect that the supply situation is going to remain constrained through the June quarter.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "First, as it relates to the joint development and partnership with Samsung on asset fees, does this actually accelerate time-to-market? Are they much more strongly competitive as is the solution in enterprise? And what's your latest thinking as to when you'll have a very competitive product in the market in that space?", "Steve Luczo", "Well, I contend that the other competitor [indiscernible] (26:07)Dave talk to that more exclusively, but I think as it relates to what we consider our third generation product which is the one that we are developing a piece of silicon with Samsung, and utilizing their NAND flash. It doesn't accelerate the timing of that. That product, that program is on schedule. And I'll let Bob speak to that. I think we've given updates in the last couple of calls. But I do think it does address an issue that customers have raised repeatedly, as well. They have a lot of confidence around the capabilities of Samsung and Seagate's ability to design this last management engine, leveraging our capabilities at the channel and interface and controller level and ,of course, Samsung in terms of [indiscernible] (26:54) silicon. There's always been a little bit of a concern about without a formal supply agreement, what was the whole package going to look like. So they're specific to that agreement, are subject to MDA, but I'm pleased with where we ended up. And I think it\u2019s a significant conclusion to that entire strategy. Dave, you want to add anything?", "William Mosley", "No, I think you said it well.", "Steve Luczo", "Bob, you want to talk about the timing?", "Robert Whitmore", "No, I think you said it. I think the engagement with Samsung is longer-term. And currently we are in qualification with our SLC product. SAS, SLC products, we just -- you'll see in the supplement that we just announced our NLC-based SSD, which will be coming into production shortly. So those two are unchanged, and as Steve said, the real strategic engagement will happen on the third generation.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "On the quarter, the $26 million increase, and with in raw material inventory, we've got a strategic decision, post the Japan earthquake, and is that what is driving your confidence in being able to set the components you need for June or is that confidence driven by conversations you've had throughout the supply chain or a combination of both?", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, obviously a follow-up on -- I'll take the last part of it. So far, I'm looking for some wood here to knock on, the issues related to the Japanese earthquake and tsunami haven't directly impacted us in terms of component availability. That being said, obviously, that's major transportation hub is damaged, major power grid is damaged. There's a lot of human loss. So the implications, I think, are still to develop. So we have tended to have very weak and broad supply chain. And it may be one of the reasons why, historically, some of our cost of goods maybe was higher than some of our competition because we tend to keep multiple sources, and maybe sometimes, not necessarily a cost with that, but I think in this particular case, the relationships most definitely supply chain are certainly benefiting us relative to some other people that are in the PC supply-chain. Dave, you wanted to talk specifically to the inventory issues?", "William Mosley", "Yes, Katy, I think you said it. You talked about the earthquake and tsunami as the trigger. I think that's probably not the right way to characterize it. We believe the demand in March was pure demand, real demand, and it's actually extended somewhat into April. And so the staging and the width of the raw materials is all about staging for that early month 1 demand. I think there'll still be the volatility all the way out through June. And that's the thing that we made reference to before relative to the supply-chain disruption.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "And just lastly, Pat, I think you've said that the earliest growth margins could uptick would be the September quarter with the new desktop products planned to be launched. With the industry consolidation and the tightness we've seen over the last several weeks, is there a chance that that changes, and there's some potential upside for June? Are you still thinking about that back half as when the earliest the gross margin could...", "Steve Luczo", "Yes. With respect -- there hasn't been any industry consolidation. These transactions are all still pending and everybody is still competing against each other like they normally would. And I don't know what the indication is on the WD/Hitachi transaction. I think it was anywhere from 4 to 12 months. And we've indicated that we believe that this would be sometime before the end of this year. So that aspect doesn't really change anything, and I don't think we'll change anything post transaction. I think, as I indicated, there does appear to be security supply/demand imbalance that's related to component shortages that are impacting the various people in the supply-chain and in particular in this PC supply-chain. And that could have the implication of firmer pricing and depending on how bad those dislocations get, that will impact margins. Right now, as you can tell, we're not actually predicting anything like that happening.", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "I hear you, Steve. I mean, we've been focused about the new products, and that's what's going to drive it for us. These other ancillary items are, as Steve said, maybe  opportunistically. But this year is all about driving the product transitions and how to sustain ability to hold the gross margins higher. So that's number one. And these other opportunities, as Dave and Steve echoed, we are positioned to take advantage of them. But it is going to be volatile, so we want to be flexible on that. So I think we're still just focused on driving a cost structure for the new products that will maintain it for a period of time.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, thank you. That's it for me.", "Operator", "Your next question comes the line of Richard Kugele of Needham.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC", "Thank you. Just a couple of questions, I guess. First, in terms of Samsung, can you give us a sense of what their mix was versus -- OEM versus channel? And then secondly, in terms of the quarter, is it fair to say then, just to summarize some of your comments, that your lack of impact on the component availability is leading to the opportunity for you to pick up maybe some share over the near term? And does that affect -- has some of that share been as well leakage from Hitachi WD a little early, if you've had any color from the OEMs on that side?", "Steve Luczo", "Rich, I think I'll answer the second question first. I think that -- I don't know if it has anything to do with leakage from an announced transactions. I think it's more related to the relative impact that the component shortages have had on all of our competitors. And we have seen a lot of upsides from a lot of customers, and we can only respond to so many. And of course we need to manage our overall production, as well, given the fact that our factories are getting near capacity as well. So I don't know that I can say that it's the leakage because of the talks of Hitachi/WD transaction as much the interruptions to the supply-chain. With respect to Samsung OEM channel, I'm not going to talk specifically to it other than to indicate, obviously, they have a large OEM customer in the form of their own company on the PC side and other computer-related products and consumer products. And then they also have a channel business that's very interesting. There's not a lot of overlap, as it turns out between new the Seagate customer base and the  Samsung customer base, particularly in the channel. They have some very unique access points to markets that we think we can learn a lot from.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC", "Okay. Just one last one on Samsung. Is the $688 million worth of stock, does that vary as the stock price if it were to rise? Would you issue less shares or is that a fixed share volume?", "Steve Luczo", "No, it's a fixed share volume that we based on the negotiated transaction volume of 1.375, but it has a 30-day average on the calculation on these shares. So that share count is now fixed.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much, and congratulations.", "Operator", "Your next question comes the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "If you look at over the longer term, do you think the combined entity will have a different longer-term gross margin target than what Seagate has independently had?", "Steve Luczo", "Pat, you want to answer that question?", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "At this stage, we would not certainly move away from it. Obviously, they don't have the enterprise business. But what we think we can pick up scale and drive cost savings, we would, at this point, not move away from that. We'll continue to evolve that story, but our intention is to drive and keep our target margin at 22% to 26%.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "And then just for March quarter, can you just talk about what drove the strength in the quarter? Was it the OEM sort of buildup inventory towards the end of the year, end of the quarter or was it more broad-based in demand that you saw?", "Steve Luczo", "I'll answer that question in a second, but I think just one thing also on the benefits of the Samsung transaction. I mean, Pat mentioned scale a couple of times. I think it's important for everyone to realize though that Samsung is a very capable designer and producer of hard disk drives. And there's a lot of technology ownership that Samsung has both on the design side and on the production side. But we believe we'll be able to bring elements of that over to our entire operation being able to leverage across our portfolio. I think it's important to note it's not just about a mass number of scale, but that\u2019s  a very confident group that\u2019s been in business for a long time. Making certainly a material amount of disk drives and there will be benefits we can leverage across our whole company, and hopefully reduce cost and pass those savings on to our customers. Dave, you want to talk on the kind of the demand elements in the March quarter?", "William Mosley", "Yes, just relative to the linearity January, February fairly slow. And that followed a December that was fairly slow as well. The March was strong. And again, I believe, and I talked about this earlier relative to the distribution channel, it was fairly broad-based demand. I think that the OEM band distribution was fairly well represented in March. And I think some of that strengths continued into April as there were a number of supply disruptions, I think, even earlier in January, the various chains that have caused people to pull back a little bit in January and February.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "And just finally, if my math's right, looks like the June quarter gross margin are trading down, could you just confirm that and so what's driving it?", "Steve Luczo", "Pat, do you want to address that?", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "Yes, I'll take that. Yes, they're going down, as much as we feel very comfortable where we're at in April, Steve and Dave talked about the volatility of this. I mean what we're \u2013 we\u2019re modeling is for an historical June quarter. We certainly think there's potential upside to that, but given the nature of the supply-chain, where it's been impacted, we're just modeling for the lack of any other reason, just for historical, given the dynamics and the whole business model for that. So it has to be modeled down because of the approach we're taken to the forecast.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Scott Craig of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Scott Craig", "Steve, maybe from a long-term perspective, there's a lot of consolidation going on in the industry obviously. So how do you think the margin structure gets affected for the industry longer term? Is up a couple hundred basis points a reasonable assumption given everything that's going on? And then secondly, do you guys foresee any regulatory issues going on with any of the transactions that are pending, given the top two players that are going to have a fairly significant market share here?", "Steve Luczo", "I think with respect to the second one, no, we don't anticipate regulatory problems. We'll be working with the regulatory agencies in all of relevant jurisdictions to get the transaction approved as constructed, and we're confident that we can do that. I think in terms of margins going forward, I think the important thing about the industry consolidation is, honestly, is more about creating business models that can fund new technology going forward that our customers need. I think as a result of a lot of issues, the demand for storage is accelerating. The petabyte growth is very strong and really has been over the last six to eight quarters, even in an economy that, for the most part, has been pretty lackluster. ", "The petabyte growth, the shift by the drive industry has grown at a very high rates, higher than historical rates. And this is against a backdrop of an areal density curve that is actually slowing, where that person in the S curve, where basically the technology gains we can get out of the current levels of technology are getting more and more difficult. ", "So that means in order to address that pipeline growth, either a lot more investment has to go into the fundamental technology to accelerate our areal density. And if that can't be achieved with the current level, the current generation of technology, then the only way that you can really provide that storage required is with more heads and disks, which of course is a big capital budget to it. So I think the consolidation is really reflective of the needs of the industry to make new investments in capital and technology to continue to provide these devices that are in such huge demand. And, oh by the way, the demand is probably accelerating as a result of all these wonderful viewing devices that basically are putting very rich content in front of people and therefore, that content, which is very rich in terms of its density, has to be stored in that storage. It has to be on rotating discharge because of the cost and the density of that technology. ", "So even though that end viewing device may or may not have a disk drive on it, everything that's up and down the food chain to pump it through that little beautiful window needs to be stored in that magnetic rotating disk somewhere. All that being said, the ability, commercial deployment, enterprise computing in Asia, this is a big demand for what we do and how we continue to deliver it in a way that allows our customers, whether they're not consumers or enterprise or system integrators, they do that as competitively as they had for the last 30 years. And I think it's more about stability of a business model so you can make those investments as opposed to necessarily a gross margin structure changing or increasing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Shope of Goldman Sachs.", "Steve Luczo", "And I think we're just going to take one more question now because we're, I think we're getting close to market opening, If I'm not mistaken.", "Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Assuming the deal closes, can you walk through how we should think about your longer-term procurement strategy? In particular, how we should think about your sourcing of internal versus external components?", "Steve Luczo", "I don't think there will be any big changes. And again, I think Seagate has a strong relationship with many of the same suppliers that Samsung does. And it's our expectation that we can both actually strengthen those relationships as result of this transaction. So I don't think that there's going to be any fundamental change in our long-term strategy. Dave, you want to add anything to that?", "Shanelle, sorry, I meant we can take one more. Looks like we have just a few minutes here.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG", "I wanted to just ask about your CapEx plans, going forward. I think on the call you mentioned that you didn't have any changes to your CapEx plans with the transaction. But I'm curious, with the Samsung acquisition, does that mean you're getting additional capacity? You don't feel you need to add anything this year? Do you think you'll need to add capacity for the second half of the year? Just wanted to get a sense of what you're thinking about.", "Steve Luczo", "Once the transaction closes, we will have capacity that is coming over from Samsung. And we would certainly intend on utilizing that. And I think, the message should have been not that our capital budget is going to change, but as a percentage of revenue, we'll still expect that to be in the 6% to 8% range. The Samsung operations have been very capital efficient, so there's an advantage to us in terms of not having take on a lot of capital that's expensive or depreciated or not depreciated. It's a very capital-light model that they have to produce anything that they produce. We'll be able to leverage that, obviously, over time, absorb it into an integrated manufacturing organization. And overall, I think we can still hold capital budgets of 6% to 8%.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG", "And so is the idea that if there's some overflow potentially you use TDK to manufacture those drives, is that kind of the thinking?", "Steve Luczo", "We're not going to talk to specific arrangements, but again we don't see any sudden changes to the relationships that Samsung have.", "Steve Luczo", "Okay, I'd really like to thank everyone. And I feel sorry that we had to shift the call at the last minute. But I'm sure you can understand. It's been a complex and moving transaction that we are pleased to conclude. And therefore announced part of the opening today, I want to thank all of the Seagate customers and suppliers and employees, in particular, for their effort over the last quarter. And we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the presentation. Thank you for your participation.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me from Seagate are Pat O\u2019Malley, our Chief Financial Officer; Bob Whitmore, our Chief Technology Officer; Dave Mosley, EVP of Operations; and Rocky Pimentel, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer. ", "We have provided detailed supplemental information about our fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year-end results on our Investor Relations site at www.seagate.com. ", "During this call, I will review the results for the fourth quarter then provide a brief update on the Samsung transaction and then discuss the outlook for the September quarter. After that, we'll open up the call for Q&A.", "On our earnings call in April, we indicated that we were expecting component constraints related to the damage caused by the Japan earthquake and tsunami to continue to impact the disk drive industry in our fiscal fourth quarter. We believe the supply chain impacts would result in the industry TAM being flat to slightly down quarter-over-quarter at approximately 160 million units. We also expected Seagate's revenue to be roughly flat sequentially at approximately $2.7 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.19 to $0.23. ", "Seagate delivered solid financial results in the June quarter with revenue of $2.9 billion. We believe the upside revenue was the result of stronger-than-anticipated demand, and we were able to respond because of the benefits of Seagate's robust supply chain. ", "On a non-GAAP basis, the company reported gross margins of 18.8%, diluted earnings per share of $0.28 and net income of $126 million. The industry TAM for the June quarter was approximately 166 million units, an increase of approximately 4% from the prior quarter, which is essentially equal to the industry's record shipment of 167 million units in the fourth calendar quarter of 2010. In addition, the average capacity per drive shipped by the industry continued to increase during the quarter and reached approximately 560 gigabytes per unit. ", "For the fiscal year, storage capacity shipped grew approximately 40% to 330 million terabytes. Seagate shipped a record 52 million units during the quarter, representing approximately 32% market share and averaged approximately 590 gigabytes per unit. We believe that this continued increase in the amount of digital storage shipped is directly related to the broadening geographical footprint of IT systems and services, as well as the impact of a highly mobile and connected user base that is demanding real-time access to rich data and content. We also believe these trends will continue as computing architectures evolve to serve this growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world. ", "In the enterprise market, Seagate shipped 5.1 million drives for mission-critical applications and 2.7 million drives for business-critical applications, representing year-over-year increases of 8% and 46%, respectively. The company shipped a total of 35.5 million client compute drives in the June quarter, consisting of 14.7 million mobile drives, up 21% year-over-year, and 20.7 million desktop drives, up 6% year-over-year. Demand for Seagate-branded storage products remained strong, with solid year-over-year growth of 36% to 3.5 million units, while consumer electronic products totaled 5.4 million units. ", "While there has been some commentary in the market about customers potentially building inventory due to real or perceived supply constraints, we believe the June quarter's TAM reflected true end demand. For example, distribution channel inventory of Seagate's 3.5-inch ATA desktop drives at the end of the quarter was 3.5 weeks, which was again below the targeted range of 4 to 6 weeks. We think it's important to note that this is well below levels typical for a June quarter, which is historically the quarter with the greatest risk of excess inventory during the year. Given our ability to sustain weeks on hand below 5 weeks for the last 2 years, we are now targeting 4 to 5 weeks on hand for our distribution channel inventory level. ", "Our gross margin in the quarter was slightly better than planned and was positively impacted by the relatively balanced supply environment in the quarter as well as higher volume. Historically, our gross margins improved more significantly in this type of environment. However, this quarter's accretion was limited by the following factors: First, since we had completed pricing negotiations with our OEMs prior to the mid-quarter increases in demand, we did not increase OEM pricing within the quarter. OEMs constitute approximately 70% of our revenue. ", "Second, we did not achieve our time to maturity targets for products announced in fiscal year 2011, which resulted in higher scrap cost and inefficiently utilized manufacturing resources. ", "Third, as we most recently discussed on our fiscal second quarter financial results call, commodity prices that directly impact our company and the industry have continued to rise. ", "And fourth, we were able to service upside demand, consisting primarily lower-margin notebook products. ", "We continue to focus on actively managing the balance sheet to maximize shareholder returns while maintaining the flexibility to invest in a broad range of storage technologies to serve our customers. During the quarter, Seagate completed a $600 million offering of senior unsecured notes, returned $77 million to shareholders in the form of a dividend and repurchased $112 million of Seagate ordinary shares. ", "Our strategic relationship with Samsung progressed as expected during the quarter, and we continue to believe the transaction will close by the end of calendar 2011. Once completed, this relationship will enable the companies to better align current and future product development efforts and roadmaps, accelerate time-to-market for new products and position the companies to better address rapidly evolving opportunities in mobile computing, cloud computing, solid-state storage and other markets. We remain confident about the benefit of this strategic relationship to our customers and our shareholders. ", "With regard to our outlook for the September quarter, I want to emphasize that the outlook is influenced by significant uncertainty concerning global macroeconomic conditions, including the outcome of negotiations around the U.S. debt limit and the impact of issues related to European sovereign debt. ", "For the September quarter, we expect the industry TAM to be 165 million to 170 million units, and believe the industry will maintain a well-balanced supply and demand environment. Specifically for Seagate, revenue is expected to be approximately $2.9 billion. We do not anticipate significant market share shifts from the June quarter, primarily due to a longer life cycle of current-generation products throughout the industry. ", "Gross margins for the September quarter is expected to be up slightly compared to the June quarter. We expect to benefit from relatively benign price erosion already negotiated with our OEMs and continued tight supply in the distribution channel. We do, however, expect a positive margin impact of a more stable pricing environment to be offset by the following factors: the costs of many upstream materials, especially rare earth elements, which have increased significantly. These costs are expected to adversely impact gross margins by at least 200 basis points. And as previously mentioned, the delay in achieving time to maturity of new products is resulting in inefficiently utilized manufacturing resources with higher cost. Currently, we expect meaningful cost reductions and resulting margin accretion associated with these new products to be realized in the second half of fiscal 2012. ", "In regards to the increasing cost of upstream materials, Seagate has historically been able to absorb these cost increases and insulate our customers. However, the recent dramatic increase in the cost of rare earth elements, combined with a pre-existing upward trend for a broad base of other commodities, far exceeds our ability to find offsetting cost reductions. While we are exploring opportunities to reduce the content of certain rare earth elements that are used in the manufacture of hard disk drive components, we will be discussing with our customers, passing through what we hope are temporary surcharges related to upstream earth-based commodities. It's important to note that for the relevant rare earth materials, there does not appear to be a significant supply constraint. And while we have a short-term concern over margin impact, we do not currently have a long-term concern. ", "The tax provision is expected to be between 3% and 10%. R&D and SG&A is planned to increase to $350 million, and we expect capital investments to be at or below the low end of our targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue. Excluding certain expenses, such as restructuring and acquisition-related costs totaling approximately $10 million, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.29 to $0.33 per share. ", "Katherine, we're now ready to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Rich Kugele of Needham & Company.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC", "A couple of questions. First, on the rare earth side, can you give us a sense on what percent of your -- of a disk drive might be affected by rare earth element pricing? For example, I mean, are we just talking about the motor, or is it much more broad than that? And then I have a follow-up.", "Steve Luczo", "Percentage in parts could be indicated in percentage in terms of basis points, which is 2%. But do you mean where is it used throughout the drive, Rich?", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC", "Yes.", "Robert Whitmore", "It's particularly the VCM magnet, Rich, and then inside the motor itself as well.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC", "Okay. Because rare earth pricing has been increasing for some time. So has it just been the supply chain that's been absorbing it up until now?", "Robert Whitmore", "That's partially true, but I think if you look over the last month or 2 months, it's been dramatically increasing as well. And sorry, I should also mention probably cerium oxide, which is used to polish glass as well. So, there are a lot of different variants of rare earths that are actually integrated.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, it's been increasing for -- I mean, I think we first identified this actually last summer, reemphasized it again in the January call. And I think it's been increasing. I think the acceleration, Rich, in the last 60 days is dramatically greater than the average before that.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC", "Okay. And then in terms of your comment about the technology transitions, your yield and not being able to hit the type of volume you wanted, can you be a little bit more specific about -- is it just the products that you mentioned in the press -- in the prepared remarks, or is it a specific areal density? And when do you expect those issues specifically to go away? Or is it just that the component count will change in the second half and so you get the margin benefit that way?", "Steve Luczo", "Let me just touch on it and then I'll turn it over to Dave or Bob. But I think we're going through, as I think when we've indicated to the investor base, it's a fairly significant transition that's occurring through this calendar year and into next calendar year. And it's related to areal density nodes as well different capacity points across almost our entire product line. So for Seagate, I think it's at least 8 products that we're transitioning over the course of this fiscal year. And ultimately, yes, it's still a component cost at higher capacity, and you have to get through the transition to drive yield. And then I'll let Dave and Bob talk to some more of those, but I think the gross margin implications, all things being equal, is pretty significant in terms of once we get through the transition.", "Robert Whitmore", "So I think the other thing, Rich, that I would add is to the component cost reduction, which are component cap coming down, which when you get through this transition, is very meaningful. It's also, as you push out the product transition, you end up changing the configuration quite a bit, which ends up in materials that are not utilized properly. They're either ending up in scrap or somewhere else that wasn't optimal. So that's what we're suffering through as we go through these transitions right now. That's what we've got to take.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC", "To the best of your knowledge, is the competition facing similar challenges? And do you think that Seagate's still retaining its areal density lead even with the delay?", "Steve Luczo", "I think that depends market segment by market segment, exactly how it breaks down. I think we've got fierce competition in certain areas, and then there's other areas where we're doing quite well. ", "[Technical Difficulty]", "But I think the other thing is there's -- not only competition is transitioning the portfolio wealth that we are, right. No one has the breadth of the portfolio. Again, no one even, across all segments and within chip segments, so I think it's a different animal probably for our competition. I think in general, we feel good about where we are in areal density transition across the portfolio.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman of BMO.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Steve, I wondered if you could just talk about if the TAM's in the range that you've identified for September, just any thoughts on what, at least directionally, the TAM would look like in December. And then also speak to, if you could, I think you said supply/demand was relatively balanced. But if you could speak to what are the constraints out there that you're seeing from your competition, particularly Hitachi, within that overall market environment. And then I have a follow-up, if I could, please.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, I think, let me just -- on the first question, I think we expect December quarter to be greater than September quarter. And my guess is probably in the same kind of growth range of maybe 4% to 5%. And I think that's probably, if you think about what our capital allocation -- and again, big product transition, so I think there's big component challenges as well at those levels even though they may feel lower than people thought the industry could be at a year ago. That was at much different component counts per drives and things like that. So with the average capacity increasing to the extent that we talked about, 40% growth year-over-year, that's obviously chewing up a lot of heads and disks, and the capital was getting pretty tight there and us for one, we told you we're going to be probably at or even below the low end of our capital investment range. So we're trying to manage it to what we see as decent growth and probably establishing a record quarter for the industry and certainly a record quarter in petabytes shipped. But it's not robust, firing on all cylinders. I think until the macroeconomy is settled down globally, right. I think with respect to Hitachi, I don't want to talk too specifically about a competitor. And what I'd rather talk to, I guess, is my observations of living in Asia for 4 months and getting there 3 days before the earthquake happened and pretty -- being pretty intimately involved with that on multiple levels, both personally as well as professionally. I just think that the disruptions on the supply chain side are still going to be probably more difficult than maybe expected. And every day, we still hear about things that are worse than we thought they were. And it's human nature to, I think, be optimistic. And I think it's also -- these are very complex systems that are -- that have been severely disturbed. And with respect to our industry, obviously, it's around fabs and fab capacity and when fabs are coming online and if they do, what yield and how much power are they going to have. And I just think it's still very tenuous and therefore, we still see a fair amount of tightness in certain segments, mostly around notebook, as some of our competitors have shifted their more certain production to probably higher margin opportunities.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Right. But as you look at the opportunity today, Steve, collectively with the industry, the industry can produce that, say, TAM of 165 million to 170 million units in the September quarter?", "Steve Luczo", "I think it can. I think it's tight, but I think it can. I guess it's going to be relatively balanced like I said.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Given the demand upside of the June quarter, can you just talk about why the guidance for September is sub-seasonal? Which product categories are you seeing weaker than seasonal demand? And were there trends at the end of the quarter that drove a more conservative outlook?", "Steve Luczo", "Probably a better question for the IT -- for the computer companies of the world probably than us. I mean, we're obviously responding to what we think customer demand is and keeping our channel inventories at reasonable levels. So I think that's probably better directed towards the PC companies in terms of the growth that we're getting from them, whether or not it's at the server level or at the client level or at the high enterprise system levels. I mean, it's really a reflection of what our customers are telling us in general.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Does your TAM outlook assume that you get inventory back into the 4- to 5-week range?", "Steve Luczo", "No. I don't think we said that. I think we said that we have consistently been under 4 to 6 weeks, and therefore, we're reducing our targets to 4 to 5 weeks. But we still continue to manage our inventories as lean as we can and as lean as also acceptable for our customers.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then just lastly, did any of the yield issues impact your ability to negotiate for more favorable pricing with the OEMs?", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "This is Pat. I'll let Dave comment as well. We were able to hit supply. I mean, we hit the time-to-market metric and get the products out there, but the yield was somewhat costly but we did impact our customers' schedules significantly as much as manifests itself into our P&L for this quarter and probably next.", "Steve Luczo", "I think OEM pricing for the September quarter, and actually with some of our OEMs, we've actually negotiated pricing through the December quarter, has been the most favorable it's probably been in the 20 years I've been in the industry, if I think about percentage changes quarter-to-quarter. So I think there was nothing with respect to ramping our new products that impacted our ability to deliver to our customers because we can obviously deliver old products. It's more of an internal challenge for us of the opportunity of getting into these transitions at the yields that we want, obviously drives a lot more margin for us. So wasn't a pricing issue at all. In fact, pricing, relative to historical norms, has been quite favorable just given the supply/demand challenges that are, as I've mentioned in the first question, I think, that are still somewhat tenuous.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Markowitz of JPMorgan.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Maybe if I could just follow-up on that last point you made, Steve, in terms of OEM pricing has been negotiated through December, I think you said, one the most favorable terms in years. Does that assume then, you've kind of already been able to pass through some of these rare earth metals increases, or is that still a wildcard?", "Steve Luczo", "That's still a wildcard.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And then how should we think about the distribution channel? Because typically, you get a nice benefit when you do put product in there. Are they going to have to bear the cost of these rare earth metals even at a higher rate?", "Steve Luczo", "Again, I don't -- I mean, I don't know whether I can answer it, even given a higher rate. Because our negotiations with our OEMs, like I said, some of them are out one, some of them are out 2 quarters and some OEMs aren't. And so depending on what you've signed up for in terms of volume and commitments on both ends, it has different implications for pricing. And as you point out, the channel is more of a spot market. And if therefore, there are shortages that are either related to increases in demand or shortages in supply or pressures from other areas like rare earth elements, then the spot market would tend to bear that more. Obviously, we have to take into account that our channel partners are working on very thin margins as well, and we have to work together in terms of determining what's the right balance in order to continue to drive demand as we deliver more and more storage for less money, as also well as not getting squeezed on the margin side where we can't invest in R&D and capital.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Sure, understood. Maybe just to come back to -- I guess, historically, have there been instances whereby once you kind of negotiate prices with the OEMs, you can come back to renegotiate? Do we need to see some sort of major demand exceeding supply situation for you to be able to pass on these rare earth metals price...", "Steve Luczo", "We tend not to do that. It's happened in the industry. And I guess for us, I mean, as you know, we have more OEM market share than any of our competitors, I think. Well, maybe not Hitachi, they're pretty OEM-centric as well. But for us, we try and take the longer-term view and we try not to raise prices in our OEMs in quarter if we've made commitments because obviously, they plan their business around that as well. On the other hand, when disruptions happen and we try and work together in terms of cushioning that for both sides so that we can pursue our business opportunities. So I would say that for those customers that have committed, it would be less likely that we would have to come back to them with any sort of increase. If it got absolutely crazy, I think they'd be understanding in saying, \"Yes, we understand what the problem is, and we have to work it together.\"", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And then my other question is just getting back to the TAM. I guess we're kind of all perplexed here by the low seasonal trends for September. Was there something that happened in the first half of the June quarter where maybe that was abnormal or artificially inflated, i.e. hoarding, and that's why you're kind of being cautious here with the outlook?", "Steve Luczo", "No. Again, I don't know that the outlook is all that cautious relative to what a lot of the computer companies are saying, but maybe you have different data.", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "And the other thing, Mark, we did expect the June quarter evenly flat, even some have signaled down and it was up. So I mean...", "Steve Luczo", "I think you have to remember what my initial comments were is that this is also heavily influenced by a lot of uncertainty around global economic conditions. I think it's very dangerous to go talk about a very robust September when 1.5 weeks from now, you may have some real or perceived issue with the U.S. government that might shatter people's confidences or not. And so we're putting a forecast out there that we think is reasonable, given a lot of uncertainty in the world with respect to macroeconomic interlinks. But I don't think it's that inconsistent with what most of the IT industry is saying. And like I said, I mean, I don't know what Intel has said or is going to say, but I don't know that 170 million units is really all that short to what the industry is saying. If it is, you can kind of give me the data that says it is and we'll visit it. It's our best guess right now.", "Operator", "Our next question from comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Stifel Nicolaus.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "A couple of questions as well. First in looking at the results over the last couple of quarters, you guys have consistently provided a guidance of basically flat sequential operating expenses. However, we've seen that surpassed here for 2 quarters in a row by a decent amount. Can you talk to us about why we should think flat or what's going on in the OpEx line that drove the upside this last quarter and just thinking about that, the quarter prior to that even?", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "This is Pat. The OpEx in the first half of the year was not -- did not have a variable comp plan. We did not hit our financial targets, the second half did. And we're planning on the objectives of the first half next year to have that. So that is probably the biggest variant. There's other variants of some level of increased investment either in sales and marketing for penetration, a few areas where we see some opportunistic views that we'll go after and see how we can harvest those and then just some other G&A costs, whether it's a litigation or, if you want to read our footnotes, we have quite a big load next year that may not manifest itself, but we are certainly planning for that level as laid out. The $350 million's pretty solidly underpinned as we see it today, so...", "Steve Luczo", "Yes. I think that the increase is $5 million or $6 million, and it's coming from 4 or 5 different directions. So we'd love to be able to say, \"Well, it's increased investment for geographic expansion and there was a piece of that.\" But the reality is, when you split apart $6 million over $3 billion revenue, it kind of gets -- it's hard to kind of give you a list of stuff when we try to give you a flavor. Probably the litigation expense may be the -- if I had to point to the one single largest piece, it might be related to that. But it's also hard to tell for us whether or not some of these are going to settle or not. So I think we feel pretty good about $350 million right now.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, fair enough. And then on the product transitional points, can you remind us again of where you're at, how you're making these areal density transitions? Were you predominantly leading with your own head technology? I just want to understand. Again, kind of going back to the question of whether this might be a little bit more Seagate-specific relative to the overall industry, if there's any differential being driven by internal versus external usage of heads or other components for that matter.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes. I don't think so, I mean, other than I think in our portfolio on the desktop and in the enterprise, we're clearly ahead of the competition significantly in some cases. And so yes, we're -- it's not just areal density, right, there's performance issues and capacity issues and rotational speed issues. But if you want to boil it all down to areal identity, I suppose we could at some point. But I think for the most part, those are we utilize TDK and Seagate heads, and we don't see any competitive differences across the board so you kind of say Seagate's better or worse. We feel good about where we're at in our head technology and we feel very good about where TDK is. So I think in those 2 segments, it's primarily we're ahead of the game. And because we're ahead of the game, we're probably paying a little bit of a price of what it means to get through the transition. Obviously, the benefit of that is pretty significant once we can get off the yield curve. On notebook, I would say that, that's not the case, and we're certainly probably not ahead of the competition and we're probably not executing as well. And that's certainly still a large opportunity for us. And again, I wouldn't point it towards TDK heads versus RHO [ph] heads. I think it's just an execution issue that we need to address. And part of it is a portfolio that is significantly more complex than our competition in terms of 7-millimeter and 9.5-millimeter, 5400 and 7200. So it's a product portfolio where you're trying to leverage the technology. And obviously, we have our hybrid technology that is another differentiation, but it's also more complexity.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I was just going actually ask that, and that will be my final question. Just update us on where you're at or where your thinking's at with regard to what you've said in the past on hybrid, when we should expect volumes ramping and how we should think about that opportunity or that move from the company.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes. We're still optimistic about it. I still kind of put my 5-year view out there, that I believe for a variety of reasons, the vast majority of our products will be hybrid, whether or not that's NAND flash-related or whether or not that's areal density-related or whether or not that's performance related at the device level or at the system level. I think there's many reasons why hybrid technology is going to be more and more relevant and prevalent. I think more specifically, we continue to have excellent traction with a broader and broader base of OEMs, so I think you'll see systems launching over the course of the next year that are going to incorporate the hybrid technology, especially as we get closer to deploying MLC-based technologies at the client level. That's obviously going to be a price point breakthrough that's going to be -- it's very significant in terms of the ramp on the product. And we feel that we're there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG", "Just a quick clarification to begin with. The TAM guidance of 165 million to 170 million, is that based on what you think the industry can supply, or is that based on your expectations for demand in the calendar third quarter?", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, I'm glad you answered the question, about the same. I mean, I think it's -- again, we'll see what our competition says tomorrow. And our best guess is that's the best TAM. And I wanted to clarify that. And I also think that's about what the industry can supply. If it's higher than that, which if we're wrong and it's 175 million or 180 million because that's what the magic, 8.8% growth rate says on, what, the 2 quarter shipped, then I think the industry is going to be very constrained and it'll show up in September. I think the other thing I'd really like to emphasize, and I'm sorry I didn't in my comments or in the previous question, is the demand is unusual in terms of how it's profiling out this quarter, in that it's very strong in July and August and less visibility in September. And yet, if you look at the last 5 years of shipments by the industry, it's obviously the inverse of that, that July is weaker than August, and August and July are weaker than September by a fair degree. So the fact that it's so front-end loaded can either talk to lack of visibility or other strategies that our customers, or could talk to that yes, the 165 million to 170 million is conservative and that pop is going to happen in September. I think the industry will struggle to feed a lot of that upside, so that would just result in a situation in September that could be certainly challenging from a supply/demand perspective.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay, that's extremely helpful. And then just talking on the product transition issues. I know that you gave a number for the impact to gross margins from the raw material costs, 200 basis points. But can you give us a sense of what type of impact the product transition cost was to gross margins? I mean, you're at 18.8% now. Your long-term target is 22% to 26%. Would you have been in your long-term targets, or do you think you'll be on your long-term targets by the second half...", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, we'll be on our long-term targets, I mean, all things else being equal. But it's another couple of hundred basis points.", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "We'd be in our target margin range as we signaled earlier without the rare earth and we ramped historical. It's not that the late market just ramping is the issue, but if ramped historical, we'd be there. So we clearly see a path to get there, it's been a little longer than we want to get there.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. And then just finally on the notebook products, you mentioned the mix was somewhat negative to the gross margins also. In the past, you talked about your notebook gross margins being lower than your desktop gross margins, that was a couple of years ago. Is that still the case, or would you say they're at parity?", "Steve Luczo", "It's very specific to current market conditions. I mean, we've had periods where our desktop -- our notebook margins are very attractive and other times when they're less so, and it's mostly pricing-related. I think if you look over the last 4 quarters, where price erosion has been the most aggressive it's been in the notebook space. And some of our competitors were very aggressive at certain capacity points and drove margins that were in the mid-20s. If you can actually measure margins that way, which we can get into a longer discussion about how real that is. But if you were to use some consistent application of accounting and said margins were in the mid-20s, those were driven down to certainly sub-double digit. So getting recovery on that as we have in the supply/demand imbalance has been good, but there's still margin levels that are less than the average for the company. And because Seagate was able to respond to upside at those capacity points, mostly 500 gigabytes, it was a good opportunity for a revenue upside that certainly was impressive. But from a margin perspective, it's squeezed margins a bit but added net income. So I think -- I'm not apologizing for it, but it's just part of the description of why the gross margins were impacted more as a result of that upside response.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah of Brean Murray.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC", "So Steve, I guess just for a bit of a clarification on TAM, sounds like you might be suggesting if we got the 4% to 5% sort of industry demand increase in the December quarter, that, that in fact, might be -- end of September quarter came in as you're forecasting, that might be a challenge to meet from the supply perspective.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, I believe that's true.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC", "Okay, great. And there, is there anything, any update you can give us, I guess, regarding sort of European Trade Commission communication? I guess anything you guys have sort of incrementally reached out to them with since they decided to take kind of like a deeper look, I guess, or request more information from you? And just maybe if you can just give us a sense of what your message to them has been through this whole process?", "Steve Luczo", "I mean, we've obviously been actively cooperating with them throughout the entire process, and I don't think that there's been any surprises in that process with respect to either request, reactions or response, timing or engaging with either suppliers, customers, competitors or internally at Seagate. So I think for us, it's been going as expected. It's a healthy process for everyone. And right now, we anticipate that will continue to proceed in a healthy positive manner and get the transaction closed by the end of the year.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC", "Okay, great. And then just one last clarification, if I could. You said the expectation for more normalized yields on the new product transitions are second half of fiscal year '12. So that's first half of, I guess, like the March, March, June quarter of next year?", "Steve Luczo", "That's right. I mean, we're obviously working out transition yields and performance issues right now, but I think in terms of our opportunity to have those contribute in the way that, that Pat mentioned, where we can start seeing benefit at the margin level to get into our targeted range, we would expect it to start at the second half of the year. So we mean starting in the March quarter. Obviously, we're aggressively pursuing.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Scott Craig, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Scott Craig", "Steve, can you give us, maybe give us an update on the SSDs in the enterprise, sort of what you're seeing there from your customers, the transition from Fibre Channel to SATA drives there as well? And then secondly, because you made a lot of product announcements recently in the SSD side and the enterprise, maybe you could just give us your thoughts on how you expect that business to ramp and when we should start seeing a meaningful contribution.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes. I mean, I think on the customer side, the reality is it's for a limited customer base who's using SSDs in the enterprise segment. And I'll let our customers identify who they are, but I think you know who the majority one is and what their success has been. They've been probably leading the charge in terms of defining an architecture, presenting it to their customers and getting good traction. And that's an account that we're not engaged with, with the Fibre Channel drive. We feel good about our technology. We feel good about where we're at on our SAS drives. And obviously, with the relationship with Samsung, we believe that the NAND sourcing and cost side of that is going to be very attractive. So our engagement with our customers certainly has accelerated, both with that agreement as well as getting further down the path on the joint technology development that we have with them, which is this class management engine chip. And in terms of meaningful revenue, I would say that once MLC starts getting incorporated into the devices, which we do feel very confident about the approach that we're taking, I think that's when you're going to start seeing a pretty significant milestone to what I've been saying for a year, which is to me, it's a 2015, 2016 thing, where you could look at that and say there's hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue, sort of somewhere between 5% and 15%, of incremental enterprise business that is associated with SSDs. And I think that's the important point. There's not a disk drive in the world that, say, that can do what an SSD does. So it's not replacing disk drives, it's basically opening up new applications other than group drives, which I think happened 3 years ago. So yes, I feel good about where we're at. I still think it's an opportunity that Seagate, and I guess I'll now characterize it as Seagate and Samsung jointly, are going to pursue in a way that's going to be tough to have a better product than.", "Scott Craig", "And then just a follow-up on the CapEx. Sounds like you're going to drop it here below the sort of normal targeted range. How long do you think that goes on? And then where are the priorities when you're looking at the CapEx over the next couple of quarters? And that's it for me.", "Steve Luczo", "Well, I think, for us, as we get to a -- I did a big -- we did a big reorganization a few months ago. And one of the big focuses on the reorg was to split the R&D function from the operating function, and within those areas, start to be rethinking how we deploy capital throughout the manufacturing side as opposed to by component, either with heads or disks or drives. And through that, I think that we've seen that we have some efficiencies that can be had. Maybe you could say that inversely, that maybe we have overinvested in some capital historically that maybe wasn't being as efficiently utilized as we think it can be now. And I think it's a decent amount, call it 5%, call it 10%, I think there's that amount in capital efficiency there that we can go attack. And Dave's off doing that. I'll have him talk more to it. And a lot of it is also this issue around complexity in the portfolio and then complexity of what we're doing in terms of how we're running our products in our factories that will basically ultimately yield a lot better capital improvement. So I think it's a big opportunity for us, to basically reduce that capital on a sustained basis and drive a lot more output with the smaller capital footprint. Where I worry about constraints? Historically, I probably would've said heads, depending again if areal density keeps -- petabyte shipments continue to grow at 40% year-over-year, and I think most people in the industry would say that aerial density is somewhere in the 25% range right now. And until you get a hammer deployment or whatever the next big generation is to boost areal density, the only way you can solve that problem is with more heads in disks. So I would historically have said probably heads. I'm starting to think probably more disks now, and I'll let Dave talk to that as well. But certainly it's the component level, not the drive level. And I think that's probably the bigger message, right. And we can argue at the margin as a constraint, first going to happen at wafer or slider or HSA, but I think it's at the component level. And if there's a marginal shift in my thinking, it's probably away from heads and towards media. But I think with -- at 40% areal density growth -- I mean, 40% petabyte growth and 25% areal density growth, if you show some macroeconomic recovery on top of that, there's going to be some challenges on the component side, and those are 9- to 12-month lead times on capital. So it's not something that will get resolved overnight. And I don't think it's something that the industry is going to lean into because all of us are operating at margin structures below our targeted range.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland of Baird.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Steve, just a clarification. I'm not sure if I understood the comment on earth-based commodity costs being more of a short-term concern than a long-term concern.", "Steve Luczo", "Well, I think we'll see how this thing plays out, and there's obviously a lot of dynamics going on that are certainly not in the conversations that I'm involved with, right. But I mean, the reality is it doesn't appear that there's a true supply constraint here. There's a lot of dynamics around owners of rare earth materials and processors of rare earth materials and who is controlling inventories at what level, as opposed to there's fundamentally some shortage. If there was fundamentally a shortage, then I would think that the fact that price is supposedly representing supply and demand. If you effectively reduce supply or enormously increase demand, that would mean that there's a sustained increase in price. I think this feels a little bit like a bubble. We went through it with ruthenium, I guess, in 2006, when there was a massive spike and it lasted 6 months and it settled down. Now did it settle down at levels higher than maybe it was originally? Yes, but it certainly wasn't anywhere near the spike level, like a factor of 10, is what the spike level was. So I think our point is that right now, since it doesn't feel like there's a fundamental supply issue, that it probably works itself out. And by the way, if these prices stay high, guess what, there's a bunch of U.S.-based mines that are going to come online again, and it will solve itself. It's not like the stuff doesn't exist. It's just that a lot of mines were closed down when the prices fell below $75, whatever the magic price is, and we're well above that right now. So I don't think it's a long-term issue. On the other hand, having a piece of something go up that's hitting in your margins by 200 basis points at a relatively short bit of time is not a lot of fun either, and we need to figure out how to address that.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Okay. A question on Samsung also. Have you been able to do anything from a pre-integration planning perspective so far?", "Steve Luczo", "No. I mean, obviously, we're under regulatory review and regulatory process. There's lots of conditions around what we can and can't do, and there's some limited planning that you can do, and there's some limited -- more limited due diligence that you can do. All I want to comment is that to the extent that we have been able to get a deeper look into the resources or the technology or the products, we've really been favorably impressed, and I think this is going to be really significant for Seagate.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Okay. Last question for me on Toshiba. And maybe this is too early to ask given supply chain constraints, but I'm wondering if you have or if you think you'll see actions from your PC OEM customers that would indicate a willingness to make Toshiba a stronger player in the industry eventually?", "Steve Luczo", "No. I mean, I think our customers care about supply, but I mean, I don't think they're going try and make Toshiba stronger. I mean, I think -- look, if the WD-Hitachi merger is approved, that's going to be an extremely powerful competitor that has a lot of revenue and deep technology, and they're going to drive areal density and product performance. And we all know the cost curves that we need to hit to deploy demand. Seagate's obviously been in that position for a while. We continue to make our company better, we hope. And it takes a lot of capital and a lot of R&D. If the Toshiba Corporation decides that disk drives is an area to allocate capital and expense to, then they'll be another supplier. But I don't think our customers are going to do that. It's going to come from our competitors, whether or not you have competitive technology and products. And this isn't an easy science. And it's a science that's getting tougher. And therefore, capital and R&D is a competitive advantage and we're at scale. And Hitachi and WD, if that merger goes through, will be at scale as well and Toshiba will be less so. And if you kind of look at that scenario, I think it would tend to say that they'll have a tougher road. But could they decide they want to invest $5 billion and get serious in the drive business? I don't know enough about Toshiba Corp. to know if that's the reality or not. But I've got enough to worry about with Seagate and [indiscernible] ", "All right. I just want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. And we do look forward to speaking with you next quarter. And of course, I want to make sure that we thank all of our employees and our customers and our suppliers for another good quarter.

My name is Francine, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. ", "This conference call contains forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements related to the company's future operating and financial performance in the December 2011 quarter and thereafter and include statements regarding customer demand for disk drives and general market conditions. These forward-looking statements are based on information available to Seagate as of the date of this conference call, but are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements. ", " ", "Such risks, uncertainties and other factors may be beyond the company's controls, in particular, global economic conditions and significant disruption to the industry's supply chain from the severe flooding throughout parts of Thailand may pose a risk to the company's operating and financial performance. Information concerning additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's annual report on Form 10-K and Form 10-K/A, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 17, 2011 and August 24, 2011, respectively.  ", "These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the company's views as of any subsequent date, and Seagate undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to the effect of events or circumstances after the date they were made. ", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Steve Luczo, CEO. Please go ahead, sir.", "Steve Luczo", "Thank you, Francine. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me from Seagate are Pat O'Malley, our Chief Financial Officer; Bob Whitmore, our Chief Technology Officer; Dave Mosley, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Rocky Pimentel, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer. ", "I first want to convey my heartfelt condolences and the condolences of the entire Seagate family to those affected by the tragedy in Thailand. This disaster has taken hundreds of lives and displaced thousands. Human impact is profoundly troubling. Our first thoughts and actions were for the safety and security of our employees, their families and all personally affected. I will provide further context on the situation in Thailand and its effects on Seagate at the end of my prepared remarks. ", "We have posted detailed supplemental information about our fiscal first quarter on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com. In today's call, I will review the results for the September quarter, share progress on the Samsung transaction and provide our view of the fiscal second quarter, including an update of our Thailand operations. After that, we'll open up the call to Q&A. ", "On our last earnings call in July, we cautioned that our outlook for the first quarter was influenced by the following: the significant uncertainty surrounding global macroeconomic conditions; increasing cost of many upstream materials, especially rare earth elements; and higher costs associated with newer, less mature products. ", "We expected the industry TAM to be 165 million to 170 million units, Seagate's revenue to be up sequentially to approximately $2.9 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.29 to $0.33 per share. For the September quarter, the industry TAM was approximately 177 million units, which was above our expected range. Seagate reported revenue of $2.8 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.34. ", "We shipped 50.7 million units during the quarter, and our gross margin was 19.5%. We ended the quarter with $3 billion in cash. Revenue was slightly below our outlook for the September quarter, and we managed cost effectively, while optimizing our product mix to slightly exceed our margin and non-GAAP earnings per share projection. ", "We lost approximately 3 points of market share on the September quarter for 3 primary reasons: one, we elected to not participate in aggressive pricing in the mission-critical market especially at a time when we were attempting to pass through cost associated with the rare earth increases; two, in the notebook market, we raised prices based on anticipated demand. However, these price increases unexpectedly dampened demand for our notebook products; and three, aggressive pricing in the Asia distribution channel caused us to lose some share, which was offset by gains in North America. ", "Macroeconomic issues particularly surrounding the Eurozone debt crisis continue to create a high degree of volatility for global demand and resulted in additional stress on consumer confidence and spending in general. Despite these issues, the HDD industry shipped a record 177 million units and continued its record 45% year-over-year petabyte growth, reflecting the sustained fundamental demand for hard drive storage. ", "As expected, the cost of the components using rare earth metals are 5x to 8x higher than historical norms and impacted our gross margin by approximately 100 basis points, as compared to the June quarter. Rare earth price increases impact mission-critical products more acutely due to the relatively larger amounts of rare earth elements used in those products. Our effort to pass through temporary rare earth surcharges to our customer to offset these cost increases was largely unsuccessful due to aggressive pricing from a competitor in the mission-critical market. ", "We expect an incremental impact to cost of goods in the December quarter, as the cost increases are fully absorbed throughout the supply chain. Recently, prices for rare earth metals have abated about 20% from peak levels. Assuming no further increases from today's prices, we expect some relief in cost of goods for rare earth metals in the March quarter since these price changes tend to take over 1 quarter to work their way through the supply chain. ", "Regarding our discussion last quarter on product transitions being slower than planned, recall we are transitioning 8 products in fiscal 2012. As indicated last quarter, 2 of the most substantial product transitions targeted for early in the fiscal year were pushed to the second half of fiscal year 2012. With respect to the 2 products, component and drive yields improved on the 300 gigabyte per platter 2.5-inch mission-critical product line, and we will begin an aggressive ramp in the December quarter. ", "The 1 terabyte per platter 3.5-inch desktop drive also lagged behind our initial plans and is now beginning the volume transition. We expect to ship millions of units on this platform by the end of the quarter. 7 of the 8 platforms are industry-leading products, and as such, we continue to expect significant margin accretion with these product transitions by the fiscal fourth quarter. ", "With respect to the Samsung transaction, we are pleased to report that the European Commission has approved our transaction, concluding that Seagate's proposed acquisition of Samsung's hard drive assets does not raise competitive concerns in the region. We are continuing to work with the regulatory agencies and other jurisdictions to reach the same conclusion. The European Commission's decision to end this investigation is a significant step in closing the  proposed acquisition, which Seagate anticipates to occur before the end of the calendar year. ", "Demand supply agreement and cross licensing agreements with Samsung have been executed. We expect to execute the HDD supply agreement with Samsung in the near future. Provided we receive all necessary regulatory approvals, we expect to begin integration of Samsung's HDD business during the March 2002 (sic) [2012] quarter and to complete the operational integration by the end of the calendar year. ", "Importantly, upon completion of the acquisition, our product portfolio will include a market-leading notebook product from Samsung that delivers 500 gigabytes per platter in 1 and 2 disc configurations. We believe this is the industry's leading notebook platform, shipping approximately 4 million units in the September quarter. ", "With respect to our December quarter outlook, the flood disaster in Thailand is having a widespread impact in individuals and businesses of all types, including the hard drive industry, disrupting transportation, logistics, power generation and the availability of labor. ", "Specific to the hard drive industry, this is a serious and highly volatile situation, which has shut down component manufacturers, as well as drive assembly operations in the flooded region. The severity of the impact on the component manufacturers and drive assembly operations range from inundated factories and submerged equipment at one extreme or the inability to get people into the workplace on the other. ", "Seagate's component and drive assembly factories in Thailand are operational, accessible to all our employees and are running at full production. As previously reported, this is not the case for some of our component suppliers. Our business priority is to work with our external component suppliers, supporting their efforts to rebuild the supply chain as quickly as possible. We expect to experience significant impacts to our production levels, while our suppliers work together businesses up and running. ", "Given the severity of the situation and the expense of supply constraints caused by the disruption, including those described by our primary competitor, the effects on our industry are likely to be substantial and will extend over multiple quarters. As we strengthen our supply chain and optimize our output, we are engaged with customers to realign build schedules, product mix and to reset delivery expectation. Prior to the flood, our TAM expectations for the December quarter was unconstrained demand for 180 million units, and Seagate expected to regain the market share lost in the September quarter. ", "Based on our current assessment of the external component supply chain, we expect to ship between 40 million and 50 million units in the December quarter. Given the volatility in the supply chain, which will impact mix and volume, we cannot provide a meaningful revenue estimate at this time. ", "As noted already, our production is not constrained by either internal components supply or by our ability to assemble finished product. Rather, we are constrained by the availability of specifically -- of specific externally-sourced components. If these component constraints are resolved result by the end of the December quarter, we expect to exit the quarter with a production capacity of at least 60 million units for the March quarter, excluding any additional capacity from the Samsung acquisition. Assuming no component constraints, we would expect additional capacity of at least 10 million units associated with the Samsung acquisition. ", "Finally, relative to our dividend policy, it remains unchanged from when we established our dividend in April. The board and the management team have confidence in the company's ability to generate free cash flow on a continued basis, and the quarterly dividend reflects the strength of our balance sheet. ", "Francine, we're now ready to open up the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", ".", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jayson Noland from Robert Baird.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Maybe if you could talk more about your -- where you are with Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers in the supply chain and your handle on the situation right now.", "Steve Luczo", "And obviously in any of these answers we give you, you know it's been stated in the Safe Harbor and other comments, we are trying to be as transparent as we can here and give the best information that we have right now. But as you might imagine, it's been a daily event. The teams have been pretty much working 20 hours a day for the last 14 days. And bear with us, we're going to give you the best information we can right at this moment. I'm going to turn that question over to Dave Mosley because he's been most deeply involved with what we're doing with our supply chain in our factories.", "William David Mosley", "Yes, so Jason, my question -- sorry, my response to the question would start with the impact at the start, which is over 10 days ago now, of some factories. We've been able to assess some of those factories with the sub-suppliers. And the problem is that as time has gone by, there's been more and more impacts to the supply chain, different parts. So as you can well imagine, it's a fairly complex problem that just continues even until now. There continues to be disruptions to people who are actually doing the assessment because the region is still quite disrupted. Peoples homes are affected. They can't get in to certain regions, so it's quite tentative at this point. That's how we've come up with the expectations that we laid out before about mix given the impact that we have in this region, for the factories that we have in that region, for the factories that we have globally. We have second sources in some cases for some products. But it's still a very highly volatile situation, as you can well imagine, not knowing exactly what we're going to get 4 or 6 weeks from now based on a lot of assumptions about how fast people can or can't come back from some of these challenges.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then last question for me on the mission-critical side. Is there a chance that we've seen a reset on the profitability level of those drives given there's a new competitor out there?", "Steve Luczo", "Who's the new competitor?", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "We've got Western Digital.", "Steve Luczo", "Well, I mean, they're buying Hitachi. I mean, I guess I don't view them as a new competitor if that merger goes through. So I think, the mission-critical space has been competitive for a long time, and Seagate really tends to differentiate itself with the breadth of the portfolio. When we get long in a portfolio and we're transitioning new products, like we are now, is clearly where customers are maybe more willing to sell a share, if you will. But that's why it's so critical for us to continue with these transitions to the next generation. And as we do them, we believe we can regain the market share to the levels of good condition [ph] which are 58% to 62%.", "Operator", ".", "Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I guess, the first question is on just looking at the acquisition of Samsung. Obviously, the EU has approved that. Where do we stand with the FTC? And as far as the EU is concerned, were there any remedies or remedial things that you guys had to do to basically getting that deal done?", "Steve Luczo", "I'm going to let Ken Massaroni answer the question.", "Kenneth M. Massaroni", "We're working cooperatively with the regulators at the FTC and other jurisdictions around the globe, and we're comfortable that we're being responsive promptly to their request for information and that we're on track to close the transaction before the end of the calendar year.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And as it relates to your comments on the supply chain, are you telling us that it is your expectation at this point that the supply chain should be back to production levels by the end of December? I guess, I just want to understand what the message here is. Is that you -- do you fully anticipate everything to be back online and therefore, operating at a $60 million full capacity run rate in March?", "Steve Luczo", "First of all, there were no remedies on the EU question. No, I think what we're seeing is the disruption in the supply chain is kind of multi-threaded and either certain component suppliers just can't get to their building. But we believe the factories are dry and ready to produce once people can get there. Others obviously have damaged the equipment. And some of those are longer lead time and shorter lead time and some of those, their second sources are not. I think that at this point, it's unlikely to assume that everything will be back to normal by the end of December, although, I don't think it's improbable that parts will be flowing in the month of December to a much superior degree than they will be when parts stop arriving sometime at factory doors some time in the next 3 weeks. And so I think as that recovers, the point is Seagate doesn't have factories affected. And so we can start taking those parts and start building drives as quickly as possible.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And then final question...", "Steve Luczo", "And then we have now a level of productive capability, which obviously could change as a bunch of mix, which is what we're working for our customers on, is the ways that we can basically even increase that output by working with them on mix.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And the final question for me is what is the lingering overhang on the gross margin related to rare mineral costs going into this next quarter?", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley", "The next quarter we have talked about is increasing another 100 basis points. So we have about 200 basis points that we look at this quarter and then it should abate if -- depending on where assumptions, where the prices are today, if they don't go back up. So in March quarter, we should start getting relief from that, which was better than what we thought in September quarter. But that 200 basis points that we talked last quarter is fully going to be baked in.", "Steve Luczo", "Just think of it this way, there's a one quarter lag to what's happening in pricing in the rare earths and how it is to the drive industry. So the rare earth prices were increasing all through the September quarter and didn't start abating until the December quarter. And if you would factor the June quarter, they were not rising the entire time or certainly not at the rate that they were in the September quarter. So the September quarter for us was a big hit, the December quarter will be a full impact, if you will. And starting in the March quarter is when we'll start seeing the reactions in the spot market today.", "Operator", ".", "And our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele from Needham and Co.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Just want to touch on 2 different areas. One, in terms of looking at margins in the first half of next year, I mean, you've got rare earths likely to come down because of the lag. You got utilization clearly maximized, so price diminished. At least according to car checks, prices are going up. So at least in terms of 2012, should we think about a different type of gross margin profile? Any comments you can make there?", "Steve Luczo", "Richard, I think right now like we said, I mean, if we can make a revenue prediction, we could probably make a gross margin prediction, right? I think it's a pretty volatile situation right now and really all of the dynamics you just described are recurring, and they kind of started like what that means, to think it's just something that's more appropriate to do in a few weeks when we have a better visibility on what our output, our mix and our volume's going to be. I don't disagree with the general statements that you're making. And yes, we believe that they're multi-quarter and certainly they extend into the first half of the year, and I believe likely to the end of the calendar year.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then secondly, in terms of your footprint. We're getting asked all kinds of questions, as you would imagine, about how your footprint might differ in terms of component supplier versus WD and others. Is there anything you can just talk about, how you structured it and how maybe even Samsung's footprint is different and why it has affected you less?", "Steve Luczo", "Well, starting at the drive level, I mean, the company's drive factories, as you know, are in China and in Thailand. And where we're at in Thailand is where we have the flooding situation. Our wafer facilities are in Minnesota and in Springtown. And so we're -- we have 2 wafer facilities. Our slider facilities are Penang and Korat  in Thailand. So 2 slider facilities, and media is in Singapore. R&D capabilities are in Minnesota, Colorado, Fremont, Springtown and Shewsbury, Massachusetts and in Singapore. So we've got a pretty diverse base on the development side as well. So I think from the kind of factory and the development side of it and I think, on the sourcing side, I'll let Dave talk to it. I mean, as you know, we've, I think, articulated our belief that we have a pretty deep and robust and strategic supply chain, which is one of the reasons why we feel that as soon as parts  start flowing we're going to achieve some of the output goals that we mentioned earlier. Dave?", "William David Mosley", "Rich, I talked about the complexity a little earlier on all of our products. We have 25, roughly, product lines that are going. Some of them, from a mechanical standpoint, have numerous different configurations, largely capacity-based. So the supply chain that feeds that is there's some places like in our China factories, for example that are specific to China. There's numerous other suppliers in different locations as well. And that's something that we're going to have to factor through the impact with the suppliers that are in the affected region. This is very substantial to us, very substantial to our whole industry. And that's where, we're focusing our concern. But we do have some opportunities to move equipment. We have some opportunities to keep lines going that are in unaffected regions and thus disciplined up mix, that's why we have to rework the mixture that the customers are getting, what we can build and what they need outside of these things together. So it's going to be a very volatile quarter.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "And most of the Samsung stuff comes through TDK, correct?", "William David Mosley", "Yes. Sorry, Richard, I'm  didn't mean to avoid that question, yes.  I mean, Samsung, is generally -- doesn't have internal components. And again, I want to stress that we produce some of the internal components, slider wafer, slider and media. We have productive capacity, and we feel good about our ability to flow those parts, which will, I think, tie into when other parts of the supply chain are available, that we're going to be probably best positioned to take advantage of that to provide output. With respect to Samsung, they're obviously not vertically integrated like we are. However, a lot of their supply chain is in Korea. Although they do depend on certain parts out of Thailand as does everyone. And yes, they do have a strong relationship with TDK in terms of the outsourcing of the [indiscernible] .", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Shebly Seyrafi.", "Shebly Seyrafi - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division", "So it looks like in the December quarter, the impact from rare earth is going to be more muted. If you hit the high end of your 40 million to 50 million, it's going to be roughly flat financially. Pricing according to checks have gone up maybe 10% to 20% in the past week alone. So why wouldn't you have a meaningful improvement in your gross margin in the December quarter?", "Steve Luczo", "I don't know, that we didn't say we would. I mean, that's for the analysts to determine. All we said is what the rare earth impact would be against whatever the gross margin is.", "William David Mosley", "And clearly part of this is aligning for the mix of our customers. We certainly have to do that. So there's a big range of outcomes on there and we're working closely with our customer to see what they want us to maximize, and we will work with them. But certainly, directionally, everything you say is in that way, but given we're talking a 10 million range of units we certainly have a wide range of outcomes.", "Shebly Seyrafi - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And can you also talk about opportunities to gain share? Clearly, I think you will gain share in the next few quarters. But can you talk about the opportunities for these share gains to linger over the next several years? Basically, how can you take advantage of the situation?", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, I mean, I hate to use the words take advantage as much as we're obviously going to try and respond to the customer needs that are out there and also, the supplier needs that are out there. What we're really doing is trying to align our capabilities, which are pretty substantial with the suppliers that we have partnerships with and that need our help to regain footing, as well them delivering the maximum amount of products to our customers. And the customer dialogue, as you might imagine, given the description of the impact to the industry, given by Western Digital yesterday, has been one of desire to align for certainly an extended period of time. We've had customer calls with several strategic customers and several large customers in both the OEM field, as well as the distribution field that are willing to do multi-quarter alignment with Seagate.", "Shebly Seyrafi - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And last one for me, have you discussed specifically the key components which are most constrained in your view affecting Seagate?", "Steve Luczo", "We can do it a little bit. I'll let Dave touch on that. Obviously, we're not going to talk about specifics in terms of companies or anything like that. But to you give an idea where some of the constraints are so you can get a sense of this, through your own work, you see us the lead below [ph] as you can get a sense of when we can address the market opportunity. I think that's fair.", "William David Mosley", "This is Dave. And I think it's very specific to product lines timing based on the amount of inventory we had in certain chains. It's also very dependent upon second sources or in some cases, dual sites that individual component vendors had and then the amount of reaction that's happened. During the past, there's been some factories that have been able to respond differently than others, just based on a lot of logistics issue. So it's a pretty complicated equation, obviously. I think they tend to the biggest impacts tend to be around our ability to build headstocks for all the subcomponents where headstocks can -- in particular, there are a lot of mechanical piece part vendors in these regions that we're going to have to go to get a solution as we try to put the supply chain back together.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Given the share loss in enterprise this quarter and the higher margin in that category, is there any reason why you wouldn't do everything to protect or to maximize the production in that segment so that you can manage those long-term relationships with enterprise customers and maximize mix and margins in the near term, as well as your ability to take back share? Or are there limitations, as it relates to needs in other segments, that would force you to not shift production in that direction?", "Steve Luczo", "No, again, I think the issues around share and enterprise are more related to us continuing to ramp our new product line. The breadth of our portfolio is significantly more extensive than our next biggest competitor. And as long as we get the portfolio out there, then we'll gain the share that we need. I think in terms of how we allocate our productive resources, Katy, that's clearly going to be a function of, again, working with our suppliers and then working with our customers to see how we can optimize what they're trying to solve right now, not what we're trying to solve. Seagate is going to do fine through this in terms of being able to make drives and ballpark. So I think to me, it's a question of how do we mix that for our customers, and obviously, our customers drive a lot of margin from enterprise. They drive a lot of margin from newer line and business-critical. They drive a lot of margin from high capital, so all areas that have been hit very hard. So obviously, yes, we're going to be mixing in that area. But it's really to optimize with our customers and with their suppliers.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. Have you thought yet about whether you're willing to order new equipment and take on more capacity if in a few months you believe that the issues that your competitors will last and you have an opportunity to take even more market share than what you could take given the March quarter capacity?", "Steve Luczo", "Yes. Again, I think the issue as we get more definition around what the constraints are and what the longer-term impacts are with the industry structurally, then we can make those decisions. Right now, we're, obviously, just trying to solve equations for our customers and suppliers in the December quarter. And then we're extending those conversations in terms of the first half of the year and in some cases for the calendar year. With the assets that we have, we have -- we do have capacity, and we do have the ability to drive more capacity to yield improvement depending on what our mix is. And so that's our first order of focus and then alignment with our customers on that. And when one of it looks like there's sustained shortfalls off of that, then we'll it consider after this.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean Murray.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "Steve, I guess, just going back in sort of around the topic of potential mix of capacity this quarter, maybe next quarter, depending on components. Do guys have a visibility to tell if you have access to sort of the mix of components you need to, I guess, give you generous capacity around what you guys and your customers ultimately choose what they want? Or are you sort of -- I mean, is there sort of a ceiling to what you could do on enterprise or a ceiling to what you could do on PCs?", "Steve Luczo", "I'm going to let Dave answer the question. I'm not sure I quite understood it. So if you did, Dave ...", "William David Mosley", "Here's the way I see it. We have ceilings, so to speak, on our production capabilities for some of those different product lines. But I think the nature of this problem and the vendors that impacted, are the wide swath of different parts. So the various impacts for the different product lines is pretty broad. I would say that -- and we can't shift for a lot more enterprise, for example, versus what our production capacity is for ourselves internally. The question really is, what do the end customers need and then what can the suppliers produce. And those are the 2 ends of the supply chain that we're going to have struggle to tie together. And I think, that's going to be a very dynamic question especially because we can't get a sense in some of the impacts. Some of the sub-supplier factories just occurred literally in the last 72 hours, so we continue assessing the very dynamic situation, and we're going to have to figure out and shift our capacity to it and the boundaries of what our manufacturing capability is very quickly.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "That's quite helpful. And just follow-up for me. I guess, in terms of absolute units of PC drives that seem to be out there sort of in the collective distribution channel and I guess, plus any comments you might have about what brokerage you're holding. Is there any estimate you can give us as we try to get our arms around what the actual impact to the PC production might be in the coming months?", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, I think, it's just hard to speculate. There wasn't a lot of inventory in the OEM hubs. There wasn't a lot of inventory in the channel when, as you might imagine, all of that has been filled in the last 48 hours. So I think the impacts are really probably going to be expelled in about 4 or 5 weeks. And this is going to be a function of really when are we able to basically start shipping drives again and at what volume in terms -- it's going to have to skew in the quarter. I think, it's the complexity. So we're obviously building drives today and shipping drives, and we're going to be able to do that for -- at capacity, for a couple more weeks. And then we'll start being impacted and then how quickly we can recover, again, if it turns out that we're having access to parts in December then we're going to build as many drives as we can in December. And hopefully, our customers can incorporate those in the channel, might be able to take them later in the quarter and the OEMs clearly even a little earlier on the quarter. And that's another thing we're trying to optimize right now. But again, I think the bigger issue is really the impact in the first 6 months of the year, as much as this is an issue about December. Given the structural issues that we described yesterday, I think, in certain way you're right, that this quarter is actually cushioned a bit by -- we have product that was on boats. I mean, WD described that they actually had actually put a greater-than-normal product into finished goods and onto the boats, although obviously been able to draw down from that in the next couple of weeks. And so -- but then given structural impact to the productive capability, I think, the real issue is around March and June. And that's what we're really lining up for as much as we can.", "Operator", ".", "Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Barclays Capital.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just a couple here. I wanted to ask you specifically about motors. It would seem like that would be the big bottleneck here. Did you find something out over the last 48 hours that plenty of motors could be available for you to do 40 million to 50 million drives and then have units up sequentially in the March quarter?", "Steve Luczo", "I think we're staying in tight contact with all suppliers that we have and watching all aspects of the supply chains that they have. So I wouldn't say there's any real new news in the last 24 to 48 hours.", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley", "Ben, this is Pat. The other thing is that the motor suppliers, not all in Thailand, as well. There's other diversified supply chain so as given that Steve talked about rare earth, with us  being China, we have some flex there. So there's going to be tightness there. But I don't think there's any new found parts. It's just we're optimizing how we use what's there and what factory it comes from.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Then with regard to -- Western Digital talked about some special charges, as well as some special expenses, to expedite materials. And there's also other things going on behind the scenes. I'm sure even at your place, even though your plants are operational, is there any special charges? Any increased OpEx over the next quarter or 2 that you can project that result from this? Or is it business -- more business as usual the way it will flow out in the P&L?", "Steve Luczo", "Yes I mean maybe incrementally, but nothing that we're calling out right now.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then I just got to ask you again. I mean, the gross margin guidance or I guess you don't have official, but it sounds like that you're saying the gross margin could be up sequentially in the December quarter. And I just want to make sure that, that's clear. I just -- what gross margin should we model? It sounds like you are open to the idea that it could be up sequentially due to the better mix of enterprise and some share gains even on lower volume.", "Steve Luczo", "I think, you're going how to model that depending on if we can build 40 or 50. We just gave you a range based on what we know today and told you that it's likely subject to change, which means -- obviously, a 20% range is a pretty big range, which means it could even go in or out of that range. So I think it's hard to say at 50 million units. That's a completely different answer at 40 million units given the absorption associated with the additional 10 million units. So I'm not trying to be cagey or not transparent, but it's just that's how dynamic the situation is right now.", "William David Mosley", "Yes, multi-variance equation there. And as you get up to that 50 million, everything that everyone's characterized, short supply demand and balance, those things certainly pushing margin upwards, and that would imply that we can hit the mix our customers want and keep our factories full. That's a very good equation. In 40 million depending on what that mix is, when it comes there may be period expenses that just can't cover. So as Steve said, we're not trying to be less than clear. It's  just when you're talking 40 million, it's a much different outcome than 50 million.", "Operator", ".", "And our next question comes from the line of Scott Craig from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Steve, I think some people are a little confused by the 40 million to 50 million number from the standpoint where -- what sort of impact are you expecting on your Thailand operations? In other words, what's the output there that you could do? And what sort of assumptions are you making there? And I know there's a lot of moving parts because you're assuming to gain some share in other spots and then you've got other factories that can fill. But I think that 40 million to 50 million number has kind of caught people by surprise based on some e-mails I've gotten already. So maybe start there, and then I have one follow-up.", "Steve Luczo", "Okay. Well, I think, again, the 40 million to 50 million is not contingent upon what the factories can do, whether they're in Thailand or China. We have 2 drive factories in China, and we have one drive factory in Thailand. We also have complemented factories in Thailand that can continue to manufacture. The 40 million or 50 million is contingent upon how much, and what mix of supply, that we can actually get of complements that are coming from these many, many affected factories. And some of those factories are still impacted today. They can't -- there would be assumptions about how fast they come back up or wide, and they're assumptions. Some of them will need the water to recede. Some of stop still being damaged today. Some of them have different levels of equipment damaged. So I think this is very volatile situation right now and expecting accuracy on some of that is just very.. .", "William David Mosley", "I think, the implied question is why is your number so high relative to WD. I think you need to understand that WD's number's, as best we understand their business, is being driven by a super set of slider -- lack of slider.  So regardless of what they're -- well, if you could say it a different way, if they had a full access to slider, what their number would be would probably likely be much higher than 22 to 26 shipped. And that would include, we're assuming, whatever was in the inventory. So that's a hard constraint that they have, that they know that they can't resolve this quarter. And hopefully, that we're working to resolve in the next couple of quarters as you indicated. Seagate doesn't have that type of part constraint either on the factory side, which -- they also some have on the factory side. As has Toshiba and marginally, Hitachi because they can't get people to work. And we don't have another component side other than non-captive components. And so for us, it's a bunch of our assumptions based on our conversations to date with our key suppliers about what parts we think we can get when.", "Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up. Steve, from a long-term margin basis when you look at the mission-critical enterprise business, is there any concern there from what you saw this quarter from a longer-term basis that, that market is potentially less profitable as other competitors, maybe ramp up a little bit there from -- and try and gain market share?", "Steve Luczo", "Again, it's always been a highly competitive market, and whenever you're in a product cycle where we're transitioning, if TAM wasn't growing aggressively and that competitor decided to use that as an opportunity to make -- to take market share. If you want to be aggressive on price and buy market share and it's in a cycle where the customers are willing to do that, then you can do that. Is that a sustained way to take market share? Not really. That's why we're convinced that as long as we keep our heads down, and deal with this new programs, which are making good progress that, that portfolio is what the enterprise customer wants. And it's part of the portfolio that we think we can, again, return to what we believe is the kind of balanced market share of kind of 58% to 62%, which then, obviously, allows our customers to diversify their supply base with 1 or 2 other suppliers in the form of Hitachi or Toshiba, who are both very good suppliers.", "William David Mosley", "The mission-critical business still drives enormous margin for our customers, and they're highly-valued products that have to have certain liability and quality service features that basically take more to develop. They take more to test, and they take more to service the operating side of supporting an enterprise business goes well beyond the gross margin side. Which is the point we continue to make. And one of the reasons our operating model is different than people going into the enterprise, it takes a lot more to support that.", "Operator", ".", "And our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Steve, is the demand side of the equation in December -- you talked about 180 million units. If you -- what's your perspective on what the collective supply side is? You heard WD's numbers last night, we have yours. But any guesses or views on against that 180 million demand, what the industry can generate this quarter?", "Steve Luczo", "Not really, because we really don't have a good view into what's going on with Toshiba, other than they've said that their factory is closed and I believe they said wet. One of Hitachi's factories is closed, and again, it just depends how long are they kept away from building drives even if parts are starting to show up. That's kind of very difficult to say right now.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. But let me try the second part against that. Whatever number it comes about for this December quarter, based on your comments will there be greater production capabilities, you think, in the March quarter, flat down or up relative to whatever occurs in December?", "Steve Luczo", "Well, as you know, that's a really interesting question because if you're talking about Seagate, Samsung,  currently we indicated up by a fairly substantial amount. I think with Toshiba and Hitachi, it's harder to say. My sense is Hitachi would be up just because, from what we understand, the factory has not been affected by water. So it's just a function of getting people back to work. Not an easy task by the way, but it is certainly a lot easier than drying off equipment first. Toshiba, I think, I don't know. It's just hard for me to speculate, so let's just say it's flat. And then, I think, the WD question is  better for them to answer but like I indicated if they lost slider fab and they're working through inventories and right now, I think, that's, I think, a question for them to answer. But that number could actually go down, I suppose. Depending on how they fill that gap, and obviously, they're over -- they're doing everything they can. I'm sure with regard to how get HTA and HSA and slider output. And it's a strong, good, well-executing company, and I won't underestimate their ability to recover. It's better for them to answer but it's hard to say.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And then the difference in March would be presumably all the collective industry would have used up their inventory buffer. Well,  the last one I have then is on the enterprise. As you guys are going through and you're going to make your priorities about how you want to allocate your production capabilities, presumably enterprise will bubble up there at the top of the list. As we think about your prioritization, should we think about prices remaining stable? Or is there a chance that you guys might look to raise prices in a particular category? I know going they're already going up in desktop and notebooks. But how about enterprise, is there a chance that prices go up? Or do they remain stable and you guys gain share or try to regain share with your new platforms?", "Steve Luczo", "Well, again, I think we'll try and regain share with our new [ph] platforms. I think it depends on the enterprise customer. There's very few enterprise customers who only take mission-critical. There may not be any even. And they're seeing that it's, obviously, they need mission-critical and/or business critical or the entire product line. Clearly for the customer's that need the entire product line, those are the ones that we're trying to address with the portfolio. And I don't even think about it in terms of pricing or unit as much as what can we deliver to the customer and what does that look like in terms of our supply chain and does that look like for them in terms of achieving their business goals.", "Okay, and I think we're going to wrap it up there. And I'd like to thank all our employees and certainly our suppliers and our customers for their ongoing support. Thank you all for joining us on the call today, and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Thanks very much.", "Operator", ".", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

My name is Melanie, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. ", "This conference call contains forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements related to the company's future operating and financial performance in the December 2011 quarter and thereafter, and includes statements regarding customer demand for disk drives and general market conditions. These forward-looking statements are based on information available to Seagate as of the date of this conference call, but are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements.", "Such risks, uncertainties and other factors may be beyond the company's control. In particular, global economic conditions and significant disruption to the industry supply chain from the severe flooding throughout parts of Thailand may pose a risk to the company's operating and financial performance.", "Information concerning additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's annual report on Form 10-K and Form 10-K/A, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 17, 2011, and August 24, 2011, respectively, and in the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on October 27, 2011. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the company's views as of any subsequent date, and Seagate undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Steve Luczo, CEO. Please go ahead.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Thank you, Melanie. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me from Seagate are Pat O'Malley, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Mosley, Executive Vice President of Operations; Rocky Pimentel, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer; and Ken Massaroni, Executive Vice President and General Counsel.", "We have posted detailed supplemental information about our fiscal second quarter on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com. In today's call, I will review the results for the December 2011 quarter, provide an update on our Thailand operations and our view of the impact of the flooding, share our progress on the Samsung hard drive business integration and provide our outlook for our fiscal third and fourth quarters, as well as calendar year 2012. After that, we'll open up the call to questions and answers.", "For the December quarter, the industry shipped approximately 119 million units, which was within our expected range. Seagate reported revenue of $3.2 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.32. We shipped 47 million units during the quarter, and our non-GAAP gross margin was 31.7%. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash.", "The disaster in Thailand affected a vast number of individuals and thousands of businesses. Although the industry is continuing to increase output, it's important to note that while many observers tend to believe that mid to late October was the low point of industry production, we believe the low point was closer to mid-December.", "Seagate's geographically diversified factory footprint and broad supply chain provided inherent advantages that mitigated the impact of the floods to Seagate's operations, although many of our external component suppliers are still working to recover their businesses and return to full capacity. We have been very impressed with the response and efforts of our suppliers, who have worked tirelessly to rebound from the effects of the flooding. There are still clear challenges that lie ahead in our component supply chain. And to help address the gaps in various product lines, Seagate has worked with its customers and suppliers on aggressive qualifications of new parts and factories, allowing us to match precious supply to end demand.", "I'll now turn the call over to Dave Mosley, who will provide more detail on the situation in Thailand.", "William David Mosley", "Thanks, Steve. The human tragedy that surrounds the flooding in Thailand is deeply troubling, and our thoughts go out all of those affected, especially our employees and their families. To put the disaster in an economic perspective, it is by some measures the fourth-largest natural disaster in history. So far, estimates are at $45 billion of damage, and 13 million lives were disrupted.", "The damages done by the flooding created by far the most stressful quarter in the history of the disk drive supply chain. The flood was most impactful in the industrial parks approximately 30 miles north of downtown Bangkok, where 7 of our top 10 suppliers suffered direct factory damage. As a result, all of our 20-plus product platforms experienced some form of supply interruption, and for a few products, the damage brought down the supply lines completely.", "Components have had varying degrees of challenges in the recovery. Specifically, a large portion of the precision machining capability that supports the hard drive industry, the motors and base decks to actuators and specialty mechanical parts, were catastrophically lost. In some cases, various fixtures were salvaged, while in other cases our suppliers have had to rush to secure new tooling. To date, over 200 requalifications have occurred for motor base assemblies alone. Also, many cleanroom facilities that support the industry, where contamination control is critical, were destroyed. Even certain electrical component manufacturing was damaged, impacting parts from IC packaging to individual discretes like capacitors.", "In addition, we're seeing much longer than usual lead times for certain pieces of capital equipment. Some sub-suppliers have limited access to capital to rebuild their systems and get back online, and Seagate is working with many of its suppliers to provide assistance where it can to accelerate the return of those businesses. Examples include temporary changes in payment terms, adaptation of our product portfolio to match their capabilities and assistance in funding for capital equipment. We believe these structural changes occurring in the supply chain today will have a lasting impact on the long-term structure of the industry. We are also working to ensure these relationships will lessen future risks in supply chain disruptions.", "With these impacts and the temporary underutilization of our in-house capacity, our average unit costs went up approximately $2.50 in the December quarter. I would like to thank our suppliers for their efforts in these trying times. In particular, vendors have shown their dedication to our industry and our mutual end-customers to prioritize urgent product gaps and restore high-quality production as soon as possible. Steve?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Thanks, Dave. In response to the supply chain disruptions in the December quarter, Seagate dramatically reduced product configuration complexity and moved the vast majority of our fulfillment process to direct factory shipments. These efforts have fundamentally altered demand planning dynamics with our customers and have resulted in a much better alignment of supply and demand. We expect that these improvements to supply chain management will become standard practice as our industry fully recovers over the course of calendar 2012, benefiting our industry, suppliers and customers.", "Our average selling price per unit for the quarter was approximately $13 higher than they were in the September quarter. While market conditions would have clearly supported a higher price for our products across our portfolio, we balance this condition with the needs of our customers and suppliers, as well as our objective for more stability in our margins. We made the business decision to trade a short-term, profit-maximizing opportunity for long-term commitments from customers, stronger relationships and more stable margins.", "As a result of improvements in supply-demand alignment and our approach to pricing, nearly all of our largest customers have entered into binding long-term agreements or LTAs to ensure continuity of their hard disk drive supply. Some of these LTAs extend for multiple years. LTAs of this nature are new to the disk drive industry and represent a structural change in the way we do business. These agreements are mutually beneficial and improve the strategic alignment between Seagate and its customers by improving forecast accuracy, unit volume and pricing visibility, product build planning and logistics.", "The executed LTAs are expected to account for an excess of 60% of our total production capacity during the calendar year. These volume commitments were made while considering our broader business, which includes the global distribution channel, our own branded retail business and other OEMs who have not executed LTAs. We are receiving additional requests for LTAs from our customers, and we will evaluate our ability to meet those requests while ensuring that our customers have adequate supply to achieve their business objectives.", "The current industry environment has also created changes within our distribution channel, including the elimination of programs that historically have complicated pricing and reduced transparency. We believe these changes will improve the profitability of our distribution partners and also result in better alignment of supply and demand, reducing the potential for excess inventory.", "Finally, in order to provide our customers another channel to access Seagate products, we are planning to auction approximately 200,000 drives later this week. In addition to making drives available for those qualified customers not covered by an LTA or where LTA volumes are not sufficient to cover their needs, this will allow us to fully understand and gauge marginal pricing. We have over 50 customers already committed to participate in the first auction. Our current expectation is that we will be conducting auctions periodically during this and future quarters. ", "As previously mentioned, product configurations were dramatically reduced in the December quarter. As a result, we have accelerated most of the critical product transitions we discussed in last quarter's call. We prioritized transitions in desktop, nearline and mission-critical to speed volume recovery, and we have made substantial progress in manufacturing yields across all these programs. Our 500-gigabyte per disk notebook products are still on the plan, and they will be substantially completed with this transition in the next 6 months. ", "As previously reported, we closed the acquisition of Samsung's hard drive business on December 19, and our integration of the Samsung business is largely complete, and the transition has progressed as expected. The logistics to complete the shift of Samsung's disk drive operations to Seagate's system are closely coordinated, and the completion of this move is a testament to the solid work of our integration and operations team.  In the final weeks of 2011, Seagate shipped approximately 700,000 Samsung drives using Seagate's global systems.", "The acquisition includes the addition of Samsung's Spinpoint M8 series to Seagate's 2.5-inch product portfolio. This product delivers industry-leading capacity and is a volume leader that will significantly improve Seagate's position as a supplier of 2.5-inch products.", "As with many other product lines, external component shortages resulting from the Thailand floods have constrained the production of this product. We are now seeing incremental improvements in the ramp of this product and expect ongoing improvements throughout the calendar year. We are excited about the broader ongoing relationship with Samsung and are pleased to welcome the Samsung employees that have joined Seagate at our new Korean design center and in the sales organization.", "With respect to our forecast for the remainder of the fiscal and calendar year, it is our belief that as a result of the structural damage to the supply chain, there is substantial and growing shortfall in unmet exabyte demand. We believe that the exabyte demand is growing at 40% per year, while areal density growth is increasing at less than 25% per year. We continue to expect that calendar 2012 unit demand will exceed supply, that the exabyte shortage will be more pronounced than the unit shortage, and that price declines on a like-for-like basis will be relatively benign throughout the year. We believe the industry will likely exit the calendar year with approximately 100 exabytes of unmet demand.", "Based on Seagate's average capacity per drive shipped last quarter, which was the highest in the industry, this exabyte shortfall equates to approximately 150 million units. For the March quarter, we are expecting drive shipments of at least 60 million units, revenues to be at least $4.3 billion, gross margins to exceed 33% and operating expenses of approximately $405 million. Based on share repurchases completed during the month of January, fully diluted share count used in the EPS calculation is expected to be 465 million shares.", "For the June quarter, we expect that our supply chain capabilities will continue to improve, which will result in revenues of at least $5 billion and gross margins comparable to those expected for the March quarter. In light of the persistent supply-demand imbalances that we believe will exist throughout the calendar year, combined with greater visibility due to our LTAs, we currently expect a relatively benign pricing environment resulting in revenues of at least $20 billion for calendar year 2012.", "With respect to the capital structure and our priorities for cash, we expect to continue our practice of returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase throughout the calendar year 2012. To the extent market conditions allow, we expect to engage in share repurchases, which should result in a share count of approximately 350 million by the end of the calendar year.", "Last week, the Seagate board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which adds to the approximately $900 million remaining from the December 2010 authorization. Additionally, the board approved a 39% increase to our quarterly dividend from $0.18 to $0.25 per share. We believe these actions will help us maximize value for our shareholders and demonstrate our ongoing confidence in the business.", "Melanie, we're now open -- ready to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research.", "Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Two questions basically related to the same subject, which is mix. You mentioned that like-for-like pricing should be flattish in the quarter, but you didn't talk about the impact of platter density, I guess, improving as the year goes on. And also served market priorities going forward with regard to mix relative to branded, et cetera. Could you just sort of walk through what that means for pricing and gross margins?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Well, I -- I mean, Pat. I mean, I think we did say that we basically expect pricing to be benign for like-for-like for the year. If average drive capacity increases, then that would imply an ASP increase. And that's a function really of our recovery on components, our ability to deliver higher and higher capacity, Steven. As you know in the last quarter, we were up about 5% quarter-over-quarter, which will probably be the high-water mark for the industry. And we hope to improve upon that moving forward as we get stronger supply on the component side to build some of the shortages that are particularly heavy in the business-critical area.", "Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC", "And then just to follow up on that, is there any way to prioritize or let us in a little bit on your thinking about what you're going to prioritize in terms of the served markets going forward, how much you can put more into the branded market given these LTAs, et cetera?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Again, the LTAs were -- the volume commitments made for the LTAs were made in consideration of the other markets that we have to serve, so as I pointed out, that's global distribution, that's our branded business and that's other OEM customers that don't have LTAs. So if you add all that up, it's obviously, it's in excess of what our capacity is. And so our ability to first address the market opportunities that our customers are presenting to us is the strategic decision Seagate's made, and the give for that was a commitment on behalf of the customers to engage with Seagate for 1 or more years. So we're going to obviously serve the retail channel as we can, but we're pretty heavily committed to our LTA customers and our global distribution partners.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with Noble Financial.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "Just want to clarify. You said there would be 150 million units of unmet demand. What -- is that by the end of the calendar year or the fiscal year?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yes, Mark. The way we're getting to that calculation is for the calendar year, we believe the growing exabyte demand will be about 100 exabytes. That might be more heavily weighted towards enterprise, both in nearline and mission-critical. And what we did is basically took our average capacity per drive to get to the 150 million units. So it's a calendar year statement, which basically means that we believe the impacts of the flooding are going to be felt well into 2013 in terms of trying to address the needs of customers to acquire storage.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "What would you project as the industry capacity in the September quarter?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "The September quarter of 2012?", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "Yes.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Our industry's capacity? Well, the drive industry or the component industry? Because those are 2 different questions.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "Well, what would be the pacing capacity?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I think we still believe in the September quarter that it's probably going to be components. I think if you asked about drive capacity against the TAM, that's likely to be 180 million to 200 million unit TAM, will be below that, but I think that the component aspect of that will be even below the drive aspect.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "So no more than 190 million -- 180 million to 190 million for the available shipping capacity?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "No, what I said was less than that. I said the TAM, I believe, will be 180 million to 200 million, depending on what your view of Windows 8 is, which ours is pretty positive. The drive industry, I don't think, will get to those levels, and then the component constraints will be even below that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions. Steve, you talked about how you're doing a direct shipment to the OEMs in this environment. Is that in lieu of JIT hubs or are JIT hubs still included in that view? And then would you expect to go back to JIT hubs later in the year when supply gets better or do you think you can keep it this way, directly shipping to the customers or their manufacturing centers?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Well, I'll let Dave answer the first part after I answer the second part, which is the customer behavior has clearly shifted as a result of what's happened to the supply chain. And if you think about it, it's not all bad. So for those customers that have been able to take advantage of the direct ship and then revenue that product fairly quickly, thereby avoiding kind of the inventory holding period that goes on in JIT hubs, they're going to be obviously advantaged to continue to do that, which would make me think that the competitors that aren't able to do that are going to have to address that pretty quickly. So as I said, we expect that these changes that are occurring in terms of better and quicker alignment between supply and demand, at the end of the day, are going to sustain themselves because certain companies are clearly using it to their advantage to take market share currently. Dave, do you want to add anything?", "William David Mosley", "No, Rich, I don't have a lot to add. We went through this transformation fairly quickly, and it's been fairly positively received as well, because people just wanted line of sight to the supply. I don't see that changing anytime in the near term, and we would have to discuss whether we change it in the future. But right now, with today's service models, I don't see it changing.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then from a technology perspective, the Samsung 500-gig  notebook drives have been pretty well received.  If they could have shipped more, it would have been even better received. You're keeping your 500-gig notebook plans in place. Is that a go-forward decision or is that just for the moment? Or can you just talk about the synergies between the roadmaps?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Sure. The Samsung product is a 9.5-millimeter, 1-terabyte, 2-disk product primarily. It obviously can be less capacity to that. Our Singapore product is a 7-millimeter product, Rich, so it's really targeted as a drive for the ultrabook market.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that makes sense. And then lastly, it seems a little silly to ask about inventory levels, but because there seems to be some confusion in the market, and I kind of need to do so, can you just talk about what you're seeing in U.S. inventory in the channel and then North American inventory and then what's out there in Asia?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "This -- I mean, Rocky, you want...", "Albert A. Pimentel", "Yes, Rich. We -- this is Rocky. We still see a pretty constant flow in the non-OEM channels, and certainly, the channel has been probably the -- suffering the most from the standpoint of availability of the drives, so we still see healthy demand and continuing flow. We don't see any inventory buildup at this point. In fact, as Steve mentioned on the -- on his prepared comments, we've had tremendous reception on our auction concept, because the non-OEM customers see it as a great way for them to access additional products, so all the anecdotal evidence is we still a pretty healthy channel flow.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yes. I think for us, Rich, where there might be inventory that's not moving as quickly as you might think given the magnitude of the shortages, those tend to be pretty low-capacity offerings, and Seagate was able to obviously bat [ph] half the mix down. So from our product perspective, we feel that the product we're putting into the channel is moving quite quickly.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And it's helpful to put out the $20 billion tough [ph] guidance, so that'll be fun tomorrow.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joe Yoo with Citigroup.", "Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I just wanted to get a better sense of what's happening on pricing within the channel. I think there is some concern that channel pricing, which is still about 50% or 60% above pre-flood levels for Seagate, might come down pretty meaningfully downwards as supply actually moves closer to demand. I mean, can you give us a sense of what your expectations are for channel pricing for Seagate for the next 2 quarters?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yes, I mean, I think -- again, I think that we've been pretty articulate what we think pricing is going to be like overall for Seagate. I think you have to also look at what pricing was like for our competitors and us. I mean typically, Seagate would be $10 to $12 a unit ASP higher given our mix. In this quarter, it looks like we're $2 lower, which means, obviously, that disparity was probably across all channels but probably particularly evident in the distribution channel. So I don't think you should read into what other people might have to do in channel pricing what we have to do in channel pricing. We've tried to keep our pricing competitive in light of the constraints, but as I said also, leave it at levels where we don't have a lot of fluctuation to our gross margin. So in certain capacity points, pricing seems to have affected demand, and therefore, when you're running a portfolio as broad as ours, there's always opportunity to generate gross profit dollars that are a function of pricing and volume. But overall, I would not expect any drastic reduction in our pricing in any one of our go-to-market channels.", "Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And for Pat, I wanted to get a better sense of your dividend policy. Obviously, you've increased it meaningfully last week. Do you have any targets in mind whether it be payout ratios or a minimum dividend yield? Is your plan to increase it consistently every year? Any color would be appreciated.", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley", "I don't know that we're quite viewing it as a payout ratio. Probably over as time evolves, as we go through this normalization, however you guys want to characterize it, but we look to returning a percentage of our cash flow as a payout ratio, not necessarily yield. And -- but this year, we just felt with the acceleration of the earnings model and the cash model that we got ahead of it as a combination of the share repurchase and the dividend increase as a balanced way to reward our shareholders and returning capital to them. So I would say it was a policy-driven thing as more as a relooking at our model for the next year, and we'll continue to assess that generally from year to year.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yes, I think, Joe, that the -- clearly, with our intent to reduce the share count, that allows us a lot of flexibility to increase dividend and not increase cash outlay. So we think they work hand in hand, and we're trying to be thoughtful in terms of the total cash flow that we expect the company to be able to generate over the next several years. What's that split between obviously returning first and foremost into our own business to drive our technical leadership, and then how do we return to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchase? And I think we've had -- we have a pretty good balance here and we're always open to suggestions. But as one of the few tech companies paying a dividend or one certainly that -- the few that pay at the yield we do, we certainly think we're striking a balance that shows our confidence in the business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Hunt with Auriga.", "Kevin M. Hunt - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division", "I have a couple of questions. First, I continue to get lots of questions on pushback on the long-term agreements, generally the pushback of the long lines of OEMs, and what are of those when push comes to shove a year from now? So maybe you could give us a little assurance on what are the mechanisms to ensure that they can't reneg on those? And the second question is really on the hybrid drive, if you could give a little more color on -- those all obviously have a big push from Intel coming late in the year, and what the positioning is there for you guys. And maybe what other -- what the competitors are at, at this point?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Well, on the LTAs, I guess I would start by saying if you don't think the CEOs of the companies that have signed these contracts are worth the signature on the paper, you may wonder if you should be owning any of their stocks either. These are firm contracts that are negotiated in terms of volume commitments and our commitment to supply, and they have conditions around them in terms of pricing and availability. And they're not contracts that you can decide 6 months from now that you really didn't want to enter into. I think the bigger point, which if anyone is not understanding, these contracts are extremely beneficial to our customers. They came about because customers that understood the implications of the supply chain disruption understood that access to this technology is going to be absolutely critical to deliver the solutions they're delivering. And while historically, maybe people look to say, \"How do I save $0.50 or $1 buying a disk drive?\" what people learned over the last 6 months is that by doing that, you're putting at risk, sometimes, anywhere to 10x to 12x that amount in revenue. So I mean, 1 million disk drives going to a customer is going to generate today even on the client $300 million or $400 million or $500 million or $600 million of revenue, depending on what your client base is. And on the enterprise, of course, the numbers are probably 10x that. So this is an opportunity, I think, for a lot of the customers to basically assure themselves that they have access to the product so they can then do their planning, and especially when it's against a big shortfall in demand.  I guess the analogy I use is if you lost 1/3 of the oil production in the world and everyone realized what that meant in terms of availability to gas for your car or fuel for your home, and you happen to have a relationship with a station owner down the block that happened to have stations all over the world, and they offered you the ability to basically get fuel whenever you wanted to at competitive prices, would you view that as an advantage or a disadvantage? I think it's pretty clear it's an advantage. So we have a lot of confidence that these contracts will be adhered to. They are involving the highest level of executives at the companies that we engage with them. They are mutually beneficial, they are competitive and they're giving these companies a great capability to plan their businesses going forward. And in an environment like we said, where we believe there's going to be an exabyte shortage that could -- that goes into 2013. With respect to a hybrid technology, we -- as you know, we're on our second generation of hybrid technology moving into our third generation of hybrid technology, and we're quite confident that the performance and cost aspects of the devices that we'll be delivering over the summer will be best-in-class and basically will have SSD-quality performance with marginal cost adder [ph], so we believe this is a big category for us going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I had 2, if I could. Pat, is there any cash flow targets you could provide for the March quarter or more broadly for CY '12?", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley", "I think we have a philosophy around our business of keeping enough cash free [ph] liquidity. I mean, we certainly have shown in the past that we can run that number as low as $800 million. But for our business, we look to keep $1 billion-plus of cash on the balance sheet, and then we generate at least $1 billion-plus of cash flow. So but that -- so looking at both aspects of the flow and what we'd like to have gross on the balance sheet.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "So sorry if I misunderstood that, but how much free cash flow do you think you can -- if you're going to do $20 billion in revenues this year, how much free cash flow do you think you can spin off of that $20 billion?", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley", "Well, we can do -- I mean, you're talking about $1 billion a quarter, at least, so you could model that, but it's certainly north of $1 billion a quarter.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I mean, you guys can model that. We've given you basically revenues and our view on at least pricing through -- margins through halfway through the year and pricing through the whole year, no big changes to OpEx...", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley", "Or CapEx.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Or CapEx. So you guys can work your own models.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Fair enough. And Steve, a follow-up for you, if I could. If you could talk a little bit about what you think industry TAM on supply of drives would be for the June quarter. And more specifically within that context, what do you think Samsung can do for Seagate over the next couple of quarters in terms of output of drives, please?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Well, I think June -- you have to start with March, right? I mean, at the end of the day, we're a manufacturing industry, and so you kind of have to think about June as a function of growth over March, which then makes you think about December. And don't worry, I won't take you back to 1957. So I think if you really think about December, the math lays out like this: the industry shipped 120 million units, but it only built 105 million. So I think the earlier forecast of the industry being able to ship something like 145 million for the March quarter would have been pretty spectacular in light of 105 million built, because you figure there's no inventory drawdowns that's going to occur in March, right? So you're talking about 105 million going to 145 million. I think that's a stretch. I mean, is it possible? I suppose if you mix way down in capacity, and you're only shooting for unit volume, it might theoretically be possible. But if you look at the first few weeks of production, it looks to us that the industry is on a pace to do something closer to 130 million, 135 million. You can therefore -- to me, 150 million to 160 million is probably the right number for June, again, depending on mix and recovery to the supply chain.", "Unknown Executive", "And components as well.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yes.  Did that answer that question?", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "It did, Steve. And then if you just don't mind, a little bit on Samsung, how do you think they can ramp?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "So Samsung's interesting. It's a great product. It's a high-yielding product. As you know, it's a outsourced manufacturing product currently for us with TDK, SA, Winpoint. And really, they ran into a situation where they were constrained by a component. And other than that, we would've been able to probably produce millions of those drives in the December quarter or they would've. In March, we probably would've been in the 10-plus million range. We've addressed the component shortage, we're ramping it quickly, and I think it's certainly reasonable that if you look over the course of the year that we can hit 50 million units a quarter with that product extending into the fall.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Scott Craig with Bank of America.", "Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Can you just talk a little bit around the CapEx and how you're thinking about CapEx over the next few quarters, Steve, and what your thoughts are on maybe trying to add capacity at some point and how you're thinking about that in the context of the industry? And then secondly, on the gross margin side of things, given you've still been pretty constrained, obviously, on capacity, can you talk about the 33% gross margin that you're pointing to in the June quarter, approximately 33% in line with the March quarter? And then sort of how pricing and maybe mix and then the volume bouncing back to higher levels for your production would all play into that number?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yes, they all play into that number. You got it. Yes, more volume, relatively stable pricing environment, mix, again, kind of a function of meeting our customer demands. And you've got to remember that mix is a little different than it's probably been in the last several years where we get orders from customers and then we basically work with our supply chain to address mix. It's a little bit in reverse right now. We have our supply chain that's presenting a bunch of parts to us, and then we dynamically rework every 24 hours what we can build in order to best satisfy our customers' demand. So it's a little bit in reverse, and it won't be fully recovered by June. So there's still going to be a big influence in the June quarter that says, \"Here's what we can build and how do we best address the market?\" So I think it's really a September quarter, maybe exiting the June quarter where we're going to have the flexibility that you might normally think of a company like Seagate, where you could put an order in, sometime 8 weeks ahead of time, and we could probably respond to it with our supply chain. So that all plays into it, and that's why we believe there's going to be stability to our margins, at least for the next 6 months, and probably throughout the calendar year.  And what was the first part? Sorry, CapEx. I'll let Dave answer the CapEx. The general answer is right now, we're working against, if you will, a capital -- I mean, a productive capacity that's fixed, that's not fully utilized, obviously, because of supply chain disruption. And what we're doing right now is keeping our heads down to work towards getting fuller utilization of the assets that we have. We're also in product transitions, which require technology and capital to transition. But generically, there's not a plan to put capital at work to raise that ceiling. And we wouldn't plan on doing that unless we got to, let's say, the fall, and it was clear that the unit and exabyte shortages were even more pronounced and of a longer duration than what we're thinking, which is kind of through 2013 in various forms and function. You'd then be  into lead times where you probably would have to address increasing capital, and then we would obviously come back to our strategic customers and negotiate that commitment with some sort of extension to the various LTAs because we obviously don't want to be on the hook for putting a bunch of capital to work and then have excess capacity in the industry.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Christian Schwab with Craig Hallum.", "Christian D. Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Is it safe for us to assume, because everyone's trying to figure out when all this ends, that the gross margin targets that you guys laid out before of 22% to 26% is a long-term target? Obviously, we're well above that. Do you see the world possibly settling out higher than that post Thailand issues?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yes. It's just, first of all, when all this ends, I mean, I think there's the -- the question when does all this end, which of course is the biggest question in life. But -- and then what does it look like? And the second biggest question in life. And what I think the answer is, it doesn't end. This is a structural event that's happened, and the industry has changed. And people want to get into the simplistic model of \"and then, on July 17, it's going to be just like it was, and there's pricing is going to come down and everybody's margin.\" I mean, this -- and that's just -- that's just not very sophisticated nor I think reflective of the business that we're in. And I think that what's going on right now is showing that. So I think it's a structural change and we've been saying this for a long, long time. This is structural. And what it looks like when we're through the transition -- and I would view the transition to mean, like I was saying before, when customers say \"Here's what we need,\" we can be very responsive with our supply chain and deliver commitments with what they need in very short order. That is at least 1 year out, I think, in terms of meeting the unmet demand.  So what does it look like then? It looks different, and it looks different probably forever. What does that mean in terms of business models and gross margins? I would say that it means higher than what was in place before, because by definition, what was in place before had too much risk in the model. I mean, at the end of the day, the reason the industry is going through what it's going through right now is because there was excess risk in the system. And that risk, in part, was a function of gross margins that weren't sustainable for what our industry really delivers, either in terms of productive capability or R&D and capital. So I believe when it's all said and done and partly, there's going to be more efficiencies, partly there's going to be more systems put in place. That supply availability is going to be more important than saving $0.50 on a disk drive. And if you ask any customer right now, would they rather have another million drives or would they rather save $0.50 a drive, they all will tell you, they want another million drives so they can go produce $400 million or $500 million in revenue. And I think that's what the smart strategic customers are focused on, and the smart strategic customers are the ones that are going to win.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "First, a model question, and then kind of most of my questions have been answered, but a follow-up on the earlier question. First on the model, just real quickly, what tax rate are we to assume as we look out going forward?", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley", "Well, for the rest of this fiscal year, I was just planning on a 3% tax rate. In longer term, we've modeled closer to 5%. But as you follow our tax structure, obviously, it's -- I won't say fixed, because it's not fixed, but it's certainly, as we earn numbers in these ranges, it makes for a foreseeable low rate, so I'd used 3% for the rest of this year and 5% long term for the model.", "Aaron C.

And then on the areal density transition that you're talking about being pretty much completed through over the next 6 months, can you remind us again how that flows to the gross margin line in what looks to be a stable pricing environment, how we should think about that on a per unit cost basis?", "William David Mosley", "Well, we'd never characterize it per unit but obviously, if you take -- you think about it from the construct of if you're taking a 500 per platter notebook, you're taking a disk in the head out. And so if you're talking the range of historically, we take out anywhere from $4 to $8 on a transition for a standard platform, obviously, that's our leverage, that's our way we look at it, and that's what we're calculating. But as Steve talked about in his prepared comments, we're largely done with the rest of the portfolio, and now we're going to have -- as we ramp those, we'll continue to get savings but we've done a -- last quarter, done a great job of pulling that forward. So that's sort of already baked into the financials, but I think what we'll get in our financials is much more capital and efficiency utilization as the factories ramp.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "And I think what's interesting is the transition for the industry. If you asked that question 5 years ago, you would say that you have compressed margins at the front end of that transition just because you're putting a lot of capital to work in new equipment and yields are low, and then you kind of get this margin expansion that might last 4 or 5 quarters, depending on what's going on competitive with that particular product. And then you start getting some margin pressure the back end of that cycle. I think it's a little different now. You still are thinking of obviously all the issues on the front end. And in fact, it may be a little longer and tougher just because the technology is getting tougher in terms of these transitions. But I think the big difference is once you get the margin expansion, and again, when that starts to come down is a function of competitiveness, I do think that you're getting longer tails on margins just because people are driving yields a lot higher. Our industry historically would've said, \"Hey, if you get to the low 80s or mid- low 90s\" -- sorry, \"mid-80s to high 80s to low 90s on yields, then you kind of start thinking about the next product.\" And that's -- it's just a different world now with these capacity points staying in production longer and what's going on competitively, we can drive yields higher than that for longer periods of time, which might give us a little longer tail on the margin, so we'll see. It's -- I think, it's kind of a new phase of the industry right now.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And final thing for me. Do we exit the calendar year based on what you guys have said, at 80 million per quarter in production capacity?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yes. I mean it's your model, but I wouldn't -- I don't -- it doesn't sound too far off, depending on mix. Depending on mix. But yes, I mean, it's about right.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "I guess, Steve, could you make any comments around what to expect on the, I guess, from the efficiencies gained from Samsung on OpEx as you move forward? I guess, what's going on right now with margins is a lot is sort of -- is probably covered up with what's going on with pricing, but you made a comment earlier, or Pat did, about not much going on with OpEx as you move through the year.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Right.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "So is --  yes, is that kind of partially impacted by the Samsung integration? And then if you can make any comments about like a longer-term Samsung OpEx framework, that'd be helpful.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yes. No, it's a great question and I'm glad you asked it. I mean, I don't -- we don't have a number for you yet. Maybe by next quarter we can start gauging that for you. Although, of course, as we go through time obviously, it's all Seagate. But what I will tell you, because I think you hit on a good point, is that we will learn a lot in terms of better operating models from what we've acquired at Samsung. They took a different design approach, they took a different qual approach and they took a different manufacturing approach. And there's a lot of good stuff there that we're learning that, as it turns out, we can apply to our broader portfolio, whether or not, again, that has to do with how we qual the product, how we ramp it or even how we build it. And they do a great job. The yields are very high. They run very clean factories. And at the end of the day, I think that, that's going to benefit us in terms of our operating efficiency, i.e. lower cost of goods sold for any product made. And it should have an impact that helps us throughout a product line. And I think probably by next quarter, we can maybe start scoping what we think some of that benefit is. You hit another point that pricing kind of masks what's going on. Well, it does and it doesn't. Like I said, you can see what our margins are at with price increases that were a lot lower than our competition. We're making really good progress on our cost and our yields, and we're getting through some of these transitions that are challenging. But like I said, once you get through them, then you basically have a pretty nice product to build for a while. And at these capacity points, when you're at nice round numbers like 1 and 2 terabytes and 500 gigabytes, we think these products are going to be in production for a while, so we have to be able to make them at very high yields.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up, if I could. Is there any point in the second half of the year when you think that you'll actually be able to ship the mix, I guess mix-appropriate, for what customers are wanting, and then, really, at that point, it's just a matter of being able to ship enough of the right mix?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I'll let Dave answer the question. I think it's going to be a struggle for a while. Business-critical has been really impacted quite heavily. Mission-critical probably recovers first because there's so much effort by the industry to solve that problem, and it's a relatively lower volume. Of course, you have substantial growth in the nearline business-critical space as a result of cloud computing. So not only was that segment hit the hardest, it's also the one where there's just very significant growth opportunities. Then notebook probably and then desktop. So I think it's going to be a while. Dave, you want to add a little more color?", "William David Mosley", "I think there are some customer systems that are qualified. Different applications require high-capacity drives, so I think that'll still be unmet for quite a while. So the answer to your question directly is no. I believe that we'll still be mixed down through the balance of the year.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Okay, I want to thank everyone on the call today, and I'd like to also stress my admiration for Seagate's customers, partners, suppliers, our employees and the rest of our industry for the hard work and perseverance through these very trying times. Thanks for joining us, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

Steve?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Thanks, Kate. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Seagate's third quarter results reflect strong operating performance by the company against the backdrop of a continued recovery of the hard drive industry. Our main focus this quarter were on operational execution in order to meet our customers' requirements and returning value to our shareholders. We delivered successfully on both fronts.", "In our fiscal third quarter, Seagate achieved revenue of $4.4 billion, diluted earnings per share of $2.48. Cash flow from operations was $938 million and we ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash. Through the extraordinary efforts of our suppliers and outstanding execution from our operations, Seagate successfully delivered our portfolio of products to a broad base of customers. We also returned significant value to our shareholders this quarter, with over $1.2 billion in dividends, share repurchases and debt repurchase. The 43.1 million share repurchased during the March quarter reflected approximately 10% of the outstanding ordinary shares of the company.", "We increased our unit shipments by 29% over last quarter, shipping 61 million drives, which equates to approximately 42 exabytes. Shipments of our client products improved, with the notebook market almost fully recovered, as expected. We expect the market for desktop drives to remain constrained, most likely through the fall. In the enterprise, the mission-critical market segment market seems to have almost fully recovered, while business-critical continues to be constrained as demand for storage continues to increase rapidly with the ongoing build out of the cloud infrastructure.", "We believe we are well-positioned for these cloud-based trends because of our broad product portfolio, which represents several high-demand, sole-supply product offerings. Our Samsung label products represented approximately 13% of our shipments this quarter. We are very pleased with the value this business has brought to Seagate. We have increased manufacturing capacity and have successfully increased our additional design engineering headcount by over 25% at our Korean design center since the acquisition was completed.", "Gross margin for the third quarter was 37%. As expected, pricing was relatively benign in the quarter and Seagate's operational performance exceeded our expectations, as we were able to ship units at an increasing average capacity per drive with improving yields. We believe our average capacity per drive was at least 15% higher than the industry average.", "Our long-term agreements with our largest customers have been mutually successful and we delivered over 100% of our committed volume this quarter. The number of executed LTAs increased to 50% this quarter. We expect these long-term agreements to account for approximately 60% of our total production capacity for the calendar year. LTA pricing was more favorable to the customer than the company's average pricing, reflecting the benefit of longer-term visibility of supply and demand. Our new auction program continues to evolve and we held multiple auctions worldwide throughout the quarter, selling 100% of the products offered at or above the company's average pricing.", "As the industry recovered during the quarter, supply to the distribution channel improved. Distribution pricing remains well above historical spreads with respect to OEM pricing. As the drive industry works towards bringing supply and demand into balance, there are several market dynamics that remained unsettled in addition to a variety of supply constraints that have resulted in our customers mixing down their capacity requirements. Most interesting is a possible market share shift in favor of OEMs versus white box manufacturers who fulfill through distribution. The longer-term implication of these adjustments is not entirely clear yet. Regardless, we believe there remains a substantial and growing shortfall in unmet exabyte demand resulting from the supply-chain disruptions caused by the floods.", "Consistent with industry analyst projections, we believe that the June quarter TAM will be approximately 160 million units. Given these dynamics, the pricing environment remains benign and we are raising our non-GAAP gross margin expectation to be at least 34.5% for the June quarter. We expect to achieve revenue of at least $5 billion and operating expenses of approximately $400 million to $500 million. Fully diluted share count for the June quarter is expected to be approximately 440 million.", "For the second half of the calendar year, we are planning that the industry will continue its current pace of recovery, and combined with the demand for cloud infrastructure and the introduction of Win 8 and new thin and light notebook products, the December quarter TAM should exceed 185 million units. Under these conditions, we believe Seagate will maintain market share of approximately 43% and will be on track to achieve calendar 2012 revenues of at least $20 billion. In addition, we are planning for non-GAAP gross margins to remain above 30% exiting calendar 2012.", "With respect to our capital structure and priorities for cash, we expect to continue to return value to shareholders through dividends, share repurchases, and when appropriate, early retirement of debt. To the extent market and business conditions allow, we expect to continue the share repurchase at a pace to result in a basic share count of approximately 350 million shares by the end of the calendar year.", "Melanie, we're now ready to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, our first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Stifel Nicolaus.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "First question for me is that I believe last quarter, when you guys had talked about the forward expectations in the March quarter, you had assumed that the industry can produce about 130 million to 135 million drives. The industry shipped closer to 143 million. Can you help us understand the delta there? Did production come back on quicker than you had assumed or is there -- how do we think about the further burn down of the inventory in the supply chain?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I think our estimates have been anywhere from, if I go back to October for the March, June, September, December 2012 quarters, anywhere from 140 million in March to 160 million in June to 180 million in September and 180 million to 190 million in December. I think when we had our call in January, the reason we were probably a little under the 140 million was that when we looked at the build rates for the first 3 weeks of January, it was extremely low. And we weren't -- it wasn't clear to us if the industry would be able to ramp to the 140 million or 140 million-plus that were shipped. And I think a lot of that was done by continuing mix down, which is done of course while addressing unit shortfall, which is good in terms of getting drives into our customers' hands, so we can keep demand overall strong. It's obviously addressing this exabyte shortage that we're focused on as well.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And the follow-up question up for me is that, I'll ask it because somebody's going to ask you this, it sounds like you're going to host an Analyst Day in September. Is that the time frame in which we expect or are you willing now to throw anything out there in terms of the long-term gross margin target model that you've talked about in the past? And on top of that, is there any way to think about free cash flow generation in the context of what you guys are targeting and more comfortable in targeting through 2012?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Well, I think, clearly, by virtue of what we said today, we've indicated a strengthening of our position of what we think is going to happen through calendar 2012 relative to what we thought in January, both with respect to the June quarter margins, as well as exiting calendar year 2012. I think in terms of being in a better position at the Analyst Day to talk about the longer-term business model, absolutely, I think that we'll be in a position to do that by then, if not adding more color on the June quarter call.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And free cash flow?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Same thing.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "Steve, just going back to gross margin, could you give us -- with all the moving parts that you guys have with pricing and product cycles and capacity utilization increases, and adding Samsung, can you give us, I guess, 2 parts -- number one, what's the -- where the, I guess, the mix -- I guess the parts that have you kind of guide down a little bit, at least at the floor in June versus March. And then presumably as pricing starts to soften a little bit as we move through the year, how should we think about some of the other levers kind of layering in to support gross margin through the year?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Right. Well, I guess I want to challenge that we guided down, we actually guided up relative to what we said in January. What we said in January is that we thought that the June quarter would be basically a minimum equal to what we guided in March, which was 33%, we're saying 34.5% now. Our performance in the March quarter was benefited by some really outstanding operational execution and we certainly hope to deliver on that in the June quarter as well. And if we do, then we will obviously outperform our plan of at least 34.5%. I think to your question of this is like, do you say potato, do I say potato, are margins going up, are margins going down? I think the things that are putting pressure on margins would be for us, as we continue to mix up our notebook product, and a lot of it is what we acquired from Samsung. Obviously, the notebook product pricing, so from an AUP perspective is lower than average. And then margins, we don't really talk about margins by products or markets. I'm not going to do that here. But there's also this issue that I try to point out between distribution and then the OEM distribution mix. So clearly, with the OE -- with the distribution price premium being significantly higher than historical norm right now, to the extent that distribution regains more of that white box share, then that would benefit our margins. To the extent that the OEMs continue to take share there, then that would obviously result in lower margins and we have our own view on how that all plays out, which is highly competitive. But when it's all said and done, that's how we get to our gross margin guidance. I think the other big thing, is what you hit, is we're working through some product transitions here that are pretty significant. We've really transitioned the entire portfolio over the last 6 months, which again, I think is a real statement of the company's performance operationally to not only were we chasing a supply chain that was severely disrupted but we actually were transitioning probably with the hardest technical transitions that the industry has gone through. And as we do that, as you know, that allows us to obviously have margin relief. And so as we mix up in either capacity or as we mix to the newer products and then as yields grow on those products, that would obviously benefit margins. So you got all the triggers of net-net, which ones influence the margins, which way, and our modeling basically results in the guidance that we gave.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays.", "Eric Sterling - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "This is actually Eric Sterling for Ben. I just have a quick question on the dividend. In thinking about the shrinking of the share count, your cash outlay actually declined. So can you just sort of give some thoughts around how you're planning for the dividend throughout the year? Is there any thought around increasing it?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Well that's a discussion that we had at the board level. But I think we've been pretty consistent in what we've said, that we believe that a combination of buyback and dividend payment is an appropriate thing to do in terms of returning value to the shareholders. And I think we've also said that we think the concept of a payout ratio is one that makes sense. So by that sense, you're right. As we reduced our share count, it gives us more flexibility to increase the dividend. And that will be a discussion topic for the board to consider.", "Eric Sterling - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And I just have another question. In the release, at the end, there's actually a comment about building about 10 drives per second, which kind of implies a June quarter TAM of 79 million if taken literally. Is that sort of a number that you're comfortable with? Or am I just kind of reading too much into it?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Well, I think you're just taking a statement that we were trying to make in terms of the operational efficiency of the company and extending it through the entire quarter. So I think the point was, as we recovered in the March quarter, obviously our production was skewed. And at the end of the quarter, we were able to reach those kinds of efficiencies. We balance the supply with the demand, so we've already told you what we think the TAM is and what we think our market share is. So we'll be targeting our production and make sure supply and demand is in balance, not trying to optimize as many drives per second as we can.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I had 2 questions related, Steve, to what you're just talking about. The first one is when you mentioned the exit December quarter rate TAM. I just wanted to clarify that, you talked about 185 million drives, I think. That's where you think the industry will be and in terms of its production capacity at that point?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I think what I said was that we believe there'd be a minimum of 185 million units and we tend to look to the industry analysts who are in the business of providing TAM estimates. We're one input to that, we obviously watch it very closely. But given some of the trends that we talked about in terms of cloud-based computing, the proliferation of a variety of mobile devices that drive storage up and down the device food chain, as well as Win 8 and thin and light, that we believe that a minimum of 185 million unit TAM is achievable for December. I think the industry analysts, frankly, are probably a bit above that. In terms of the drive industry's ability to respond to that, there's the drive companies and then there's the drive industry, and I'll let Dave talk to it. I think that's probably pushing the limit, but I'll let Dave talk to that in terms of what the industry can support.", "William David Mosley", "Really gets into the specifics of which products we're talking about. So different markets, different products have many different dynamics. I think, like Steve alluded to, the box count has gone up but the average gigabyte per drive in the industry went down appreciably as a function of this mix down to basically chase that because there was such a dearth of total HDDs in the past 6 months. Now going forward, the question is does that dynamic continue to --  at those low capacity points, if you will? Or do we start to grow up the value chain for more capacity in those sort of boxes? And then obviously with the cloud growing, those are high-capacity drives as well. So I think we'll be mixing up our components available to be able to do that. I, personally, just knowing the supply chain the way I do, I don't feel that numbers that are much more than that are really capable -- the industry is really capable of. There are a number of components still have yet to recover as a function of the flood.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "If I could just ask a follow-up then. Steve, when you talked about pricing will be benign in the June quarter, is there any color you can give us on some specifics on either like-for-like or weighted average pricing for the June quarter?", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley", "This is Pat. We've gone through negotiations. Generally, we've indicated that prices are going to be relatively flat. But as Steve said, as the channel moves, we'll be competitive there. We're still very competitive. But if you look at historical rates, Keith, I'll just say benign is below that. So that's how we should look at it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "A couple of questions about the enterprise and notebook markets, if I could. Given the commentary about basically meeting supply and demand in the quarter for those 2 segments in particular, can you just talk about with the customers that have signed LTAs, how their behavior was at the moment of balance? The market's very concerned that as soon as things get into balance, that you're going to see dramatic pricing pressure or backing away from the LTAs. So any commentary from a high level on those 2 segments given the fact that we've seen supply and demand balance in those areas?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Well, I think we already commented on pricing, Rich. I mean, pricing is effectively done for the LTA customers for the June quarter. And as Pat just indicated, there's been little change to no change in pricing overall. I would say that the behavior through the quarter is there's been a lot of continued chasing of demand, even in those 2 segments. What we've noticed is the LTA customers seem to be taking share and what's really interesting is the LTA customers with the longer-term LTAs seem to be even taking more share. And that may be a function of their ability to do some longer-range planning knowing that they have the supply available, particularly in some of these product categories where Seagate is a sole supplier and is likely to be a sole supplier for anywhere up to 12 to 18 months. So I'd say, in general, as notebook came into balance, the pricing has remained fairly stable and certainly, the same thing in mission-critical business grew [ph]. And I think pricing is really a function of an industry that has a lot of capital to recover, probably at least a couple of billion dollars have to be reabsorbed into the industry, and the supply chain is still not functioning anywhere near where we need it to be functioning, and that's our job through the rest of this year as an industry, is to be able to more closely align supply and demand with our customers' needs.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "And just lastly then, on the CapEx front, you talked about in the prepared remarks, that your CapEx would be, for the quarter, below your targeted range. How long do you think you can maintain that level? There's got to be some base level of just maintenance, right? But how long do you think you can go before you might have to expand capacity?", "William David Mosley", "Rich, this is Dave. I think we'll do pretty well at the levels that were at, low end of the range we said 6% to 8%. That will be at the low end of the range. Until we really see a big pop in the TAM, and I think everybody's fairly conservative relative to that macroeconomically. We are through the bulk of this product transition that we talked about. So most of the technology transition, capital that we have to put in place is already in place. There will be some of what you referenced but it's more of that kind of run rate level that we're at right now. And we'll spend as we see the need for it within the lead time, but nothing major to take us up to the high end of the range, certainly.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "And actually, one for Pat. Just on the authorization of the stock buyback, how much is left on that?", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley", "As of today, Rich, we authorized an additional $1 billion in the last quarter. With that -- we have made the announcement. We've just now entered into that phase. So we have $1 billion left of all authorizations in front of us. And as Steve suggested about the capital structure, we have ongoing discussions every quarter with the board and they'll continue to look at that on what the appropriate authorizations are to get us to 350 million...", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "So is that $1 billion as of April 1 or of today?", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley", "Today. As of today.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Rich, just on the pricing thing, back, I'm not sure that you caught the point on, first of all, the LTA pricing is below the company's average. The LTA customers are benefiting from our ability to line up our factories efficiently to meet the demand they're putting in front of us on a scheduled basis, which means then we can obviously deliver some of that cost savings to them. It's evidenced by a lower price to them. In addition, you need to recognize that we're overshipping the industry average capacity by 15%. So when you take the overall AUP deltas, either on average or if you then even apply it to the LTA customer, and then also take into effect the capacity difference, I mean, there is a very substantial savings to the LTA customer right now in terms of the pricing they're receiving.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross.", "Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Two questions, please. First of all, is there a way to put mix aside and talk about your manufacturing efficiencies exiting the quarter, versus, say, pre-flood levels? How much more improvements do you think you have to make relative to the supply chain and just your own internal production? And then secondly, Pat, could you just talk about your receivable days and it spiked up a little bit during the quarter versus sales growth. Where do you expect to see that, say, exiting the June quarter?", "William David Mosley", "Steven, this is Dave. I'll handle the new product yields first. Actually, we made appreciable progress in the last 6 months. While some of the time was, I'll say, slow time in manufacturing because of the flood, the new product yields improved quite substantially. I'm not happy. I'm never going to be totally happy with them but they're way ahead of plan right now and that's flowing through our numbers quite a bit. Are we done yet? There's a couple of product transitions that I think we still have yet to finish but I'd say, like we talked about last quarter, mission-critical, business-critical, those are the product transitions are complete now. The desktop transition is largely complete and we'll balance that as time goes on. And then notebook products are still in the process of transitioning. The notebook yields, though, I'm very happy with the progress we've made last quarter. So mix aside, I think in these products we're doing well.", "Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC", "But, in aggregate, you're saying there's more room to improve efficiency, say, over the next couple of quarters?", "William David Mosley", "Always, yes. I certainly think so. I mean, we still are not at some of the historical levels that I want to be at on some of these new products so there's work to do.", "Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC", "And then just, Pat, on the receivables?", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley", "As Steve alluded to about the January, when we looked at January production and as Dave talked about how we got much more operationally efficient, it was a great quarter from that aspect, but as you can imagine with that, we delivered a lot of product towards the end just because that's when it was coming online. So a lot of this was driven from linearity, not really Ts and Cs or anything like that. So I'd certainly target as we go through our growth curve, to get back to steady-state, that would be sub-50 and closer to historical, about 48 days. So I would expect to get those days working capital back, but this as a function of linearity and sort of the growth projection we had throughout the quarter.", "Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC", "And is that a reasonable target exiting June or is it going to take longer?", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley", "I think that's what we'd target to. I mean, June's always a fun quarter. But I think, as Dave's run the factory as it is [ph], I think we certain -- should target under 50 because it's running much more linear this quarter than it was last quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just a follow-up on that last question. First, I understand you saw operational efficiencies as you moved through the quarter, but did you also see some improvement in demand and pulls from your OEM customers that would be constructive on the overall demand environment moving into June?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Well, again, I don't want to talk too specifically about customers. I already made a comment about customers sets [ph], where we do believe that the OEMs are at least in this environment, taking share probably from the white box companies. So we did see that as an improvement in the quarter, Katy, because I don't think we had planned aggressively for it at the beginning of the quarter. And I think as the quarter evolves and they're gaining more confidence that, that may be a more sustainable share shift, then, yes, we do see strength there and that's one of the reasons I think that even for some of our products like in the notebook segment, we were continuing to chase demand for LTA customers through the quarter. And that's why I was saying in the scripted part of the call, that depending on how that plays out in the near term and long term, it may be kind of a structural shift that -- in our customer base that we'll have to adjust to.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And Pat, as DSOs normalize in the June quarter, can we get back to that $1 billion-plus quarterly free cash flow target that you had said back in January?", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley", "Yes, absolutely. I mean, right now, as you can imagine it, we're growing through the -- from going from 40 million units, to plus 60 to plus 70, we're chewing up working capital going there. But that's -- once it gets into, as Steve talked, as TAM stabilizes, our share stabilizes, we can run a fairly stable model.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rob Cihra with Evercore Partners.", "Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "I wonder if I could just ask a question on mission-critical, you said units were good and you said the industry looks almost fully recovered. I recognize it's not the easiest time to be probably looking at long-term trends. But if you look forward there, when you combine flash at the high end and then near-line growth, which has been obviously there's a lot more demand probably than supply right now at the low end, I mean, do you think of that mission-critical, traditional, 10K certainly 15K market being a growth market looking forward? Or is this kind of -- how do you look at that kind of beyond the next couple of quarters? Is there positive growth, negative growth?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "No, I think absolutely it's a growth market. I mean the enterprise -- the strain on the enterprise numbers, regardless of how you split it between mission-critical and business-critical, which gets  in the probably [ph] more art than science at this point. That's where all the petabyte growth is and whether or not it is private or public clouds to changing infrastructure that is back-end storage weighted. And as long as bandwidth keeps opening up, that's the architectural shift that's probably going to occur. So I think there's absolutely big growth and whether or not it's some sliver or Tier 0, that's SSD or bigger piece of Tier 0 that's hybrid or the rest of it, which is 95% of it, which is going to be rotating mass storage. That's just the big petabyte growth requirement that we're going to be chasing hard as an industry. In the enterprise, those numbers are probably in the 40% to 50% annual growth rates and their density growth, as you know, is half that. So that's a big puzzle for the industry to solve. And therefore, I think the demand requirements in the supply demand and balance is going to be something we're chasing for a while.", "Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "And within business-critical, do you see that as something that the industry gets back to recovery coming out of the June quarter or is that still you think a couple more quarters, because it seems to be still the tightest?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Well, it's hard for us to say because we're uniquely positioned there with a couple of products that are in very high demand that I mentioned, we're sole supplier on and just, architecturally, we will be for a good period of time. So there's a lot of growth in the cloud in the near-line business-critical space in general and then for our products in particular. So we're going to be running hard to meet that demand, I think, certainly through the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joe Yoo with Citi.", "Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Steve, I just wanted to get, I guess, back to the gross margin question. There has been some concerns that you are incurring some additional costs as you try to help the supply-chain in Thailand recover. I was just wondering how -- if any were of an impact to the gross margin that you posted this quarter and then if anything is embedded in the June quarter guidance?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yes, I mean, absolutely. We've done a lot to support the supply base in different forms that some of which have hit the gross margin line as you indicate. And yes, I mean, this is back to the point, this is a structural change and so we believe that will be structurally in place. This is how our industry supply-chain recovers and there's going to be costs that get capitalized throughout the supply chain that's going to be have to be absorbed by us and our Downstream customers. And that's the reality of a structural change. I don't know Dave, if you want to add anything else.", "William David Mosley", "I'll just say that the suppliers, in general, have done a nice job of trying to recover the volumes as well, which helps them quite a bit as they're pulling that structure back together as well.", "Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I guess more specifically, I'm just looking at the guidance and obviously, you want to provide a range, a pretty wide range, but just taking really the conservative route and going to 34.5%, a lot of what Steve has mentioned is actually positive. We could make a good case that gross margins could actually expand sequentially. So I'm trying to get a handle on what...", "Stephen J. Luczo", "That's why we raised the minimum from 33% to 34.5%, Joe.", "Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I mean, what is the biggest concern to gross margins, I guess, more directly to the June quarter?", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley", "I don't think it's concern as much as sort of opting...", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I guess I'm not understanding the question, Joe. We just said we raised our minimum guidance from 33% to 34.5%.", "Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I understand that and that's well taken. It's just that you posted 37.5% and you're saying at least 34.5% but as you know, a lot of people will just interpret that as 34.5%.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I'm not going to get in a dialogue about what people are going to say. We said, our minimum is 34.5% and we also gave you the pieces of what could put pressure on margin. I think it was the very first question. I don't know if you were on the call or not. If you weren't, I'll just repeat it briefly. One is that there seems to be a shift going on right now between OEMs and distribution. That's not clearly understood in terms of how long it's going to last. But to the extent that it's a more permanent shift and given the fact that distribution pricing is substantially higher than OEM, then that would obviously reduce in the lower margin structure. At Seagate, because of our share gains in notebook, as a result of the Samsung acquisition, our mix is basically increasing more notebook drives and that's putting margin pressure on us as well. And then to your point, we hope to offset that with mix up and with yield improvement. Did I miss anything?", "Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Fair enough. The other question's on share repo, to Pat, I wanted to get a sense of what -- how you see the pace of share repo for the next 3 quarters. Obviously, you bought a lot more than the normal pace in the first quarter -- first calendar quarter. So just get a gauge of how you plan to pace for the next 3 quarters.", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley", "Well, we target 350 million by the year end, if you want to do a linear basis, you can certainly model for that. That's probably the best way. I'm not looking to super time market. We have a plan in place, a structured plan, and we've been pretty regular about those purchases. So that would be the way I'd model it. Sometimes you might see a little different, but it's modeling a linear base is probably the fairest way.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with Noble.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "Just wanted to talk about this margin situation. You said that Samsung is going to try to be reducing them, but if you internally supply heads and media to Samsung in the long-term, won't that be a significant boost?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "We don't disclose what our long-term plans are with respect to internal heads and media, other than the high-level numbers that we give, Mark. As you know that today, those are heads that are supplied by TDK, you're right. I think you're also aware that we have a pretty significant partnership with TDK going forward and we expect to continue that. So all of that is taken into consideration. But I think the point more about Samsung was, is that overall, notebook margins are probably not the highest margin business that the carry, so to the extent that we increase our relative exposure there, that could put pressure on margins.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "There has been some debate recently, but you said the inventories in the channel are still fairly modest. Could you give us in terms of weeks, is it a week? Is it 2 weeks currently?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I think it's hard to say because it was so back-end skewed. The channel is kind of like the last customer base, if you will, to kind of get a flow of drive certainly from Seagate as we supported our LTA customers. And again, I think there's also this issue around, how much of the channel business is being fulfilled by the systems vendor. So it's not really a comment on the health of our channel partners because they're fine. They can either take drives and motherboards and sell them to white box companies or they can ship whole systems and there might be an argument that says they actually like shipping whole systems better. I think with the price deltas at the component level that we've seen going into the channel, that's provided an opportunity for the OEMs, and especially for the OEMs that have had supply visibility through the LTAs to gain share. How that plays out, I think, is a good question and we're just going to have to watch it. That's one of the issues around, if you will, supply in the channel. So we're watching it very closely and to the extent that we feel that the channel isn't moving the product, then we'll probably see that in the OEM side, because clearly, at the end of the day, all those bars and systems integrators need disk drives.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "Just finally, would it be fair to say that the channel's certainly below seasonable norms for this time of the year?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Scott Craig with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Two question on the OpEx for Pat. Pat, can you maybe take us through what sort of leverage you think you can get on the OpEx line here as you continue to move forward? And then secondly, maybe for Steve, from an Ultrabook perspective, if you want to call them that or thin and light, whatever the right terminology is, when do you think the hybrids really start to penetrate that market from a timing perspective?", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley", "On the OpEx, I think, actually we've leveraged it fairly well. We take a very minimal expense with the Samsung team and add that revenue fairly effectively. So at that $400 million level, I wouldn't say that's a high watermark, but we'll certainly target that model over the coming months to probably a year. And so there's some leverage capabilities in there but I think we've done a pretty good job in there. So we're not really looking to tune that up and shed anything significantly. In fact, we'd probably look at areas that we might need to make more investment but I think we could fit in that range of that $400 million. So I don't think that's anything that we're looking to take a big step function down.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I think in terms of thin and light, that we do believe that obviously is kind of a next generation of the notebook the next incarnation of the notebook. And we believe it's going to be a very successful form factor of product. And hybrid probably plays a very big role there and when that happens is clearly a function of when you can get MLC flash working in those products. Because then you're at a cost difference that's pretty compelling in terms of versus an SSD and the performance differential being negligible. And when does that happen, I think it starts happening at the end of this year, but in terms of volume shipments and adaptation, I think you're looking at calendar 2013.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.", "Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "A few questions. First, have you ever given us the breakdown in terms of the LTAs? What's the composition of OEM versus distribution?", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley", "No, we haven't but we just characterize the vast majority of our top customers, which you would think of large OEMs. But that's how we'd characterize it and I think that's probably the best way to think about it.", "Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then within that composition of being primarily OEM, has there been any one OEM or another that's take on a greater or less of that composition over the last, call it, 2 months? In terms of changes?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "What do you mean? I'm sorry.", "Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Let's say OEM A, maybe at one time they were 15% of the total base. Now they need a lot more from you. Now they sign on for even more LTAs. Now they're suddenly like 35% or 40% of that base. Are you seeing any sort of outsized changes or is it pretty linear?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "So there were different volume commitments by Seagate to different OEMs, which represented different percentages of what that OEM buys. So you're talking about percentages and absolute numbers here. So in some cases, we could have had a lower percentage but a bigger absolute number than this other guy that had a higher percentage, but a lower absolute number, right, depending on how big that customer was. The question is, have we seen general increase in demand by those LTA customers? And the answer is, yes. Has that been relatively stronger with certain customers than others? And the answer is, yes.", "Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "If I could do a follow-up to the yes and yes part. Within that context, are there any customers who are taking on more of the lower capacity versus higher capacity? I think probably at the lower capacity...", "Stephen J. Luczo", "No.", "Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I'm trying to get a sense in terms of gross margin  overage -- are you getting a better benefit from some of these customers versus others because of their shift to the lower capacity versus high-capacity or vice versa?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "No.", "Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then as far as just looking out here, trying to get a sense in terms of the significant amount of cash flow that Seagate has been generating. Do you guys feel that there's a need to accelerate some of these advanced technologies, pulling forward some of that move to hammer and other stuff just because you have such a great market position and cash flow position? Or is that kind of getting too cute?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Well, I don't know if it's getting too cute. I think it's just we're advancing those technologies as fast as we can right now. We weren't R&D expense or capital limited prior to this to driving that technology as fast as the technology will allow it to be driven. So we're still on that pace. I think the different question might be is there other technologies maybe not related to HDDs that we're looking at? That's a different question. But with respect to HDD technologies, it hasn't really changed the pace or the amount of investment that we're putting into our core underlying technologies or into our product development.", "Kate Scolnick", "Operator, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I wanted to ask about auctions, just some more color. What you learned? How frequent they'll be? And is it fair to assume that these auctions would impact the OEM distributor dynamic you talked about, Steve?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I'll let Rocky talk to you. Let me just give a general answer. I think it's -- this is still something that we're learning and we expect to kind of continue to learn from over a period of time. And so every quarter, we're trying something slightly different to see what works for us and what works for our customer. We get the feedback from our customers in terms of what they liked and what they didn't like and we try to make adjustments. And as a result of that, I don't think we want to get in a position of saying we're going to have fewer than or more than or whatever quarter-to-quarter because it really still is a learning process here. But in general, we've been very pleased with the results, both in terms of what we have learned every auction. You go into it expecting certain things. A lot of times you are right, sometimes you're wrong. You get to learn a few things you are wrong about. And I think in terms of validating that the marginal price of this technology is quite valuable. It's been proven out. And today, that's been done with products that maybe are not as scarce as some of our other products that we might auction going forward. So we get a better sense about the margin, what are some of our products worth that are very high demand. These are all the elements that we're testing out. And Rocky, would you want to add to that?", "Albert A. Pimentel", "Yes. It's an indication there. We're pretty excited about the results of the auctions we held this quarter. I would say that they exceeded our, going into the quarter, expectations. I think it's an indication of sort of creative thought that we continue to perpetuate across the management team at Seagate, developing a whole new sales channel that we see longer-term becomes an important information gathering point, as well as indicator around the market and the products we're offering. I think also we'll see it as a key tool in some of the spot market characteristics and behaviors, we'll have a better understanding of, as Steve talked about, the marginal value of key products, as well as what the behavior in the market is. So we're pretty excited about using this, one, again as another sales channel and two, as a realtime dynamic information validation tool.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And last question for me on Toshiba, they're obviously going to benefit from some regulatory stipulations here recently, but what are you seeing now and what do you expect? And is it still fair to assume a longer-term percent of the market at around 20% by units approximately?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Well, I think it's tough, especially if the TAM plays out to the 185 million going to 200 million in the next year, let's call it. That's 20% of that number is a long way away from where they're at today, which is a fairly substantial capital investment, which it's not clear that the parent companies' choices are going to be optimized around disk drive given all the other pressures that the Toshiba Corporation has relative to its competitive footprint on its real business. That being said, I think Toshiba is a very tough competitor. They do very well with certain products and we expect that they're going to continue to be a relevant player in the tune of 14% to 16% market share, which is still a nice business. But I think it's a little hard to see where the capital would come from to grow it to the numbers you're talking about. That would be 40 million units a quarter. That's a long way from home.", "All right. Thanks, everyone. I just wanted to comment that the company's performance during this unprecedented time has really put us on a course for continuing success and I really want to thank our employees and our customers, our partners and especially, our suppliers, as they work with us to recover, for their continued hard work and perseverance. We look forward to updating you on our longer-term strategic plan at our Analyst and Investor Meeting on September 21.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kate Scolnick, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, Kate.", "Kate Scolnick", "Good morning, and welcome to today's call. I'm joined today in Cupertino by Seagate CEO, Steve Luczo; CFO, Pat O'Malley; Dave Mosley, EVP of Operations; and Rocky Pimentel, EVP of Sales. We have posted our press release and detailed supplemental information about our fiscal first quarter 2013 on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com.", "During today's call, Steve will review the highlights from the September quarter and provide the company's outlook for the December quarter. After that, we will open up the call to questions.", "As a reminder, this conference call contains forward-looking statements, included, but not limited to, statements related to the company's historical and currently anticipated future operating and financial performance in the September quarter and thereafter, and includes statements regarding customer demand for disk drives and general market conditions.

Please go ahead, Steve.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Thank you, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'd first like to express our concern and sympathies to those that have been impacted by the storm on the East Coast and are enduring difficult times. I also want to thank all past and present Seagate employees, as well as local and central government officials in China, as we just celebrated the production of our 1 billionth drive from our China operations. We accomplished this remarkable feat in just 17 years, and we expect that the company will ship its 2 billionth disk drive this quarter. Congratulations to all involved.", "Seagate's first quarter results reflect strong operational performance as the company responded quickly to demand and product mix shifts in a challenging environment. We effectively adjusted production and maintained inventory turns in our target range and ended the quarter with inventory levels lower than the June quarter.", "For the September quarter, we achieved revenues of $3.7 billion, non-GAAP net income of $594 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.45. We maintained our commitment to returning value to shareholders with over 70% of the $1.1 billion in operating cash flow generated during the quarter, returned to shareholders through share redemptions and dividends. Over the last 3 quarters, Seagate's ordinary share count has been reduced by 17%, and dilution from options and equity awards has been reduced by 45%.", "As with most global technology companies, our financial performance is being impacted by a wide range of factors, including: sluggish macroeconomic growth in all major markets, as well as a slowdown in the BRIC economies; business-spending restraint related to the U.S. federal deficits and the upcoming fiscal cliff in the United States; supply chain and systems inventory adjustments by our major PC OEMs; weaker enterprise demand in Europe; adjustments to PC systems related to the Windows 8 release; changes in PC demand related to tablets; and lastly, the lack of significant product innovation in the notebook space. Due to these factors, the September quarter was more than seasonally back-end loaded, and the overall industry demand environment was approximately 10% lower than we had expected going into the quarter.", "Despite the reduced addressable market, we effectively balanced supply and demand, shipping approximately 43 exabytes of storage and maintaining market share. Our shipments into the client market declined 12% quarter-over-quarter, which is in line with unit declines reported by other technology companies in the PC space and slightly better than the decline reported in tablet sales.", "The enterprise market was weaker than we expected this quarter, down 26% sequentially. Despite the sequential reduction in the addressable market, on a year-over-year basis, Seagate grow unit shipments by 14% and increased average capacity per drive by 17% to 738 gigabytes.", "Non-GAAP product margins for the September quarter were 29%, which is at the midpoint of our long-term margin range of 27% to 32%, but was slightly below our expectations. The pricing environment and the benefit we received from cost improvements from product transitions were within the expected ranges for the quarter. However, sales volumes and mix from enterprise products were below expectations. In addition, margins on the sale of our products at Brazil were materially lower than we expected, impacting gross margins by approximately 100 basis points.", "As we discussed at our strategic update in New York a few weeks ago, as the hard drive industry has evolved and matured, it has improved its alignment of supply and demand, particularly in an environment such as the one we are in now, where demand is less than what the industry forecast and the industry and each company is capable of producing more drives than current demand requires.", "Seagate will continue to adjust in -- quickly adjust in-quarter production to align to the demand requirements we are experiencing. And we will manage our inventory aggressively, as evidenced in the September quarter. Further, we will reduce our capital expenditures and align our investments to meet near-term demand signals as opposed to deploying capital in anticipation of a recovery of demand. As a result, Seagate is in a better position to focus on effective supply and demand balances and financial model resiliency in both the near term, as well as with respect to long-term return on our research and development and capital investments.", "Looking ahead, we are approaching the December quarter conservatively based on current planning indications from a broad base of customers and on our current assessment of the following issues I previously outlined. In general, we remain concerned with global macroeconomic conditions. While we do see some signs of China stabilizing, we do not anticipate significant improvements to the current growth rates in China until late spring 2013. In the United States, it is uncertain that the fiscal cliff will be avoided. Regardless, large federal, state and local budget deficits will continue to weigh on growth prospects. We expect continued economic weakness in Europe.", "In addition to these economic concerns, we remain cautious in OEM demand as many customers are still working through client systems inventory balances. We expect enterprise demand to remain weak, particularly due to the enterprise markets' exposure to the European economies. We believe that tablet offerings will continue to evolve and may result in the notebook refresh cycle to lengthen, depending on macroeconomic conditions and competitive product offerings. We are optimistic that the wide variety of new notebook offerings, including thin and light systems, will result in renewed growth in this market over the next 12 months. We also remain optimistic about the long-term impact of Windows 8 and other operating systems that enhance the user experience by incorporating touch, keyboard, pen, voice and gesture.", "Based on all these considerations, our forecast for the December quarter assumes the market to be relatively flat sequentially. And as a result, we are continuing to constrain builds and manage inventory. Based on already completed negotiations associated with the current quarter, we expect that the ASPs will decline about 5%. We are currently forecasting second fiscal quarter revenues of approximately $3.5 billion, with margins at the lower end of our new long-term range of 27% to 32%.", "For the December quarter, we are planning for our operating expenses to increase slightly sequentially and reflect a full quarter of expenses from the acquisition of LaCie in our retail business. The vast majority of our capital expenditures continue to be used for maintaining our existing operations, including investments related to technology transitions as opposed to installing new capacity. We expect to maintain capital spending at or below our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue, including a replacement of our media R&D facility in Fremont, California in November.", "In terms of returning value to shareholders, we are planning to return approximately 70% of our operating cash flow this fiscal year through our share redemption program and dividends. We are maintaining our target for approximately $350 million ordinary shares outstanding at the end of the December quarter.", "In conjunction with our purchase of the Samsung hard drive business line last year, our shareholder agreement requires us to file an S-3 and register the 45.2 million shares we issued to them by September 19. Samsung has indicated that they intend to maintain their position in Seagate for the foreseeable future. And as a reminder, these shares were already reflected in our ordinary share count.", "Given the flat demand environment we are experiencing, as well as the uncertainty around the issues we discussed impacting demand, we expect to be in a better position to update our financial expectations for the fiscal year and calendar year when we report our second quarter fiscal results in January. With respect to price negotiations that will occur this quarter related to the March quarter, we expect that ASPs will remain relatively flat.", "We currently expect macro unpredictability and rapid technology and computer industry change to continue, and we continue to implement investment and business processes designed to build a business model with higher margins to withstand fluctuations in demand. We believe the best reflection of this effort is represented by the low end of our gross margin range being higher than the high end of our previous gross margin range.", "Data consumption and creation and global Internet connectivity growth continue to be very robust. At the same time, computing is changing fundamentally and at a rapid place, driven by open source software, cloud infrastructure and architectures, and mobility. Because of our leadership position in storage, we have a high degree of engagement with a wide spectrum of customers from end users to OEMs to cloud service providers. We are now on our third-generation, solid-state hybrid notebook drives, and we are expanding this technology into desktop and enterprise products. We also have new 7-millimeter and 5-millimeter products at customers for qualification and evaluation, which position us very well for the new thin and light notebook systems.", "In summary, we believe Seagate is well positioned to sustain strong financial performance in this challenging economic environment, as well as to address the opportunities associated with the needs of cloud computing and mobile connectivity.", "John, we're now ready to open up the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rob Cihra from Evercore Partners.", "Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "I just want to ask a question on the, I guess, the enterprise weakness or shortfall in the September quarter and then continuing to the December quarter. Maybe Steve or whomever. How much of that do you think is the market because you did cite Europe? And how much of that was sort of inventory drawdown, and where we are in that inventory drawdown process?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yes, it's the right question. And unfortunately, it's a little hard to see, because I think the third element that's probably playing into that is the architectural changes as well. We're definitely seeing more customers that are building various types of either private or public cloud infrastructures that are purchasing systems maybe away from the traditional OEMs, whether or not they're going directly or whether or not they may be buying architectures from smaller start-ups. But I think it's the right combination between people that acquired inventory in the March and June quarters in anticipation or concern around recovery still in enterprise from the supply chain disruptions caused by the flood combined with the slowdown. So I think there is an inventory overhang that's still being addressed. And then there's also, I think, some competitive issues where certain of the OEMs maybe just aren't having the sell-through that they thought they were, which may be related to macro or may be competitive issues. But it's definitely a combination of the 3 things of a changing customer base that's responding to a new architecture and then inventory absorption, as well as -- I do think the macro impact is significant, though I've been a little surprised that the European situation hasn't kind of shown its head earlier just because most of the enterprise companies still have somewhere between 25% and 40% of the revenue exposure in Europe, which is different than the client side or consumer technology companies.", "Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And I guess just, everything you just said, do you think that applies equally to mission critical and business critical, or is most of that more mission critical?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I think it applies equally. I think, probably, the comments around cloud service providers and architectures is probably more of a nearline business critical point than mission critical, but I think there basically was inventory buy-in on nearline as well. Again, a lot of the OEMs feed the cloud market as well, right? So I think it applies to both of them.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montr\u00e9al.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Steve, just want to try to get your take about the OEM inventory. I know you talked a little bit about inventory more broadly, but specifically at the OEM in the channel? And then I had a follow-up please.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Well, I think there's 2 levels of inventory, obviously, at the OEMs, right? One is the device level inventory and then the other is the system level inventory. And I think the comments I just made, I think, at the device level, I think there was probably a fair amount of buy-in really in the June quarter with still some concerns around the recovery of the drive industry. And then I think that, that buy-in happened to coincide with the slowdown that really started at the tail end of the June quarter. I mean to me, 2012 feels a lot like 2010, where we start getting this rollover in May and then things never recovered for the rest of the year. And I think for the OEMs, they were buying in inventory, and then things started to slow down. And it's always a little confusing in June when things slow down because it's the summer, and that's a typically slow period anyhow. And you hope it recovers in September. We really didn't see that recovery, and I think people, clearly, are grasping the macroeconomic issues a little better now as being more significant than maybe we thought 3, 4, 5 months ago. So I think at the OEM level, it's a combination of a lot of system inventory, and initially, in the summer, and device inventory. Then I think probably, trying to bleed down that inventory in anticipation of Windows 8. Clearly, people are trying to get lean on how many of the old systems they're carrying in order to be prepared to ramp as Windows 8's released. And then depending on the robustness of demand for Windows 8, I think they'll be able to respond. So I think it's -- again, I think it's a similar story, just different reasons, maybe more related to Windows as opposed to cloud architecture changing.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "But in terms of just run rates, do you feel like their finished goods inventory and/or channel is at a point where the ships of your drives will match whatever their end demand is? So do you think things are kind of evened out? I know it's hard to see.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Well, I think the channel actually feels better to me, if you're talking about -- the distribution channel, with respect to device level technology, feels better. Our position is about 1 million units less than it was last quarter and within our range of 4 to 6 weeks. I'm not that concerned about the distribution channel. I think in the OEMs, there's -- depending on the customer, there's probably still some work to be done. I would say at the margin, I feel -- I wish inventories at the customer level were a little lower, both on the systems side probably and the device side. So again, that's one of the reasons that's weighing on our flat TAM assumption. I think probably end user TAM is actually probably going to grow by low-single digits or maybe even mid-single digits. But I still think there's inventory adjustments to be had.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. My follow-up, then I'll cede the floor is -- Steve, you mentioned you thought ASPs in the March quarter would be flat. I just wanted to see if you could flush that out a little bit. It would be unusual relative to history for those March quarter ASPs to be flattish. Just curious, a little bit of feedback.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Thank you. Well, yes, the difference in history, I suppose, is the structure of the industry. I think the major point that we're trying to convey is in -- this quarter is when we negotiate prices for next quarter. So if you think about it in reverse, for the quarter we're in now, we negotiated those prices in September or late August. And I would say that I kind of feel that the December pricing probably got away from us just a touch with the demand falling off as much as it did in September. And trying to, I think, recognize what was the real TAM going to be for the December quarter, I think the industry and probably our customers were hoping that it was going to be more in the 150 or 155 range. So I think the industry is probably recognized that the March quarter is likely to be pretty flat to or maybe marginally up. And that we're really not going to buy TAM with pricing. And so I think, we've obviously gotten to pricing levels that are as low as we want to see them if we're bumping on the bottom end of our range. And so, it's important for us to make sure we maintain discipline going forward, so we can get our R&D and capital investments where we want for the long term. So that's the way we're going to approach the March quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Fox from Cross Research.", "Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC", "A couple of questions. First of all, just further on the March pricing and looking forward. Can you sort of describe what kind of mix you anticipate in March, how much that's helping the overall ASP? And then secondly, Steve, you talked a lot about macro pressures that are hard to figure out when they're going to end and so on. If this goes on, say, for 9, 12 months, is there plans to take capacity down? Or do you think you're comfortable operating in these margins on the capacity level as you've got currently?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Thanks, let me just make some notes, so I don't forget. On the first thing, on March pricing, I think, Steven, the mix assumptions -- look, we've been kind of off on mix for a couple of 3 quarters in a row here where the mix assumptions we've had, basically, don't come to fruition. And part, I think, is that's just because the pressure that the systems vendors are under to maintain margins. I think mix is -- the assumptions for mix are basically pretty conservative for the March quarter. So if there was actually an improvement in mix, which would be what we would hope, especially if there's any sort of recovery in March on the enterprise, then I think that the relatively flat ASPs, hopefully, will prove to be conservative. So we have tried to, at least this time, assume a pretty conservative view on mix, to say relatively flat ASPs, because as you know, obviously, with new products coming on and mix improving, it actually probably increase ASPs. On the macroeconomic situation and how long does it have to last for it to be really painful. That's a good question. And I would say if we had -- I guess, the question is do you have clarity on that it's going to be 9 to 12 months. If we knew it was going to be flat and weak for the next 9 to 12 months, we'd probably do one set of things. But if you're kind of making that decision quarter-to-quarter, you have a little bit less flexibility, obviously. But to answer your question, I think the good news is for the drive industry, or certainly, for Seagate, and I guess getting to be that way for WD and Hitachi, is for us, it's about absorbing heads and disks really. It's where most of our R&D and where most of our capital is deployed. And as long as we're absorbing heads and disks at these levels, we're okay. And if we had to reduce drive output, that's actually fairly easy capital for us to address, in part, because a lot of it is test capacity, which we can actually increase test times and also with aerial density -- sorry, with average capacity per drive increasing, test times are increasing anyhow. So in a certain sense, as challenging as the environment is, I'd say for the drive industry, given the aerial density and the petabyte growth, it's manageable. Now if TAMs dropped to 120 million units, that's a different story. Then the industry would probably have to take a hard look at a lot of things with respect to internal components and supply, as well as drive level capacity. But I'd say right now for us, while we're operating well below our theoretical capacity, we can maintain the margin structures and the cost objectives that we have at this level of demand, even if it lasted 9 or 12 months.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "Steve, two if I could. I guess the first one is regarding the gross margin and ASP guidance in December quarter. I guess I was thinking, if prices were coming down about 5%, that gross margins would be able to be stable, more or less. I mean is that just -- sort of typically, not the right sort of assumption? Or is there something going on with mix that's baked into that -- to the gross margin guidance as well? And then I have a follow-up.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yes, like I said, I think we've been pretty conservative on mix. But again, price erosion is a tricky little term in the drive industry that's, unfortunately, got a legacy that went back to when there was only about 5 different products as opposed to 700 different products. So we like to talk more in terms of ASPs. So you're generally right though that if it was a 5% price erosion that the ASPs probably wouldn't erode by 5%, and gross margins would be healthier. So price erosion is higher than 5%, ASP erosion will be about 5%. And if mix improves either within each category, right -- mix meaning capacity per drive, if you will, or heads and disks per drive, or if the mix improves in terms of enterprise nearline versus client, notebook and desktop, those are all things obviously that boost ASPs. We've taken a pretty conservative approach, as I said on the enterprise market opportunity, in part because of the inventory and in part because of European concerns.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "And just as a follow-up, you've been pretty consistent or very consistent, I should say, on capital allocation through this calendar year. Can you give us some sense of what capital allocation could look like as we get into '13? I believe you have some stipulations around some NOLs. So was interested in sort of getting your thoughts on how that might impact any of the capital allocation.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "It doesn't change the long-term capital allocations, where we still believe that we're going to target a heavy return of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends or redemption. And of course, we've got the 2014 end of year target of $250 million ordinary shares outstanding. So what happens in 2013 though, as you pointed out, is we do run into a Section 382 problem where, if we redeem too many shares, it could trigger a loss of our NOLs, which are fairly substantial. And we'd rather avoid doing that, not that we've used NOLs or necessarily see any need to use NOLs. But it's nice to have them in case you need them. So we'll probably be reasonable in sidestepping that problem, unless the value proposition is just too great, in which case, obviously then, we'll go ahead and buy our stock and deal with losing NOLs that we may or may not need. So what that would mean obviously is a slowdown in redemption in 2013 and then an acceleration in 2014 to get to our target. And in the meantime, obviously, maintaining our dividend policy, which is, as we said, a minimum increase, targeted increase of 10% per year.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "Got it. Is there any sort of level that we should expect the redemptions to sort of settle in at as we get into '13?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "They're pretty minimal for '13.", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley", "It's really for 9 months of '13. In the December quarter of 2013, some of the limitations ease. But for the remainder, the first 9 months of calendar 2013, they will be pretty minimal.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "The only thing that can also change that is there are certain holders of securities that we can buy from and not trigger a 382 problem, if you will. Not to imply that anything our government does to us is a problem. But one of those would be Samsung. So if Samsung decided to sell any shares, we could acquire from Samsung and not run into a 382 problem. There are also a couple of institutional holders that we can buy shares from and also not trigger it. So we have a couple other options, but we'll just have to see how it unfolds.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I appreciate the detail on the hybrid drive progress. I know you mentioned the 5-millimeter and the 7-millimeter being in the process of being qualified with some OEMs. Can you give us an update on where you are with hybrids? Have you shipped any into new products, or is this really more of a 2013 thing?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "It's calendar 2013. So I think by the end of this calendar year, we're going to have hybrid offerings; CTU level, at least, with a lot of major customers, so that would, Sherri, include desktop and enterprise. The 7-millimeter hybrid's getting a lot of attention, which would be a drive that would be used in thin and light. 5-millimeter is not a hybrid, the first version, that would be later. But we think there's lots of interesting applications for 5-millimeter regardless. And I'd say where I'm most excited is the attention that the hybrid in enterprise is getting at a couple of accounts, because you basically can boost IOPS performance by 2x to 3x, which in a lot of applications, IOPS is the measure that they're most concerned about. So we have a couple of large enterprise customers that are very interested in the product, and that's probably the one I'm most excited about. So that's all stuff that we would expect to be ramping in calendar 2013, but some of those even in the first half.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, and then just a quick question on share count. I think the share count was a bit different this quarter than, at least, we had expected. What is the assumption for share count in the December quarter? I know you've given a 350 million by the end of the year, but what type of average should we use for the quarter?", "Patrick J. O\u2019Malley", "I'd use 390 million shares. That may be slightly conservative, depending on the pace we buy to get to 350, but I'd plan for that, Sherri.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Two if I can. I just want go back to the March discussion. Understanding that you are going to be more disciplined relative to December on pricing, is your assumption also, as we work through this OEM inventory that -- what's your assumption around the industry demand TAM or the shipment numbers going into the March quarter? Are we to assume a flat sequential TAM, or do we expect -- I think it's hard to try and judge what normal seasonality is anymore?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yes, I mean flat. I mean people can get all hung up on 10 million units these days. But the reality is, 10 million units, when you think about our 42% market share, is 4 million units, which I think we could probably respond to in about 1.5 days, so it's not a big deal, right? Whether or not I say 140 or 150, while some analysts may get all exercised about that, the reality is it's the same number from an operations perspective. So I would assume a flat TAM, whether or not that means 140 or even 155, I think is possible. Like I said, I think the December system sales will probably actually be up. My guess is 3% to 7%, but I think we're not going to see it just because of inventory absorption. So that may mean real TAM for December, in terms of sales out of systems in the 150 range, in which case, then March probably, for us, sales will be like that. So that's what we're assuming, but it doesn't really matter. The point is, capacity is way above that. Capacity is 170, so you're not going to pick up anything. You're not going to pick up 30 million units with pricing. The issue is not pricing of systems. The issue is macroeconomic conditions. So the TAM's 140. We'll build whatever it is, 56 million drives, and we're going to price them so we can maintain the margins that we need to invest in our business long term.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Very helpful. And as a follow-up, you guys had the Analyst Day on September 21. You talked about roughly a 30% gross margin. I'd like to understand, I know it's just a week or so left in the quarter, what changed relative to that? I think you also had made a comment about Brazil having 100 basis points impact. I don't know if that was really the driver. I'd like to understand why that changed in the final week or so of the quarter.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Sure. I don't know if you had heard the earlier comments that I made, but the quarter was really back-end loaded, much more so than -- more so than even is typical for a September. And September's a pretty back-end loaded quarter anyhow as you know. July is usually very weak, August is weak, almost through the entire month. And then it's this race to the finish, and it was even more seasonally back-end loaded. So we had a lot of drives to ship. We looked at historical seasonality, and basically, the quarter didn't come through. So part of it was just related to the overall weakness in demand that basically never really kind of resolved itself.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "The Brazil issue?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "So part of it was mix. Again, enterprise mix at the end didn't come in where we thought it would. So again, we have a lot of historical data about what happens with enterprise shipments through the quarter. They're typically even more back-end loaded than client. And so they didn't resolve as much, and the mix wasn't as good. So that was the second thing. And then you have Brazil was like 100 basis points. So I mean even with the first 2 items, we would have hit the 30%, if it wasn't for the Brazil issue. And that was basically a function of -- it's a fairly complicated story. But in Brazil, there is a requirement that if you are building computer systems in Brazil, a certain number or a certain percentage of the components have to be purchased in-country. And we've invested a fair amount of money, in part, as an extension of the investments that Samsung had to make sure that we can actually provide in-country-built drives. Our estimation of what that business should have been in the last couple of quarters was high, and we're still digging into why that is. But as a result, the pricing that we deployed was too aggressive because we didn't get the absorption that we should have. So we've made the adjustments in terms of our expectations. We'll make adjustments in terms of pricing. And we won't get all of that 100 basis points back next quarter, but we think -- this quarter, but we'll probably get half of it back, and then we should kind of be through that knothole [ph].", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes from Barclays.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I was wondering 2 things. You said OpEx is going to be up sequentially slightly. I was wondering how you were thinking about that lever. I think you mentioned that you didn't want to cut product development, but if things were to get particularly difficult, what are you thinking about the OpEx  lever, and what could you do? And I have a follow-up.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Well, we could do a lot on OpEx, as you know, Ben. I think the only thing that's really driving -- and that would again be if we had a forecast of a sustained environment that's a lot worse than this. Again, I'm not going to cut OpEx when we're running at margin levels, like I said, that are higher than what the high end of our old range was. If this is what bad is, we can live with it and continue to invest. The biggest thing driving the increase in the OpEx right now is we hadn't done a focal increase really for a couple of years. And so we're doing a focal increase on comp. And the second is LaCie acquisition brings some OpEx into the model that wasn't there previously. So we know how to manage OpEx if things get bad and stay bad, but I don't think we're near that right now. But we do planning all the time.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "My follow-up is on enterprise. Within your TAM estimate, I think you're saying there's continued pressure into the fourth quarter. And just within enterprise, if you wouldn't mind, what are you seeing into December and then into March in terms of TAM? And how we balance the inventories there, just in enterprise, in particular?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yes, again, we're maintaining a pretty conservative outlook in December and March. Our issue around enterprise, or I think, the technology industry's issue around enterprise is, in my opinion, more related to European situation and weakness in economy just because Europe plays a big role in enterprise purchases, as do governments. And there's obviously more and more policies around austerity, which ultimately means fewer purchases by government. So I think we're just being conservative, there's not going to be much of a recovery, Ben, for a couple of quarters.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So it's like in line with your TAM estimate, just flat and flat kind of is best guess for now?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yes, that's right.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jayson Noland from Robert Baird.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I wanted to ask about, Steve, your comment on balancing supply and demand, strong inventory management and gross margin performance relative to pre-consolidation, especially considering linearity. If you can talk about balancing supply with these conditions, it just seems like Seagate and the industry are more nimble today.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yes, well, I think Seagate is. I mean if you look at our inventory position, I think it's -- to have less inventory than we did in June, in a quarter that fell off pretty dramatically relative to expectations, I feel that the company responded pretty well. I think linearity is a different issue. I think -- I still think that we and our customers have a lot of work to do around linearity and velocity. And Dave Mosley can talk just a little bit, with Rocky. I mean we're doing a lot of -- it's funny. The flood, for all of its challenges, also, I think, resulted in some really good business process improvements between us and our customers in order to reduce inventory and increase velocity. Some customers are continuing with that. Others are going back to their lazy ways that basically somehow revolve around carrying a lot of inventory to solve business process problems. And I just don't think that's healthy. I think our industry's got to address that with our customers that at the end of the day, that's not good for anybody. So the only way we can really do that is keeping a really tight control on builds. Dave's done a lot of work in this area on the supply chain side, all the way through demand fulfillment. So maybe I'll just ask him to talk to you a little bit, and then Rocky can weigh in on what he's seeing on the customer side in terms of those that are kind of moving towards a model that is maybe more focused on velocity versus inventory.", "William David Mosley", "First of all, product simplification happens, which we've been working really hard, especially through the product transitions that we went through. That helps it straight out of the factories. And then working with our customers to develop hubs that make sense versus hubs that are spread all over the place where we can late-stage postpone some of the configuration issues that they need out the field. With product simplification, that's helping us quite a bit. And then once you get those hubs set up, you can take advantage of [indiscernible]. So I think there's a lot of things that we're doing around that, working with some of the customers that have really kind of come to the table after the flood that Steve talked about that's really paying good benefits efficiency wise. Rocky?", "Albert A. Pimentel", "And I think that cross-functionally, Dave and I working together on the business process, I think on the sales side, the management of customers' week-to-week demand and polls, et cetera, we've made a lot of improvements to really get down and focused on those key customers that really move the needle. And working with manufacturing, I think we've really improved the business process of the supply chain with the customers and holding the customers accountable for their commitments. And I think it's resulted in that efficiency you've seen in inventory. It's a continued battle every week-to-week in the volatility to the market we're in. But I think that, again, we made some really fundamental advancements in our cross-functional management of the supply chain through customer fulfillment.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "And we just have to be more disciplined. One of the things we're doing internally, Jayson, is we're actually changing our sales comp programs to be rewarded on basically, forecast accuracy and linearity, which is not something that typically we had done, not certainly at the level or priority that we're going to do it now. And the other again is just working with customers. I mean we had a customer last week that made a big change order on enterprise from one product to another. And we try to explain to them why that was difficult. And the response was, well, it's just a mix change. As if you just wave a wand over these drives and somehow make them something different. So it's just a different dialogue that has to occur that look, if you order one of these things, then we're building it for you and you're buying it. And if you're not, then there's going to be a penalty associated to it, not that we'll just swap these things out, like you can go to the hardware store and decide you want 1/4 inch screws instead of 3/8. So a lot of work the industry has to do, I think, to got the right discipline in.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Cindy Shaw from DISCERN.", "Cindy Shaw - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc", "I've been hearing from some of my industry contacts that they're seeing the enterprise systems ship with just less capacity of drives and more empty drive space. And we can speculate as to a number of reasons as to why that might be up -- going on. But I was wondering if you can comment on, are you seeing that? And if you are, what do you think might be behind it?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I don't know that we're seeing that. But what I guess would be behind it is customers that hope that they can buy directly instead of buying racked-out systems that they're paying a huge markup on disk drives for. But I don't know that they can really do that, because if they're buying from OEMs, the OEMs really control that through their maintenance and service contracts. So you can't really buy a system and then buy drives from Seagate if you're buying a system from a traditional OEM because then your service contract typically is invalidated. So no one's willing to do that. So we haven't really seen that. But I do think that if you weren't talking about OEMs, I mean, I do think, architecturally, that's happening, that people are starting to design systems where they can incrementally add the storage they need. If those aren't really necessarily through the OEMs. I think it's -- that's more some of the new architectures.", "All right. Well, on behalf of the entire management team, I'd like to thank all of our employees and customers and partner suppliers and shareholders for your support and commitment, and best of luck to everyone on the East Coast as you recover from the storm.

My name is Keith, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Kate Scolnick, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Kate.", "Kate Scolnick", "Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to today\u2019s call. Joining me today in Cupertino are Seagate\u2019s CEO, Steve Luczo; CFO, Pat O\u2019Malley; and EVP of Sales and Marketing, Rocky Pimentel. On the line we also have EVP of Operations; Dave Mosley; CTO, Bob Whitmore; and EVP and General Counsel, Ken Massaroni.", "We have posted our press release and detail supplemental information about our fiscal second quarter 2013 on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com.", "During today\u2019s call, we will review the highlights from the December quarter and provide the Company\u2019s outlook for the March quarter. After that, we will open up the call to questions.", "As a reminder, this conference call contains forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, statements related to the Company\u2019s historical and currently anticipated future operating and financial performance in the March quarter and thereafter, and includes statements regarding customer demand for disk drives and general market conditions.", "These forward-looking statements are based on information available to Seagate as of the date of this conference call, and are subject to a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements.", "Such risks and uncertainties such as global economic conditions and other factors may be beyond the Company\u2019s control and may pose a risk to the Company\u2019s operating and financial performance. Information concerning additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements are contained in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on August 8, 2012 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as filed with the SEC on October 31, 2012.", "These forward-looking statements should be relied upon as representing the Company\u2019s view as of any subsequent date and Seagate undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Luczo. Please go ahead, Steve.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Seagate\u2019s second quarter results reflect strong operational performance as we continue to manage through a challenging demand environment. For the December quarter, we achieved revenues of $3.7 billion, non-GAAP net income of $525 million, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.38.", "We generated $844 million in operating cash flow and returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through share redemptions and dividends. In December, we raised our quarterly dividend 19%, and in the first half of fiscal 2013, Seagate has returned over 95% of operating cash flow and over 100% of free cash flow to shareholders.", "Our business environment continues to be impacted by a wide range of macroeconomic, spending and demand challenges. Industry shipments declined 3% sequentially in the December quarter to approximately 135 million units. This decline was primarily driven by the notebook market as all other segments demonstrated quarter-over-quarter growth.", "The overall industry demand environment was slightly lower than what we had expected. By executing effectively in response to in quarter upsides from our customers, our market share grew to near the higher end of our market share expectations.", "We effectively balance supply and demand with finished goods inventory levels decreasing over 10% from the prior quarter. For the December quarter, we shipped over 47 exabytes of storage with an average of approximately 823 gigabytes per drive. This reflects a 59% year-over-year exabyte growth, which is well over twice the current rate of areal density growth.", "Gross margins for the December quarter were 27.6% within both our expectations and our long-term margin range target. The pricing environment and the benefit we\u2019ve received from cost improvements from product transitions were also within the expected ranges for the quarter. Product mix improved slightly in the quarter.", "Operating expenses in the December quarter were $437 million, including a $21 million benefit from legal costs reimbursements. We are focused on effectively aligning our operating expense to support a broader product portfolio of storage devices, including hybrid and solid state drives, software, other devices, and services. We believe these additional investments will support our continued leadership in the storage market and effectively align us with the rapid advancements in mobility, cloud, and open source initiatives.", "We also continue to make strategic investments that position us for the future success in new storage applications. As an example, today we announced the strategic relationship with Virident Systems Inc., a performance leader in flash-based storage-class memory solutions. The company\u2019s plan to jointly deliver solutions for the fast growing PCIe storage market and most immediately, we will offer a complete line of flash-based PCIe solutions to our OEM and distribution partners, powered by Virident.", "Longer term, we plan to jointly create next generation hardware and software solutions for the solid state storage market. We also made an strategic equity investment in Virident. Virident products are highly regarded for their industry leading performance, reliability and capacity. This is another example that accelerates our strategy to offer our customers a complete line of solid state products across all markets.", "Now I\u2019ll provide our view for the March quarter and some context related to our outlook. Based on current planning indications from a broad base of customers and our assessment of the global macro economic conditions, we are continuing to manage our business cautiously. While customer demand visibility remains challenging, we expect the industry to continue to balance supply effectively and maintain relatively stable pricing.", "For the March quarter, unit shipments in the first few weeks of the month of January have been linear and have trended higher than the beginning of the December quarter. Our outlook reflects an addressable market that is flat to down sequentially, and we are currently forecasting March quarter revenues of approximately $3.25 billion to $3.45 billion.", "We continue to focus on the quality of our business versus absolute unit shipments. And at the low end of our revenue guidance, we have a conservative view of in quarter upsides. We expect to maintain gross margins at the lower end of our long term range of 27% to 32%.", "Seagate remains focus on sustaining profitability in the current demand environment and investing to continue to be a storage leader. We are targeting non-GAAP operating expenses to be relatively flat sequentially, which should then directionally decline in the June quarter.", "As we\u2019ve said over the last few quarters, Seagate is maintaining capital expenditures to meet narrow term demand signals as opposed to deploying capital and anticipation of our recovery of demand. The vast majority of our capital expenditures continue to be used for maintaining our existing operations and our current technology transitions. We expect to maintain capital spending at or below our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue.", "In light of the gap between areal density growth and petabyte growth and the resultant upward pressure this puts on average capacity per drive shipped. We believe that this approach to capital provide support for our long-term gross margin expectations.", "Delivering value to our shareholders continues be an important objective with Seagate. Through the share redemptions we have made this fiscal year and through our quarterly dividends, we are on track to return approximately 70% of operating cash flow and 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2013.", "The next few years in the storage industry will present new and significant opportunities for Seagate. Data consumption and creation, along with the increase of global internet connectivity continue to drive petabyte growth at rates that are significantly greater than the areal density growth rate.", "At the same time, open source software, cloud infrastructure and architectures, and mobility are fundamentally reducing the overall cost of computing and extending its deployment.", "In addition, the new touch-enabled thin and light systems, along with Win 8 should be increasingly compelling in the client market. These dynamics should provide significant benefits for Seagate and the storage device industry. As such, we remain optimistic about the second half of calendar 2013 and beyond.", "Keith, we\u2019re now ready to open up the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. (Operator Instructions) And your first question is from the line of Rob Cihra with Evercore Partners. Please go ahead.", "Rob Cihra \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Hi. Thanks very much. I was just wondering with the enterprise was clearly better than expected in the quarter versus when you went into the quarter, and I know we are going through inventory correction that really hit in the September quarter. Did you think that the upside particularly in near line was reflecting better end demand or was it really just a timing we\u2019re coming out of a inventory correction and we\u2019re just sort of correcting a little better and quicker than we thought, or do you think, I guess end demand was stronger than expected? Thanks.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I think demand continues to increase in the near line space. I mean that\u2019s where the vast majority of the companies that are providing cloud infrastructure, purchase those types of devices, so as the cloud deployments continue, that market continues to grow. And I think in Seagate case, we did execute well in terms of in quarter upside there as well.", "Rob Cihra \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Okay. And then if I get a follow-up i'm not sure if I do, but I will ask one, may be I\u2019m curious with LTAs as a run through here into that beginning of calendar 2013, any expectation that they impact your pricing or market share, or do you think they really don\u2019t have as much impact as maybe people think, or do you think they do? Thanks.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I know I do what people think, but the LTAs again provided favorable pricing to the OEMs in the supply-constrained environment, substantially lower priced in the spot market would have provided at the time. And it was to align the longer-term purchase requirements of those customers with our supply situation. A number of those agreements have been extended. Others originally extended beyond this calendar year, last calendar year and this calendar year. So I don\u2019t see any big changes as a result of the constant evolution of the LTA agreements.", "Rob Cihra \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.", "Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. The question is on the TAM, if I compare the peak industry TAM about four or five quarters back, and with this quarter or the guided quarter for the March, it seem the industry and Seagate is operating less than 80% utilization. So I would like any comments thoughts about right sizing the capacity?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Well, I think our businesses isn\u2019t as simple as just taken the TAM and the number of units. So you have to take into consideration the nature of the devices so to split between client and enterprise and then the capacity per drive. So with average capacity per drive increasing the way it is, that\u2019s absorbing head and disks, which is a very good thing for a vertically integrated drive company. And with average capacity per drive continue to increase, that also absorbs test capital.", "So our most expensive capital deployments are in heads and disks and test, and our most expensive R&D is in heads and disks. So as we continue to drive more heads and disks per platform, it\u2019s actually not a terrible situation in terms of being a flat TAM or slightly eroding TAM. That being said, clearly TAM growth would be a good thing in terms of a final assembly, but with the average capacity per drive right now, our factories are running at levels obviously it allow us to maintain these margins, and we are not considering any sort of reduction in sale just because our longer-term outlook obviously is different than what the situation looks like today is.", "As you know, we believe that by the end of the decade there is going to be a significant demand for petabyte shift and that will evidence itself in unit growth, as well as average capacity per drive, so we don\u2019t want to take capital a lot right now.", "Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Okay, thanks. Just the last question on the Virident acquisition, a very interesting acquisition there, could you maybe talk about the Virident\u2019s current customers and kind of any of the traction where you would see in the market?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yeah, it was an investment.", "Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Yes, sorry, yeah, I misspoke.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "And I\u2019ll let Rocky talk to the details of it. I\u2019ll just provide a brief little overview that is consistent with how we approach the emerging solid state market, which is developing nicely. And we believe that we have to participate in a variety of segments that we feel very good about our position. On the enterprise SaaS side with our partnership with Samsung, the PCIe space is clearly an attractive one. And we feel this partnership is going to allow us to address the needs of our OEM and distribution customers, and then we are doing things on the clients\u2019 space that we have talked in prior calls.", "Albert \u201cRocky\u201d Pimentel", "Yeah, I mean I think Steve just covered it. It\u2019s really another step in completing the platform for solid state storage that Seagate wants to offer alongside of its traditional magnetic core storage side. I think we\u2019re pretty excited about this engagement with Virident, not only to we have a strong go-to-market initiative, but also strong development initiative forward. And so as a result, we\u2019ll have a stack of SSD solid state solutions that span from the client all the way through to the flash server, high application, data demands of the massively scale data center.", "Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securities. Please go ahead.", "Shebly Seyrafi \u2013 FBN Securities", "Very much. So it looks like your guiding down \u2013 revenue down 9% sequentially and that\u2019s worse than what I have in Western Digital down 3% sequentially. Maybe you can talk about why you think you\u2019re going to go down more, are you being more price aggressive than them? And also relates to this on the gross margin, do you expect to get a mix benefit in the March quarter, you had one in December just now, and with the lower revenue and perhaps no mix benefit, is there a possibility that it goes below your target of 27%?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I\u2019m sorry, what was the last part of that?", "Shebly Seyrafi \u2013 FBN Securities", "The possibility of the gross margin goes below the 27%, what was your target range?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I think we already indicated what we thought our gross margin is going to be, so I\u2019m not going to repeat that. On the first one, I\u2019m not sure what Western Digital\u2019s revenue decline was. I thought at the midpoint it was closer to 6% not 2%. But and for us I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re in the first part of the call where we indicated that we\u2019re also at the near of the high end of our market share in the December quarter as a result of some really good in quarter execution to customer upsides.", "At the low end of our range, we haven\u2019t modeled that type of performance again, we typically don\u2019t model that. So I think that the outlook for the markets, we maybe a touch more conservative in TAM than our competitors and coming off of the higher market share. We may have some small market share loss if we don\u2019t get the in quarter upside like we did. But in general, I think it\u2019s a fairly consistent, okay.", "Shebly Seyrafi \u2013 FBN Securities", "Just a quick one on Virident, right, can you talk about the opportunities with Web 2.0 customers?", "Albert \"Rocky\" Pimentel", "Well, we definitely think are the huge opportunity with Web 2.0 customers. When you actually look at the index that we manage to of our direct cloud-based customers, that share the business or that portion of our business grew strong double digits quarter-over-quarter, and certainly the Virident product solution is a very pertinent solution for the hyper-scaled cloud providers.", "Shebly Seyrafi \u2013 FBN Securities", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead.", "Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Just one question from me, Steve, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your average capacity per drive, the recent trends are up again from like about 832, I think you said in a release from 802. You exited like fiscal 2011 like less than 600. I\u2019m just curious, can you talk about what\u2019s different between the first for this fiscal year versus maybe in the first half of last fiscal year, and then how you see that progressing and what are the key drivers over the next few quarters? Thanks.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I think if we go back further than that, Steven, I think of it kind over a four-year trend and the average capacity per drive is kind of gone from mid 20s to mid 30s to mid 40s to mid 50s. And whether or not it goes to mid 60s, I guess we can argue about. But even at these rates given where areal density is, it\u2019s a good thing for the drive industry, because what we do is we ship petabytes, how we package them is probably the easiest thing that we\u2019re faced with, driving areal density and then of course managing our capital deployment and matching up with our customer needs architecturally is where a lot of our work goes. So I don\u2019t see it slowing down.", "I just think if the \u2013 know if the silicon folks can keep on track in terms of reducing the cost of silicon and the software people can continue to develop nice portable easy open code, then we\u2019re going to see device proliferation in the client side, especially in the mobile space continue to grow and hopefully we go from 1.7 billion people connected to 2.7 billion connected and sharing all sorts of rich content which is what we hear about.", "We do believe that to give people the user experience that they probably deserve at the edge, there is an opportunity for HDDs to play a greater role in some of the mobile devices and we\u2019re pursuing those discussions but clearly the backend infrastructure to support that type of data growth is a big opportunity for us. I don\u2019t see it slowing down if anything I see it accelerating.", "Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research", "And do you see\u2026", "Stephen J. Luczo", "If you go to high frame rate video, you go to 4K video, I mean these imply, movies today in HD are 20 to 30 gigabytes and 4K that\u2019s just average frame rates is 100 to 200 gigabytes. So it just gives you a feel for the challenges we have gone for to provide storage people are going to need.", "Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research", "So all that applies and given some of your previous comments that you are thinking at both the enterprise and clients side can grow capacities at a similar rate going forward, or is it a one that\u2019s going to grow faster?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Depends on the application, enterprise has to be split, I think, in the mission critical enterprise versus maybe call service provider or content. If you are in an archiving mode, then clearly we believe that there are architectures we can deploy that drive capacity per drive. But if you are in the pure mission critical, you have a performance constraint that always has to be bought about. So it just depends on the application.", "Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research", "Fair enough. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel Nicolas. Please go ahead.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolas", "Yeah. Thanks for taking the question guys; one on gross margin and a follow-up on the Virident acquisition. First on the gross margin line, can you just clarify how much benefit you got back from the Brazil situation last quarter? And then also as you think about people looking at these models on a capacity shift versus a unit TAM assumption, can you provide us an update on where you stand with regard to the industry supplying enough media as you expect obviously there is possibly to accelerate in terms of capacity per drive?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I\u2019ll take the first one, Aaron. On the first one\u2026", "Albert \u201cRocky\u201d Pimentel", "Aaron, this is \u201cRocky\u201d Pimentel. Let\u2019s clarify, you said acquisition, we made an strategic investment in Virident.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolas", "Fair enough, sorry. And I\u2019ll ask on that little bit.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "So on the Brazil issue, however, last quarter we said \u2013 at least half of the impact in that was even less than that this quarter, so it was measurable but not any frame that we were about. We\u2019ve put a plan in place to correctly resolve some of our provision in inventory and I think that\u2019s working well. So we think we largely taken care of that issue.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolas", "Okay. And then on the media in terms of continued increase and capacity per drive?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Dave Mosley is on the call. I\u2019ll let Dave talk to that.", "Dave Mosley", "So just real quick, I think with the TAM being down here, we are putting more disks into each drive, but I think the industry is probably okay for the next couple of years depending on how you view the overall growth of petabytes and the box count. But after say 2015, there could be significant challenges if we could continue on the rates that Steve just illustrated. So that\u2019s the way I\u2019d answer that.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolas", "Okay. And then on Virident maybe you could help me, if you compare and contrast maybe this illusion relative to the primary competitor of the market being Fusionio, either from an architectural perspective and also on a cost per gigabit perspective if you can?", "Albert \u201cRocky\u201d Pimentel", "Yes, so one of the, Aaron, this is Rocky Pimentel again. Obviously \u2013 they actually have benchmarks that you can refer to on their website, but based on the benchmark, the external third-party benchmarking they\u2019ve done with their product against other leaders in \u201cthe category out there\u201d, they demonstrate the ability to exceed many of the key specs like IOPS et cetera against the incumbent competition out there. And I think secondly, another thing that we can bring to our relationship is the ability to drive their cost structure down from a product standpoint, given our scale and our involvement and other areas of solid state storage.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolas", "Okay. No quantification on cost per gig right now though?", "Albert \u201cRocky\u201d Pimentel", "No.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolas", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Meredith Dunne with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Meredith Dunne \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Hi, thanks. Someone in the industry have talked about hybrids accounting for about 0.5 of the 2.5-inch notebook drives for 2015. Just curious what your expectations are for that and whether there are any shifting capacity or utilization effects to think about in the market transition that could impact gross margins? And I have a follow-up as well, please.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Sorry, I got the first part of that question. What\u2019s the second part of the question related to the first part or was that a second question?", "Meredith Dunne \u2013 Wells Fargo", "It was, it was related to the first part.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Okay, so while the first part is I think that those types of estimates are possible. And then what was the second part of it?", "Meredith Dunne \u2013 Wells Fargo", "It\u2019s just in terms of \u2013 if that starts to ramp up and the HDD side starts to \u201cramp down\u201d just in terms of any sort of shift in that market impacting your gross margins?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "No, no. Hardware isn\u2019t HDD, it just also got flash in better than along with a bunch of software that makes that flash work well. So we don\u2019t, from a manufacturing perspective, we don\u2019t see that shift is being problematic because again its still lots of heads in this. And I think the trend up where we are at on single disk and two disk solutions is probably not necessarily influenced by hybrid. It\u2019s really a performance play. I think it\u2019s a big deal. I think because you kind of get the SSD \u2013 for example down at CES last month or whenever it was now, earlier this month hard to believe and just shocking the number of thin and light machines that are packed with expensive SSDs when you can use a hybrid drive for a lot less money with the same performance.", "I think as the industry has now become the line around the right chipset and the right performance measures, we are going to see a lot of thin and lights that roll out with hybrid, because you can pickup ten times the capacity of one-fifth the cost and that probably will help the notebook market, that\u2019s probably more price sensitive than other market. So I think it\u2019s a big transition ahead of us.", "Meredith Dunne \u2013 Wells Fargo", "And along those lines, can you just talk about the opportunities in the tablet market and I am referring primarily to the ARM based market that\u2019s using flash today. May be if you could just talk about if and where discussions currently are? Thanks.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yeah. And I think it\u2019s a big opportunity again. We indicated that we believe to deliver the user experience that you probably deserve as a mobile user. There is lots of reasons that you need more storage capacity in that device, not citing anyone\u2019s product. We are just calling something a tablet. If you only have 16 or 32 gigs and you have to decide which three or four movies you are going to take with you seems kind of silly when you can take every movie your own for less cost and actually the same battery performance in the same (inaudible). So yeah, we think there is a big opportunity coming down the pipe for tablets as well and we are engaged on multiple fronts.", "Operator", "Your next question is from line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Please go ahead.", "Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Murray Carret & Co., LLC", "Hi, good afternoon guys. Thanks to taking the question. Steve, let me just ask one on pricing here. I believe that earlier comments you guys are looking for March quarter pricing to be more flattish blended, and I think if I just work in a point of the guidance it seems like down mid-single digits. Is that accurate and if so can you just sort of walk through the puts and takes maybe it\u2019s a mix, talk about some of the mix issues, not issues but the mix situation in the December quarter that maybe them winding, just love to get your thoughts and I have a follow-up. Thanks.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I think where we had some share gain in the December quarter was spread across all the markets, but probably a little heavier on the enterprise and on the newer line so that\u2019s partially influencing the AUP discussion. So in general, the pricing that we\u2019ve entered into was pretty much what we expected and pretty benign.", "Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Murray Carret & Co., LLC", "Got it. Thanks. And then I guess just to that end, the gross margins are still pretty solid in the March quarter. I guess even with \u2013 I\u2019m just I\u2019m sort of referring that maybe some of the market share gains in the enterprise, there\u2019s some of the share get backs that you\u2019re talking about the normalization and you still guiding to 27% gross margins in the March quarter. So not to get too far ahead, but can we infer that go and post the March quarter with sort of more of a normalized mix and you expect margins to still be pretty stable?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yes.", "Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Murray Carret & Co., LLC", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question is from line of Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights Research. Please go head.", "Nehal Chokshi \u2013 Technology Insights Research", "Yeah, thanks. I calculate that your ASP for the December quarter was down Q-over-Q. So could you take and also you didn\u2019t reflect all your segment numbers. So if you are not divulging your segment numbers, could you at least take us through which segments drove that and if you don\u2019t mind, do you have older segment numbers?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "No, we don\u2019t have segments, but Pat you can talk to what the AUP decline was, pretty minimal as I recall of the September quarter.", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "Yeah, AUP was managed mainly with mix. We had talked in the September out, it\u2019s September call in October that the pricing was negotiated in the backdrop if they had access and so we were heavier on pricing than historically in the December quarter, but even with that they were able to stay in the target margin range and we highlight that we will be going with fairly benign pricing going forward and that\u2019s been the case across the board.", "Nehal Chokshi \u2013 Technology Insights Research", "Okay, thanks. And I\u2019d also like to ask question about the Virident investment note that I got that right. But so as you guys hope to get this product out to market, do you expect this to be margin neutral, margin accretive or margin dilutive, because it sounds like this is more of a distribution relationship and that the technology relationship is to come?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yeah, the first phase is definitely a go-to-market phase. The next phase will be joint development on product. And our intention is to make it margin neutral to margin accretive overall.", "Nehal Chokshi \u2013 Technology Insights Research", "What about initially?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Initially it will be pretty minor amounts of money. By the time it becomes visible, it should be margin neutral and margin accretive.", "Nehal Chokshi \u2013 Technology Insights Research", "Okay. Thanks.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "And just on your first question, we just \u2013 we just look the AUP, the AUP decline was only 3% quarter-to-quarter, so that was a lot less in the price erosion that we have talked about.", "Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Murray Carret & Co.", "All right, okay.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Cindy Shaw with Discern. Please go ahead.", "Cindy Shaw \u2013 Discern, Inc.", "Hi, thank you. I was wondering if you could talk about LaCie, which you had for the first time in the fourth quarter, any impact for that on revenue and earnings as well as the SSD business sort of the non-traditional business. Is there any impact on revenue and earnings? And then I have a follow-up.", "Bob Whitmore", "LaCie is accretive to us. It\u2019s been a good investment. We are in the process of still integrating that. But that\u2019s been accretive and so as we would expect obviously that is some OpEx, but for what brings for breadth and depth on our portfolio is in expectations. And then your second part of the question?", "Cindy Shaw \u2013 Discern, Inc.", "Yeah. I was also asking about SSDs and other sort of non-traditional contributions? Then I have a follow-up after that.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "No big changes from the prior quarter.", "Cindy Shaw \u2013 Discern, Inc.", "Okay. And then the follow-up, the Cloud Builder Alliance, when will you be expecting to see revenue and really meaningful revenue out of that?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Of what?", "Bob Whitmore", "Cloud Builder Alliance. We are in helping to engage the Cloud Builder Alliance. We are not going to get revenue from that. We are just engaging with them to help align the architectures and our products to contribute to that, so the second tier and direct builder architectures approach the market. But we are not going to get any direct revenue other than enabling the folks in that. We help enable the folks in that alliance to better tackle the market.", "Cindy Shaw \u2013 Discern, Inc.", "And when do you think, can you measure really when or how that\u2019s going to impact revenue or is it just too disconnected?", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "No, I mean I think over the course of the back half of this year, we are definitely going to be able to measure it as cloud overall is one of our key initiative. So we\u2019ll be able to articulate the details of what that program is delivering. Like Pat said, it\u2019s really a market creation engagement vehicle, it\u2019s not a direct sales vehicle at this point.", "Cindy Shaw \u2013 Discern, Inc.", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jung Pak with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Jung Pak \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Hi, thanks very much. The notebook market has been down for two consecutive quarters, what do you think inventory is with the OEMs in the channel for the notebook market? And what are your views for the notebook HDD shipments for the next quarter or two? Thanks.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "I think the inventories are better certainly over the last two quarters and probably closer to where the customers wanted me to have to ask the customers that. But I think from our perspective, no one is really confident on it, but our inventories are, so I don\u2019t know what that is. Our inventories are quite low, running almost a $0.5 billion of inventory less than our competitors.", "So, we feel really good about our inventory balances, as far as we can tell that customers inventory balances are pretty well managed right now. And I think, the demand on the notebook side is really just a function of the new platforms gain traction, which is partially dependent on the touch-enabled technology and Win 8 deployment.", "So we\u2019re kind of in a wait and see mode, but we\u2019re optimistic that things improve from here, well enough that happens in the March quarter, the June quarter, September quarter, we\u2019ll see. But I think we\u2019re probably skipping along the bottom here and I also think as hybrid start showing up in these devices, it\u2019s going to be a value add to the notebook market, because like I said you can get a lot more capacity in the same performance with a lot lower costs, so.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Eric Sterling with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Eric Sterling \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.", "Hey, thank you. Given the limitations on the buybacks throughout 2013, can you discuss your plans for the dividend?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Nothing different than what we\u2019ve already said and disclosed on our file documents, something we continue to look at every quarter. We don\u2019t really have a limitation on the buybacks. It\u2019s just that if we buyback too much stock, we run into section 382 issue. So it\u2019s just something you consider as we think about whether or not we want to pursue buybacks, but it\u2019s not a direct limitation.", "Eric Sterling \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi, thank you. I think that in December, you anniversaried one year on the Samsung acquisition. And if I remember correctly, there were some limitations on you combining the business with Samsung for at least a year. I was hoping you could give us an update on where you are with combining the business and do you expect to see any cost savings as we move through the year?", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Well, for us, we integrated pretty much most of the areas where there were cost savings on the R&D side and on the operating side. Our limitations were and/or really geared around the go-to-market side, sales, customer engagement, pricing. And you are right that the initial \u2013 on December 19 or 20 or 21, we had the right to ask the regulatory authorities to relapse those. We haven\u2019t done that. We continue to have a positive and constructive dialogue with Matcom and other regulators in China, and we are going to continue those dialogues and when appropriate then we\u2019ll seek release from the requirements.", "Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Thank you. I think we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Okay. Your final question will be from the line of Scott Craig with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Scott Craig \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thanks, good afternoon. Here is a couple of questions around OpEx, do you made it from a longer-term perspective. Is there a revenue target or timing or something we could think around when you would reach the OpEx target of sort of 8% to 10% of revenue?", "And then secondly, with regards to an earlier question on capacity if the PC market is a challenge to what some people think, and I believe their consensus is sort of where declined this year. How does that impact, what your capacity thoughts are for the back part of calendar 2013? Thanks.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Yeah, I kind of answered the second question already. I mean we\u2019re not going to \u2013 we manage our capacity more on our capital deployment as opposed to brick and mortar. As we look out to 2015, 2016 we believe that that this constant disconnect between petabyte growth rate and areal density growth rate is going to put extreme shortages in front of the drive industry at current capital deployment rate, so we don\u2019t want to walk away from brick and mortar, it\u2019s really how we manage the inside of the walls in the meantime.", "And that\u2019s what we are doing very conservatively, so I don\u2019t think it changes any of that. I don\u2019t know that I agree with all the nay sayers anyhow I kind of like the term \u2013 what was the \u2013 what\u2019s the normal term on PC, post-PC, but whatever it is. It\u2019s really what the PC evolving to, and I think these convertible platforms that become tablets and notebooks and have onboard storage are very compelling, and I expect there will be resurgence in the client side of the market here in the not too distant future, but we\u2019ll watch it. And in terms of the OpEx question, we just see big opportunities on the mobile side, I mean call the infrastructure side where there is a lot of device level technology, software technology, and even system level technology that really only a drive company can provide and we don\u2019t want to miss the opportunity to investment in some of those fundamental technologies as these markets develop.", "So I think for the incremental dollars, it\u2019s a prudent thing to do now, and then we\u2019ll see where the revenue flows with it. But clearly, we think these are multibillion dollar opportunities when you take mobile and cloud and think about the evolution of computing.", "Over the next five to 10 years and so we want to position Seagate to participate not just as a device company, which will be our core, but some of the other opportunities that go along with it. So we\u2019ll manage it prudently and hopefully start to show some revenue associated with it in the next year.", "Scott Craig \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks, Steve.", "Stephen J. Luczo", "Okay. Thanks very much. And on behalf of management team, I want to thank our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and our shareholders for your support and commitment, and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter.

For the March quarter, we reported revenues of $3.5 billion and on a non-GAAP basis achieved gross margin of 27.6%, net income of $464 million diluted earnings per share of $1.26. On behalf of the entire management team, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers for the support and commitment.", "Our balance sheet remains healthy as we generated $678 million in operating cash flow in the quarter and paid $379 million for the early redemption of a portion of our long-term debt. We ended the quarter with approximately $2 billion in cash and investment. Returning value to our shareholders remains a priority. And in the March quarter, we redeemed 3 million ordinary shares for approximately $102 million and paid a dividend of $0.38 per share. And as a reminder, this payment was accelerated for the December quarter.", "Over the first nine months of fiscal 2013, Seagate has returned 75% of its operating cash flow to shareholders. Our focus over the last few quarters is centered on effectively optimizing our business model in an environment with limited visibility due to uncertain macroeconomic conditions and technical product transitions among our core customers. In the March quarter, overall demand was slightly higher than our expectations, primarily driven by the continued build out of our infrastructure and applications.", "During the quarter, we shipped over 47 exabytes of storage with an average capacity of 842 gigabytes per drive. For the first nine months of fiscal year, Seagate has shipped over 130 exabytes of storage, reflecting 33% year-over-year growth, which is well above the current areal density growth rate.", "Non-GAAP gross margins for the March quarter were 27.6% within both, our expectations and our long-term margin range target. The pricing environment and the quarter was benign and blended ASPs increased slightly driven by product mix.", "Non-GAAP operating expenses in the March quarter were $446 million, representing a 4% sequential increase which is primarily due to increased employee related expenses and investments in our new storage technologies. These investments support our continued focus on effectively aligning our operating structure to support a broader product portfolio of storage devices, including hybrid, solid-state drives and other devices and services which we believe will be critical to follow mobile compute environment.", "Capital expenditures for the March quarter were $221 million, representing approximately 6% of revenue. We continue to target capital expenditures at 6% to 8% of revenue. On a year-to-date basis, approximately 4% of revenue has gone towards maintenance of our existing operations while 2% of revenue has gone towards improving our global R&D footprint.", "The HDD industry continues evidence a lack of consistent visibility from our customers across most of our markets. As a result, we continue to plan cautiously which we believe will effectively position us to continue to optimize our financial and business performance.", "For the June quarter, we expect the unit demand environment that is flat to slightly down, sequentially. Revenue of approximately $3.3 billion to $3.45 billion, non-GAAP gross margins consistent with our performance over the last two quarters, non-GAAP operating expenses to remain relatively flat and lastly remaining on track to return of these 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2013.", "Looking ahead, we believe the next few years the storage industry will present new and significant opportunities for Seagate. For calendar 2013, the growth trajectory of data-driven in part by cloud of mobile applications has our industry on pace to close to 500 exabytes of storage and is advancing at a rate which is more than two times greater than expected areal density growth rate.", "As a result, continued investment and heads in this technology and the continued absorption of capacity will be required to meet storage demand in all of our product segments. This trend in part supports the overall gross margin target of 27% to 32% that we have discussed previously. As an example, in the June 2011 quarter, which was before any market share shifts attributable to the flood or industry consolidation,", "Seagate produced 150 million heads with an average capacity of 180 gigabytes per head against the total industry TAM of 180 million HDD units.

We believe that with the number of connected people, availability of rich content and increasing bandwidth, mass storage will continue to expand across a variety of devices in the PC plus environment.", "In the client space, while PC unit demand has flattened over the last several quarters, the demand for heads in disk and average capacity per drive continues to increase. Some of the innovative products we have introduced this year that have been well-received by leading OEMs include our 7 millimeter, 500 gigabytes for ultra mobile devices and two terabytes desktop hybrid products. We began shipping our third generation of solid-state hybrid drives in the March quarter and we have additional performance-based and high-capacity client products on our roadmap for this year.", "In the branded space, we personal files, wireless access and SSD performance based products are catalyst for continued growth and our acquisition of Lacie is proving to be a successful investment for our consumer and small business technology offerings.", "In the enterprise business, the expansion of cloud infrastructure and cloud applications requires high-capacity, high quality products. We will continue to provide a portfolio of enterprise products that meet the needs of the cloud environment including hard disk drives, solid state drives, hybrid drives and a complete line of flash-based PCI solutions through our OEM and distribution partners through our strategic investments.", "In summary, Seagate is optimistic about our storage technology roadmaps as it relates to current technology implementations as well as the advancing mobile, cloud and open source environments. We look forward to updating you in more detail at our Strategic Forum in September.", "Aisha, we are now ready to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray. Please proceed.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray", "Hi, guys, good afternoon. Congratulations on a solid quarter and thanks for taking the question. I guess, Stephen, the first question is around ASPs. Can you just walk through the dynamics that led to the flat pricing for the quarter. It feels like it was, like you said, the benign, like-for-like, and then some mix but just the specifics would be helpful. Then I have, it seems like you are guiding down 3% blended for the June quarter. If you could just walk through those dynamics as well. Then I have a quick follow-up. Thanks.", "Stephen Luczo", "So, on the pricing, like you said, is benign. We haven\u2019t gotten into any specifics of what that is but it was below historical rates and that\u2019s what we expect to be the operating model going forward as long as supply demand stays relatively in check. The mix was a positive element for the quarter. The business-critical near line drives clearly, forward growth segment for us and that helped the mix. But, all-in-all, it played out as much. Now, for the next quarter, we have a still benign pricing. We don\u2019t have excessive pricing there by any stretch of imagination. It is a very benign but the mix is probably somewhat offset due to seasonality.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray", "Got it.", "Stephen Luczo", "In the notebook space, we definitely felt that there was opportunity and the need to increase pricing marginally and we did do that and that pricing has held so far.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray", "Got it. Thanks a lot. And, Steve, how should we think about the new pricing this quarter, next quarter manifesting itself on the margin. I guess, longer term you gave guidance for the June quarter obviously on the margin, because we think about sort of what might allow the margins to move up into the upper half or towards the middle of the longer term gross margin guidance range whether that you sort of envisioned that they get it there over time. Thanks.", "Stephen Luczo", "Okay. A couple of things, I think one is as you TAM expansion in the back half of the year. From a capacity perspective, the industry is kind of bumping up against its limit. I'll turn it over to Dave Mosley in a second to talk on that, but if we do have TAM growth that I think is actually more related to macroeconomic conditions and also I think to some of the new product offerings by the OEMs and the client. We are pretty excited about some of the things that we see in the notebook space, for example.", "Then I think, the other big trend is just a shift to the cloud. If the cloud continues to build out and it's our belief that we are going to see a fairly dramatic acceleration in that exiting this year and going into the next calendar year, given the number of heads in this that get absorbed into that product area, I think there is going to be some pretty tight supply situations in the back half of the year and we have already been signaling to our customers that the current pricing to me even look favorable relative to the last half of the year, because I think we could start seeing some constraints in near line even exiting this quarter. I'll let Dave talk to some of the math behind.", "Dave Mosley", "Yes. To the comments that Steve made earlier, the industry is relatively constrained, say roughly 500 exabytes of capacity and you will put capital online sparingly as we talked about earlier, but the growth of the cloud primarily continues to drive a lot of capacity into the industry and so as we see that we talked about the areal density growth, our ability to deliver that capacity relative to the sheer capacity growth. I think those are the two vectors that the demerging. And as we look to invest in the future I think we make sure we see the requisite and return on capital that, but trend definitely old that areal density is not growing nearly the rate as the capacity growth is and that's ultimately [constraint].", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. You may proceed.", "Joe Wittine - Longbow Research", "Hi. Thank you. First question, I want to talk about capital deployment I guess. with the near-term piece of debt taken out. You saw I guess a pause on the buyback this year and that maybe just as important that share count target for the end of calendar year 2014 still possible in your view with the appreciation in the share price? Thanks.", "Dave Mosley", "Yes. On 2014, we are certainly still committed to that even with share price\u2026", "Joe Wittine - Longbow Research", "Then your near-term thoughts on capital deployment?", "Dave Mosley", "Continued dividend as stated and buyback shares within the limitations that we have today on that would change for any reason, we certainly modify that, but as Steve and I commented, we are still good for the 2014 to 250 million shares.", "Joe Wittine - Longbow Research", "Thanks. Then, Steve, in your prepared comments, you talked about being seldom growth in you form factors in the second half of the year. Intel recently said they think of 30% the client PC environment could be these new form factors ultra, fans, convertible, detachable, just curious from your point of view how many of those products do you think will be carrying or will be initiated with HDDs or hybrid HDD? Thanks.", "I think over time the penetration is going to be pretty high. I mean, it's kind of funny watching the tablet evolution. Reminds me of the netbook Dell evolution and certainly it's just that the tablets started with really great screens and no keyboards. Now they have keyboards and you can take them apart and I think shortly, where you are going to see tablets with HDDs in them as well and all of sudden what it was going to look like again going to look a lot like a notebook.", "So, I think it's just really a question between the breakdown overall of what's a super thin notebook, what's a slightly bigger notebook, what's a higher performance notebook. Some of them with detachable keyboards, some of them not. Some of them with flash and some of them with HDD. If you take up the super mobiles, we think the tablets today, I obviously believe that penetration rates is probably go into the 30% to 40% range because if you can deliver 500 gigabytes of storage with the same performance that you get of off flash for all those people that want to watch something through those pretty pieces of glass, you can at least store it somewhere. But I think it\u2019s a ramp that begins hopefully sometime this year and then continues to accelerate.", "Rocky Pimentel", "I think with that, Stephen and Dave talk about some of our emerging form factor and product solutions on the clients' side over the second half of the year and you look at the total TAM between classic PC desktop and the tablet, you have got 80 million to 85 million units a quarter on the classic PC notebook desktop side and then you have another 40 million to 45 million tablets, you have a total market of like 130 million to 140 million devices. I think based on the product platforms, we will see over the next six to months usually serviceable simple market is probably is north of 100 million units which is a positive because we have been dealing with a serviceable market that\u2019s been 80 million units. So it certainly has to be proven but I think we are optimistic about the opportunity to extend or expand the service that\u2019s obtained on the clients' side.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Richard Kugele with Needham & Company.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "Well done on the quarter. So just a few questions. I guess first that comes to the five millimeter rollout. I know you showed us last September at the analyst event but can you just update us on your timing on that side for both the standard version and the hybrid?", "Rocky Pimentel", "The marketing people really hate it when I do product announcements on earnings call. That being said, as you point out we show that we were up to back in September, we continued along with a great deal of positive momentum on our product offering. I expected that you will see something in the not too distant future about our product positioning and what the engagement has been like at the customer level.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "Do you get the sense that the OEMs are leaning more towards the five millimeter versus the seven millimeter? Is there going to be a learning curve before they are willing to adapt their designs to that or take more advantage of that form factor?", "Rocky Pimentel", "No, I think right now they are for different devices like we were just saying in the prior question. Five millimeter, to me, ultimately at least initially is, it could go into thin and light as seven millimeter could go into a thin and light and especially if you are just doing a new seven millimeter, you have a lot of capacity opportunities. I think that\u2019s the bigger play for hybrid as well basically. Five millimeter, I think, initially is probably going to be targeted more towards, we think it is a tablet market today and there, whether or not you need a flash based device or not is a function of algorithms in hybrid. Seagate's fairly well advanced in our hybrid algorithm. So we have the capacity to leverage off of the flash in the system but I think ultimately again, as I think of what that product path looks like a couple or three years out. It just really going to be a function of capacity. There is no scenario that we think off that says get two disk in the five millimeter. So you are going to limit yourself to 500 gigs or 750 or whatever the point after that was for seven millimeter and of course you are going to have to accept that and there will be plenty of need for that amount of storage on portable computing devices. So I think they are separate markets and they both are going to be picked by (inaudible).", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful and then in terms of your ability to take cost down, can you just update us on where you are in the areal density transition for the one terabytes per platter and then any comments on the Chinese regulatory bodies approval on fully integrating the last bits of Samsung?", "Rocky Pimentel", "Steve, you want to talk about transition?", "Stephen Luczo", "Yes, relative to areal density transition one terabyte a platter, We still have some of the 500 gigabyte per platter technology around but its more of a convenience thing for us. I think we could transition if we wanted to. So I consider that transition complete. Certainly, one, two, three terabytes and on up, that\u2019s all on that new product family.", "Stephen Luczo", "On the [comp] situation, we continue work with the regulatory agency. They are in, as we said before, we do it as constructed relationship and we don't have any current thinking about when that relationship is going to it's personal direction, but we think it's been a positive relationship as we (Inaudible).", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Nolan with Robert Baird. You may proceed.", "Jason Nolan - Robert Baird", "Great. Thank you. Steve your comment on visibility not being very good broadly is understood wondering if the cloud storage part of your market provides better visibility given your comment on constraints in the potential constraint in the back half of the year.", "Stephen Luczo", "That's really some interesting question. It does, but I think the lack of visibility overall is, in my mind, fairly just a function, what I will call macroeconomic conditions. I think maybe more exclusively deficit related issues that there's still as hesitancy I think certainly among multinationals they kind of extend too far off, so some of the structural issues around spending are understood a little better.", "That being said, inside of the cloud build out area, I actually think the lack of visibility is one where what we are seeing is probably going to be below what really gets rolled out. There's been kind of a bit of an uptick in the cloud build outs and build out have been consistently growing for a while, but it is certainly our sense from engaging with either our OEM customers or directly to the companies that are doing the cloud build outs directly that we maybe within 12 months of some your step function changes that build out has guys for the company starts go global and their footprint, starts recognizing some of the issues around bandwidth as well as some of the issues around in-country storage requirement. So, the kind of the scalable of that infrastructure I think is potentially going to be bigger than what maybe people thought just six months ago.", "Jason Nolan - Robert Baird", "It seems like we would see blended ASP start to mix shift upwards at some point.", "Stephen Luczo", "Yes. That's just, but to Dave's point it also probably have those products mispriced right now, because the capacity issues around it from heads in disk absorption as well as other factors such in the past are dramatically different. That's just a different economics for us, so we are watching it closely.", "Operator", "You next question comes from the line of Rob Cihra with Evercore Partners. You may proceed.", "Rob Cihra - Evercore Partners", "Hi. Great. Thank you much. Two questions if I could. One, just one, I guess, it's an [question], but lot of people think always wonder what the TAM being 136 in the quarter versus PCs that were down and recognizing I know the drive market [PCs] in the back half of last year. Just how comfortable you are in terms of inventories out there both in terms of channel and OEMs given the fact that at least mathematically more drive shipped and then or at least drives or flash and PCs down and then I guess following on that any ability or I know you say visibility is bad and it is, but if you look in December quarter WD talked about maybe first take at 140 tight TAM is that you something you think is reasonable at this stage? Thanks.", "Stephen Luczo", "I think the first question is interesting. Obviously just our hard drives will not, but the desktop 3.5-inch drive doing the tune up and currently just don't go. They don't just go into PC. There's other lots of devices that they go into including data devices and one thing I think that we have seen from our market research is that you with the increase of tablets and smart phones, if you will, the attach rate of data devices has gone up pretty dramatically in some market segments increased from like 20% attach rates to 50% attach rate, so part of it may be that. But with respect to the question, we don't see any issues in inventory and whether or not that's what we can see inside the hubs, or clearly in the channel, channel inventory has been really flat for last several quarters actually certain measure probably got lower in the March quarter and we manage our hub inventory really closely. Again, I am a little suspect of the data, Rob, in terms of when people cite, PC shipments being down. Are they talking about individual companies or what ODMs are saying because it is also shipped between what the PC manufacturers are doing in terms the mix of internal builds versus ODM builds.", "You could see it could be said it\u2019s the ODM level but that\u2019s doesn\u2019t necessarily a one-for-one relationship to what the PC industry is shipping. So I think there is more work to be done by everyone in terms of this kind of disconnect and we are certainly working with all the industry analysts and trying to resolve it but we certainly don\u2019t see any inventory buildups.", "In terms of back half of the year, again, I think it is, to mo, it is going to be more influenced probably by macroeconomic issues but the macro situations stays the same where it gets better, they yes, I do think the back half of the year shows that we are going to rollout today. 140 isn't a whole lot higher than 137 so I might saying numbers slightly above that but we just have to wait and see what happens.", "The industry is well geared right now to operate very efficiently between 130 million and 150 million units by just targeting the low-end and chasing the upside. That\u2019s the smart thing for the industry to do. So I am not worried about it breaking out away from us other than to Dave's point that if it breaks above probably 150 million or 155 million units and there is a mix shift, the industry is going to tapped out of exabyte capacity and there is no way to address that in short-term.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel. You may proceed.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks for taking the questions. First question. Just going and looking at the enterprise piece of your business and the industry in total. By my calculations the industry grew shipments by about 7%. Clearly we have seen some weak data points out of some of the OEMs. So I guess, my question is how do we look at that data and triangulate that relative to what you are seeing from the cloud and maybe you can give us a contribution from what you are seeing directly from those type of data centers at that point and help us understand that up 7% relative to some of the other demand data points we have seen?", "Rocky Pimentel", "Again, I don\u2019t know what other demand data points you are referencing exactly but if you are asking me, do we see demand increases from cloud service providers? The answer is, of course. One will know architectural features that the cloud service providers are pursuing are architectures that allow them to buy drives directly and put their own software on top of that as opposed to buying that software stack from someone else. So we believe that\u2019s the beginning of a trend that\u2019s probably going to sustain for many, many years.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "Any idea of contribution or share position that you have in that environment today?", "Dave Mosley", "In the cloud environment?", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "Yes.", "Dave Mosley", "We feel that we are, overall, at least equal to what the standard enterprise share is against our competition and in some cases in a preferred position.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Then the final question for me, as we look at your capital return strategy and we look at free cash flow generation, how should we think about the model progressing, in that context of how we should think about annualized free cash flow generation?", "Stephen Luczo", "So, on the capital returns, obviously, we have a dividend payment in place and we are certainly committed to that. So that will be part of the return to shareholders, now and in the future. Of course , the one item we said to go on a 250 million shares, you could model that anyway you want. It is going to be somewhat lumpy as we go through some of our (inaudible) issues but we are committed to the deployment of that capital. So you can certainly put those two numbers in and see the level of cash that is going to be returned to shareholders and then clearly our business could support that level. So you are back in that way.", "Pat O'Malley", "If your question is, when do we see a shift in CapEx as of relative to the return capital, the answer is, not until the bathtub is full which I don\u2019t think happens till the end of this year. Then we will slowly address the capital needs that we see in the marketplace as we confirm. We are not going to be needing the capital, yet in this uncertain environment.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "I guess, what I am asking is, you are doing about $1.8 billion of annualized free cash flow in this most recent quarter, is that the right level to think about or do we go higher? The driver is high of that?", "Dave Mosley", "Slightly higher than that. Certainly, as Steve said as business evolves you get some TAM upside and we think this is going to more and more, we certainly believe our cash flow should be at least that and grow.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Hi. Thanks. Pat, I just wanted to round out the guidance a little bit. Steve, you gave us a lot of detail, but just thinking about interest expense. I know you bought back some debt this quarter. How should we model interest expense in terms of the tax rate? You guys have a pretty wide range 3% to 10%, I think what you talked about in the past that you haven't really been. You've been below that. How should we think about taxes and what type of share count are you thinking about for June?", "Patrick Connolly", "Sure. On the interest, you just take the $5 billion out of that. It's a simple number. Just take that some level as you are taking that down, but it's going to be relative to all big numbers are going to be still relatively flat there's just a tranche of that was a smaller tranche of that, but was significant tranche on getting the security out. So, that's all I do there.", "Tax rate, it is variable somewhat. I [stock] use $15 million to $20 million as opposed to tax rate crazy tranche and tax rate I think that's fair, and I would use the share count where we had this quarter and relatively flat for next quarter given what level share we will be buying.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "So, just to clarify on interest expense or you can take $5 million out of interest expense sequentially?", "Patrick Connolly", "Yes. Let's take around that level.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights Research. Please proceed.", "Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research", "Yes. Thanks. I would like to get two questions. One is with the gross margin. Looks like you had a positive mix shift in terms of enterprise non-compute versus client. Your June was flat also flat [q-on-q]. I know that the volume was down 4% q-on-q, so the question is purely volume that drove the effective higher cost per drive up q-over-q or is there something else going on there?", "Patrick Connolly", "It's much more than mix driven than anything else. The cost structure, whether from input cost to the factory end delivery was relatively flat and somewhat better, so it was primarily driven through the mix.", "Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research", "Okay. And staying on a sequential theme here, mission-critical consumer electronics and branded hard drives they all seem to have trended above seasonal, so can you discuss what we were drivers of Seagate's above seasonal performance there? Was that industry or was it Seagate-specific. And importantly, do you see those drivers being stable?", "Patrick Connolly", "Yes. I think on the mission-critical or on the enterprise class drives, there was again some unique advantage that we had in product that we took advantage of and then on the [CE] it was strong in winning more market share at some of the CE customers that we underserved in the last several quarters et cetera. So, I think those were probably the two key changes in and what you in those lines of product.", "Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research", "Okay. Thank.", "Stephen Luczo", "Aisha, we'll take one more.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Keith Bachman Bank of Montreal. Please proceed.", "Keith Bachman Bank - Montreal", "Yes. Thank you. Number one, why was there such a disparity on the client side between yourselves and WD this quarter in particular, desktop WD had 54% sequential growth and yours was down I think 11, and then my follow-up is on the TAM, but I wanted to kind of go through that as why was there such a disparity and what do you think that portends if anything?", "Stephen Luczo", "I guess I am not sure what data you are assigning right now.", "Keith Bachman Bank - Montreal", "Just on the client side sequentially, sorry.", "Stephen Luczo", "What are you trying to find?", "Keith Bachman Bank - Montreal", "Well, we'll just focus on the desktop if we could.", "Stephen Luczo", "I would say it's as much price positioning, Keith. I mean, we went in there as stated in my comments, we are fairly benign on the pr and certain capacity points we are just not willing to move to market. So that\u2019s clearly one aspect of it. I do not think it necessarily has anything to do with the portfolio or attribute anything to our position going forward but probably the largest driver of that was price position both in the channel and in the OEMs.", "Keith Bachman Bank - Montreal", "Okay, let's shift to the TAM. Steve, you mentioned, let's just say, for argument's sake, the TAMs caught 145 in the September and perhaps even December quarter. How are you thinking about the contribution within those numbers if they turn out that way both from hybrid and/or all of the media in the tablets? Is there much contribution in the back half of the year from those type of products as we look out?", "Stephen Luczo", "On an absolute basis, there will be some decent growth on hybrid but as a percentage of what we ship it will still be pretty small. I would say, in terms of tablet, you could go from zero to hundreds of thousands or maybe a bigger number by the end of the year which is big numbers but obviously on a percentage basis, they are tiny. I think the more significant thing is that once the penetration starts then you decide what type of curve you wanted to draw if you are at least getting into a marketplace that, I have been told that moment we weren\u2019t participating and that\u2019s what we are more excited about.", "Keith Bachman Bank - Montreal", "Steve, if you look at just 2.5 inch drives, would hybrids in December quarter make up 5% of that that notebook shipment or 10% of the 2.5 inch category?", "Stephen Luczo", "I think you have to look at the notebook systems today how many of them are flash based. The umber is, flash based notebooks are 10% or less.", "Keith Bachman Bank - Montreal", "Yes, its less than 10%", "Stephen Luczo", "So if you are saying could we be half of that, what 5% would be good.", "Operator", "There are no further questions in the queue at this time. I will now like to turn the call over to Steve Luczo for closing remarks. Please proceed.", "Stephen Luczo", "Good, great and well, just on behalf of the management team and I want to thank you for joining us today.

Seagate demonstrated strong operational performance in the June quarter achieving revenues of $3.4 billion and on a non-GAAP basis gross margin of 28%, net income of $447 million, and diluted earnings per share of $1.20. Bulk of our revenue and gross margin results for the quarter were higher, were at the higher end of our expectations, primarily driven by near line market demands, as a wide variety of customers deployed Cloud infrastructure and applications.", "Full year fiscal 2013 revenues were $14.4 billion and on a non-GAAP basis we achieved gross margin of 28%, net income of $2 billion, and diluted earnings per share of $5.31. We met our shareholder capital return goals for the year returning 70% of operating cash flow, and 90% of free cash flow in the form of dividends and share redemptions. In addition we successfully restructured our debt profile this quarter to optimize Seagate\u2019s capital structure and to support the long term growth of the company reducing our annual interest expense by over $40 million. We ended the fiscal year with approximately $2.3 billion in cash and investments and 359 million ordinary shares outstanding.", "Going forward we remain committed to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share redemptions. We have nearly completed our share redemption plans for the September quarter purchasing approximately 4 million shares in the month of July. For fiscal 2014 we are targeting to return upto 70% of operating cash flow and upto 90% of free cash flow to shareholders.", "Our senior management is pleased that Seagate executed well in a time of change, uncertainty and opportunity over the course of fiscal year 2013. In addition to meeting the vast majority of our financial goals we successfully enhanced and expanded our storage technology portfolio through organic growth, partnership and acquisition to position us for future success with an expanding base of customers. For the cloud market we introduced several new enterprise products and features designed to specifically address the manageability, performance, total cost of ownership and security requirements for these environments. We\u2019re particularly excited about the opportunities of our new 4 terabyte near line product with a competitive combination of capacity and energy efficiency that customers are demanding.", "We expanded our SSD solutions over the last several months to include our newest enterprise SSD that we developed with Samsung and we have strategic investments focused on the emerging enterprise PCIe market and key architecture advancements in next generation SSD technology.", "In the mobile market we have introduced our 7 millimeter hybrid drives and 5 millimeter disk drives for thin and light and tablet computing. As the mobile market continues to evolve and expand we believe we\u2019re well positioned with competitive products that are high capacity, high performance and cost effective storage solutions.", "And then in the branding market our acquisition of LaCie and new products such as Seagate Wireless Plus and Seagate Central has significantly boasted our external drives and personal cloud offerings for easy to use home storage solutions that we believe will continue to be in strong demand.", "Over Seagate\u2019s history we have successfully invested in our technology portfolio to deliver the industry\u2019s highest standard of security, reliability and performance coupled with these efforts we have worked to make cost effective and well-timed capital investments to support our global manufacturing operations. In fiscal year \u201913 our capital expenditures were less than 6% of revenue and focused on maintenance investment for our existing infrastructure and improvements to our global manufacturing and R&D footprint including the Korea Design Center for our Samsung acquisition and planning for our improved media R&D center in Fremont, California.", "In fiscal year \u201914, we expect our capital investments to remain within our long term targeted gains of 6% to 8% of revenue. Mobile and cloud will continue to be the priority areas where we are investing in our R&D efforts and aligning our technology portfolio and we expect our operating expenses to remain relatively flat. At the same time maintaining our product gross margin is a key priority at Seagate which will enable us to make the investments required for advancement of our technology portfolio. For the past several quarters our model has proven to be effective for us to leverage both market opportunities and manage through uncertainty.", "We will continue to work to balance near term financial performance with long term strategic development or maximizing shareholder value.

We are optimistic about our leadership position in product portfolio and technology, and we look forward to updating you on our vision and strategic plan at our Investor Meeting on September 10.", "On behalf of the entire management team, I want to thank our employees for meeting our operational goals for the fiscal year and positioning Seagate for ongoing success in fiscal year 2014. I also want to thank our customers, partners, suppliers, and shareholders for continued support and commitment. We are now ready to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Rich Kugele representing Needham & Company. Please proceed.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Good morning. Just a couple of questions from me. I guess, first on the long-term trajectory for your business. It seems you have intentionally focused on the enterprise and some of the other higher capacity opportunities can you just talk about perhaps long-term, Steve, what you think two years out your mix might be between enterprise and all of the flavors, retail and client?", "Steve Luczo", "I think it\u2019s probably more corporate we talked about that at the Investor Day, Rich, where we are talking about our longer term strategic vision.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay, I will hop off of that. And then more near-term to the enterprise hybrid that you launched, can you just talk about how you think that, that will work into the product line of the customer interest, would you expect most of your OEMs to move to that or is that for a specific subset of the client of the customer side?", "Dave Mosley", "Yes, Rich, this is Dave. I can give you some flavor of that. So, obviously we know a lot about enterprise workloads, because we have been studying the drive from the markets for that are part of 15 years as people have integrated into the high-performance servers that we develop today. As we look at those workloads, what we see that is that sometimes the drives get used as I am going to call them almost memory devices that the data is spread all over the place in the drive, but oftentimes, the systems level operating systems, the applications layers so on, have been able to aggregate into more sequential workloads. So, what the hybrid drive does is it allows the drive to shift from one to the other really well, and we foresee that there is not really any massive changes coming in server architecture or the operating systems architectures, that\u2019s going to address the drive. So, this is going to be a good value proposition for the high-performance drive for some time to come. And we think that most of the market will move over to these kinds of drives as people see that value performance of that (pay more).", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay. Just two last housekeeping, one on the TAM, can you just give us your sense of what you thought the TAM was in June? And then lastly, if you can make any comments on the appeals court process was announced yesterday?", "Steve Luczo", "Yeah, it seems like the TAM in June was 132, 133, Rich. And I will let Ken answer the question about the Court of Appeals.", "Ken Massaroni", "Yes, Rich. I mean, the company is pleased of the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the judgment back to the District Court with an order to enter the findings on our behalf that we did as indicators that will appeal to the Supreme Court Minnesota which has a discretionary appeal that Supreme Court is not compelled to take it. Seagate will do everything that we have to defend the judgment that we have received at this point in time, and we\u2019ll see what Supreme Court likes to do.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay, thank you very much. Congrats on the quarter.", "Steve Luczo", "Thanks Rich.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah representing Brean Capital. Please proceed.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital", "Hi guys. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. A couple if I could. Hey, Steve, big acceleration, nice acceleration in the enterprise drives this quarter you referenced it as well. I was interested in saying if you give us some of the dynamics behind the 9% sequential increase and then also you are commenting on I guess if you think this is sort of the signal that some of the stronger growth (inaudible) that you mentioned on last quarter calls as well and then I\u2019ve a follow-up. Thanks.", "Steve Luczo", "I think I\u2019ll let Rocky follow-up and what I mean generically it's continuous to be what we see as big build-out we call the infrastructure whether not that\u2019s CSG related or ISG related or even private (inaudible) related I mean clearly architecturally there is a big change going on in terms of how people are storing and managing their data. So I think it is a continuation of that trend, those growth rates you know tended to be accelerating and it is an extension of what I think happen over the course of the next several years. I think what\u2019s going to be interesting about the business is that it will be spiky I think from time to time I think more from upside perspective, I think that the general trend is positive and I think on top of that you\u2019re probably going to have these spikes for either big ISPs or CSPs decide that they have to do some big build out competitively or geographically and that\u2019s what we kind of manage our way through. You don\u2019t see that in the normal quarterly or maybe multi-quarterly planning process but then in quarter all of a sudden you can get these opportunities and the ability to respond to them is important. So I think it is the continued trend of overall architectural change that is certainly driving higher capacity drives in the infrastructure.", "Rocky Pimentel", "I will add to Steve\u2019s comments, there definitely was a strength of the quarter to quarter growth and what we call define as the cloud customer class, as Steve mentioned between each account the characteristic differ but the overall group continues to grow you know very robustly on a quarter-to-quarter basis and I think also this last quarter we filled in some of our product portfolio on the near line which gained a lot of momentum particularly in our 4 terabyte drive class category so couple of very positive drivers in the whole near line data center class products that\u2019s what we benefited from.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital", "Yeah that\u2019s helpful and I then guess just part and parcel with that, growth margin guidance was flattish in the September quarter, can you just walkthrough I guess the puts and takes on the flash margin guidance kind of in the face of seeing improved mix as we begin the second half of the year. Thanks.", "Steve Luczo", "Well actually in the second half of the year usually don\u2019t get improved mix, you get a strong notebook playing (ph) you get a smaller gaming play so actually the mix works against you the second half of the year and that\u2019s been in this case offset against you know we think continued growth on the cloud side.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers representing Stifel. Please proceed.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "The first question looking at your 855 average capacity per drive as we look forward through this next fiscal year what do you think that exists this next fiscal year and then I think last quarter you had alluded the possibility of tightness on finished media if the industry were to get towards a 500 exabyte level or about 420 right now, what\u2019s your view on that updated view on that dynamic?", "Dave Mosley", "So we\u2019re not quite there yet I think it really does depend on the growth of the cloud specific Aaron to the extent that five disc drives are in the norm Rocky mentioned the 4 terabytes for example, as that continues to grow so I won't (inaudible) talk about box but just talk about Exabyte growth and then that really starts to strain the media. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be there in FY \u201914 but it will be more of a FY \u201915 commentary.", "Steve Luczo", "Now on the first question now I think if you look at the product offerings, the 4 GB product that we mentioned in kind of the demand we\u2019re seeing for that and then in the consumer marketplace which is really for the higher capacity drives are going obviously, there will a bunch of 2 GB products coming on so I think exiting the fiscal year will be certainly crusting our near 1 terabyte on average capacity per drive you know again you got to remember that the classic enterprise drives are lower capacity drives but they are doing much higher performance. So it's really what\u2019s going on in cloud and what\u2019s going on in consumer both those trends are quite neo-positive from a capacity perspective.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "Great and then the final question for me, what assumption are you making as far as the TAM through the back half of this calendar year and how does that reflect the new game council cycle?", "Steve Luczo", "Well, we have only talked to September quarter, so I know we are not really talking close to the back half of the year. Again, we will give you a little better clarity about what we think some of the longer term trends are for the December quarter and to Rich\u2019s question earlier a little bit, our incentive up, two or three years out, but I think the market estimates are implied in our moderately sequential number. We are kind of thinking that it grew to 132 last quarter you can see 135 to 140 in the September quarter, and we would expect December to be up from that.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And game council?", "Steve Luczo", "In terms of what accident numbers or?", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "Yes, in terms of just the new game council cycle with the Xbox One and then the PS4?", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, it should be positive.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line (inaudible). Please proceed.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, good morning. Can you hear me okay?", "Kate Scolnick", "Yes.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Just following up on some of the comments around solid say drives developments that you had with Samsung, I was just curious in terms of where you think you would be on commercialization of some of those products between now and year end? And then secondly, any comments around some of that, there was couple of acquisitions that were relatively high profile in that area? And I was curious where you guys stand on build five versus build given those acquisitions and given your own incremental elements? Thanks.", "Rocky Pimentel", "Yes. So, I think based on the activities that, this is Rocky by the way, that we have done over the last year were still very interested in making strategic investments in SSD and PCI category products. Organically, we have been utilizing our Samsung partnership as well as our internal development efforts. And right now, based on our forecast as we would exit this year, our organic efforts in SSD would be greater than any of those companies that were recently acquired by in the open marketplace. So, I think we feel pretty positive about the evolution of our SSD initiatives.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, I mean, obviously there was nothing secret about the acquisitions that occurred and it was our decision not to participate. We are confident in what we are doing internally right now.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just secondly just looking at the notebook market for the second half, can you may be talk about where you stand in terms of 5 millimeter drives design wins, how much momentum you think that can contribute to your business as the year progresses?", "Steve Luczo", "Sure. I don\u2019t know that I view 5-millimeter necessarily as a notebook drive. I think we view 7-millimeter as probably the right platform for thin and light notebooks. 5-millimeter probably is the more compelling drive for something even more mobile like a tablet. And we are happy with the engagement that we have on the 7-millimeter side as most OEMs are incorporating 7-millimeter and 7-millimeter hybrid into their next generation thin and light offerings. And we are pleased to-date with the engagement we have had on the 5-millimeter side going into tablet. So, we do think that high capacity, high performance, and much lower cost on a per gigabyte basis is compelling to mobile users. So, we will see how it plays out the rest of this fiscal year, but so far I would say we are encouraged by what we are seeing from the OEMs. Rocky, you want to add?", "Rocky Pimentel", "Yes, I was going to say this quarter we will be shipping a meaningful amount of 5-millimeter drives as we launch into our initial program. So, we are pretty positive. We have several major OEM commitments on the 5-millimeter that we will be pursuing as we exit the September quarter and then continue to build that volume in the December quarter.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks again.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rob Cihra representing Evercore. Please proceed.", "Rob Cihra - Evercore", "Hi, thanks very much. Two questions, I guess, because one on gross margin, it was actually solid in the quarter 28% even on a weak PC market. I am just wondering though if you look at your target range, what you think you need to see to get higher up that, I mean, is it simply better capacity utilization or there are more drivers to that? And I have a follow-up, if that\u2019s alright.", "Pat O'Malley", "This is Pat, Rob. Clearly, volume would be beneficial to us, I mean, but given the world that we are seeing is with the modern growth rates now, we\u2019re really managing on the price stability as much as we can because we need these margins continue to invest and also just mix. As Steve talked about with the cloud build out that\u2019s certainly been helpful to maintain it, but to drive to the middle of the range, you need either a greater mix or some volume because I think we\u2019re doing a pretty good job on maintaining the economics on the drives being sold.", "Rob Cihra - Evercore", "Okay and then just in CapEx you obviously have been running lean and you said running is a sort of whatever operational levels, I know you gave the guide for fiscal \u201914 to stay in your target range. Do you feel like you're almost running too low, I mean you\u2019re running nicely conservative but it was fiscal \u201913 almost too low when you start looking at new technologies and that sort of thing? I mean is that a, is there a chance for higher up in that range as you again in fiscal \u201914 or do you think you can still sort (ph) around maintenance levels. Thanks.", "Steve Luczo", "I think it depends on I think the answer to your question is no, I don\u2019t think it was too low. I think it was appropriate for the visibility that we have around demand and which is both again a technical transition issue on the client side offset by a technical transition on the enterprise side offset by very squishy macroeconomic conditions and not a lot of that has changed so we\u2019re going to run the capital pretty tight. If the trends continue where the client side shows little or no growth and cloud continues to grow. We do think we will hit capacity issues, which then you we will probably evidence themselves and shortages and a different margin structure at which point then we can consider what we do on the capital side but we\u2019re not going to lean into it other than maintaining what we need for technical advancements. Dave do you want to add?", "Dave Mosley", "No I think that\u2019s right.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner representing Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "I just wanted to get a little bit of detail on your thoughts on ASPs as we have head into the back half, I know Pat you said that you\u2019re managing to have good economic, I mean there is a good growth margins in the quarter but I think some of the OEMs had said they had seen HD pricing starting to come down. So can you give us some sense of your expectation for ASPs as we move into September?", "Pat O'Malley", "Our position has been in the last several quarters remaining relatively flat. Obviously there is, our view is we still want to drive the cost of storage down by delivering compelling products through technology and cost management, but our view on the price is going to be relatively stable and that\u2019s our plans for the rest of this calendar year.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "And you also talked about having I think the commentary was meaningful and also a 5 millimeter drives in September quarter, are you\u2019re going to start breaking out the hybrid and the SSD products in any time over the next couple of quarters because it seems like it's becoming a more important piece of your business.", "Randy Olmstead", "I think we will be able to give some level of guidance as that market develops for us, probably a little premature right now as Rocky said we\u2019re going through a lot of OEM qualifications, we\u2019re feeling fairly positive but once it starts taking traction that\u2019s probably a fair breakout for a period of time.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay great and then just my final question. I know you guys, anniversary anniversaried the Samsung acquisition in the beginning of the year or last year December. Have you had any progress in terms of integrating that business, I know couple of quarters ago you said you weren\u2019t really focused on that but just wanted to get an update. Thanks.", "Pat O'Malley", "We\u2019re still under MASCOM agreement which we\u2019re working very positively with the agency and so we don\u2019t view it as a huge challenge but we\u2019re operating these two entities on the interface of the customers vary independently still today.", "Steve Luczo", "Yeah I mean the R&D side and the ops side has been integrated for a while but it's just the customer facing activities that we\u2019re managing separately and we will continue to do so until we\u2019re released from those restrictions by MASCOM (ph).", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Smith representing Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.", "Scott Smith - Morgan Stanley", "Guys can you just run through some of the puts and takes in the free cash flow side and when do you expect to get back to levels that allow to meet your repurchase goals?", "Pat O'Malley", "So, maybe on the repurchase goals I don\u2019t know what you are referring to, but from our standpoint, Steve in his prepared comments talked about returning 70% of operating cash flow, which was our goal last year and we met it, and we are continuing try to target up to that this year as well and also as much as 90% cash flow. So, for fiscal 2013, we have never had a stated goal other than to continue to return large amount of the use of the cash flow to the shareholders.", "Scott Smith - Morgan Stanley", "Yes, I guess, and just referring to the $250 million target exiting 2014?", "Pat O'Malley", "Yes, okay, that\u2019s calendar 2014. So, that\u2019s still a target with us. Obviously, the share price does have an effect on it. So, we will manage the business and we will continue. In the meantime, the return significant amounts of capital cash flow to the shareholders. So, that\u2019s the fiscal \u201813 goal.", "Scott Smith - Morgan Stanley", "And then Pat, just on the free cash flow this quarter, I think there was a large other item, can you just run through what drove the lower free cash flow in the quarter?", "Pat O'Malley", "The redemption of the debt we issued $1 billion, but we also redeemed $700 million. So, we had $111 million of basically premium and charges to accelerate that redemption, but in the period, we are going to say of over $40 million a year, extend their debt maturities over two years and dropped overall portfolio by 130 basis points. So, that was a one-time charge of the whole restructuring of the debt profile.", "Scott Smith - Morgan Stanley", "Great, thank you. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski representing Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.", "Dan Garofalo - Piper Jaffray", "Good morning. It\u2019s Dan Garofalo on for Andy. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to focus on the enterprise, I know there has been a few questions, obviously another strong quarter, especially in the near line category. I guess, as you look at that category, it looks like 21% year-over-year unit growth in fiscal \u201813 given the increasing capacity that is getting shipped in cloud applications, how should we think about unit growth in that category. Is it fair to think that it could accelerate?", "Steve Luczo", "It is tended to have accelerated over the last two years. And I think the conditions that are causing that acceleration are still in their early stages. So, I think as Cloud continues to build out, we still expect growth in that area.", "Dan Garofalo - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And then I guess just one follow-up if I could focusing on the PC industry, in addition to talk about second half catalyst related to new product intros, there has also been talk of Microsoft gaining support for Windows XP next April, potentially being a catalyst for the PC industry. I just wonder how are you looking at that event, as well as any color you can provide on your view of the PC pipeline for the second half of the year. Thanks.", "Steve Luczo", "Well, I don\u2019t think we have \u2013 I mean, we have our own perspective on, which is we are positive, we are more positive than the doomsday scenario of the PC is dead. As you know, we tend to \u2013 we still wise line about PC Plus, not post PC. And we believe that the PC has an important role to plating and computing environment for sure as do the mobile devices that connect to it and around it as does the cloud that everything on it is going to ultimately connect to. So, our view is positive on the client side in all of its forms. And I wouldn\u2019t want to specifically identify an action by Microsoft, but we think the long-term trends are still positive for the PC industry, but there is no reason for us to kind of plan to that right today. We just \u2013 we have the capacity and ability to address that marketplace that\u2019s in front of us. And as it stabilizes or recovers we will be in a position to I think have a good product offering to fit all the different segmentations that are occurring around how people use technology and make their lives better.", "Dan Garofalo - Piper Jaffray", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Monika Garg representing Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. My question is on enterprise SSD market, I mean, we are seeing strong adoption of enterprise SSD, and Seagate has also made investment in the field. So, could you may be talk about the impact of enterprise SSDs on the mission critical drive?", "Rocky Pimentel", "Clearly there is emerging evolution of what\u2019s the high performance layer in the data centers which is the, it's a blend between mission critical and enterprise SSD and I think it's important that we have both sides of that equation covered, certainly there is again ebbs and flows of the transition between somebody wanting mission critical elements of HDDs and their typology versus SSD. So, I think with the growing success of our enterprise SSD initiative we\u2019re less concerned about what does that mean for mission critical drives and what it means about our kind of high performance element of the enterprise overall.", "So, certainly we see some customers migrating more to SSD enterprise class SSD solution but still the mission critical is an important element in the overall architecture so both elements are important and the fact that we\u2019re succeeding it both kind of gives us confidence that whatever the customer wants we can fulfill their need.", "Steve Luczo", "We like to garner our characterization and these are complementary technologies, I have heard that somewhere before.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities", "And then if I may just a follow-up on the same question. I mean we have seen the NAND companies moving in the enterprise SSD space and given more than 80% cost of the enterprise SSD is just raw flash so the question is how you think HDD industry and Seagate compete against with NAND vendors when given they are increasing the offering in this space too.", "Steve Luczo", "Obviously understanding the customers and integrating with the customers is a key point of how successful you\u2019re going to be and so pointing back you will see a variance in the enterprise space understanding customer workloads, is really important. I will say that the market itself is very complex and so at some places the SSDs are being used as storage devices and some places they are actually storage class memory or memory like devices. And difference (inaudible) that it might be hanging up of, it's a really complex space maybe with one brush (ph) and say you know 10k or 15k HDDs belong here and SSDs belong here especially given the plethora of applications and the servers this will be really completed.", "Pat O'Malley", "So I think the reality is that the workload and application aspects that we either favor SSD or HDDs are different and those that favor SSDs weren\u2019t really being served by HDDs it's actually opening up in an entirely new application set and the front end of that set has advantages to SSD if it's random and if it enables therefore the analysis of more and more data then we think that obviously supports the need for high availability data to run through that front end and so we actually think warrant store (ph) and things like that are becoming very important as well. So again the replacement aspect of IE, I use an SSD drive to replace a boot drive that\u2019s a three year old story that was about 1% of the mission critical drives that we sold. I think the reality is just like phones that aren\u2019t using disk drives or driving the creation and sharing content that\u2019s impacting the need for more HDD and the infrastructure, SSDs on the enterprise side are doing the same thing with basically big data analytics and we\u2019re one having products that will participate in that category directly, we do it with partners, we do it with our own products and it also benefits us on the HDD side or on the hybrid side to one of the earlier questions I think which Kugele asked about the nature of that customer which seems to be the big data customers that need an accelerator into the SSD.", "So we think again this is just part of an overall architectural change that favors big data growth and big data needs to sit on that disk drive ultimately.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Wittine representing Longbow Research. Please proceed.", "Joe Wittine - Longbow Research", "I think, hate to look at market shares on a short term basis but any comments you can make on whether the strength in enterprise reflects any share gains during the quarter and conversely the softness and client reflects any share losses or anything you walked away from? Thanks.", "Steve Luczo", "We have tended not to chase prices much on the client side, which may have resulted in some share loss. I would say, on the enterprise side again, it\u2019s the ability to kind of execute in quarter. Those could either be architectural issues, where we have to be qualified at some OEM or with some particular CSP in someone else isn\u2019t or it could product related. We do feel good about it\u2019s probably more of a Q1 story than a Q4 story, but we do feel good about the positioning of our new 4 terabyte drive. But I think in general, I think any market share shifts in the 1% range is pretty much noise level at this point. And I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it. I think the industry is kind of fairly stable in its market share right now, and I don\u2019t see any big shifts occurring there one way or the other.", "Joe Wittine - Longbow Research", "Thanks, Steve. And then a quick follow-up on OpEx, we have crept over the percentage of sales for a few quarters now, maybe it\u2019s not surprising given all the new products you have introduced, but you got it flat again kind of what changes \u2013 what changes going forward that enables if you kind of keep at this current level, any\u2026.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, I know, it\u2019s an important question. Yes, I know, it\u2019s an important question. I think with the gross margin change that we have seen over the last couple of years anywhere from 800 to 1000 basis points of additional gross margin, and of course, the company has been good about returning a big percentage of that to our shareholders, I also think given all the opportunities in storage both on the mobile and the cloud side that it\u2019s important for us to invest in some new technologies and products that are resulting from that change in marketplace and that\u2019s where we have been making some investments. And it has pushed the OpEx up marginally. It\u2019s obviously tied to our expectations of revenues and profits down the stream., Some of that is SSD related, some of that is core technology related to make sure that we can keep aerial density growing at the rates that we need to, some of it specifically to mobile and some of it is to cloud.", "And again at the September meeting, we will continue to update you on whatever our views are about these investments and the particular markets and the technologies that we are deploying, but I do think it\u2019s important for the company to make those investments and position itself to generate revenue growth and margin growth down the stream from those investments. We watch it closely as you know. OpEx is something that we fight hard for every day, and it\u2019s one of the nice DNAs of Seagate. So, we are actively managing it, but I do think it\u2019s important for us to take some of that gross margin expansion and position our company for growth, because there is so much growth related to the storage that we would be remised not to.", "Joe Wittine - Longbow Research", "Fair point, thanks.", "Steve Luczo", "Thank you.", "Operator", "You have time for one final question and that question comes from the line of Cindy Shaw representing DISCERN. Please proceed.", "Cindy Shaw - DISCERN", "Thank you. Several questions. First, you talked at your Investor Meeting last year about going out after the cloud storage by trying to really go up the stack and go more directly, and there is talk about potentially getting higher margins and prices to that value-add. As you look at what you are getting in terms of cloud business now, is that what\u2019s happening or is it more of a classic near line drive?", "Steve Luczo", "No, it\u2019s a classic near line drive.", "Cindy Shaw - DISCERN", "Is there still a thought that you can with some of these folks that are trying to use more commodity-like drives go up the stack and get those higher margins?", "Steve Luczo", "We think about it very differently. With OpenStack deployment, there is the opportunity for a desegregation of the software and services level that exist today and many companies are pursuing architectures that say how you take our devices and deploy it with OpenStack to achieve their storage goals. To do that, there are many changes that we may need to make at the device level that effectively move us up the stack, and yes, we have those discussions ongoing with a wide variety of technology providers.", "Cindy Shaw - DISCERN", "And then it\u2019s thought as to when that might actually start to happen in the marketplace, so we are talking the quarters, years?", "Steve Luczo", "Quarters.", "Cindy Shaw - DISCERN", "Okay. And then following up on a couple of the earlier questions, there was some discussion about potential for capacity constraints as demand and start to improve and the constraint being media. Do you feel like you have got a lot of capacity in another area such as (inaudible) and things like that or would you start to bump into other things pretty quickly after the media?", "Rocky Pimentel", "It really depends on how it comes out Cindy, if it's the cloud drives there honestly heads media rich, if their client devices which were not as Steve said earlier we\u2019re not really leaning into and those are more box cap related (ph) where we have to procure individual parts and test time and things like that, so there is a balancing act. I think right now we\u2019ve got enough capacity for what we see in FY \u201914 and we\u2019re going to be cautious with our CapEx.", "Cindy Shaw - DISCERN", "Okay and then one final clarification, when you answered one of the error questions I wanted to see, it was talking about PC long term trends, you used the word stabilizing, recover. Is it your view that the year-over-year declines in PCs was been seen, in the last few quarters are somewhat temporary phenomenon and the PC units are going to actually start to grow or is that factored in potentially getting hard drives into tablets.", "Steve Luczo", "Yeah I think it's maybe closer to the second half, I think that we need to stop viewing the world as defining it as the technology that\u2019s 10 year\u2019s old. When someone says PC I don\u2019t know what they think about that giant desktop thing or the notebook, our technology market has continued to evolve over the 35 years I have been in it and what\u2019s happening with tablets is in my mind not any different than what happened when we went from mainframe to many decline servers to PC to now phones and it's a constant evolution of technology that\u2019s basically becoming more and more available to more and more people which allows more people to share and create and at the end of the day that\u2019s driving more stores. So yes we\u2019re positive on the future of client devices if client devices are things that go in individuals hands and they will take the form of something that I can carry in my pocket or something that I can carry in my briefcase or something that\u2019s in my home or something that\u2019s in my workplace that is all connected and some of it may also be in a shared services that many people connect to. So I think we need to kind of change our thinking about what\u2019s happening to the PC, the PC is evolving just like it has for the last 30 years and continue to evolve.", "Okay. I think that\u2019s last question. Again we want to thank everybody for your time this morning and for coming in for our early call and we look forward to seeing you in September and then talking to you on the next call.

Please go ahead Steve.", "Steve Luczo", "Thank you Kate. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. Seagate demonstrated excellent execution this quarter and achieved revenues of $3.5 billion and on a non-GAAP basis gross margin of 28.5%, net income of $473 million, and diluted earnings per share of $1.29. We had a strong cash flow quarter generating operating cash flow of $682 million and free cash flow of $521 million. In terms of our product portfolio we shipped a record 48.7 exabytes of storage, up 14% year-over-year and averaged a record 875 gigabytes per drive across our portfolio, up 19% over last year.", "Our non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 15.1% in inventory turns and day sales outstanding were within our targeted ranges. Our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and investments, and during the September quarter S&P raised its corporate rating on Seagate to BB+ further reflection our strong financial position.", "Returning value to shareholders through share redemptions and dividends remains a top priority for Seagate. In early October, we completed a private share redemption transaction with Samsung of 32.7 million shares for $1.5 billion. In addition, our Board last week approved raising our quarterly dividend $0.05 or 13% to $0.43 per share.", "Through these activities, we expect to meet our goal of returning approximately 70% of operating cash flow to shareholders this fiscal year. At our strategic update in September, we discussed the major dynamics we see in the storage industry and the expanding and changing opportunities for Seagate in mobile, cloud, and open source computing. Looking out to 2020, we believe that data growth and demand for storage is continuing at a pace that is higher than what the drive industry infrastructure is capable to produce, and we estimate that approximately 60% of this data will be stored in both home and enterprise cloud environments.", "Seagate\u2019s research and development is focused on advancing our product offerings to align with these emerging market trends. Some recent examples of our R&D success include our 4 terabyte nearline product delivering a competitive combination of capacity and energy efficiency, the storage industry\u2019s first enterprise and desktop hybrid drives, and enterprise level NAS offering leveraging are LaCie software expertise, and the announcement of our Seagate Kinetic Open Storage Platform designed to simplify data management and improve performance and scalability while lowering the total cost of ownership of cloud computing.", "Developing products that our customers value and which solves their storage needs is one of our highest priorities, and we believe we have a very competitive portfolio from traditional HDDs to the highest performance flash-based enterprise products. We also continue to focus development efforts on improving magnetic recording aerial density. We\u2019re leading the transition to Shingled magnetic recording technology or SMR and are currently shipping drives utilizing this technology in significant volume. We will be incorporating this technology into additional products over the coming year. In addition, we\u2019re integrating flash technology across our product portfolio, and we\u2019re pleased with the traction we\u2019re seeing in our solid state hybrid drives as well as our enterprise SSD products.", "For the September quarter, non-GAAP product margins were 28.5% reflecting market demand for our storage portfolio, effective supply chain management, and cost improvements. Maintaining margins within our long-term target range of 27% to 32% will continue to enable us to further invest in advancing our storage technology and manufacturing efficiency. Non-GAAP operating expenses this quarter were $469 million within our targeted range of 12% to 14% of revenue and reflecting investments in our core infrastructure and aligning our organization for our cloud, mobile, open source, and flash technology opportunities.", "Turning to our December quarter outlook, we see the revenue and unit demand environment remaining relatively similar to what we have seen in the last several quarters. While global macroeconomic conditions and technology transitions continue to provide a level of uncertainty with our customers, we are mindful of those factors and we are confident that we can continue to execute effectively. For the December quarter, we expect revenues of approximately $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion, and non-GAAP gross margin relatively flat sequentially.", "Seagate is well-positioned for this era of ongoing data growth and technology transformation, and we will continue to focus on executing to our financial model and delivering strong operating results. I am pleased with our performance this quarter, and on behalf of the entire management team, I\u2019d like to thank our employees for their solid performance and thank our customers, partners, and suppliers for their support and commitment. And before we open the call for questions, I want to take a moment and acknowledge the well-deserved executive promotions we announced today. Rocky Pimentel named President, Global Markets and Customers and Dave Mosley named President, Operations and Technology. By elevating Dave and Rocky to lead our core product technology operations and customer engagement, Seagate is even better positioned for continued operational excellence and to further our ability to capitalize on our growing opportunities in the storage marketplace. This new leadership alignment also allows me to focus more on the long-term strategic opportunities for our company and to increase my efforts around accelerating our mobile and cloud technology strategies. I am pleased to continue to be Chairman and CEO of Seagate, and I have no plans to leave the company anytime soon.", "Regina, we are now ready to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And your first question today comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Good afternoon guys. Two questions for me. One, maybe you could just talk about the buyback program as you go forward and given the repurchase of shares from Samsung, what implications does it have to the Section 382 limitations that you have on your buyback as you go through the next 12 months?", "Steve Luczo", "Well, the Samsung shares were not subject to the 382 restrictions. And as you may know, and I will have Pat go into this in a little more detail, the 382 requirements were changed a little bit in a mode that makes it more favorable for Seagate in terms of giving us more flexibility quarter-to-quarter. So the buyback redemption from Samsung didn\u2019t affect us, and the 382 changes provide us a little more flexibility going forward.", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "Yes, with the recent IRS relaxation or amendment of the 382, companies like Seagate have been buying back their shares were in the same ilk of other companies buying other companies. So, we got relaxation on that. So, now the 382 should not be a gate or anything like that buying back our shares. So, our buying back redemption of shares will be totally a function of the cash flow generated by the entity.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Fair enough. Thank you. And then maybe if you can just touch on ASP declines that you had sequentially of about $1 to \u2013 it sounds like I am assuming it might be more due to the consumer side of the business, but maybe if you could talk about it on a like-for-like basis, what did you see in terms of pricing in September quarter and how do you expect that to shake out in December quarter? Thank you.", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "Less than 2%, we expect that environment to continue on a like-for-like basis not mix of course, but like-for-like.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Perfect, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray.", "Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray", "Good afternoon. Just wonder if I could get a little bit more color your SMR drives, your competitor launched a 7-platter helium drive that\u2019s expected to come out this quarter with one use case definitely targeted at the cloud. So do you think your drives leveraging SMR will be effectively positioned against those drives in both cloud and enterprise?", "Steve Luczo", "Yes. We are pretty confident in our cloud near line portfolio right now, and we look forward to the product launches that are coming next year.", "Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And then just a last follow-up on gross margin, it certainly came in a little bit higher, and I don\u2019t think you guided flat, you said so, I guess can you just talk about what drove that up this quarter and why you think it\u2019s going to just continue to remain flatter, is that just a matter of mix?", "Steve Luczo", "I will let Rocky go into that in a little detail and Dave would just give some macro thoughts, this is Steve. One is we have continued to emphasize our focus on quality of revenue. So we are starting to focus a lot more in revenue market share and exabyte market share, and we feel that in certain segments it just didn\u2019t make sense to participate given the rather lackluster revenue boost that would have provided maybe margin pressure. So, I think part of it is that we were selective in the business we pursued from a margin perspective. Rocky will talk to that a little bit more in terms of quality of share, and then the operating side, the factory has really performed extremely well. So we had some really great execution from Dave\u2019s organization and he can go into a little bit more detail following Rocky.", "Rocky Pimentel", "So I think to echo Steve\u2019s comments, you know, there has been a lot of operational go-to-market discipline that we have tried to build over the last several quarters through processes and behavior, and you know we\u2019re focusing on preserving or gaining share in those key categories of the portfolio that give us margin leverage and being very disciplined at the low end of the portfolio where you know the competition is maybe looking for volume upticks, et cetera. So anyway that gives you the color on it.", "Steve Luczo", "And from the operations perspective, we continue to manage the things that are under our control scrap and freight lanes and warranty and things like that very well, so we\u2019re pretty comfortable with the portfolio we have and we keep driving it.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities", "First one here is could you maybe kind of talk about the momentum you see from your cloud or web scale customers buying directly from you guys and maybe if you could provide some idea of how much revenue \u2013 your enterprise revenues from these kind of segments?", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "I will just again, let me just say you know generally the purchases by the cloud service providers or Internet service providers or any other big web based companies are they are very choppy, and we\u2019ve said that over the last several quarters these large volume orders, but they tend to come and go in big blocks, and sometimes those companies are buying from our traditional OEMs and sometimes they shift their purchasing to direct kind of depending on what type of architectures they are deploying. So, I think it's a bit early to kind of get a read on how that\u2019s going to play out consistently, in fact it's my personal belief that the traditional OEMs are probably going to reestablish themselves pretty effectively in this marketplace just because of their go to market capability, so it's dynamic and it's choppy, and then I can let Rocky talk a bit about how we view what percentage of our drives go into what I just think of cloud-based architectures.", "Rocky Pimentel", "Yeah I think we were really pleased this last quarter despite in the cloud market some softness overall, we were able to gain market share in some of the key categories, and we talked a few quarters ago about estimating our cloud business at somewhere around 10% to 12% and now it\u2019s continued to escalate, and probably 15% to 20% because some of it is direct and some of it is indirect, but we\u2019re really seeing a lot of traction and with our recently announced kinetic drive, we\u2019re getting a lot of interest from all the key cloud customers across the globe, and I think we\u2019re continuing to build a great relationship with all those key customers to give us a preferred competitive position.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities", "And last one from me regarding your hybrid enterprise drive, could you maybe talk about the traction you see in the market and kind of where you think the group could be in that segment?", "Steve Luczo", "Yes so, we've had a limited release of the enterprise hybrid drive with couple of our key OEM customers, but it is benchmarking really well. It's particularly as we noted against our 15,000 RPM class drive in the marketplace, so as we continue to kind of uptick the marketing effort with our key OEM customers, we see that continue to grow for the foreseeable future. We were really satisfied as well in our desktop hybrid introductions and then in our client class commercial class hybrid drives meaning we crossed over 1 million units this quarter of shipments and see that continue to grow as an important part of the client compute part of the TAM basically.", "Operator", "It's from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights Research.", "Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research", "Can we go a little bit more into what\u2019s underpinning the guidance of effectively flat Q-on-Q market by segment, and then maybe I might have a follow-up on that?", "Steve Luczo", "So, we generally don\u2019t break it up by segment, but just if you take a look at the \u2013 even going back the last eight quarters, we have been running above our new target range of 27% to 32%, so \u2013 but while that period has been going on, the visibility is nothing stronger than it has been in the past. So we are in a world that has limited visibility. We are playing in the world that\u2019s relatively flat on unit, but growth in exabytes and that\u2019s how we are taking the approach of business. We are going after the quality of revenue. We are trying to manage the business accordingly and deploy capital appropriately. So that\u2019s the world we are living in and that\u2019s the world we are operating in.", "Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research", "Okay. And then within that context, would you be expecting flattish going out on to calendar year as well, and also given that you typically see seasonality in the December quarter and looking at the year ago compares where you had the iPad Mini being significantly cannibalistic, but there doesn\u2019t appear to be any new tablets cannibalistic device. Is there an opportunity for upside do you feel or do you feel that this is actually an aggressive target basically?", "Steve Luczo", "It seems like you are focused on unit TAMs still, is that right?", "Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research", "Yes, yes, I am sorry, I am sorry that\u2019s with respect to unit TAMs.", "Steve Luczo", "That\u2019s not the only world you are talking about. Again, that\u2019s not the only world we think about. So we think unit TAM probably trends as it has over the last several quarters, which seems to be this kind of 140 give or take like we said I think the last call and the call before that whether or not when you are within 10 million units of either side of that type of TAM for the drive industry, now that\u2019s the things that the industry can manage pretty easily given the way we are producing. It\u2019s really the mix within that. That\u2019s more critical. And I think that just the architectural trends that we see one is the continued advancement of mobile technologies and then the network effect that, that has on where data is created and stored doesn\u2019t seem to us there would be any trend to break away from that. Hopefully, we are some of the new mobile products. You get an even greater network effect, because maybe there is more endpoints of people sharing which content, but the reason we kind of feel December is the same is the last five or six quarters is because we don\u2019t really see any big macro changes negative or positive and we don\u2019t really see any shifts away from the mobile and cloud future that we have been pretty solid on speaking to. So I think you are going to see relatively flat TAMs with the shift to increasing capacity per drive, which of course were the vertically integrated drive companies means absorption in heads and disc, which is good for us. And then the higher capacity drives of course are higher value-add technology as they are harder drives to making harder drives to test.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of (indiscernible) with BMO Capital Markets.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. I had a question on hybrids and SSDs, in your Analyst Day you guys communicated that you guys would have about $100 million in hybrids and SSDs, can you provide an update on that for if you guys are still tracking that?", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, I would say we succeeded in those comments that we made previously. We are not given specific numbers on that, but we met or exceeded that comment that we made in the September analyst update.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. The question on the ASPs, it was down roughly 3% sequentially. And when I look at the product mix, your consumer electronics rose roughly flat and your hybrid shipments were much higher than we expected. So can you help us understand why ASPs were down 3, was there anything in terms of each products, where pricing was more aggressive or not?", "Steve Luczo", "Overall, the portfolio like I said was less than 2%. What you are seeing in ASP is much more mix adjusted on based on how the between segments. So if we take a look at the breakdown where the revenue came from, it was on a higher mix of I\u2019d say client drives versus then I mean the enterprise side. So it\u2019s all \u2013 what you are seeing is all affected by the market mix.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Alright, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Thank you. Good afternoon. A couple of questions from me. I guess first, when it comes to highest capacity drives that the cloud can buy, it's basically 4 terabyte correct, on the 3.5 inch form factor. I\u2019m just interested in what the next aerial density point is when we should see that and will you launch it on the cloud first?", "Dave Mosley", "We will probably will launch it on the cloud first, we won't make a product announcement today but you can imagine that if that segment is really demand in the capacity points we were talking about and we\u2019re looking hard on it.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Let\u2019s go peep into the fourth ladder, universe.", "Dave Mosley", "It's pretty competitive information Rich but we\u2019re not going to talk about what part of (indiscernible) we\u2019re putting inside of our devices.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay and then I guess within that range if you write about where the Exabyte growth is going and the industry's ability to fulfill it the supply chain we will need to invest as well, especially on the head side, but at the same time heads are one of those categories where one of your competitors buys almost all of their business. So I'm just interested in your views of the strategic levels of commitment that the head supplier has to you guys and your view of cutbacks in that area if you want to keep it more in-house.", "Dave Mosley", "Well, I think we have talked about this a little bit at the analyst day in New York. We\u2019re great partners with the external head vendor TDK and we don't foresee changing that going into the future. They have other customers obviously and what they do with those other customers kind of up to them. We will continue to maintain the technology and manufacturing synergies that we get with them going forward.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay and then last question is just Pat, what should we be assuming from a share count perspective on a blended basis for the second quarter?", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "I think if you take a look at the December quarter based on what we have transacted with Samsung. It's is a 320 million for the actual shares and approximately 346 million for fully diluted and I just planned for that.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Eric Sterling with Barclays.", "Eric Sterling - Barclays", "Your competitor last week had talked about modest potential improvement on the PC side, I\u2019m just wondering if you guys are seeing anything to substantiate that looking at into the end of the year and into next year? Thanks.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes so I think right now we still see a pretty choppy situation among the different OEMs. There's clearly some that are still suffering and some that are doing better than the overall market segment and we look out to next year in early stages, we\u2019re hopeful with the new design, the OEMs are coming out with well to stimulate consumer demand but it's still just a pretty murky segment of the market and that's why I think we\u2019re very selective and cautious about how we continue to look at the client level of the marketplace.", "Eric Sterling - Barclays", "And any of the different view on the corporate PC side?", "Steve Luczo", "Yeah I think we\u2019re much more optimistic on the corporate PC side, and we have got a couple of initiatives that should bear a very positive fruit as we go into 2014 so we\u2019re much more optimistic on that side for sure.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Rob Cihra with Evercore.", "Rob Cihra - Evercore", "Two questions I would like to ask one just real quick I guess for Pat with the OpEx do you think OpEx keeps increasing in dollar terms into the summer quarter I guess particularly with options but anything outside of the ordinary and then more sort of strategic product wise, can you tell us I know it's early but when you look at the ultra-mobile drive targeting tablet, where is the early OEM interest do you think most focus is it literally tablets or is it convertibles and is it going for using capacity or sure of bang to the buck as a differentiator or is it trying to kind of create a different looking part, I\u2019m just trying to see where the demand is there. Thank you very much.", "Steve Luczo", "So I will answer the first part and then I will hand it off to Rocky but in the first part, we are committed for the December quarter statement, 12% to 14% revenue range for OpEx and it\u2019s probably close to the high end as you said with options in our continued investment in cloud mobility. So it\u2019s probably at the higher end of that range for the December quarter. And then it should probably moderate after that and for Rocky to go through.", "Rocky Pimentel", "Yes, this is Rocky. So we have a number of OEM programs currently addressing the ultra-mobile class product that we announced back in September. One of the benefits of our design kit is the ability for the OEM to either buy the drive in a native format or buy it as a hybrid, which gives a lot of flexibility we provide the micro code in the mobile enablement kit according to what the OEM wishes to do, but certainly as we see 2014 unfold and this is where there could be a new pop in the consumer side of the business as the new form factor and design packaging comes out to be more of a convertible device that functions the benefits of both the tablet and the traditional notebook world. This is certainly something we think it stimulate consumer demand. And also commercial demand, we think that there will be some commercial platforms also introduced that better fit the enterprise environment. So we are actually very hopeful on the ultra-mobile side. And maybe Dave has got a couple more comments on that?", "Dave Mosley", "Yes. I guess the other thing I would say is that we are pretty confident in that 5-millimeter design point as being robust enough to handle it. And a lot of that will depend on the market adoption of those form factors, but it\u2019s still pretty slow, but over the next year we should see more and hopefully that\u2019s a compelling play out there in the notebook space.", "Rob Cihra - Evercore", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel", "Yes, thanks for taking the question. A couple if I can as well. I think in the past and I have not seen the supplemental commentary stuff yet, but I think in the past you have talked about the breakdown of your 8.1 million units that you have shipped in total enterprise between mission-critical and near line. Can you disclose that? And then also I am interested to understand what you view as your share position in the higher capacity point with the 4 terabyte solution starting to ship this last quarter? And I have a follow-up.", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "Hi, Aaron. This is Pat. I will answer the first part and I will let Rocky answer the high capacity. When we look at the products in the markets whether it\u2019s near line business critical and mission-critical, they are very similar in their technical applications and the customer sets. Therefore, we feel it\u2019s more appropriate to aggregate these for presentation purposes and we will continue to do that in the future. And Rocky, you could take the high capacity?", "Rocky Pimentel", "Yes. So, on the high capacity side, we actually gained some market share in the near line this last quarter with our 4 terabyte solution. We were admittedly a quarter or two late to market against the competition. We have gained our traditional market share in that category. And on the enterprise class products, we also gained this last quarter. So we are very happy with the performance of the upper end of the portfolio.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel", "Okay. And then as my follow-up, just looking at the continued return of cash or free cash flow to shareholders, it looks like coming out of this quarter with a $32.7 million that you are spending on the shares of Samsung, we are already talking about $1.8 billion spend thus far this year. How do we take that in the context of the 90% cash flow from operations of return that you expect to do? And I think on top of that, are we still kind of sticking to the target of $250 million exiting calendar \u201814? I just want to be clear that those shares from Samsung aren\u2019t on top of that?", "Steve Luczo", "So we commit three-side turn, 70% of operating cash flow. And this puts us well in line to do that. For the rest of the shares for beyond this level, we don\u2019t view the \u2013 because of 382 rules now, we are going to view those as fairly synonymous going forward. So now, it\u2019s going to be a function of cash flow, but given when we have started this program and the stock is at 19, it\u2019s now going to be a function of the stock price and how we want to look at dividends and redemption of shares. So we will continue to monitor that and we will engage appropriately, but from our standpoint we are committed for the return on cash flow in the most efficient and effective way to our shareholders.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel", "Okay. So the $1.5 million for the Samsung shares is inclusive or should be included in that 70% number?", "Steve Luczo", "That\u2019s correct.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel", "Okay, thank you.", "Steve Luczo", "Sure, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "I just wanted to ask a little bit about your CapEx plans going forward I think historically you have had a goal of 6% to 8% of revenue for your CapEx, you have been well below that clearly with the market being relatively flat. I wouldn\u2019t expect you to increase that but just wanted to understand your views of spending for CapEx, what do you need to spend on? What do you think the industry is spending on and does that pick up at a new point? Thanks.", "Dave Mosley", "So yeah as we have talked about before we\u2019re still pretty much in line with 6% to 8% for this year although as we see that we have enough capacity online to meet the demands you know quarter-over-quarter we will sometimes pull the breaks a little bit and we did that starting a little bit last quarter so which as reflected in the CapEx numbers that we talked about. I think that we can replace equipment and keep our technology migrating along for something well under that 6% to 8% so occasionally from time to time we will pull back but we will be ready to go should we see upsides either heads, disks or drives as Exabyte march goes on.", "Right now I\u2019m a little bit just concerned that that we won't see that for another year or so we pulled this last quarter.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "And then just thinking about the long term targets that you could have for the gross margins 27% to 32%, you guys are sort of at the lower end of that, how do we get to the higher end of that range what needs to happen? Thanks.", "Steve Luczo", "I think Sherri it's really a function of again kind of relative growth of the cloud service providers again just because of the value associated with those drives and then really just macroeconomic traction I mean I think as long as the petabyte growth is where it's at, the industry does all right to maintain the margins because of the absorption, but I think really to push the industry you know let say above 30% I think it's probably going to take some overall growth. I think the world is still a bit cautious on maybe that plays into some of the things we talked about earlier in terms of what happens with the drives that are more targeted towards the mobile market that with the next-generation of products from OEMs could be compelling. You can get some Exabyte growth with HDD's in the markets that today are just purely SSDs. We have seen that even a little bit on the high-end notebook market that is all flash based or hybrid drives now represent about 20% of that market which is a market that I think year ago people would have said we wouldn\u2019t have anything of so. I think it just plays into a bunch of things but I think the real driver is going to be a better macro outlook with generate just you know a higher rate of global demand for storage both in terms of exabytes and units across the board.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Joe Wittine with Longbow Research.", "Joe Wittine - Longbow Research", "The big introduction of new SSDs was in May, I hope you can maybe talk through how the adoption has gone and maybe how you\u2019re competing there too with the relative mix of OEM versus channel and then maybe as a third point, what\u2019s the ultimate share opportunity within pure SSDs? Thanks.", "Rocky Pimentel", "We\u2019re still in the early stage of the SSD I think we were really pleased with this quarter\u2019s performance on SSDs obviously, making the comment that we did over a $100 million of solid stake related storage in the quarter tells you that you know our SSD business unit performed very well relative to a quarter-to-quarter performance. I think as we look out and actually look at this quarter\u2019s performance the unit is probably as big as anything that's been acquired recently by other companies. So we were very pleased with that, I think we\u2019re still working on our technology roadmap of the sustainable strategic advantages we can have in each of the key product portfolios so I don't know that we can now that we made a bold statement as to how much of a market share we\u2019re going to have but I think that we feel with our presence in our existing storage portfolio and the response we've been getting from our major accounts in both the cloud service area as well as the OEM area the opportunity is there for us to execute to have a pretty handsome share in the SSD market. But it's still early on and there is a lot of plays to be executed and a lot of competitive developments that are going to happen. So we have to go and attack it.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, this is Steve. I mean, it\u2019s pretty dynamic right now. And we expect it will be over the next couple of years as all these different technologies play out in terms of which application spaces they are successful and then which kind of workload requirements are needed by which type of customer. I think for Seagate, certainly, we have always targeted the enterprise SAS market as one that we believe we have a competitive advantage in value-add as a result of our experience in the higher end compute market as it exist. Obviously, Hitachi has the same advantage. So I think relative to some of the other players that haven\u2019t been as exposed to those enterprise workloads as we have, the drive industry has kind of a natural advantage and I could see that those shares reflect what we see in the mission-critical space.", "I think the SATA space gets a little more confusing just because it\u2019s currently under a lot of price pressure from the people that control media and then the PCI market space whether or not you call that storage or fast memory is also I think extremely challenged right now by a lot of competitors in the space. And while there is value-add to the software, the companies that are providing the media I think are making it difficult for anyone to really have an attractive margin there. So for us, we are really focused on enterprise SAS. That\u2019s where we think we have our best opportunity in the most capabilities and we were most excited about our partnership with Samsung. And the other areas, we will proceed with cautiously, but with the same mindset that we are really focused on margins here and want to make sure that we deploy something that we can sustain over a number of years with the competitive advantage.", "Joe Wittine - Longbow Research", "Great overview, thanks. As my quick follow-up, Pat, with the sustainable or a go-forward quarterly interest expense, net interest expense number after the $1.5 billion goes out, that went out the door in October? Thanks.", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "So the interest expense, if you just talk pure interest expense, it\u2019s around $40 million to $45 million in that range. Obviously, if you are talking to net line over the interest income, the interest income is still going to be relatively low whether we have the cash or not, you are not getting much on your investment this day. So that won\u2019t marginally change. So I think if you are just looking for the interest expense model around $45 million and it will be okay.", "Joe Wittine - Longbow Research", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Your final question today comes from the line of Steven Fox at Cross.", "Steven Fox - Cross", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Just two questions from me. Just I was wondering if we can get some highlights around the branded business for the quarter whether just it look like it was up marginally from fiscal Q4 and sort of the outlook for the rest of the calendar year? And then secondly, just on the Kinetic announcement, probably don\u2019t understand the technology as well as I should, but from a go-to-market standpoint, your ability to commercialize this platform, can you just sort of talk about, I don\u2019t know if timeframe is relevant, but just sort of how you go about realizing revenues from this announcement? Thanks.", "Rocky Pimentel", "Yes, this is Rocky. I will take the branded one and then on Kinetic, I will turn it over to Dave. On branded, I would say, we were very pleased with the performance of the branded division. We succeeded in higher capacity drives in that category in the marketplace. There was legitimately a very challenging low end of the market price environment for branded, but despite that characteristic, our branded team did execute well against the market that made sense for our quality of business. So we are really pleased with that. Now having said that, there is a key product segment in the branded business, 2 terabyte that has been pretty successful in the marketplace for the last quarter or two and we are now shipping that product into the marketplace and that was not present to our September numbers in volumes. So we are optimistic about what we can continue to do on the branded side as we get to volume on our 2 terabyte products. So we will keep you posted on that. And I will turn over to Dave then for Kinetic.", "Dave Mosley", "Yes, Steven on the Kinetic announcement, it\u2019s really a development kit at this point in time, it\u2019s some electronics added to our print circuit board on our hard drives, not tremendously difficult to do, but the ecosystem that\u2019s outside of the drive isn\u2019t developed yet. So we need to get the product out so that people can get working on that development. As you know in the past, we have kind of spearheaded the changes whether it\u2019s SCSI or fiber channel or serial attached SCSI in the enterprise world to new interfaces and this is the same along that line. Although it's not a block based interface it's really a key value Ethernet interface if you will, and the largest reason that we did it was because well we have got a bunch of customers asking us for things like this, but what\u2019s happening what they see is that the objects themselves are being disaggregated in the blocks in order to be passed across the block based interfaces into the drive and that\u2019s costing money outside of that the disk drive whether it's software or silicon or whatever. So by virtue of us having this I mean expose this kind of interface to them then they can go and integrate without some of those added cost and the total cost ownership [ph] goes down. So we\u2019re pretty excited about it right now but you need everybody\u2019s else to go help develop that ecosystem outside the drive.", "All right great. Thanks everyone. On behalf of the Seagate team we thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter.

Seagate demonstrated solid execution this quarter achieving revenues of $3.5 billion, net income of $428 million, and diluted earnings per share of $1.24.", "On a non-GAAP basis, we recorded gross margin of 28.5%, net income of $455 million, and diluted earnings per share of $1.32. We had a very strong cash flow quarter generating operating cash flow of $856 million and free cash flow of $713 million. During the December quarter, we shipped a record 52.2 exabytes of storage and averaged a record 922 gigabytes per drive across our portfolio.", "Our non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 14.4% and operating expenses, inventory turns, and day sales outstanding were within our targeted ranges. Our balance sheet remains healthy as we ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash and investments.", "As part of our capital allocation strategy, returning value to shareholders through share redemptions and dividends remains a top priority for Seagate. During the December quarter, we redeemed 33 million shares which put us a few quarters ahead of our fiscal \u201914 plan and raised our quarterly dividend by 13% to $0.43 per share.", "Through these activities, we expect to meet our goal of returning approximately 70% of operating cash flow to shareholders this fiscal year.", "We have talked about strategic acquisitions as a potential area of capital deployment and at the end of December we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire Xyratex for $374 million. Xyratex is a leading provider of data storage technology including hard disk drive test equipment in modular solutions for the enterprise data storage industry. The addition of Xyratex will further enhance Seagate\u2019s vertically integrated supply and manufacturing chain for disk drives and ensure uninterrupted access to important capital equipment. The acquisition also expands Seagate\u2019s storage solutions portfolio by adding Xyratex\u2019s industry leading enterprise data storage systems and high performance computing business.", "We expect to close this transaction sometime in the June quarter and for the acquisition to be slightly accretive in its first full fiscal year of operation or sooner.", "As the trends in Exabyte growth and technology shifts continue to develop over time, we focus on a few main areas that we believe will allow us to continue to deliver solid results in the near term and position us well for long term success. These areas include expanding and innovating our storage product portfolio to align with emerging trends in mobility, cloud, and open source computing.", "In the mobile space, we\u2019re leading the industry in hybrid technology and our 5-millimeter drives are now being sold by multiple-OEM manufacturers in tablets. For cloud-based applications, we have launched our Kinetic platform for object based storage with strong interest from developers, customers, and then users, and we are continuing to expand our offering of high capacity drives with our 6-disk, 6-terabyte drive shipping early next quarter. Investing and improving areal density and advanced storage technologies, we are shipping in-volume drives that utilize single magnetic recording or SMR and we will continue to deploy this technology advancement across our portfolio in the coming months. We also continue to invest in advancing our HAMR technology development and our hybrid and flash technology initiatives.", "We are deepening our customer engagements. One of the most positive emerging trends we are seeing is the interest from customers in requesting a deeper strategic engagement. Our opportunity to add more value for our customers and help them advance in areas such as big data analytics, hyperscale data management, and high-density content management are new opportunities for the disk drive industry. We are making investments in our go-to-market capabilities and product development and technology to engage more strategically with an expanding customer landscape, including OEMs, service providers, enterprise information technology functions, and consumers, and we are managing our capital investments. We are currently running our capital investments at the lower end of our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue, and it will be most likely -- and it will most likely be below the range for the full fiscal year. We are managing our production cautiously, and we are pleased with our performance against our metrics for manufacturing efficiency and operational excellence.", "Turning to our March quarter outlook, we expect to achieve at least $3.4 billion in revenues and to maintain non-GAAP margins approximately flat sequentially. Demand so far has been at a solid pace this quarter and industry inventory remains low. We are planning for operating expenses to be relatively flat sequentially, which would result in OpEx that is slightly higher than our targeted range of 12% to 14% of revenue for the third quarter, but it\u2019s still within the targeted range for the fiscal year. Over the last year and a half, industry Exabyte shipments have grown approximately 30%, while units have remained in a manageable range of between 130 million and 145 million units per quarter. Based on macroeconomic conditions, we expect these market dynamic characteristics to continue as customers remain cautious with their forecast and the project-based nature of cloud build-out represents challenges for them in terms of purchasing, timing \u2013 of purchase timing. Given these dynamics, we are running our business consistent with what we have done in the last several quarters by managing production slightly lower than forecast with the ability to flex up if additional demand warrants.", "On behalf of the entire management team, I would like to thank our employees for the performance this quarter and thank our customers, partners and suppliers for their support and commitment. Seagate is well-positioned in the storage technology markets we serve and we will continue to focus on executing to our financial model and delivering strong operating results for Seagate shareholders. We are now ready to take questions.", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And the first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Please proceed.", "", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel", "Yes, thanks for taking the question. So I guess I want to go back to two things really, the comment on the capacity shift, if I look at your capacity shift and also what Western Digital had reported, it looks like we saw about 12% year-over-year growth. So I am kind of curious of what underneath of that you are seeing be it on the enterprise side, I guess in the context of that given the decline sequentially that we saw in this last quarter?", "", "Steve Luczo", "Decline, I am not sure you are referencing any decline?", "", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel", "The enterprise shipments sequentially declined in the December quarter?", "", "Steve Luczo", "Okay.", "", "Rocky Pimentel", "This is Rocky Pimentel. I think it addresses actually which I think our competitor referred to, in the fourth quarter, I think the industry saw a bit of a softness in the cloud side of the enterprise drives, the capacity-centric enterprise drives, and that was really just due to the timing of the build-outs and planning of CapEx. It has continued to be a category that offers substantial long-term growth, but I think as others have pointed out, it will be a situation where it will be lumpy until processes improve at the cloud service providers to create a more smooth and linear approach to how they deploy their resources in the data center but I think that was just what you saw in the December quarter, but fundamentally the category is very strong and represents a tremendous growth opportunity as we go forward.", "", "Steve Luczo", "One of the things that we have noticed in terms of conversations with some of the customers, in case, sometimes it's through the OEMs and sometimes it's directly with the customers that are deploying. There has been a lot of effort to reduce the time between purchase and deployment of these assets that are going into the cloud infrastructure, and especially you know the folks that are in the multi-billion dollar range per year, so deployment being reduced from in excess of nine months to more best-in-class deployment rates that are probably in the 3- to 4-month range now are still working their way through the industry, and so I think that does create a situation where there is inventory that\u2019s basically being absorbed as people reduce that deployment time.", "", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Couple of questions, one I guess just for the March quarter, it sounds like you are expecting sales to be down about at least 3.5% - 4% or so. What are you expecting from a TAM basis, and then on the pricing as well because it sounds like enterprising can actually pick up for you guys a bit in the March quarter?", "", "Steve Luczo", "Again I think what we -- right now the outlook is for revenues to be at least $3.4 billion so it's in the least. So, I mean I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the percentage you want to apply to that and it kind of depends how good the quarter fills out, but it's off to a good start. In terms of TAM, that\u2019s why we try to make the comments that we did that the industry seems to have been operating in the 130 to 145 range, and we expect it will continue to operate in that range, and then I guess we said in the last few calls within that range, you know, arguing about whether or not it's an extra 1 million or 2 million units is not what drives the business models of the companies.", "", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "And inventory, let\u2019s say was up about 9% sequentially for you guys. Can you talk about what drove that in the quarter and how do you expect inventory to track in the March quarter going forward?", "", "Dave Mosley", "Yeah, a couple of things on inventory, so finished goods was relatively flat, although there is some of the \u2013 I\u2019m going to call it and hold it across the finish line especially in the cloud space, because their lead times are very long for those product lines. I think as people know, but finished goods was relatively flat. It was within raw materials and some of that was just staging for this early linearity that we have seen pretty healthy up against Chinese New Year, I think so, but that\u2019s the general trend there. I think we can get it back right down and check to where we have been running them the last four quarters, so I\u2019m not too worried about inventory.", "", "Steve Luczo", "Inventory in the system at the customers is very lean.", "", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.", "", "Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray", "Just following up again on those enterprise comments I guess your overall enterprise unit growth lagged to Western Digital this quarter, but your capacity [centered] (ph) drives certainly performed nicely despite not having a 6 terabyte drive in the market. So I guess were you surprised by that growth and do you think that will accelerate when you have a more competitive product in the market next quarter?", "", "Rocky Pimentel", "I think we definitely think there is lots of opportunities, still you know some throwing out in some of the cloud service providers demand, but certainly as we go out over the year strong growth and in terms of next generation capacity-centric drives, you know we\u2019re very positive because we will be, we\u2019re releasing a 6-disk, 6 terabyte drive early in the June quarter which we think will be very interesting to the customer demand.", "", "Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray", "Okay well maybe then on the performance-optimized side, I guess what\u2019s going on there? Is there any sort of competitive dynamics impacting your growth there?", "", "Rocky Pimentel", "No I think it's pretty much as it's been in the last number of quarters. Nothing unusual there.", "", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Joe Wittine with Longbow Research.", "", "Joe Wittine - Longbow Research", "Steve, I hope you could talk about within the PC category, the mix of hard disk drives within PCs, and really just kind of where they are trending, is the rate of share loss let\u2019s say easing? From my \u2013 from where I sit, I guess in the low end, we are starting to see some $300 type PCs with traditional HDDs and Windows, etcetera that seemingly makes sense for the category that has faced some headwinds from Chromebooks. And then in the high end, you guys have put out the press releases on the 5 millimeter getting into 2-in-1s in some tablets, so really just kind of curious on your commentary of the rates of share movement of HDDs within the PC category?", "", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, I mean, I think the client business was stronger than we would have expected in the December quarter and it was stronger throughout the quarter, and client can be desktop and/or notebook and it seems to be continuing into this quarter. So in that sense, I think there is a stabilization and I am glad you pointed out, most of the world is not at $1,000 price point, but I think that the one thing in your comment, to just point out too in terms of even the high end, about 6 million notebook units a year -- a quarter going out with SSDs, but the hybrid penetration on that has been actually growing as well. I think last quarter we did something like 1.7 or 1.5 million hybrid drives, so almost 20% of that market that was part of that time, SSD-only has already been penetrated by HDD, which I think not a lot of people aren\u2019t really focused on.", "And then as you pointed out, the traction of the 5-millimeter drives in no thinner, wider either direct tablets or even convertibles, we do think it\u2019s going to be a decent product category, especially for people that have high-density content that they want to have on those devices. So I do think that there is plenty of role for disk drives to play in this ecosystem. But again as you heard me say many times, whether or not it\u2019s about mobility or whether or not it\u2019s about SSDs, these are all complementary technologies that are just expanding the product portfolio of technology that people use, and it grows the overall need for storage across the ecosystem whether or not there is lighter devices that are helping it make people capture things in 4K like the Samsung Note 3 has 4K capture capability, and that eats up a lot of video in an hour or the network effect of being able to share that stuff. At the end of the day, it all ends up on a disk drive or usually three to four of them. So I don\u2019t want to make it seem like it is this net zero sum game, because I don\u2019t think it is at all, I think these are just technologies that are growing the ecosystem, but we do believe there is a role for high-density caching g, which is really what we do with the 5 millimeter drives, and we believe those opportunities are expanding, not decreasing.", "", "Joe Wittine - Longbow Research", "Great, that\u2019s really helpful. And then I am glad you brought up hybrids , that was my follow-up, just kind of curious where are we innings or however you want to talk about it on the high-end client environment taking a look at hybrid again adopting them, I would assume we are still in the early innings, kind of curious if you can talk through it?", "", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, early innings and actually we have often been surprised a few times over the last five or six quarters in terms of some of the traction that we see with hybrid on desktop and it\u2019s not just gamers. So no, I think the hybrid drive, it\u2019s probably not a great name for \u2013 probably some of the different names of hybrid, but I think high performance drives have their role and I think we are still in the mode of thinking the majority of our portfolio is going to be hybrid drives whether or not it\u2019s for aerial density or performance as we look out over the next three or four years.", "", "Joe Wittine - Longbow Research", "Thank you.", "", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jay Noland with Robert Baird. Please proceed.", "", "Jay Noland - Robert Baird", "Okay, great. I wanted to follow-up on the hyperscale drive opportunity, Steve, it sounds like it\u2019s in lumpy and a certain degree of limited visibility right now, I wonder if that\u2019s a function of just the product cycle at this point or maybe R&D that\u2019s involved, but your outlook, your thoughts on the full year calendar \u201814 as it relates to this part of the market?", "", "Steve Luczo", "Well, I mean, we are still encouraged by the outlook for the full year. And I think that this is a market, where small unit TAM variances can have big implications. I mean, the community, the investor community sometimes moves the driver to driver to drive, a million notebooks drives is just like a million nearline drives and that\u2019s not in lot of case in terms of lead time, ability to respond revenue or profits associated with and some of that is related to the technology and some of it's related to the test.", "We\u2019re still confident that 2014 is going to be a positive year in terms of deployment and cloud infrastructure what it means for the growth related to nearline drives. I do think that there is this added variable that the big users of this technology realize that they can\u2019t take nine or more months to deploy the assets because they get into this very difficult situation where they are making estimates about cloud infrastructure and not just storage, right, but everything that goes into the infrastructure. Cloud infrastructure is nine months out to satisfy a quality of service for users and that\u2019s just too long of a lag and so you get this thing of it's not really about in quarter demand it's about how well did you predict demand was going to be three quarters ago and it's costly. I mean that\u2019s all inventory that basically they laid out capital for, they haven't started generating revenue. So it's an intense focus clearly at the big buyers of this capital especially if you\u2019re spending 1, 2, 3, 5, $7 billion a year on it to get that stuff in the production much quicker and I think there has been success. As we look at our customer base and the big purchasers of those systems, again whether or not it's through OEM or direct I think that time of deployment is actually compressing which is allowing them I think to use some of that inventory that they bought a couple of quarters ago to bring it online quicker and we will see if that features holds out but we\u2019re still bullish about the Russell calendar year especially actually when you think about the 4K deployment and a lot of the technologies that were shown down at CES whether or not it was actual high density captured equipment or high density viewing [ph] equipment or some of the technologies being shown to assist big data analytics, biometrics and various other technologies.", "It all talks to an increasing need for people to keep the data. We\u2019re still bullish about it and that\u2019s why we\u2019re not pulling back on how we invest in that infrastructure because I think it's going to be the situation where again if the industry is faced with a 1 million or 2 million unit upside on nearline in the quarter the industry can\u2019t respond to that. If it's faced with a 1 million or 2 million unit upside on notebook we can probably respond to that in two weeks, that\u2019s how different those two markets are.", "So we\u2019re going to stay focused on making sure that we can deliver till it's upsides as they come.", "", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please proceed.", "", "Steven Fox - Cross Research", "Just a couple of questions from me, first of all, looking at this current calendar year in terms of Exabyte growth, how confident are you in achieving 30% type of growth rate for those shipments and any color on how the mix might be changing between on an average capacity and then secondly I know you\u2019re not talking about Xyratex specifically but can you just sort of outline your plans for say moving upscale into more of a storage systems offering overtime and how that fits with your strategy? Thanks.", "", "Steve Luczo", "Yeah we\u2019re not going to respond to this second question because that could be too closely related to the Xyratex\u2019s acquisition, I rather just not tread that line while we\u2019re under review. On the first one I think we\u2019re confident that the data growth rates are still in excess of 30%. Again I think it comes back to infrastructure that\u2019s being installed and deployed relative to original expectation. So we will have to keep an eye on it. The industry does a great job obviously of keeping track of the Exabytes it ships but that\u2019s not quite the same as the Exabytes that have been put in production by the various cloud companies and we\u2019re trying to get a better handle on that directly with some of the relationships we have been through our OEMs but we still believe the growth rates are in excess of 30% a year. I would expect that the average capacity per drive crosses over terabyte sometime this year and we always think about the cloud but again one of the biggest drivers of the average capacity per drive calculations, what\u2019s going on in the consumer front? You know where people are taking 2 and 3 and 4 terabyte drives into their homes pretty rapidly and we see that continuing as well. So we are still a lot confident that we have good growth in average capacity per drive and that we have petabyte growth rates in excess of aerial density growth rates, which puts pressure on us from an ability to deliver the petabytes required.", "", "Steven Fox - Cross Research", "Great. And then just real quick, in terms of the PC industry serve this bottoming that we have all been talking, is there from your PC any differences in terms of client versus enterprise we should pay attention to over the next couple of quarters? Thanks a lot.", "", "Steve Luczo", "I mean, yes, it\u2019s been bottoming for a while, I am not sure what a bottom is when it\u2019s been bottoming for five or six quarters, but it does feel overall, I would say, it feels better, demand feels better. And maybe on a relative basis, it feels better in client than it has, but I\u2019d say across the board, business feels a little better. The caveat I would put on it is in the last five years, its felt better three to four times and it seems to have always felt better right about now. And then right about May or June, it feels not as better. So I am hopeful because it hasn\u2019t felt like this in a while I guess. I don\u2019t know that last year it felt better at this time. So I think in that sense, I am encouraged or we are encouraged, but we are cautious that we can always flex to the upside. Again, the industry in this range of whether or not it\u2019s 132 or 144 that\u2019s easy for the company, the industry to respond to. So \u2013 and I don\u2019t think we are going to break out from that one way or the other this quarter or probably next. So we are pretty cautious things from how we are going to plan our production. That being said, it probably feels better than it has in the last couple of years. And maybe the relative strength is in the client that might reflect a better macroeconomic condition for regular people instead of just big governments and big companies that could borrow at zero percent and buy the stuff they need to keep the companies and governments running.", "", "Steven Fox - Cross Research", "Great, thank you very much.", "", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, thanks. I just wanted to dig into the expenses this quarter a little bit higher than I think at least I was expecting, I know you have commented Steve that they are going to be up a little bit, they are going to be flat next quarter, can you give us a little detail on why they were up and do you expect them to come back down into your targeted range of 12% to 14% of revenue in the next couple of quarters? Thanks.", "", "Steve Luczo", "I will let Pat handle that.", "", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "Yes. So, sure, yes, I do expect to come back down as you see in the financials, we have talked about last quarter doing a little reshaping, so we certainly went off to reshape the P&L where we took minor restructuring charge, but we continue to shape that to stick in the 12% to 14%, but we do want to continue to make some investments as Steve and Rocky commented on getting deeper relationship with the customers, that\u2019s just not in the go-to-market, but that\u2019s also in a technology engagements, whether it\u2019s IP, whether it\u2019s working with them or whether it\u2019s product offering, that\u2019s all in front of us. So I think there is good opportunity. So we are going to keep those investments. The other small piece about that is that we have a deferred comp trust that you had some about $5 million to $6 million more in OpEx this quarter than you normally would have that offsets an OIE, so that\u2019s \u2013 that will disappear, so that will be normalized in the future. So that was a little harder, but that wasn\u2019t really P&L harder, that was just a category. So what we do, we are committed to that 12% to 14% and we see some of these investing\u2019s for a good business model or revenue stream in the future, that\u2019s why we are going to keep those investments.", "", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thank you. And then just I just want to need a little more detail on your SSD strategy, I know we talked about hybrids, but maybe if you give us some detail on what you are seeing with your SSDs and how that\u2019s going? Thanks.", "", "Rocky Pimentel", "Sure. This is Rocky Pimentel. So we continue to make great progress on our organic SSD initiatives. We also have a very robust portfolio of inorganic initiatives on the SSD side. We look at our solid state storage business as a portfolio. So it\u2019s the pure SSDs plus the success in the hybrid. And on the hybrid side, we have been succeeding in not just the client level, but also at the low end of the enterprise level on hybrid adoption. So what we are looking at is a complete portfolio, but believe me we are making serious investments in our organic efforts on the pure SSD side. We continue to make progress, did design wins and some of our inorganic portfolio opportunities are really looking interesting and as they mature we plan to share a little bit more detail about them but at this point I think we feel a need for some confidentiality due to competitive concerns and so we will keep those things under tap until a future day.", "", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.", "", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital", "I was wondering if you could give us your view on cash priorities for calendar \u201914 and maybe talk a little bit about what we should expect for allocation between dividend and buybacks in", "\u201914? And then maybe just lastly comment on sort of how you think about share repurchase, does it meet through the year? Thanks a lot.", "", "Steve Luczo", "So obviously our biggest message is returning the best fashion of capital to shareholders and given as we have talked about we are pretty much on target for the 7% this year so that\u2019s important. Now giving guidance for next year obviously the dividend in a buyback program will be active. We do have an active buyback program, authority to do so and it will remain active. Now the split and how we\u2019re going to manage that, we will probably look over the course the remaining part of this fiscal year for June and will get more clarity but I think what your reference is we had it go 250 obviously that was put in place when stock price was well different from it's today but we\u2019re still committed to the stock buyback program and the dividend and both of them will be vehicles as Steve also alluded we will continue to look at opportunities whether it's an IP or other assets that we will look at but that\u2019s all we will probably be needed on it and we will stay committed to the 70% but this share will probably come with greater clarity in due time on how we want to breakout the dividend and the buyback.", "", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital", "I guess and just second one for me. How should we think about free cash flow generation or how you\u2019re thinking about in \u201914 you know cash conversions like all you know think you can do to grow free cash flow?", "", "Steve Luczo", "I think right now our cash conversion side we\u2019re pretty comfortable, could move it for a couple of more days we could but as Dave said we\u2019re managing the inventory on just the tactical but a strategic where we want to setup some things. I think we have a good understanding of the cash flow on the margin it might change a couple of days but for the cash flow I don\u2019t think you should plan up difference than you\u2019ve seen recently. As Dave talked about, we\u2019re living in the world sort of a set range and we\u2019re committed to staying in a target margin range and for the products that continue to generate the cash flow you\u2019ve seen over the last several quarters.", "", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed.", "", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities", "First question on the Kinetic solution maybe can you talk about just sampling or is it solution in the produce type stage and when they expect the revenue recognition? And also since the solution competes with often kind of storage OEMs. Do you think it's going to impact your relationship with the storage OEMs?", "", "Dave Mosley", "I will say couple of things firstly we\u2019re shipping this is the technology development platform right now so we\u2019re shipping it largely to a developers community. There is a lot of interest amongst customer base but we ship 6000 CTUs [ph] now so that people can get developing on these platforms that is not usually one drive at a time since it's a network drive. Their (indiscernible) a number of these things together but there is a lot of software host level development that has to happen in order to enable solution. So the cycle if you will the developmental cycle has been very long to that host side. A lot of people have a lot of interest because they see the opportunity to save money on the host side. Does it challenge our customers? Architecturally it challenges but I think at the end of the day some of those architectures need to be challenged for lower, lower cost. The host will enable the architectures and also the drive. Architecture is still, you know I think the customer ultimately once the, since the whole development platform matures then those customers will be able to take advantage of it and deploy it as they seek it.", "", "Rocky Pimentel", "This is Rocky Pimentel just to add on to Dave\u2019s comments, with our existing cloud service provider customers and our OEMs customers are clearly very interested and have cost [ph], as Dave mentioned I think also an emerging set of customers in the telecom space and the content delivery network space and also coming to the forefront team, this is a big opportunity for their future infrastructures as well. So it\u2019s a pretty exciting space for us to get new customer.", "", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, a lot of work left to do I think, but it\u2019s going to be quite some time before we monetize it.", "", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities", "Then as a follow-up, I mean, on the Analyst Day, you talked about organic revenue growth target 3% to 4%, it depends it\u2019s kind of in the units which you talked about 130 to 140ish moving units, do you think it is still possible to realize that revenue growth?", "", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "This is Pat. Over time, absolutely, because we fundamentally believe in the data storage trends out there that Steve talked about that the deployment maybe somewhat soft one quarter, stronger the next, but over a period of time, it will show up. And as folks deploy this capital and start utilizing and filling these up, that\u2019s going to drive more growth. And so as it sits today, we are probably living in this range and we will continue to live in this range, but longer term, we do think it breaks out eventually clearly in the storage, how much storage we are shipping, but that eventually the industry is going to have to make some investments in capacity that we have made for the last several years.", "", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities", "Thank you. That\u2019s all from me.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham. Please proceed.", "", "Rich Kugele - Needham", "Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions from me. In terms of share count Pat for the fiscal third quarter what should we be assuming? And then on the OpEx side, is the guidance flat in absolute dollars relative to the second quarter or should we be backing out the incentive comp?", "", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "So you could back out there incentive comp, Rich and outside that would be relatively flat. And then on the diluted shares for next quarter that is 2.41 [ph].", "", "Rich Kugele - Needham", "Okay. And then lastly just Steve conceptually as you look at your exabyte shipments and the growth of that relative to your aerial density improvements within Seagate, would you expect that you would be able to outpace the industry\u2019s ability to ship exabytes with drives like the 6 terabyte, is that what the extra OpEx is going through, any thoughts on over the next four quarters how Seagate trends relative to aerial density growth on the exabyte side?", "", "Steve Luczo", "No, I don\u2019t think. I think the industry is competitive across the board in terms of how it invest in the aerial density, if you will have not just for me to say, yes, we are better than those guys. I think the industry is working as hard as they can to drive aerial density in this 20% range, which is not enough to keep up with the demand side. We hope to do it better than our competitors whether or not, that shows up in aerial density or quality or costs or all three or responsiveness which is where we tend to be quite good as responsiveness in the quarter. I think the OpEx investments are in some of these areas, other areas that we pointed out which related to the mobile and cloud and open source side, you saw some of what we have been on the mobile side both within our own technology as well some of the announcements made at CES. So I think those opportunities are little different.", "I think the storage industry is in this beneficial phase right now where the opportunities in front of the providers of storage devices are pretty significant and they are pretty broad. And I think each company will probably pursue them a little bit differently as a result. So as a result it may not be as easy to say well, WD Hitachi looks like this and Seagate looks like that and Toshiba looks like that, but I think each of these companies is going to take advantage of their own skills and leverage those into an opportunity set that\u2019s pretty broad. And so for us, we are investing in some OpEx areas that laid again, we have been transparent about but they relate to mobile, cloud and open source, but we haven\u2019t been so transparent, because we view it as highly competitive in terms of how we are going about taking advantage of the long-term trends. But to your base question, we believe it\u2019s absolutely fundamental that we remain competitive and hopefully the leader in our core technology of HDD, hybrid and SSDs. So, yes, we have a lot of investment going in that area and then we have others investments surrounding those areas that as we are successful there, will allow us to broaden our value proposition to a widening customer base.", "", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Scott Schmidt with Morgan Stanley.", "", "Scott Schmidt - Morgan Stanley", "Aside from the test equipment with Xyratex, you see other areas of opportunity to further vertically integrate or make further supply chain improvements and maybe as a follow-up on that I think a while back if we go post the flood there was a certain amount of com componency [ph] or sourcing externally. Is there an update on that? Anything else that can drive further margin improvement?", "", "Steve Luczo", "I think what we focus on more is continuing of supply and obviously if the market went up a lot then we have to ask ourselves this questions right now the model is not going to change relative to how much we outsource, it will be more discussions about continuity supply.", "", "Dave Mosley", "I think the lessons of the flood and the tsunami, earthquake before that really have to do with the systems that we put in place with our suppliers and with our customers and those have been big investments that we will continue to make. I mean we do believe that we have driven a fair amount of operational efficiency as a result of some of those programs and we think there is more to come. So accelerating the flow of the technology from our supplier base to our factories to our customers, saves everyone a lot of money and I think Seagate has made real progress but it's also, it's taken big investments in people, in technology and systems and even investments in our suppliers and in our customers from an engineering perspective and IT perspective and time spent So, I think that will continue.", "", "Scott Schmidt - Morgan Stanley", "Got it and just if I can follow-up on the branded business. Can you just talk about whether the strength came from more the retail side of things or if you\u2019re seeing some strength in the SMB NAS Market and what the kind of margin profile of that is or implication of that is?", "", "Rocky Pimentel", "This is Rocky Pimentel again, definitely strengthen in the NAS side of the business in retail or in branded. I would say we did well in the December quarter despite the fact we felt we could have had a stronger portfolio. We were late in one of our critical ramps in the branded business. It's a high capacity product and which could have brought better margins to the portfolio for branded and as we enter this quarter that weakness has been remediated and so I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how we can compete in the marketplace at the high end which is a margin rich sector of the branded retail business.", "", "Steve Luczo", "Can we take one more question?", "", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights Research.", "", "Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research", "I want a follow on branded here and focusing on the consumer side than the NAS side. Are you seeing an appetite for consumers upgrading to what is effectively a personal cloud offering rather than simple backup drive? And I might have a follow-up question based on that answer.", "", "Rocky Pimentel", "No question, consumers are very interested in NAS solutions at the home level. I mean this is an opportunity for growth in the future which we\u2019re pretty excited about you will see more and more of our product announcements around that. We talk about release of our most recent wireless drive at CES, under the LaCie brand which is really a great production. So no question if that\u2019s a category that will continue to grow in the branded retail space.", "", "Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research", "So what do you feel can be the incremental TAM opportunity as consumers take that wireless product effectively in personal cloud?", "", "Steve Luczo", "We don\u2019t put specific numbers on it. It's still an emerging segment of the branded retail TAM I mean direct attached storage is still it's a bigger segment of that TAM but we still, we see definitely shifts more towards NAS capable retail solutions and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to declare million to unit next quarter but this quarter but it's a growing demand by the consumer that we will try to service to the best of our ability.", "", "Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research", "It does appear you know as people expand the eco-system with tablets and use those devices more and more that the attach rate for tablets is much higher than it was for desktop or high-capacity notebooks. There is some market data that shows those attach rates are in the 50% range versus rates I think more in the 10% to 15% range for the desktop side. Notebook side maybe was 15% to 20%. So we do see a big shift in attach rates there. And then what becomes a NAS versus a DAS is an interesting question when you have a bunch of wireless devices. So, yes, we think there is opportunity there, but again for us I think it\u2019s just part of the expanding ecosystem and these mobile devices obviously need storage, because there is not a lot you can do even if you are rich person, you can buy a 64-gig tablet, you can gobble that up pretty quickly and you have to store all that great high-def video somewhere. So it\u2019s our job to make sure that the technology we deliver is easy to use. I think that\u2019s where the industry probably hasn\u2019t done well. And competitively where you probably see both of the major players, WD and Seagate focusing a lot of energy, Seagate through both LaCie and our brand, WD through both of their brands, but I think clearly the ease of use issues around managing storage for your connected devices is a big opportunity for all of us and to the extent that we are successful it should drive significant amount of revenues and profits, if not tens of millions of units.", "", "Steve Luczo", "Thank you.

Please go ahead, Steve.", "Steve Luczo - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Kate. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Before I begin our quarterly overview, I\u2019d like to welcome Jamie Lerner who has recently joined Seagate and is our President of Cloud Systems and Solutions. Jamie is leading the integration of the storage systems business that we have recently acquired with Xyratex in addition to other cloud initiatives within Seagate. We expect Jamie to provide more details about these initiatives on next quarter\u2019s call.", "Now, I will review the key figures from our fiscal third quarter. Seagate demonstrated solid execution this quarter achieving revenues of $3.4 billion, net income of $395 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.17. On a non-GAAP basis, we recorded gross margins of 28.5%, net income of $453 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.34. During the March quarter, we shipped 50.8 exabytes of storage and average 920 gigabytes per drive across our portfolio. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 14.7% and operating expenses were $470 million slightly better than our plan due to lower variable compensation and cost containment efforts. Inventory turns, days sales outstanding were within our targeted ranges.", "We continue to manage our capital investments closely and our production cautiously and we are pleased with our performance against our metrics for manufacturing efficiency and operational excellence. For fiscal year \u201814, our capital investments are running below our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue and it will most likely be below the range for the full fiscal year.", "Operating cash flow for the quarter was $443 million and free cash flow was $319 million. There were various reasons operating cash flow was impacted this quarter, some of which were non-recurring in nature and some front-end linearity. We expect to be back to our normal level of operating cash flow in the June quarter and we anticipate achieving operating cash flow of at least $2.7 billion for the fiscal year. Our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash and investments.", "We continue our focus on returning capital to shareholders. And during the March quarter, we returned $324 million, including $184 million to redeem 3.5 million shares and $140 million for a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share. We are planning for a similar level of cash return in the June quarter, which will keep us on track to exceed our shareholder capital allocation goals for the fiscal year. We are currently in the early stages of planning for fiscal year \u201815 and we will update our capital allocation plans on the July call.", "We closed our acquisition of Xyratex on March 31 slightly earlier than planned. The addition of Xyratex will further ensure uninterrupted access to important capital equipment for our integrated supply chain and expand Seagate\u2019s storage solutions portfolio with their enterprise data storage systems business and high-performance computing business. We are in the initial stages of integration planning and we expect the acquisition to be slightly EPS accretive in fiscal year \u201815.", "We continue to believe that this decade will be transformational in the amounts of data created as well as where and how data will be stored. The economics of storage infrastructures are changing as utilization of public and private hyperscale storage and open-source solutions are working to reduce the total cost of ownership of storage, while increasing the speed and efficiency with which customers can leverage massive computing and storage power. Growth in mobile, personal devices, video surveillance and big data analytics are all trends that we believe will continue creating significant demand for next generation storage systems and solutions.", "Through our technology investments, we are aligning our storage product portfolio with these emerging trends, which we have categorized as mobility, cloud and open-source computing. We believe the significant investments we are making at the drive device level can bring even higher capacities, faster access time, increased reliability and improved overall efficiency to storage systems. Examples of these investments are reflected in the new products we introduced this quarter, including our 6 terabyte nearline enterprise drive, which is our highest capacity, self-encrypting product for server and storage systems and the fastest nearline drive on the market. We believe we will see a strong ramp for this product in the second half of the calendar year, as enterprise cloud customers continue to push for higher density drive technology.", "Our seventh-generation surveillance drive, which can store over 500 hours of high-definition video, is specifically designed for the high right workloads of surveillance applications. It is estimated that surveillance cameras worldwide are producing over 400 petabytes of data each day. And we believe this market will continue to be a high growth opportunity for Seagate.", "In addition, market interest for Seagate\u2019s object-based Kinetic Open Storage platform continues to grow across many industry verticals. We believe the Kinetic platform will be a fundamental underpinning for next generation cloud architecture and we continue to actively cultivate an ecosystem of system integrators and software developers. We plan to have further technology development and customer announcements later this year.", "Turning to our outlook, the market environment in the tech sector remains dynamic with visibility somewhat limited. We therefore continue to plan conservatively for the near-term, while providing flexibility to meet importer upsides and make investments for the longer term opportunities we have discussed. For the June quarter, we are planning for revenues of at least $3.3 billion and operating expenses of $505 million, including the acquisition of Xyratex. As we just closed this acquisition, we are not modeling synergies assumptions at this time. Non-GAAP margins of approximately 28%, down slightly from the March quarter reflecting seasonality, market mix and with relatively stable pricing and maintaining overall market share of approximately 40% to 42%.", "Our June outlook assumes unit demand to be down a few points with negotiated pricing having been relatively benign. The outlook also assumes Exabyte growth will be modest due to seasonality in the client and branded markets as well as due to a few specific temporal factors in the enterprise and nearline market this quarter. These factors include a few significant enterprise customers are absorbing in-house drive inventory and reducing disk drive purchases in the June quarter as they prepare for their new product introductions planned for the second half of the calendar year. And a number of cloud service providers have accelerated their time to deployment and have improved overall utilization and existing cloud infrastructures during the last three to four quarters, thereby absorbing their in-house drive inventory over the last two to three quarters. Based on current customer sentiment, we are planning for a stronger market demand in the second half of the calendar year as these entities deploy new build outs.", "As we look ahead at the second half of the calendar year, we are anticipating the stronger seasonal demand in the client and branded markets that we have seen historically and for the temporal issues in the enterprise and nearline market to be resolved. Given these factors, we would expect market demand at the higher end of the range we have seen over the last several quarters with continued benign price erosion.", "On behalf of the entire management team, I would like to thank our employees for their performance this quarter and thank our customers, partners, suppliers for their support and commitment as well as our shareholders.", "At this time, we would like to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.

Just a couple of questions, I guess first just a follow-up, Steve on your last comment there on pricing, so your indications from conversations with the OEMs that you think that the second half if their demand profile plays out that you can maintain this or even a lower level of price erosion quarterly?", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, I mean if we break it down by market, Rich I think on the client side both notebook and desktop, those markets have stabilized I would say over the last year, I mean I think we have been pretty consistent in saying we thought it was kind of flattish market year-over-year. And it seems to continue to be so and I think for the rest of the year we are probably thinking the same, which would imply maybe low-single digit growth for the second half of this year relative to the first half, but flattish year-over-year. That pricing has been pretty stable overall. There has been shifts by the OEMs in terms of capacity points that they have been purchasing.", "Nearline, I think has been aggressive in the last couple, three quarters and I just don\u2019t see those price erosions sustaining themselves, given the capacity points that we have to deliver over the next year, going from 6 to 8 to 10 terabytes, that\u2019s a lot of technical investment as you know, it\u2019s also a lot of test investment. And therefore I think that the margin profile on those drives is about where they can be in order to sustain the investment that we have to make going forward. So I would say that I would see a reduction in that price erosion to something close to what we are seeing on the client side.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay. And then just lastly I don\u2019t know if Jamie wants to handle this or Pat, but how should we be modeling the progression to neutral to slight accretion from Xyratex, how long do you think it will take to get to a more efficient operating model for that business?", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "This is Pat. Jamie could add color to it Rich, but obviously we haven\u2019t started the synergies. Jamie and his team and Dave and his team are working on the capital equipment group have already started that. I would imagine you would see incremental improvements quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, we want to drive the top line growth as well and not just the OpEx, but I would expect you see OpEx reshaping over the next two quarters and start seeing signs of that in the P&L as Jamie reshaped the top line that will probably take a little longer.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "And will the Evolve business be rolled up into that entity?", "Steve Luczo", "Well, Jamie has responsibility for Evolve as well and we are going to through the work right now to figure out how they are going to integrate our Evolve business, Xyratex, our data center operations business and some of the business \u2013 some of the new efforts that we had focused on devices aimed towards hyper scale inside the both the product management and the design center, so all of that will be under Jamie.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay, excellent. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Please proceed.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel", "Thanks for taking the questions. So the first question just to build on Rich\u2019s question on the Xyratex transaction. We actually build our models I have got a lot of questions around how we think about the gross margin of bringing Xyratex into the fold, relative to what Xyratex were to look like on a standalone basis to gross margin on that systems business. So maybe you can help us understand at least albeit early how we should think about that gross margin trajectory from that revenue stream and are you still targeting $500 million to $600 million in revenue for the first fiscal year of combined, that being in the model?", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "This is Pat. I think the $500 million to $600 million is where what we are targeting whether we can achieve that obviously we are engaging with customers has been pretty positive. So that would be the model we are aiming to, but even with that with the gross margins probably 10 to 20 basis points drag on overall HDD, but we would hope to even neutralize that as a year, but that\u2019s what we are modeling now.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel", "Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, can you talk a little bit about how you guys are thinking about capacity shipment trends in the overall hard disk drive industry, I think obviously at 8% year-over-year growth that\u2019s a little bit off the pace that we saw outlined at the analyst event back in 2013 I think 26%. So maybe you can help us understand are we changing at all from that growth trajectory in terms of capacity shift are you still comfortable that that\u2019s a progression we are working towards?", "Steve Luczo", "I think we are still working towards that projection. I don\u2019t, it\u2019s an interesting discussion between capacity shipped versus capacity deployed. And I think \u2013 I usually typically think of it in terms of capacity deployed, i.e. end user demand of petabytes versus ability to deliver aerial density. And I do think that there has been a lot of inventory absorbed over the last six months as again on the cloud side as utilization rates have bumped and deployment times have been blocked down. And you know at least of one major customer that also kind of redeployed a bunch of drives into cold store or warm store. All those customers have kind of said that that one-time event or series of one-time events is kind of over and they were looking at second half demand that more reflects the end user growth in data. And their end user growth in data is actually, probably accelerated not decelerated over the last six months. So that\u2019s why I am still fundamentally encouraged by the overall delta, which is what\u2019s petabyte growth at the demand level versus aerial density growth and I still believe it\u2019s running two laps at least.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel", "Okay, thank you.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, thanks.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, I think I just wanted to ask a quick question about your expectations for Xyratex in terms of how much revenue they add next quarter, I guess I would have thought the revenue would have ticked up some based on the benefit of having Xyratex in the business?", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, about $100 million, but it\u2019s really hard to say right now, because again you may have a big test business, which we now own and we have to kind of \u2013 we don\u2019t really know what the order profile of that business is going to look like yet. I mean, obviously their customers are still deciding which orders to place when and then of course we have to be able to fulfill those and that timing isn\u2019t completely understood yet either. So I think right now we are thinking about $100 million. I think you also have to recognize that the systems business was declining fairly rapidly over the last year. And the good news is, is that the traction with our OEMs has been quite positive in terms of their perspective on what they might do with us now that it\u2019s owned by Seagate, but of course, the lag time on that is fairly long as well. It\u2019s not like they are making order and we shipped it this quarter.", "So, I think we have to recognize that those revenues were falling and we are kind offsetting the fall of that revenue as quickly as we can. So, all in all, I think about $100 million, which kind of speaks to a seasonal decline in the June revenue numbers for the HDD business. And then we will just see what happens with the test business, whether or not the Xyratex business picks up a little bit. Good news on the Xyratex business is they do a lot of the integration for some of the new storage architectures as well and we have seen a lot of encouraging signs from those customers buy Seagate\u2019s ownership as well. So, I think we just have to get a little more time under our belt to be able to be more articulate about what that revenue profile looks like and we hope to do that in the call for the June quarter.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you, Steve. And then I just wanted to follow up with a question about your expectations for PCs, you were generally pretty positive in your comments earlier about the PC market, but I think some people are concerned that maybe the XP refresh impact is starting to wane, so wanted to get your updated thoughts? Thanks.", "Steve Luczo", "In general, I think versus last quarter where it felt like business was getting some traction. And I was a little bit cautious about \u2013 but we are going to be really disappointed in April or May like we were kind of the last two cycles that\u2019s happened. I actually have to say that I am more encouraged in terms of what I think is going on, on a global basis in terms of economic activity and what that means for technology spending in general. So, I mean, I think that we are \u2013 we have stabilized the decline and I think we are going to see some modest growth across \u2013 really across all segments here going forward. June quarter is obviously, mostly always seasonally down except for when we have been recovering from floods or huge cutbacks by the industry. So, where we are at in June? I actually feel okay about and the back half of the year is we are starting to get some good indications from customers about stronger shipment scenarios.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Great, thank you.", "Steve Luczo", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please proceed.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Two questions from me. First of all, I don\u2019t know if there is any more detail in terms of what the initial steps are that you guys had tackled in terms of integrating Xyratex, it will be great to get some more color on that. And then secondly, Steve, in terms of some of the temporal issues you mentioned, you did mention that higher utilization of HDDs. I guess is that something that we should think of as an ongoing impact of some new technologies, have been sort of ramped into some service provider capital models?", "Steve Luczo", "Not as I have heard the conversation, which has been directly with two of the largest CSPs that they are more. Again, I think people can understand that for the big CSPs today that are buying directly mostly from the drive industry, they are all employing very different architectures. I am not sure if we grasp this yet that those architectures are in fact their proprietary competitive advantages for the application set that they are serving. So, the Google implementation is very different than Microsoft\u2019s is very different than Amazon\u2019s and different than AWS\u2019 versus the rest of Amazon versus eBay. And what\u2019s happening is that as they are pursuing different architectures to achieve those application sets, they have breakthroughs every once in a while whether or not they are on how quickly they can get a server up and running and active with storage to how they get utilization rates and then in a couple of cases over the last couple of quarters, a couple of those really being providers have either dramatically pulled in time to deployment in one case, because I think they were probably not competitive and/or kind of step function improvements and utilization.", "The conversations are pretty much that I have had it pretty much some of those technical leads have pretty much concluded that that\u2019s it for a while. And then you know in another year or two maybe there is another step function change. I just think that\u2019s the nature of the business with those big CSPs that are calling multiple billions of dollars into their infrastructures. So, I don\u2019t think it was like some magic of some new technology. And by the way I wouldn\u2019t say it was disk drive related, I think it\u2019s overall system related that those are utilization rates and deployment rates that have improved, not just targeted towards disk drives. I think it\u2019s across the board.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research", "Great, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just any other color on what are the first steps in terms of or you got to get a handle on with Xyratex?", "Steve Luczo", "I will let Jamie talk to it, because he has been into it the most.", "Jamie Lerner", "Hey, Steven, this is Jamie. I mean, I think we are thinking about the acquisition of Xyratex in terms of putting together both a technical architecture and a business architecture. On the technical architecture side, we are looking at ways and drilling in with our customers in the ways that we can combine the storage devices that we have into the enclosures and appliances that Xyratex builds. And working with our customers say, are there architectures that we can come up with that allow us to achieve synergies or technical breakthroughs by combining those technologies, essentially Seagate on Seagate methods. On the business architecture, we are looking at can we provide greater operations, manufacturing and logistics synergies between the disk business and the enclosure business to pull cost out of the model as well. So, we are working to do both those and next quarter we should be able to come back with a strategy.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research", "Great, that\u2019s all. Very helpful. Good luck going forward with that.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. Two questions for me. One on the enterprise side, Steve you talked about a couple of the temporal issues that are impacting the enterprise business. It sounds like enterprise units both mission-critical capacity will be down sequentially in June. I am curious are we seeing incremental conversations about SSDs becoming a more of a replacement option on the enterprise side and if that\u2019s the any parts, especially for nearline drives?", "Steve Luczo", "No. Again, I mean, I just don\u2019t \u2013 the architectures aren\u2019t really about replacing HDDs. I mean, we have kind of been over this a whole bunch of calls. SSD deployment is about the acceleration and fast data processing. HDD is about storing data and they complement one another. So, it\u2019s not that architectural shift. What\u2019s happening is we have two big customers who are both about to release new products on the storage side, which are mostly HDD-based storage products for the second half of the year. And when they do that, they typically bleed down all the inventory they have inside of their company in various labs. And I mean, people don\u2019t realize the scale of what some of these customers do in terms of the drives that they hold for a number of years as they test these systems. And when they get to the end of a product cycle, they basically are able to flush through all that technology as they prepare for the next generation of technology. So, it\u2019s related to that.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Fair enough. And then I guess the $505 million of OpEx that was mentioned for June, how much of that incremental $35 million is Xyratex centric versus some of the organic Seagate dynamics, can you kind of break that out? That would be helpful.", "Steve Luczo", "The vast majority of that, you could probably model in $40 million for Xyratex, $35 million to $40 million, almost all of it. You might have little puts and takes, but you just model all of it.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Fair enough. Thanks a lot.", "Steve Luczo", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Yes, thanks. How did the shorter cloud deployment times impact you order visibility? In other words, when will you have certainty around whether those orders come through, is it a few weeks ahead of time or is it months?", "Steve Luczo", "Well, kind of I\u2019d just associate to two things. It\u2019s not so much about visibility on orders, it\u2019s about how much inventory or how much are they guessing about what they need. So, I think, how I view it Katy is that we have way better alignment between supply and demand, because with the longer deployment periods, what was happening is that the customers were having to predict out in the future how much capacity they would need, server capacity, storage capacity, and they would buy all that and then sometimes they were right and sometimes they were wrong. And of course, being wrong is probably was really probably a really bad thing, because when they couldn\u2019t bring servers online. So, with the ability to deploy quicker just means that the forecast that we get are more accurate.", "In terms of our ability to respond to that, that\u2019s a completely different dynamic which is actually becoming more challenging I think for the customers. And one of the reasons why we think some of these pricing issues are going to kind of have to stabilize is that, as you get to the 6 and the 8 and the 10 terabyte drives, the lead time on those drives is going to be pretty significant whether or not that\u2019s wafer-related or whether or not that\u2019s test related. And so you are not going to kind of be able to call up and say, by the way I need an extra 500,000 eight TBs I forgot to order, because they are just not going to be there and the industry can\u2019t respond that quickly. So I think we are going to get better linkage on supply and demand and I think we are probably going to get more accurate forecast because people are going to realize that the lead times on these drives are longer, much longer than they are used to.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, thanks. Any update on expected timing or results of MOFCOM deciding whether the industry can begin taking out costs?", "Steve Luczo", "I think Ken can talk to that.", "Ken Massaroni", "Yes, we continue to have a positive dialogue with MOFCOM regarding market dynamics that gave rise to the original conditions that were attached to the approval of our Samsung transaction. We are going to continue to have those discussions with MOFCOM and we continue to expect that in due course, the conditions will be released. But unfortunately, I can\u2019t tell you it will be this day or that day. It continues to be something that they are paying close attention to and we will continue to cooperate with them on.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Please proceed.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital", "Hey, thanks guys for taking the question. Few if I could, the first maybe for Pat, the second for Steve. Pat I believe last quarter you guys were talking about HDD related OpEx starting to soften at least as a percentage of revenue, in the June quarter you are beginning to drive some leverage and having some of that going forward, I was just wondering if you could give us some context around what to expect now?", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "I think you saw it manifest in this quarter where we basically went from the 4.90 plus down to the 4.69. So we started shaping that at the end of activities in December, which showed up in this quarter. We expect those to stay at the same level from an HDD level and all the increases from Q3 to Q4 are really driven by the integration or just the addition of Xyratex OpEx. As we look to integrate the organization, Xyratex we expected some synergies there. But many of the modes that we are looking to reshape right now and on this reshaping deployed obviously with Jamie\u2019s initiatives to drive cloud we will make the appropriate level of investments there with the SSD appropriate level there. So probably we are going to stay at the high end of that 12 to 14 for a period of time with the expectation to drive revenue growth with those investments. But for the short period of time in that high end of HDD and then we have to figure out how to integrate Xyratex. As Steve said Evolve and look at the whole holistic picture and say how do we reallocate that, but it\u2019s going to be at the high end of the range. And we will \u2013 as Steve talked about the capital allocation we will talk further about the OpEx model for \u201915 as we finalize our plans going into next year.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital", "Yes, thanks Pat. That\u2019s really helpful. Steve can you just \u2013 just a follow-up for you on your TAM comments with regards to the second half, should we expect I guess you said sort of a high end what current quarters have been, should we expect September and December to be sort of towards the high end of what sort of recent quarters have been which should be more in the 1.42 range, are you saying September quarter will be sort of at the high end of what recent September quarters have been and December quarter at the high end of what recent December quarters have been, just a clarification there? Thanks.", "Steve Luczo", "Sorry I was trying to be confusing. I think we think that September and December are probably in the 1.40 to 1.45 range.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital", "Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.", "Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Thanks for taking the question. I understand the weakness in the enterprise, but can you discuss the initial uptake of your new 6 terabyte drive by the cloud providers? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.", "Rocky Pimentel", "Hi, this is Rocky Pimentel. So the 6 terabyte drive is in late evaluation with the customers and we see clearly very positive response from all the cloud customers there. They are definitely interested in higher capacity, higher density per drive products and we have done some really good engineering work on that product. We think it\u2019s a real value leader in performance and design margins, so we are pretty optimistic about how it\u2019s going to play in the marketplace when we start production shipments probably towards the back half of this quarter, but certainly building strongly as we go into the second half of this current calendar year.", "Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, got it. And then I know you will update your capital allocation next call, but can you tell us how much cash you need on hand to run the day-to-day operations and what\u2019s your appetite for taking on more debt to maintain the current level of repurchases if needed?", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "We think we have the appropriate level of leverage, we certainly could take on more leverage, but we look at that leverage more as monetizing it through investments in business. So I think returning the level of capital we did has been appropriate for where we have been in the investment stage of the company, so we are still committed to our dividend and growing the dividend. And we will continue an active buyback program, but we want to look at everything that\u2019s available to us. So we will monitor that and like Steve said, we will come back in July with further updates on that, but we will \u2013 certainly will continue a buyback and a dividend program. And with the debt like I said, I think the levels we have today even though we have the capacity for some additional debt, but I think the levels are fine today.", "Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray", "And then the minimum cash level?", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "I am sorry minimum cash level, $1 billion to $1.5 billion we could run the business at that level. I am more comfortable with $1.5 billion for strategic elements that may pop themselves up, but we feel comfortably at the $2.3 billion that we have plenty of cash to run the business.", "Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities", "Thanks for taking my question. Just kind of first on the September and December time, which you talked 1.40 to 1.45 range, maybe could you elaborate which particular segment you see the more pickup for the demand?", "Steve Luczo", "I think it\u2019s across the board.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities", "Thanks. And then you kind of talked about some inventory digestion at your customers at enterprise and hyperscale, do you think it is possible that you are seeing the pause, because people are waiting for the 6 terabyte drives or it is more to do with some products at their end?", "Steve Luczo", "No, this has to do with your own products.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities", "Okay, just kind of the last one on the NAND side, maybe could you kind of talk about the NAND strategy, do you think you need any more M&A in this field or do you think you would like to grow the business more in-house? Thanks.", "Rocky Pimentel", "Hi, this is Rocky Pimentel. On the NAND side, certainly, we have our organic efforts on SSD, but as we have said in the past we are definitely always on, looking at the inorganic activates we can do, whether it\u2019s acquisition or investments. So we continue to have a pretty disciplined filter, but needless to say we see ourselves pushing forward the initiative from both an organic and an inorganic standpoint.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities", "Thank you. That\u2019s helpful.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Scott Craig with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Scott Craig - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Pat I was wondering if you can go over the OpEx again on the quarter because it came in a bit better than you guys have thought originally, you mentioned cost containment, given you expected some of the comp stuff to go away, so is there anything specific you guys are doing on the cost side that perhaps continues moving forward here. And then secondly, just a clean up item on our models on the tax rate, there was a credit there as opposed to an expense, can you help us understand what that was and is that something that is more one-time in nature? Thanks.", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "Yes, so starting backwards on the tax there was some tax adjustments every periods from time-to-time, audit periods expire with time, so you just \u2013 you take a look at that and you make the appropriate level of adjustments. So that was a $14 million one-time item, that\u2019s why I think claiming the tax rate of about $60 million on a go forward basis, spread equally through quarters is probably the best model for that. On the OpEx were some actions of reshaping some of the activities throughout the company. We had some cutbacks over the last several months. So we certainly reshape some investments through actions inside the company and then through slowing down some investments on pieces we talked about SATA 4 SSD where we thought that wasn\u2019t probably the appropriate place, so you saw some expenses come of there. So it was looking across the board, not just core, but some of these new investments where we thought the best chances if we get the adequate level of return on investment. And so that was done, that activity will continue to keep ourselves flat through on the HDD for Q4 the June quarter and as Steve and Jamie talked about from a business process we will continue to look to how to integrate further and maybe harbor some of that, but like I said probably with the appetite to redeploy in other areas. So, I would like I said model that high in the 14% and we will get more clarity on the Xyratex, Evolve everything else optimization in the July timeframe.", "Scott Craig - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you.", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "Sure, thanks.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Please proceed.", "Joe Wittine - Longbow Research", "Hi, thanks. With the weakness in enterprise, I am curious, Pat, if there is an impact, a noticeable impact on gross margin for not just on a mixed basis and if so how much?", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "We already gave you our gross margin outlook of 28%.", "Joe Wittine - Longbow Research", "Yes, I am sorry. So, talking to just to clarify talking to the current weakness we have seen over the last couple of quarters, is that driving a noticeable level of weakness in the companywide consolidated gross margin that you are reporting?", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "Yes, enterprise drives have higher gross margins in the corporate average.", "Joe Wittine - Longbow Research", "Okay. And then maybe just on market share, with the big swings in enterprise and the downside in client, especially desktops and the upside, is there anything you would like to note in market share that\u2019s been happening over the last quarter?", "Steve Luczo", "No, market share has been pretty consistent for the last four or five quarters. Maybe if I think back the last six quarters, I think the biggest swing in market share has been a couple of points overall. I think half a point shifts here and there are kind of to be expected then those are seem to be mostly a function of either product gaps from either us or the competitors or maybe someone has access to a customer that happens to be doing better and sometimes that advantages us and sometimes it advantages one of our competitors. I would say the only kind of significant trend if I think back over six or eight quarters is that Toshiba has picked up a lot of share on the branded side, which was done through relatively aggressive pricing three or four quarters ago and that seems to have been resolved in the last couple of quarters as well. So, no, I don\u2019t see any huge market share shifts, some at the fringe, but that\u2019s mostly either product related or maybe something specific customer related.", "Joe Wittine - Longbow Research", "Okay, helpful. Thanks.", "Steve Luczo", "Good, thanks.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Robert Cihra with Evercore Partners. Please proceed.", "Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners", "Hi, thanks very much. Two questions as well if I could. One on just your internal head in media, mostly the head side just that without, not so as far number, but just where you are now and if you think there is that\u2019s changing over the next couple of quarters in terms of more internal head mix or do you think it will stay similar? And then on the enterprise side, I know it\u2019s been picked apart 50 times, but out of the 7.7 million enterprise units, if you could give us any kind of mix between mission-critical and nearline and all the dynamics you are talking about, Steve, in terms of the OEM product cycle than a hyperscale, I assume is applied across both mission-critical and nearline or are they kind of mostly mission-critical on the OEM side and mostly nearline in the hyperscale side? Thanks.", "Steve Luczo", "Let me answer that before forgetting and Dave can talk about the sourcing stuff. Yes, the most of the mission-critical stuff is I would call legacy system, which is obviously still an enormous market and that\u2019s where you see a big rotation on the architectures, the new product offerings from a few of the customers that\u2019s causing kind of the soak up in the inventory that they have in the house. And then the deployment and utilization rate stuff that we have seen over the last few quarters has been mostly on the hyperscale side. That can show up either in the OEMs or it can obviously just show up directly to the drive companies and to the server companies or the white box server companies, because as you know, the CSPs for the most part are buying direct although from time-to-time, they are still buying through certain OEMs. So, there is a more of a mix on that side of whether or not it\u2019s impacting OEMs or if it\u2019s impacting the component industries directly.", "Dave Mosley", "And Rob, to answer your question on the heads internal versus external, we are fairly happy with the mix, also the technology access that we are getting across various platforms. So, right now, I don\u2019t foresee any changes in internal versus external strategy for the coming few quarters.", "Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners", "Alright, great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of (indiscernible) with Technologies Insights. Please proceed.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes, thank you. I got a couple of questions. First is to pick apart guidance a little bit more, $3.3 billion includes about $100 million from the Xyratex. So hard drive operations revenue, it sounds like that\u2019s about $3.2 billion, so probably about 6% Q3 decline on hard drive revenue. Could you help parse out the two factors that you have cited, the inventory correction and the seasonality?", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "So, on the inventory correction, that would probably be\u2026", "Steve Luczo", "The seasonality is usually 4%, yes.", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "Right. And the inventory correction would be the other piece and probably the bigger drag on the margin.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, okay very good. And my other question is on the branded that has had two consecutive quarters of core unit growth, but more importantly two consecutive quarters of ASP growth. So, the question is are you seeing this growth coming from higher ASP offerings, and more importantly, where is this mix shift at this point in time and where do you think it will go two years from now?", "Rocky Pimentel", "Hi, this is Rocky Pimentel. Yes, I think we have been pretty pleased this last quarter with the execution on our retail side. And that is a mix to higher product, higher capacity products, particularly our momentum built in the 2 terabyte category in the channel. So, we continue to see higher capacity products playing a bigger role in the mix as we go out over the foreseeable future in the branded side as well as the emergence of more NAS centric products in both the small, middle \u2013 small, medium-sized business as well as consumer NAS.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And your question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, great. Thanks. Looking at the demand outlook you discussed, how should we think about exabyte shipment growth in the second half of the year given that the strength I believe you said was going to broad-based across the segment?", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, I think it\u2019s going to accelerate. I think what I said is I expect growth across all segments, but I do think that on a relative basis, the growth will be better on the nearline side, where it\u2019s been pretty flat the last three quarters. So, I think we are going to see some exabyte growth acceleration. And keep in mind obviously on the client side, we have large capacity types, through lots of people gobbling up one and two and three terabyte drives on notebook and then two, threes on desktop. So, it doesn\u2019t really hurt you so much even if you get it on notebook and desktop, but I do think the weighting will be more towards nearline mission-critical.", "Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful.", "Steve Luczo", "Thank you.", "Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs", "Second question on MOFCOM, can you remind us of the potential benefits you would expect to see if all the restrictions were lifted and obviously we don\u2019t know how it will play out, but just how are you thinking about that today?", "Pat O\u2019Malley", "Yes. Obviously for Seagate, it was \u2013 we picked up a product line, we picked up a good engineering team that would still utilize post MOFCOM and continue to invest there, but if you take a look at the total operating synergies on the OpEx, you could make that case for $40 million, like I said what would we do with that, whether we redeploy it, but that will be probably a magnitude for us. And then obviously just giving us our customers would like to have one access point. So, the customers would prefer it as well. So maybe customer set and that yields something, but from an OpEx about $40 million.", "Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. With that, I would like to hand the call back to Mr. Steve Luczo for closing remarks.", "Steve Luczo - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, just want to thank everybody for being on the call today. And then we look forward to speaking with you again in July. Thanks.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.

My name is Kathleen, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Kate Scolnick, Vice President, Investor Relations.

Joining me today from Seagate's executive team are Steve Luczo, Chairman and CEO; Pat O'Malley, EVP and CFO; Jamie Lerner, President, Cloud Systems and Solutions; Dave Mosley. President, Operations and Technology; and Rocky Pimentel, President, Global Markets and Customers.", "We've posted our press release and detailed supplemental information about our fiscal fourth quarter and year end on our Investor Relations site at Seagate.com. During today's call, we will review the highlights from the June quarter and fiscal 2014 and then provide the company's outlook for the first fiscal quarter 2015.

Please go ahead, Steve.", "Steve Luczo", "Thanks, Kate. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Seagate demonstrated strong operational performance in the June quarter, achieving revenues of $3.3 billion and on a non-GAAP basis gross margin of 28.5%, net income of $370 million, and diluted earnings per share of $1.10.", "We had another strong cash flow quarter generating $577 million in operating cash flow and $446 million in free cash flow. Full-year fiscal 2014 revenues were $13.7 billion and on a non-GAAP basis, we achieved gross margin of 28.5%, net income of $1.8 billion, and diluted earnings per share of $5.04.", "Operating cash flow generated for the fiscal year was over $2.5 billion and free cash flow was approximately $2 billion.", "We exceeded our shareholder capital return goals for the year, returning $2.5 billion in the form of dividends and share redemptions to our shareholders. We ended the fiscal year with approximately $2.7 billion in cash and investments, and $327 million ordinary shares outstanding.", "One of our strategic priorities for fiscal year 2014 was to further optimize Seagate's capital structure to support the long-term growth of the company. Over the course of the fiscal year, we successfully raised $1.8 billion in investment grade debt while retiring $700 million. These actions decreased our weighted average interest rate to 5% and extended our debt maturity profile out to 2025.", "We continue to be focused on making investments and acquisitions to build out Seagate's storage offering, enter new market adjacencies and expand our core technical capabilities. The first quarter for our Cloud Systems and Solutions business, which includes the OneStor systems, ClusterStor and Evolve product lines was strong and we exceeded our internal revenue plan.", "The traction we are achieving with existing and new customers is encouraging and we believe this momentum will create new revenue opportunities in the future.", "At the end of May, we announced our plan to acquire the SSD controller and PCIe assets from Avago, to further build out our integrated flash technology portfolio, expand our customer base, and drive new revenue opportunities. The transaction is on track to close at the end of August or beginning of September and we look forward to talking more broadly about our strategic plans post-close.", "Our fiscal year capital expenditures were $559 million below our long-term planning range of 6% to 8% of revenue. We continue to plan cautiously and focus on deploying capital towards the maintenance of our existing operation, increase technical R&D capabilities, and improvements to our global facilities footprint.", "Looking ahead to fiscal 2015 and beyond, the significant changes and economics and architectures taking place in the traditional storage industry continued to create opportunities for Seagate. As we plan for our next fiscal year, we remain focused on investing in our storage technology product portfolio to deliver high quality storage products and solutions that create advantages for our customers.", "Some of these investments will have immediate benefit to our business, while others will take more time, but we believe will create important strategic advantages for Seagate in the storage marketplace.", "As noted on our last call, we talked about demand momentum building towards the back-half of the year. Based on the June quarter activity and as a result of ongoing conversations with customers, we continued to see demand trends strengthening across multiple segments. This is the first time we've seen this kind of sustained traction during the last four years. In addition, while it is early in the quarter, we are seeing higher-than-normal pull rates for July and a significant increase in capacity for drive thus far.", "Turning to our outlook, we believe market demand in September and December quarters are being driven by a few key factors, improving sequential momentum in the cloud market and the traditional enterprise market consistent with product refreshes, sequential strength in the notebook market, and seasonal demand for gaming and branded. Taking these factors into account, industry estimates are for market demand to be approximately 142 million units to 146 million units in the September quarter.", "Given the current outlook for notebook demand, we anticipate the addressable market will be at the higher end of that range. In this demand environment, we believe Seagate's product portfolio is well positioned competitively. In the enterprise market, most of our major OEMs and cloud customers are qualified or are actively qualifying our 6 terabyte product. This product has many industry-leading features in terms of capacity, performance, and cost.", "We have also delivered 8 terabyte customer development units to major customers and cloud service providers and the initial customer feedback has been very positive. While it\u2019s still early in the development of our Kinetic object-based storage platform, we are in deep technical discussions with a very broad-base of enterprise customers. We believe our focus on developing key values for object-based storage will make the Kinetic platform a differentiated offering in the cloud storage marketplace.", "In conjunction with improving dynamics in the client market, we have been focusing on optimizing our client product portfolio and reinforcing our competitive position. This past quarter we finished qualification of our 7200 RPM notebook product at all major OEMs, and we expect to quickly ramp volume in this critical space and win share that is in line with our segment averages.", "We are encouraged by the adoption we are achieving with key OEMs for our hybrid drives and the top three worldwide PC manufacturers now offer our hard drive in their mainstream product lines. We have seen a significant acceleration in demand and plan to ship over 2.5 million hybrid drives in the September quarter.", "And finally, we expect to maintain share in the gaming market and have a fully refreshed portfolio for the branded space for Seagate and LaCie products. Based on industry forecast at this time in the quarter and the competitive positioning of our product portfolio, we are planning to achieve revenue of at least $3.55 billion in the September quarter. We are targeting product gross margins to be relatively flat, recognizing we have margin pressure associated with the integration of Xyratex and the Avago flash technology assets.", "Operating expenses will be approximately $550 million, slightly above our long-term targeted range of 12% to 14%. We are planning for our core businesses expense to be relatively flat and approximately $35 million in one-time expenses from our planned 14-week quarter and other charges.", "In summary, Seagate is very well positioned for continued success and while our forecasting continues to maintain a sense of caution due to macroeconomic conditions and industry dynamics, the trends we are seeing in the marketplace are continuing to align with our long-term expectations for exabyte demand and the growing need for economical and efficient storage.", "We are optimistic about our storage technology leadership position and we look forward to updating you on our vision and strategic plan at our strategic update on September 12. On behalf of the entire management team, I want to thank our employees for meeting our operational goals for the fiscal year and positioning Seagate for ongoing success in fiscal year 2015.", "I also want to thank our customers, partners, suppliers, and shareholders for their continued support and commitment.", "And we can now turn it over for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley Equity Research", "Yes, thanks, good afternoon. There is still some debate in the market around the sustainability of PC strength post Win XP. And I think your comments in the back-half you mentioned cloud and notebooks and gaming, but not desktops. So can you just talk about what you've seen in July around commercial desktop and whether that strength is continuing?", "Stephen Luczo", "I think it's early, Katy, but I mean what we are seeing right now is strength across all the segments.", "Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley Equity Research", "Okay. And then as it relates to the constructive comments on the back-half, what do you think is driving that, is that just global improvement in macro, is that catch-up in capacity, demand as data has grown and orders have not over the last year, just curious what you think is driving the strength?", "Stephen Luczo", "I would say most of our customers would attribute it to just general macroeconomic strength. I do think there is, as we said, these changes between the deployment of storage and the demand for storage and those can fluctuate based on either time to deployment or utilization rates, and those are going to constantly flux over the period of years or quarters. But right now, I think the strength is being driven by macroeconomic factors.", "Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley Equity Research", "Okay. And then just lastly given the potential for better fundamentals in the back half, what should we expect on the buyback in the first-half of fiscal 2015?", "Stephen Luczo", "We'll talk about our capital allocation plan at the strategic update in September.", "Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley Equity Research", "Okay. Thank you.", "Stephen Luczo", "Yes, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. Two questions; one, maybe you can just talk a little bit on the Enterprise Drives, what do you expect in the back half between the mission critical and the capacity-optimized drives? Do you expect both of them to see robust trend? Is one better than the other?", "Stephen Luczo", "Yes, Rock, you answer that.", "Albert Pimentel", "Yes, this is Rocky Pimentel. So, on the enterprise side, we expect consistent improvement based on our OEM customers anecdotal and forecasted data. On the cloud side, I think our anticipation is the capacity driven products going more into the cloud side and we see probably a stronger sentiment in the cloud side as we go through the remainder of the back half of the year.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Got it. And if I can just clarify the second part, the $550 million of OpEx that you guys are talking about for the upcoming quarter. $35 million of that is related to extra weeks or extra, how should we think about $550 million run rate on a quarterly basis go forward?", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "It's $35 million and other \u2013 this is Pat, I'm sorry, this is Pat. These $35 million and other charges whether it's integration and other activities as we try to knit the companies together. But above that $22 million to $25 million is going to be the 14th week, so you can't attribute all the 14th week, but it's that plus other things, is that $35 million one-time disappears after Q1.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "And is that\u2026", "Stephen Luczo", "And then at the \u2013 and at the Strategic Update, we'll provide a better annual and quarterly outlook on OpEx, because these will be two quarters and on the Xyratex business and kind of a couple of months and at least on the knowledge of what other side looks like. So, we're going to give you more transparency about what the overall OpEx looks like at that time.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Got it. And I guess, Pat, just to clarify this thing of the extra week, is that a net neutral or bit of a drag to your operating margin and EPS?", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "", "It's a good question. I've been around this business a long time. This is probably my fifth cycle, 14 weeks. We certainly expect to get some marginal uplift on that 14th week, but the way OEMs negotiate on a quarter-to-quarter basis, you can have some debate on that. There's not too much debate on the OpEx or the other costs and they're fixed and we know those, so \u2013 but we've modeled it.", "Stephen Luczo", "", "It's a net negative on operating margin to answer your question, because you get the full week of expenses obviously. But you don't get a 1/14th increase in revenues, because the OEMs don't, they just negotiate quarterly and as you know we're heavily weighted towards OEM. So you get a revenue pick-up, but you don\u2019t get a 1/14th revenue pick-up, but you certainly get a 1/14th operating expense pick-up, so\u2026", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "That's helpful. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joe Yoo with Citi Research. Your line is open.", "Joe Yoo \u2013 Citigroup", "Thank you. So, I wanted to ask more of a longer-term strategy question, and more specifically to the NAS market, and obviously, you announced some products and, I wanted to ask that question, because the Soho market that you're targeting, it appears to be fairly sizeable. I mean there's, I think over 5 million firms just in the U.S. with 20 employees or less. So, and also your major storage customers don't really participate in that market. So could you help us, maybe, size that opportunity and, and how soon it could become a meaningful contributor to the P&L?", "Stephen Luczo", "I think the key to it being a significant contributor to the P&L revolves around software. I think still to-date, the main inhibitor to that market really achieving its full potential is that the software is difficult to use. And it's an area where we've been making investments and are trying to solve that problem. But to your point, the market is attractive. I want to say, shouldn't guessed at this, but I want to say this is $1 billion market or something like that when you take all the companies that we know and then hear about often and then maybe some of, what goes through integration.", "I think the difficult part is, what goes through the VAR channel and SI channel that ends up being a NAS product, we lose visibility on things like that. But I do think that this is a substantial market that likes the DAS market as the drive industry started delivering more integrated products with software and hardware that, that's opportunity for us on the NAS side.", "And again, our distribution channel really knows how to reach into VARs and SIs that have storage expertise, so I do think it's a potential but and so the software gets a little easier to use. I don't think it's going to be as addressable as it probably should be.", "Joe Yoo \u2013 Citigroup", "Got it. Thank you, Steve, for the color. And Dave, I believe in the past you talked about various cost levers like scrap, warranty, and freight, and where do you see opportunities in the second half to maybe further optimize costs?", "Dave Mosley", "I think we'll continue to pull those levers as much as we possibly can. There are some product transitions going on, for example, the 6 terabyte and things like that. So, as we get up the initial ramp and then are able to get our yields up and work those issues, we can continue to take costs out. So I think products transitions and more efficient use of internal components, high number, high component counts that cover fixed costs, things like that. There's a lot of opportunity there.", "Also there are some synergies that we get from some of the acquisition stuff that we've done like, for example, Xyratex, making the supply chain flow better up and down. I think there will be some cost opportunities there as well.", "Joe Yoo \u2013 Citigroup", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Your line is open.", "Joe Wittine \u2013 Longbow Research", "Hi, thanks. If you're willing to, just a question on the rationale behind the LSI acquisition, I think the WarpDrive piece, the PCIe is self-explanatory, get you closer to the hyperscale guys. But I really want to ask you on the core SandForce, the standard FSPs. I know the standard control is typically focused on kind of the channel SSD and replacement SSD market, so just curious, any quick thoughts of how that second piece is complementary to Seagate?", "Dave Mosley", "Yes, first of all, we have a lot of controllers ourselves. Every hard drive has a controller as well. So there's complementary technology development that's going on that can be used back and forth. But I think germane to just how do you go to market if you will. The knowledge that you get from integrating with the various customers is pretty powerful. And I think insofar as those are the same customers that we're doing, we are going out and talking to with hard drives. I think there is and we understand the market segments really well and we can address both spaces. I think that's fairly powerful also.", "The \u2013 I think everybody needs to keep in mind that this is really a flash controller. The interface side, we have a lot of expertise in anyway, whether it's SAS or SATA or something else, and then some of those can plug into your point about the PCIe cards we can also plug those in to that interfacing and go to market that way. But the NAND control piece is something obviously we've been doing a lot on for our hybrid drives.", "Steve talked about how that market's growing quite a bit, so I think there's a lot of synergies there, I hope that answers your question.", "Joe Wittine \u2013 Longbow Research", "Great, thanks. And then switch gears to branded quickly, you said, you have some work to do on the, on product introductions coming up here. I don't know if you can give any more details there. And second, what is the reasonable expectation of kind of go-forward unit growth for brand? And I only asked, because your units grew only a point last year. I know Toshiba kind of aggressively grabs some share early in the year, which didn't help. But if you can give us your updated thoughts on what the long-term, mid-term secular growth rates is here?", "Albert Pimentel", "Yes, this is Rocky Pimentel. So, I think we're still looking at a single unit direct-attached storage market for branded for the next couple of quarters that being the dominant product. But like Steve talked about, that the \u2013 today that the branded has pretty much serviced the small home office type category of products and then demands. But I think as we see our product's roadmap over the next 18 to 24 quarters, we'll start to be introducing additional more complex products in the NAS, with a focus on the user experience and the software offering.", "So we totally recognize the opportunity as the segmentation between traditional \u2013 between real consumer and true small business emerges that \u2013 it's an opportunity for us to continue to offer low-end complex NAS storage to that segment.", "Stephen Luczo", "I think a lot of that where the real research on the market side, and Jamie can lean on this as well as this line between prosumer to small business to medium business, and which of those segments you are going to be serviced through HTDs through cloud offerings, whether or not it's an AWS-type solution or a hybrid solution where there is local storage as well as some cloud-based storage.", "And so we are working on our architectures that, in partnership with some of our cloud customers there is utilizations where by having a hybrid product, non-prime storage, as well as cloud-based has some overall advantages either in terms of security or cost or bandwidth. So I think how that flushes out and which one of those kind of sub-segments you are talking about will have well different offers. But that notwithstanding, that animal that is a pure NAS product for a lower-end less technically confident customer, the software has to get a lot easier.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Yes, thank you. I think you kind of dovetailed a little bit with the comments that you just made. Can you talk a little bit more about your Xyratex business and in particular your ability to position a solution sale into the cloud opportunities? Has that started to materialize? How much was the Xyratex revenue contribution this last quarter relative to the $100 million? And maybe talk about how we should think about the trajectory of that opportunity going forward?", "Stephen Luczo", "Jamie, do you want to handle it?", "Jamie Lerner", "Hey, Aaron, this is Jamie. Maybe I'll take a moment and highlight some of the accomplishments this quarter. ClusterStor which is our high performance computing business is gaining a significant amount of traction in the oil and gas and healthcare verticals especially genomic sequencing as well as seeing a lot of strength in the government sector for immense big data deployments.", "Aaron, to give you an idea of the scale these projects, our team closed a 65 petabyte, 3-petaflop deal with a European weather service, as well as we recently won a 82 petabyte deal in partnership with Cray, that's delivering 1.7 terabytes per second for immense data processing to the U.S. government.", "Of the Fortune Five, two of those oil and gas companies are using ClusterStor for their exploration and geospatial analytics. Now, for the cloud-scale folks that you talked about as a sign of that pipeline, we are responding to a 0.5 zettabyte and a full zettabyte storage opportunity for the world's largest cloud storage operators.", "Few other points that are worth mentioning is also with ClusterStor we have an item called the Secure Data Appliance, which is the world's fastest data analytics engine. And this product achieved the Intelligence Community Directive, ICD 503 this quarter. And for those you don't know what that is, this is a group that oversees the analytics work for the Intelligence Community and has certified us for the world's most secure data projects for the U.S. Intelligence Community.", "In addition, that ClusterStor business grew at over 210% this quarter. The Evolve business had its largest quarter in the last 10 years was \u2013 we have five deals that were over $500,000, so we are seeing the average sale price go up as we are able to, and working with Xyratex, meet the needs of much larger organizations. And in our OSS and OEM business which a lot of cloud providers are saying, will you actually build a custom box for us. We saw for the first time in over 10 quarters, that bookings were significantly ahead of revenue in that business, so all three businesses over-performed this quarter.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Right. And so when I think about that opportunity or that business trajectory materializing and considering that you are stripping out the pass-through effect of what Xyratex would have been historically selling on hard disk drive content. How do I think about the margin profile and how that could progress and play into the Seagate story? And I'll cede the floor.", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "So let me take that Aaron, this is Pat, and if Jamie wants to add color, please, Jamie, add more color. But when we made the acquisition we knew it was the \u2013 the first thing, we were going to stabilize the asset and I think what you're hearing from Jamie is, we stabilize it and start reinvigorate the product lines, that's the good thing.", "As we go through the fiscal year, we really, the only thing we really said was the revenue would be $500 million to $600 million. I can tell you here we'll probably get more color, but we really don\u2019t want to break this business out, so it gets about $1 billion, but with that $500 million to $600 million, like I said, we are trending in the high part of that, but it won't be accretive during the first fiscal year, but it will thereafter.", "I think the margins have a slight drag, but should trajectory through the course of the year get equal to and above. So we like the path, but there is a bit of reinvigorating that product line to drive that and Jamie stabilizing the existing and growing with the new.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Very good. Thank you.", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open.", "Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research", "Thanks. Good afternoon. First of all, could you just expand on your comments about the significant increase in average capacities that you are expecting for the second half of the year, where exactly you're seeing it, what's driving it from the customer-end?", "And then secondly, can you help us put the 8% growth in exabytes versus the 4% decline year-over-year in revenues, what's making up the difference there? Thanks.", "Stephen Luczo", "Well, on the growth thus far, it's just \u2013 we're just using an average capacity for drive across the board, which is \u2013 from where it\u2019s been the last several quarters and that\u2019s across all customers. And we are not going to talk about customer specific or market specific.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Clearly the high capacity drives are getting higher capacity and lower-end drives are going up in capacity, so there is multiple drivers driving the average size of the drive sold up.", "Stephen Luczo", "What's driving it is richer content and more people needing access to richer content.", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "And data, right.", "Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research", "Okay. And then just putting the\u2026", "Stephen Luczo", "Would you restate the second half of the question?", "Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research", "Yes, I think you said in your prepared remarks that exabyte growth was up 8% year-over-year for the quarter, your revenues were down 4% year-over-year, so how would we split between the two?", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "I think as we highlight the back-half of the year, where the cloud was somewhat muted, where they're the richest drives. We saw the average capacity of drive go up, but we saw as we talked about in the last two quarters, where we had some whether it\u2019s enterprise or cloud that was somewhat muted, we see that accelerating. So what we saw were growth in a lot of the \u2013 in the notebook drives, which are per unit, a lot lower capacity, but that even as those units go out, their capacity for drive is increasing.", "So I think you have to look at the whole portfolio, but if you look at it individually you will see an increase of every drive capacity across the board. So every segments getting richer, it\u2019s just the mix that's sort of covering that story up.", "Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research", "Thank you.", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "Yes, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi, thanks. Just going back to the Xyratex revenue question, I think you had said in this quarter, you thought that revenue would be about a $100 million in this quarter. It sounds like you guys think that it was higher than that based on the $500 million to $600 million annual revenue run-rate at this point, is that fair?", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "Yes, that's fair. Like I said, we're not breaking it out and until we get to a significant more scale, but that's probably a fair assessment.", "Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then just looking at the guidance for $3.55 billion, am I \u2013 is it fair to assume that you are not including any revenue benefit from the fourth quarter, I'm sorry the extra week in the quarter?", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "We're some marginal, but not, as Steve says, it's not a 1/14, it\u2019s very small.", "Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then just looking at your guidance versus the TAM guidance, it looks like revenue is going to be up at the midpoint about 8% versus units up maybe 6% to 7%, is that because of better mix, why do you expect the ASPs to go up? Thanks.", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "That's all mix, as we talked about in the last call, where we see the strengthening in the back-half of the enterprise and the cloud, classic enterprise and cloud, that's being fuelled by that, and it's also being fuelled by richer content of richer of mix up of every segment drive.", "Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thank you.", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Your line is open.", "Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC", "Thank you. Good afternoon. Actually just taking on the last comment, Pat, what do you think \u2013 in terms of pricing dynamics in the retail segments, are you expecting prices to go up there as well? And then I have a follow-up.", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "", "If I look at the whole portfolio, it\u2019s relatively benign. It has been relatively benign for a while. We expect it to stay that way. We don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not a company that place quarter-end deals. We sure just \u2013 we run a long-term business model and we expect pricing to be relatively stable, what we\u2019ve seen over the last year.", "Stephen Luczo", "", "And when you say retail, Richard, are you talking about branded?", "Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC", "", "Yes.", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "", "So we don\u2019t see price rises, but we see relatively price stability.", "", "Stephen Luczo", "", "I\u2019d say that the price competition has been less aggressive than it was earlier in the year.", "Albert Pimentel", "", "Yes, and I would say, this is Rocky Pimentel, where we see a benefit of mixing up of capacities in the retail portfolio, strength in the one terabyte, two terabyte offerings, and as we continue to go out over the next few quarters, so certainly that\u2019s going to be positive impact to the retail business across the industry basically.", "Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC", "", "Okay, and secondly on the margins, as you look at the balance of the year taken into account Avago and what you\u2019re doing with the Xyratex business, do you think that there\u2019s greater leverage on the gross margin side or on the operating margin side?", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "For the fiscal year, I think we have more leverage on the gross margin, the operating leverage will be a little more difficult during fiscal 2015 until we get to scale and as we knit these companies together to get more efficiencies as Dave highlighted on the supply chain as we look at all the facilities, we got to knit those in but that\u2019s going to be the challenge if you want to think of it that way for us in fiscal 2015 to set up a good 2016.", "But the gross margin leverage I think we\u2019re going to have tools to optimize that better than the operating for the first 12 months.", "Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC", "", "Okay and then just lastly, Steve, you mentioned that for the first time in four years, you\u2019re starting to see a little bit better demand and visibility out of the OEMs. I\u2019m just interested, are you seeing any changes in behavior regarding inventory or hubs or how they want to manage the business this time around or do you think you can maintain the same supply demand discipline that\u2019s been in place for few years?", "", "Stephen Luczo", "", "No, I didn\u2019t say OEMs, I said customers.", "Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC", "For Customers.", "", "Stephen Luczo", "", "And I think I'll do a quick answer and then I\u2019ll let Dave talk on the operational side, which is really what you asked. But I would say across the customer base globally, there\u2019s a greater degree of confidence about what\u2019s ahead of us for the next four quarters than what I had felt anytime in the last \u2013 since the debacle of 2008 September. And we\u2019ve had a couple of starts before as I mentioned on the last call, but this is I think the first time that\u2019s actually sustained itself here at the end of the summer.", "And I think that\u2019s encouraging and then in terms of the operational side, I think, things just continue to get better in terms of people understanding that as my friend, John Monroe says inventory is not an asset, Velocity is important. And therefore, lean supply chains are where people make money. But I\u2019ll let Dave talk to that because we\u2019ve made a lot of good progress with some of our key customers there. And in that case it has been mostly OEMs.", "Dave Mosley", "", "Right, to that end, Rich, we\u2019ve had a lot of success optimizing freight lanes, using the right kind of freight, whether it\u2019s ocean or rail, not air, and using super hubs rather than individual jet-hubs [ph] for everybody, to do late stage postponement and things like that, that's really helped our inventory positions and that\u2019s helped by the fact that some of the big OEMs are working complexity across every segment.", "They\u2019re doing a really good job there. We can always redeploy those drives out of the channel or whatnot if they don\u2019t have the demand and I think just in the last few years, that\u2019s been a market change in our industry. We just continue to work on that systems that enable that with our key partners.", "Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC", "", "Great, excellent. Thank you very much.", "", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest. Your line is open.", "Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "", "Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick \u2013 the market share was just a bit lower in the quarter, about 39 points, usually it\u2019s been 40% around, any particular reason or you think it\u2019s just quarter-over-quarter noise?", "Stephen Luczo", "No, I think it\u2019s quarter-to-quarter noise. Again, the industry still has competitively at the end of the quarter that Seagate tends not to participate in, and there\u2019s also big shifts on depending on where your relationship is with which gaming company and you are at in the cycle with that gaming company. You could see SharePoint moves off of a point. So half point moves are noise level to us. We believe we\u2019re going to win with good solid product execution, better performance, better reliability, and we\u2019re not worried about where the share is at these levels.", "This is a revenue share, our exabyte share has been relatively flat for the last four or five quarters. And we really focus probably more right now on revenue share and exabyte share than we do on unit TAM share as long as we are getting enough absorption. Because of the shift, the higher capacity for drive that we\u2019re seeing across the portfolio, we\u2019re absorbing heads and disks and that\u2019s what we need to do.", "Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Then just as a follow-up, Seagate currently uses much higher external media and head capacity. Do you think you will move more of it in-house, just maybe it could help the margins more?", "Stephen Luczo", "If we were really short-term focused that would be something we could do. But our thesis is that there will be long-term constraints in the supply of storage versus the demand of storage. And therefore, we believe the partnerships that we have with our head vendors and our disk vendors and other parts vendors will be well served over a longer-term view, where we can more efficiently use our capital and frankly more efficiently use our R&D dollars as we are with some of our partners right now.", "Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "", "All right. Thanks a lot. That\u2019s all from me.", "Operator", "Our next question \u2013 our last question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean. Your line is open.", "Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Capital, LLC", "Hey, thanks, guys, for squeezing me in. Two, if I could. The first, Steve, is for you with regards to your comments around, I guess, 12-month visibility. I guess 12-month visibility has sort of increased demand to go along with the customer visibility there. Does that include your hyperscale customers? And I guess really what my question is, do we have maybe longer than a two-quarter deployment cycle here with hyperscale?", "Stephen Luczo", "Again, my comments were about what customers are seeing across the board in terms of the macro trends in the world and the confidence it gives them in their business models. You can\u2019t draw one to one correlations and what does that mean, this hyperscale customer or that hyperscale customer.", "Every one of those companies that are providing public, cloud services are operating under different business models with different architectures, different applications, different deployment rates. So I\u2019d hate to paint a big broad stroke other than the general confidence level of people running technology companies or that are involved with the business of technology as strong as I\u2019ve seen it in four or five years.", "Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Capital, LLC", "Okay. Got it, guys, that's helpful. And then my follow-up is with regards to gross margins, you're forecasting flat gross margins, even with the cost load of the acquisition, which would suggest gross margins, I guess, up year-over-year without that load. And then I guess there was some commentary around having leverage through the year with regard to the acquisitions to get some gross margin leverage.", "So my question is, we had a few quarters of year-over-year gross margin increases, sort of on an apples-to-apples basis, without the acquisitions, do you think we're in sort of an environment now where that kind of dynamic could more or less continue for the foreseeable future?", "And then the second part is, given you have levers on gross margin from the acquisition, should we expect a little bit more expansion even on top of that over a reasonable period of time?", "Stephen Luczo", "We\u2019re going to talk about the long-term gross margin models in September. I think viewing the company without the acquisitions at this point is irrelevant. I think the trends are, again, that if the fundamental demand is towards higher capacity per drive, subject to a benign relatively, rational pricing environment, where we match supply and demand closely and don\u2019t do silly things to, take a point of share for no obvious reason.", "Then yes, the general margin structure improves from the industry, but it has to. For us to hit the demand profiles that we see out in 2016 or 2017, we will not be able to do it on capital to revenue of 6% to 8%, and I don\u2019t think, we're going to be able to do it on 28 points of gross margin. I mean we just \u2013 to deploy the amount of capacity that we have to, to hit the multiple zettabytes of demand out in 2017 or 2018, we\u2019re going to have to establish more consistent business models. So if it isn\u2019t moving in that direction, the industry is going to be even more challenged.", "Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Capital, LLC", "Got it. Appreciate that.", "Stephen Luczo", "I want to thank everybody for taking time on the call today. We will see many of you prior to the next call, because we have the Analyst Day on September 12.

Please proceed, Kate.", "Kate Scolnick", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today\u2019s call. Joining me today from Seagate\u2019s executive team are Steve Luczo, Chairman and CEO, Pat O'Malley, Executive Vice President and CFO; Dave Mosley, President, Operations and Technology; Rocky Pimentel, President, Global Markets and Customers; and our General Counsel, Ken Massaroni.", "We posted our press release and detailed supplemental information about our fiscal third quarter on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com. During today\u2019s call, we will review the highlights from the March quarter, provide the company outlook for the fourth fiscal quarter 2015 and then open the call for questions.", "We will refer to non-GAAP measures on this call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our supplemental information on our website.

Please go ahead, Steve.", "Steve Luczo", "Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. For the fiscal third quarter 2015, Seagate achieved revenues of $3.3 billion on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 28.9%, net income of $357 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.08.", "As we indicated in our business outlook in January, challenges from macroeconomic pressures in Europe and PC demand were factors we needed to manage through the quarter. The magnitude of these factors actually increased in third quarter, resulting in an impact to our top line revenue beyond our initial expectations, particularly in our EMEA business which was down approximately $100 million sequentially.", "In light of these dynamic market conditions, we are satisfied with the company\u2019s overall execution this quarter and we\u2019re particularly pleased with our sequential gross margin improvements and demonstration of operation expense control.", "Overall storage shipments for the March quarter were 55 exabytes, up 9% year over year, with average gigabytes per drive for the quarter increasing sequentially and continuing to average over 1 terabyte per drive.", "Cash flow generation was again strong in the March quarter and we achieved $374 million in operating cash flow and $215 million in free cash flow, including our previously announced $225 million payment for our tax audit assessment with the State Tax Bureau in China.", "Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $555 million, reflecting expense control around the core business and some optimization in our Cloud Systems and Solutions business.", "Capital expenditures in the March quarter were in line with our expectations and inventory both internally and externally are within manageable levels. Our balance sheet remains strong and we ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents.", "During the quarter, we returned $882 million to shareholders in dividends and stock redemptions. We redeemed approximately 12 million shares, ending the quarter with 318 million ordinary shares outstanding. Year to date, we have returned $1.4 billion to shareholders and have redeemed approximately 5% of our ordinary shares outstanding.", "We continue to believe our capital allocation policy is aligned with the long-term shareholder value creation and reflects our confidence in our ability to generate strong cash flow from our business.", "Before I cover our business outlook, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Dave Mosley to provide an update on the technology portfolio refresh that is underway across our business.", "Dave Mosley", "Thanks, Steve. Regarding our comments last quarter that we\u2019re in the process of refreshing significant portions of our HDD and SSD product portfolio, I\u2019m pleased to say that we\u2019re executing very well on our plans.", "Development in progress and customer qualification activity is on schedule, with our traditional enterprise mission critical HDDs as well as with our newest high-capacity cloud offerings, our 4 terabyte, 6 terabyte, and 8 terabyte platforms are performing extremely well in the field and customer adoption was strong is Q3.", "In the retail space, our 2 terabyte 2.5-inch drive still leads the industry in areal density and will be refreshed in the next two quarters to a higher capacity, maintaining our leadership. We look forward to pushing these areal density improvements into the majority of our products in FY 2016.", "As the costs of NAND flash have come down over the last several quarters, customers have begun to recognize the combination and the value of combining non-volatile caches with HDDs. With the advantage of selling over 15 million hybrid drives under our belt, we believe we are uniquely positioned to drive continued innovation and lead the industry in delivering the value that this combination of technology enables.", "Revenue growth and customer qualification traction for our SSD controllers, solid-state drives and PCIe accelerator cards are on track to our milestones. Our recently announced partnership with Micron for our next-generation enterprise SAS in proceeding well and customer feedback has been favorable.", "In addition, we\u2019re very happy with the close collaboration that we have with customers on application-specific tuning for SSDs in data center environments, underscoring the quality of our decisions in the M&A space over the last few years.", "In the high-performance computing space, this past quarter saw major new wins with leading academic, public sector and private labs that combined represent more than 120 petabytes of storage capacity, equivalent to the amount of storage needed for 1600 years of HD video.", "We also made first delivery of a massive scale-out storage system that when complete will achieve 1.7 terabytes per second while ingesting data, making that the fastest storage system in the world and it\u2019s built end to end on Seagate storage technology.", "I\u2019m really pleased with the breadth of technical innovation that the Seagate engineering teams are delivering, while continuing to judiciously manage operating expenses during a period of dynamic market conditions. I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank the entire global team for their continued efforts.", "And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Steve.", "Steve Luczo", "Great, thanks, Dave. Turning to our business outlook, the long-term trends in data growth, big data analytics, machine to machine computing and public and private cloud deployments continued to progress in an encouraging manner. Seagate is expanding and investing in its storage technology product and solutions portfolio to align competitively with these market dynamics and capitalize on exabyte demand growth.", "We remain optimistic that calendar year 2015 will provide significant opportunities to deepen our customer relationships, leverage our business model and return value to our shareholders. In the near-term, macroeconomic pressures in Europe and global currency fluctuations are continuing to have an effect on customers demand visibility.", "While we expect Europe to be challenged economically for most of 2015, it continues to be difficult to assess the degree of this impact will have on our client market customers, in addition to the timing of the release our Windows 10.", "Overall demand in the enterprise market is relatively stable. And as we have expressed previously, the Nearline high-capacity drive market can exhibit variations quarter to quarter as cloud service providers drive higher utilization of storage capacity additions and others prepared for build-outs in the second half of the year. When you take a multi-quarter view of this market, the exponential demand for storage is evident as exabyte capacity shipments in 2014 were up 35% over the prior year.", "From broad based discussions with customers, we currently believe that the addressable market in the June quarter will be relatively flat with the March quarter. We\u2019re targeting revenues for the June quarter of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion and managing to a very lean production schedule.", "Should macro conditions improve or PC builds accelerate with improved confidence in back to school demand, we could see upside to this forecast and we have the ability to flex up production as necessary. We will continue to shape our top line revenue opportunities that preserve our business profitably and enable us to continue to invest in advancing our storage technology portfolio offerings.", "For the June quarter, we anticipate margins of approximately 28.5%, taking into account continued dilution impact from our recent acquisitions. We\u2019re targeting operating expenses at $555 million, as our core product portfolio refresh continues to be on track as well as timing of investments in our new market adjacencies.", "Looking further ahead, we continue to believe that the second half of the calendar year will be stronger than the first half with demand coming from the PC market, seasonal gaming demand and continued stability in the enterprise market with potential upside from hyperscale deployments.", "We\u2019re confident in the long-term dynamics of data growth and the opportunities ahead for Seagate in the storage technology market place in 2015 and beyond. I thank our employees for their hard work and our customers, vendors, suppliers and shareholders for their ongoing support.", "I\u2019ll now open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Rich Kugele of Needham & Company.", "Richard Kugele", "Couple of questions. First, can you comment on what you felt the TAM was in March, so we understand the base for June? And then secondly, just on the PCIe space, Nytro, there\u2019s been some competitors complaining that the PCIe market is losing mine share to SAS solutions and SATA solutions. Can you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing from a competitive technology perspective in PCIe?", "Steve Luczo", "Richard, I\u2019ll have Dave answer the second question. But the first one is just assume, we believe held share in the quarter of about 40%, so that would translate into a TAM of call it 125 million, 126 million. Last quarter being early that we are \u2013 we made a guesstimate we were off by a few million units, I think, as it turns out, when everything rolled in, so we\u2019ll have to see what the other companies report. But our sense is we held share that would imply about 125 million, 126 million, something like that.", "Dave Mosley", "Relative to the PCIe space, what we\u2019re finding is that the customers who tend to buy these drives really want their applications accelerated in a very specific way, so there\u2019s a lot of deep understanding of the application that\u2019s required in order to get the design win and a lot of work with the customers specifically to make sure that it has traction across their entire install base when you install it.", "There is a very healthy market out there right now for SATA and SAS going into existing plugs without that requirements of that tuning. And I wouldn\u2019t pick one against the other, although I\u2019d say that maybe some of the growth of the PCIe space was a little overblown in the past. It\u2019s very customer and application specific and there\u2019s a lot of work required in order to get that traction.", "I think going forward, the idea that everything becomes the model where you just unplug what you have against one of those SAS or SATA plugs and plug in something new, it\u2019s probably not the right answer though, because I think there\u2019ll be architectural disruption on the software and hardware side that require further optimization. And on a lot of the PCIe space, obviously that time is money. The application acceleration that you can get means a lot to those customers and we\u2019ll continue to do that work.", "Steve Luczo", "So Richard, I think the comment about overblown, I think the point is that going back a few years when people were projecting how big they thought this market was and how fast it was growing, I don\u2019t think that has ever really been substantiated in terms of how these deployments really occur. And with respect to the specific question on our particular product and the traction we\u2019re gaining with customers, we find it to be quite positive when we don\u2019t really see some of the challenges that others have indicated.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Stifel.", "Aaron Rakers", "Can you talk a little bit about, you made a comment about some optimization in the operating expense structure of your cloud solutions business, can you just remind us where you\u2019re at in terms of the ramp of the Xyratex business and whether or not you still see upside drivers of what you\u2019ve laid out in the past, I think, $650 million to $700 million, and then where you stand on realizing or how much maybe further cost optimization realization could be had from that piece of the business?", "Steve Luczo", "We\u2019re still expecting that, as things develop over the next call it one to three quarters that we\u2019re going to gain some confidence on increasing that profile on what we think the revenue opportunity is from the CSS business.", "And on the margin side, we inherited a business that had a lot of good technology, but operationally probably hadn\u2019t had some of the investments that it needed to really be optimized and drive some of the efficiencies that we typically do on the drive side.", "So we\u2019re actively using that operations capability that we have to push more efficiency and flexibility, which it\u2019s kind of a combination of trying to get the efficiency with the flexibility because these orders come in fairly dynamically with not a lot of time, sometimes to address these opportunity especially as we get near the end of the quarter, there\u2019s still kind of the systems mentality where stuff is very back-end loaded, which we\u2019re trying to address operationally as well as how we manage our inventory. So I think there\u2019s a fair amount of room there in terms of what we can do on the margin profile over the next one to two years.", "Aaron Rakers", "And how much of an overhang is that right now on your gross margin?", "Steve Luczo", "On the gross margin, I\u2019ll give you an estimate, it\u2019s hard to exactly split everything that we\u2019re doing, because we are an integrated leverage company. But I think at least 50 to 70 basis points.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri Scribner", "Steve, considering the market was a bit weaker than I think most people expected going into the quarter, I was hoping if you could give us some commentary on what you saw in terms of pricing, it looks like your ASPs were up more \u2013 it looks like on like for like basis, they declined a little bit, so I was hoping to get some commentary?", "Steve Luczo", "Pricing was about as expected in the quarter, I\u2019ll let Rocky talk to it, but it was about as expected. We did have good mix up.", "Albert Pimentel", "I think as Steve said, the mix up was good. I think even in light of the fact this was kind of a seasonal hyperscale service provider consolidation period where their purchasing becomes a little more flattish, waiting for some of their expansion in the back half of the year was still strong year over year.", "And I think the enterprise was pretty stable, certainly the client had pressure, but we tried to apply very disciplined methodology towards making the market at the low end of the drive portfolio. So I think we felt really good about the overall mix in the product portfolio. Certainly, I think it\u2019s a reflection of the value that we have going forward in the hyperscale new data center world we\u2019re going to see. ", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox of Cross Research.", "Steve Fox", "Just broadly speaking on your non-HDD business, it looked like it was roughly flat, if my numbers are right, quarter over quarter. I know there\u2019s seasonality in there, could you just talk about how your sales are tracking towards some of those long term goals you laid out? Is there any other positive surprises in non-HDD sales and if you\u2019re still targeting some of the leverage for next fiscal year?", "Steve Luczo", "We think we\u2019ll still on track. So all the businesses either hit their plan of records that we had or maybe slightly achieved our internal plans and feel good about the opportunity in the growth prospects that we provided previously.", "Steve Fox", "And then Steve just there\u2019s been a lot of M&A discussion in general around storage, I know you guys are always looking at stuff, is there anything, if nothing came out in terms of acquisitions over the next six to nine months, is there any reason to think that you\u2019re not \u2013 your portfolio isn\u2019t fully loaded for that growth profile or what do you have to go to continue to develop it beyond what you\u2019ve discussed so far?", "Steve Luczo", "I think we have the pieces we need to meet the growth profile. I think if you see us pursue M&A activities, it will either be to affect the margin profile in terms of the technology that we\u2019re providing to the customer or it will be to either expand market share or broaden the technology portfolio in another way that would gain greater revenue growth. So it could either be a play on the gross margin or could be a play on the revenue opportunity. But right now I think the assets that we have support the growth profile that we\u2019ve indicated.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets.", "Amit Daryanani", "Two questions from me. I guess, one, could you just maybe talk about the enterprise business, especially the Nearline Drives, historically you\u2019ve had a few good quarters and you had a bit of a lull. So I\u2019m curious to what extent do you have good visibility in that business? And as you shift towards the 6 terabyte Nearline Drives, does that help, I\u2019m sure it helps the ASPs, but does that help your gross margin profile as well over there?", "Albert Pimentel", "Certainly the high end of the product portfolio always contributes to our gross margin and that was manifested in this quarter\u2019s strengthened gross margin despite the challenges we faced in revenue. I think our portfolio and as we\u2019ve talked about our 8 terabyte and beyond and Dave mentioned the strength of the hybrid program and things like that, I think we feel very positive about the prospects that the high end of the portfolio offer as we build forward throughout this year and then in the next year.", "And I think with the partnership with Micron and working on hybrid programs in next-generation SSD solutions just broadens the non-HDD portfolio that Steve was asked about previously. So I think we feel really good about the opportunities we have in our toolbox to go forward over the next several years.", "Amit Daryanani", "I\u2019m just curious on the June quarter, it seems that TAM is going to be flat, the mix sounds like it\u2019s going to be fairly stable, so could you maybe point out what are the levers that are resulting in 40 basis points decline in the margin guidance that you guys are providing for gross margins?", "Patrick O\u2019Malley", "So you heard us we\u2019re going to try to manage the supply tightly this quarter and with that, we\u2019re going to run the factories probably not the optimal way. So we\u2019re planning some downside there. But as Steve and Rocky said, we\u2019re quickly poised to take advantage of any opportunity that comes to us and we could get some lift there. But we\u2019re just going to manage supply really tight this quarter. That manifests itself in a short term margin compression, but long term economic benefit by maintaining that supply. So it could be a little better, but we\u2019re managing the business really, really tight this quarter.", "Albert Pimentel", "I think to add on to Pat\u2019s comments there, the marginal profitability for gross margin on the marginal units that we may benefit from with any kind of upside in the quarter definitely would help us to improve the gross margin profile. But again, we\u2019re just modeling the outlook based on a somewhat cautious TAM I guess for lack of a better description.", "Steve Luczo", "So we probably have time for just a couple of more questions before market opens, we want to be respectful of that.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.", "Katy Huberty", "In the context of the flat TAM for the June quarter, can you just talk about what you\u2019re expecting for PCs versus enterprise versus cloud sequentially and then just your thoughts on Win 10 in the back half and how that impacts PC\u2019s seasonality this year?", "Steve Luczo", "I think actually all of the different markets seem to be at least as we\u2019re managing going into the quarter flat. I think where there is opportunity for the upside is probably on the PC side, depending again on the OEM\u2019s confidence about back to school pool, which I think they\u2019ll start deciding probably in the month of June. I think my guess is they probably got their build plans pretty set for April and May and June with one level of expectation about back to school which they\u2019re obviously going to prepare for.", "And then I think if there\u2019s some shift in terms of what the macro conditions are, whether or not that\u2019s global or just more confidence about what\u2019s happening in the US, then you could see acceleration in June. So I think on the client side and maybe that\u2019s mostly a notebook comment, I think that\u2019s where there is some opportunity for something beyond flat.", "There was also lot of inventory and supply chain adjustments in the March quarter that we don\u2019t have perfect visibility on, but it\u2019s pretty clear that the OEMs drew down inventories and limited their production. So this quarter, they probably have to catch up on the production side to meet even a flat demand or I guess maybe even imply a slight growth. So we\u2019re watching that closely.", "As indicated on the Nearline side, it\u2019s really just a function of where are the big cloud service providers are in their capital deployment plans. Most as we would see it though, the acceleration is probably more in the September and the December quarter. And whether or not they pull anything into the June quarter just to smooth out that pool in September and December is I think where the opportunity might be there. And I think the other markets are relatively flat.", "Katy Huberty", "So is it fair to say your guidance does not assume a pickup in PCs in the month of June and that would be largely upside versus the guidance you provided?", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, that\u2019s correct.", "Katy Huberty", "And then just Win 10 in the back half and how that impacts seasonality?", "Steve Luczo", "It should benefit it, but it seems to be a bit of unknown right now in terms of the timing. One more question and we should probably let everybody get to work.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from the line of Monika Garg of Pacific Crest Securities.", "Monika Garg", "First question on the \u2013 could you talk about the visibility like your comment suggest that you expect pickup in demand for some hyperscale customers back half of calendar 2015, just wanted to check out those views.", "Steve Luczo", "So Monika you just want a view of the visibility from the customers, just want to make sure on hyperscale?", "Monika Garg", "Yeah, hyperscale customers, and do you expect pickup in demand in the back of calendar 2015?", "Albert Pimentel", "Yes. As Steve mentioned that hyperscale, the major global hyperscale service providers are all pretty strong in their dialog about their capital expansion in the second half of the year. And the question I think was posed earlier as to how do we see the June quarter and that\u2019s really \u2013 the opportunity is that the hyperscale providers accelerate their purchasing and start in like the June month, that\u2019s an opportunity for us to service, but we\u2019re trying to again maintain a cautious demeanor for the June quarter. But certainly, hyperscale providers present a very strong opportunity as we go into the back half of the year for sure.", "Steve Luczo", "Long lead signals for us would point towards at least 60/40 split second half to first half in terms of the exabytes they\u2019re demanding and for some it\u2019s even greater. So again, it seems to be one of the phases where they\u2019re going to deploy pretty heavily and then they wait and fill it up and then they deploy again. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing right now. That\u2019s obviously a function of their data growth needs, macro conditions, but right now that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re seeing, 60/40 or even a touch more.", "Monika Garg", "Just to follow, if my memory serves right, enterprise\u2026", "Steve Luczo", "We should wrap it up, we\u2019re at the market open. So we want to thank everyone for participating and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Okay, great, thanks everybody.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

My name is Kaley, and I will be your coordinator today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Kate Scolnick, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, Kate.", "Kate Scolnick - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call. Joining me today from Seagate's executive team are Steve Luczo, Chairman and CEO; Dave Morton, Executive Vice President and CFO; Dave Mosley, President, Operations and Technology; Rocky Pimentel, President, Global Markets and Customers; Phil Brace, President, Cloud Systems and Electronic Solutions; and Pat O'Malley, Executive Vice President.", "We've posted our press release and detailed supplemental information about our first fiscal quarter 2016 on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com. During today's call we will review the highlights for the quarter, provide the company outlook for the second fiscal quarter 2016, and then open the call for questions.", "We will refer to non-GAAP measures on this call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our supplemental information available on the investor section of our website. We are planning for the call today to go approximately half an hour, and we will do our best to accommodate your questions in that timeframe.", "As a reminder this conference call contains forward-looking statements about the company's anticipated future operating and financial performance, customer demand, and general market conditions. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current views and assumptions and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date. Actual results may vary materially from today's statements. Information concerning risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause results to differ from these forward-looking statements are contained in the company's SEC filings and supplemental information posted on the investor section of the company's website at seagate.com.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Luczo. Please go ahead, Steve.", "Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. The first fiscal quarter 2016 Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion. And on a non-GAAP basis gross margins of 24.2%, net income of $165 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.54. Overall shipments for the September quarter were 55.6 exabytes, up 7% sequentially, with the average capacity per drive over 1.1 terabytes per drive.", "As we stated in our pre-announcement there were intra-quarter demand developments that brought our revenue in at the lower end of our forecasted range and impacted the profitability contribution of our HDD portfolio to corporate margins by approximately 300 basis points.", "While the September quarter nearline and enterprise demand was marginally lower than expected in terms of both units and exabytes, we believe Seagate's CSP and OEM customer base is more highly concentrated than the competitors, and therefore has a high degree \u2013 higher degree of volatility. This dynamic led to a negative impact on Seagate in the September quarter, resulting in lower mix, higher inventory carry, and reduced absorption, impacting the corporate gross margin by approximately 190 basis points.", "The company needs to further leverage its technical leadership across its product offering to address the broader market opportunity and needs more active engagement with these customers on the sales and technical side. These issues are being addressed and progress will be achieved over the next two quarters to three quarters.", "In addition we saw upside in 2.5-inch notebook and gaming client applications, which have margins at the lower end of our product portfolio. The lower margin contribution from the portfolio shipped in volumes impacted the corporate margin by approximately 110 basis points. While we are disappointed in our overall corporate margin results for the September quarter, we believe we have a path to sequential margin improvement that I will cover in our December quarter outlook.", "Non-GAAP operating expenses were $501 million, down 9% year over year, reflecting expense control around the core business, adjacencies, restructuring activities, and lower variable compensation. Drive inventory levels increased by approximately $160 million sequentially, due primarily to the increase in finished goods from our enterprise products. Capital expenditures were in line with our expectations.", "In the September quarter we had strong cash flow from operations of $824 million and free cash flow of $615 million. We effectively executed on our long-term capital allocation goals for the shareholders and redeemed approximately 20 million shares in the September quarter, reducing our outstanding shares down to 299 million shares. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents.", "There are a few developments from the last few weeks that are meaningful to Seagate that I'd like to provide some additional context. We closed our acquisition of Dot Hill on October 6, and we have begun integrating the business into our Cloud Systems and Solution business. We are pleased to have the Dot Hill team on board and believe the expansion of our Cloud Systems and Solutions product portfolio will enable us to better serve our storage OEM customers and further leverage our core storage technology expertise.", "On October 22 we were notified by China's Ministry of Commerce that the company can now integrate Samsung's hard disk drive business completely into Seagate. This now allows us to move forward in our plans to consolidate our product portfolio, leverage go-to-market synergies, broaden sales coverage, and optimize design centers. All of these activities will benefit our customers.", "At our board meeting last week we approved a 17% increase in our dividend payment, raising our annual rate to $2.52 per share. This dividend raise reflects the confidence we have in the future cash flows of our business and fulfills our goal to increase our dividend by at least 10% for the fiscal year. Our capital return to shareholders remains a top priority at Seagate, and we continue to balance the effective investment in our technology portfolio with shareholder returns and within an investment grade framework.", "Turning to our business outlook. We believe the overall storage market demand will continue to be relatively flat in the December quarter. This includes some slight uptick in enterprise nearline exabyte demand and seasonal declines in the client and gaming markets. For the December quarter, we are planning for revenues to be between $2.9 billion and $3 billion, and we are forecasting operating expense to continue to decline to approximately $485 million in the December quarter. We plan to exit fiscal year 2016 with operating expenses of $460 million per quarter, including Samsung integration synergies and the acquisition of Dot Hill.", "Under these assumptions, we will reduce our fiscal non-GAAP year-over-year spend by approximately 12%. Our non-GAAP gross margins should be sequentially improved with mix, new product offerings, and absorption costs benefit to approximately 25.5% to 26%. As enterprise exabyte demand continues to grow at 35%, along with our ability to monetize the demand with our product offerings, we believe we will be back in our targeted margin range of 27% to 32% by the June quarter.", "Before we open up for the questions I would like to highlight the promotion of Dave Morton to Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Seagate. With over 20 years at the company, Dave is already a very active contributor of our management team. And the board and I are confident in his abilities to continue to provide effective leadership and financial stewardship for Seagate.", "I also thank Pat O'Malley for his 7 years of service in the CFO role and over 25 years of contributions at Seagate. Under Pat's leadership we have refined our effective and resilient financial model, executed a very good track record on total shareholder return and return on invested capital, and strengthened our balance sheet. I'm very pleased Pat will be continuing his career at Seagate in an Executive Vice President role, reporting to me and working on a number of strategic initiatives.", "I would like to thank our customers, suppliers, and employees for their continued support. And we're now ready for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham and Company. Your line is open.", "Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Good morning. Two questions. First, when it comes to the high cap in nearline and enterprise for that matter, can you just talk about where you are for the PMR and the shingle version? And what your thoughts are on timing for the 10 terabyte helium? And then as a follow-up I know that there's some software changes that some of the customers have to do to be able to hit those capacity points in their systems. If you have any thoughts on the adoption rate once you get to those points.", "William David Mosley - President, Operations & Technology", "Hi, Rich, this is Dave.", "Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC", "Hi, Dave.", "William David Mosley - President, Operations & Technology", "First off all, start with the shingle version. The volume for that is an archive market only. The volume's small, but the traction has been pretty good, that's 8 terabyte. The other 8 terabyte \u2013 I'll call it workhorse drive \u2013 is really a high-performance nearline drive. And we're quite happy with the way it has proceeded through quals and built up its quality and so on and so forth in the ramp. So we're right on plan for that per earlier discussions.", "And relative to 10 terabyte, realistically we said we'd be introducing helium at 10 terabyte I think in the last call. We're still on plan for that. It'll happen in the first two calendar quarters. The ramp will be pretty slow, because that's bleeding edge areal density, but we're pretty excited about that product next year.", "Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then you don't see the software issue as an adoption hurdle?", "William David Mosley - President, Operations & Technology", "For shingle there's a difference between \u2013 if that's what you're referring to \u2013 there's a difference between the drive aware and host aware. So our drives today are drive aware. But the industry is going through a transition, which I think is what you're referencing, which is host aware. That's where the customer side has to go modify some of their software to be able to adopt it. And there's industry consortiums that are helping shuttle that thing along. I think we're right on the cusp as an industry of going through that transition, but we haven't shipped any of that product yet. Just test units.", "Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then just lastly, Steve, at a \u2013 if you have any thoughts big picture on the SSD market, your positioning and your relationship with Micron in the wake of WD/SanDisk?", "Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well look. We've said for a while that we view these markets as more complementary than competitive. We've struck relationships with the companies that we view are the ones that are either technical leaders and/or low-cost leaders and/or have the broadest technology and/or are furthest along in transition to next generation of technology. None of those are really reflected by the WD [Western Digital] target. So our engagement will continue to be with companies that fit that profile. Micron is certainly the one that we've publicly discussed the activities that we're undertaking together. And that relationship continues to be very positive. We're happy with the engagement that we've had.", "And there's kind of multiple threads of leveraging the joint technology between Seagate and Micron at the product level. And of course a lot of that falls under Phil's domain. I don't know, Phil, if you want to provide any additional color that -where we're at versus what we've said to date? But so far, Rich, we're pretty happy with where we stand. And we have similar potential engagement with other leaders in the flash space.", "Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC", "Excellent. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah, thanks. A couple questions if I can as well. So first of all just curious when you look at the model now with the Dot Hill transaction closed, how do we think about that in terms of current expectations for the current quarter? And can you just touch on \u2013 by my model it appears that you had a decline both sequentially and year over year in your non-hard disk drive business. And then I do have a real quick follow-up.", "Philip G. Brace - President-Cloud Systems & Electronics Solutions", "This is Phil Brace. No, so far I guess the model going forward, we're pleased with the integration going to date. Today I would say that in aggregate, the model is probably underneath the corporate gross margins. Our obviously target is to actually get it above that from this point of view. Yeah, previous financials at Dot Hill had it above it, so you would see us kind of integrating that and moving in that direction long term. On a year-over-year perspective I think we were up year over year, quarter to quarter. So I'm not sure. Other models we were up pretty strong year on year on both the system side and the flash side.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then as a real quick follow-up, I'm just curious with the moving dynamics that shows up in your working capital this quarter, and obviously being a driver of the free cash flow generation, how do we think about your free cash flow? How does the company think about the free cash flow generation from the model, as we look forward on a annualized basis?", "David H. Morton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hi, Aaron, it's Dave. We continue to work down our needs for our working capital as you can see, through our stronger sales linearity this past quarter. A lot of our DSOs had improved. We got some benefit from our DPOs as well. And we're going to continue to monetize what we can out of our turns and inventory. So we continue to be very thoughtful with a discerning eye on how we view that aspect of our business.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "So to be clear, you think you sustain this kind of cash conversion cycle level going forward?", "David H. Morton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Your line is open.", "Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC", "Thanks. Also on the non-hard drive business. give us some reasonable expectation of a revenue run rate. I mean based on the numbers you provide, and granted they're rounded, you're at $165 million last quarter give or take. So what kind of opportunity should investors expect over the coming, let's say over fiscal 2016? Where can you get?", "Philip G. Brace - President-Cloud Systems & Electronics Solutions", "Sorry, could you repeat the question? Sorry, I missed the question.", "Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC", "That's okay. I'm just looking for a reasonable expectation of a revenue run rate for the non-hard drive business going forward, now that Dot Hill is in the mix. Would a stretch goal, a reasonable goal, where can you get the quarterly run rate by let's say exiting 2016?", "Philip G. Brace - President-Cloud Systems & Electronics Solutions", "Yeah. I think exiting 2016 you'd see us kind of on the $200 million to $250 million a quarter kind of run rate, tracking to plus $1 billion-plus dollars a year, kind of in that vector.", "Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay, thanks. And then maybe on the hard drive TAM. Anything you could talk about for the first half of the year beyond the current quarter here? Do you expect where we sit today to see the large seasonal decline in March? Or like some have talked about previously, could the decline be a little bit more muted this year?", "Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. It's hard to say just given kind of the lack of traction that's developed even in the second half of the year. And again our view is probably is narrower than it should be. And it's not often that the CSP base in particular doesn't engage for more than three or four quarters. And we're kind of on the outer end of that dimension right now. So we'd expect at some point here that there'd be a capital cycle that would improve. For us I think it's as much as broadening the customer base. Some of that is product related and some of it is just engagement related. So that's opportunity in front of us I think regardless of whether or not there's a market acceleration.", "But the fact that the second half of the year didn't develop the way I think the industry expected it would, I think that does probably say at some point there's going to be a capital cycle up. And right now we don't have any signals that say it's going to be in the first half of the year, but we don't have any that say that it's not either. So I think a lot of it just depends on what happens through December. And then the people start letting contracts. As you know it's still, it's a cyclical business that's highly concentrated. And until there's more diversity in that customer set, it's going to kind of have an ebb and flow that can be challenging like it was for this quarter for us.", "Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC", "Makes sense. Thanks, Steve.", "Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi, thank you. I think, Steve, you said that you expect to get back to your gross margin targets within the year over the next couple of quarters. I think you said the June quarter next year. Can you walk us through the steps that help you get to that? How much does MOFCOM add? How much does the improvement in the mix related to the storage business add? And then how do the cost cuts help?", "Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well the biggest thing clearly is better traction on our higher capacity nearline and mission critical drives. That's the bulk of what hurt us last quarter. I mean again reading some of the analysts' and other industry observers' work, I don't think there's still a great understanding about the leverage that's in the manufacturing system, especially on these enterprise drives, we're absorbing as many heads and discs and test time as we are.", "So unit misses in the 500,000-unit range, while they don't sound big relative to a 45 million or 50 million shipment, they are. And especially obviously at the margin when the cost has been completely absorbed. And of course those are decent price points, but they're obviously \u2013 they're good margin products to begin with. But obviously if they're already built and sitting in inventory, then they're really good margin products.", "And you can see from our inventory uptick of $160 million, that translating into revenue accounts for a couple hundred basis points of gross margin. So clearing through that inventory in a responsible way is going to take a couple of quarters. And as we do that then we're going to see a more regular trend back to overall gross margin that we expect to deliver.", "The other thing about that is, it kind of may feel like a big surprise. But the other reality is the industry moves a lot of drives in the last 2 weeks of the quarter. And really with a week to go in this quarter, we could have still delivered the gross margin that we should have. And it was just basically not executing or not having customers take the drives that we thought they were going to take. So that being the case we're hoping that we can get those drives moving. And again in a reasonable way sooner rather than later, so that we can get back to the margin model that that piece of the business delivers.", "I think in terms of the incremental margin improvement of Phil's business, we really have I think a nice path of saying, where we're at today from a gross margin and an operating margin perspective to make sequential quarter improvements in the direction that Phil talked about. And ultimately we do believe that at the gross margin level it's accretive to the range and certainly to the midpoint of the range. So I think that certainly will help. And then another big hunk of it as you pointed out is operating expense control. Like we said we think that we can still take another $20 million out of that number, which is as you know two quarters ago was on its way to $580 million. So to get down to $460 million, we feel pretty good about.", "So I think it's a combination of all three. It's all stuff that's right in front of us. It's for us to execute against. The trickiest stuff is frankly finding those customers that are taking those higher capacity drives. And for the customers that we do engage with understanding how we can get a better mix, because clearly right now we're not getting the mix that we should.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay that's helpful. Just to follow up how much does MOFCOM add in terms of margin benefit? And then as a clarification what share count should we use next quarter? Is it the 299 million? Or is it slightly above that, because of the diluted shares? Thanks.", "Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I'll let Morton figure that out. The MOFCOM thing, it's hard to answer the question. For us of course if you just looked at it from a synergy perspective on \"OpEx,\" as you know we were basically maintaining a separate go-to-market organization for that. It wasn't a huge go-to-market organization.", "So the synergies isn't so much immediately OpEx related. There will be some. There may be some OpEx related in that we were moving a lot of units, over 10 million units, with a pretty lean organization. And we are actually kind of reverse engineering that to saying, how can we take advantage of \"the Seagate operation\" to maybe look more like that? So actually the synergies may effectively come from reduction in Seagate OpEx, as opposed to the apparent reduction in the small single digit millions of dollars that we were spending on the Samsung side.", "I think the other big piece is revenue synergies. I mean clearly now that product line is the highest areal density product in the industry. It has been for a couple of years. And we can now broaden that to the broader Seagate sales force. I think there's going to be some nice revenue synergies from that.", "And then the other big synergy that's an OpEx synergy, but I can't tell you and it's going to save this many dollars, is that design center, which is a very competent design center, is now free to design products that don't have to be subject to the hold separate. And so that allows us basically to start putting products into that design center or having products come out of that design center that aren't going to be limited to the Samsung sales force. And so in that sense there's nice operating leverage, because a design center is an expensive thing to keep. And so having a broader portfolio come out of that we think is beneficial.", "So net-net we think it basically drives better revenue opportunity, clearly better margin opportunity as we mix across the portfolio. And then better operating margin, because the more efficient dynamic on the design center as well as the go-to-market side.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks.", "David H. Morton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And, Sherri, this is Dave. Just a quick follow-up. Please use 304 million shares for your fully diluted EPS calculation.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC. Your line is open.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks, good morning, guys. Two questions for me as well. Dave, I just want to go back to Aaron's questions on the cash conversion cycle. Very specifically though could you talk to the DPOs? Those expanded pretty materially this quarter. What did you guys do differently I guess to get to 77 days there? And how can you sustain that?", "David H. Morton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "If you go and compare to where we were running kind of under the averages, both between us and our competitor down south, it was just a higher activity in and around of how we manage our working capital. There was nothing being done outside of anything with our normal terms. It was just we got very, very critical. Plus we also had a lot of strong linearity in and around the quarter, which suited us well versus the previous quarter. So that's where we see those upticks.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Got it. And then I guess as a follow-up given the transition or the acquisition Western Digital is going through with SanDisk, I'm curious. Do you think it creates an opportunity for Seagate to perhaps increase their market share in select markets, ideally enterprise, given the fact that your largest competitor may be a little bit more distracted as you go forward?", "Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. It's not the distraction that I think is the opportunity. It's the kind of the overall transaction. Because when you kind of go through it, it's a $10 billion premium to the 90-day average. 35 times earnings for a company that hasn't had earnings growth in 5 years, actually has earnings decline in 5 years. Isn't a technical or cost leader. And you're going to finance it with $18 billion of debt, which means you have to somehow have big OpEx cuts, because there's not enough SG&A to pay for that. Wouldn't appear to be enough revenue synergies, because it's not a competitive technology relative to the leaders. So it's going to come down to engineering cuts.", "So I think that's the opportunity. It's not so much the distraction. Maybe there's a distraction, maybe there isn't. But the reality is in order to make that model work, there's going to have to be OpEx cuts to pay back that huge debt load. Or you never build in another fab. And this is just an industry where, whether or not it's the flash side or the HDD side, massive cuts in R&D doesn't seem smart. But for us it's good. So I think the opportunity is make sure \u2013 look. Seagate feels great about where we're at technically. We don't obviously feel great about having the broadest portfolio that we need. And we need to address that. But the good news is we have the technical leadership to do that.", "So we'll keep pressing that case. That's I think what's going to translate into the market opportunity, whether or not it's the enterprise level or the client level or the nearline level. And I do think that that transaction gives us an opportunity, just because the OpEx side of their business is going to be challenged to pay back all that debt.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Perfect, thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you.", "Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in. Since no one has asked about the PC market specifically, I was just curious if we could get your thoughts on how it looks maybe even into the middle of next year. And then just very quick, Dave, just on the OpEx exiting this fiscal year, does that put you guys at a sort of a normalized or a comfortable level with OpEx? Or do you think there's more that you could do, depending on where, based on what you see about growth in the markets going forward? Thanks.", "Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think on the PC market it feels \u2013 it's kind of always hard to tell where you're getting traction or not, especially when the gaming stuff comes in and out as much as it does. But it feels like the PC market has kind of found its space. And that there's probably a little bit of traction for some marginal growth.", "I think with respect to Seagate, kind of gets back to the technical point, we are excited about the product portfolio that we're about to roll. We do think when you transition to kind of 1 terabyte and 2 terabyte products, that's compelling for those client based systems that actually do need onboard storage. And of course we can do that in the form factors that fit into the new thin and light notebooks.", "So I think we're kind of \u2013 we're I think \u2013 look. I think Seagate has always been a little bit more bullish on client than maybe others. And I think within that segment we feel that we're particularly well aligned. And maybe again that's a reflection of the fact that we're very OEM concentrated. And we feel good about lining up with what the OEMs need in that space. So I feel okay about the client space going forward.", "And as you know I'm more encouraged also that there's some client that goes beyond what we're calling a client today. And I still think those opportunities continue to open up. And they're going to need 1 terabyte and 2 terabytes and 4 terabytes of data.", "By the way same could be said about the branded market. We've got a nice 4 terabyte market product out there right now, and we're gaining traction with it. And we continue to believe that the direct attached storage business will be quite good on the client side, especially as people skinny down on what they have on board.", "David H. Morton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And then in regards to the modeling question, exiting in FY 2016 at a $460 million non-GAAP run rate for OpEx. I think that's fair to continue on that trajectory. Obviously we continue to evaluate in how we monetize our OpEx investments in and around the specific workloads that we deliver to our customers.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Great, thank you very much.", "Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "All right thanks, everyone. We're going to work hard to gain back some credibility here. And we appreciate you being on the call today. Look forward to talking to you next quarter.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Kate Scolnick, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, Kate.", "Kate Scolnick", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone and welcome to today's call. Joining me today from Seagate's executive team are Steve Luczo, Chairman and CEO, Dave Morton, Executive Vice President and CFO, Dave Mosley, President, Operations and Technology and Phil Brace, President, Cloud Systems and Silicon Group.", "We have posted our press release and detailed supplemental information about our second fiscal quarter 2016 on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com. During today's call, we will review the highlights for the quarter, provide the company outlook for the third fiscal quarter 2016 and then open the call for questions.", "We will refer to non-GAAP measures on this call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures on our supplemental information available on the Investor section of our website.

Please go ahead, Steve.", "Steve Luczo", "Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. Our second fiscal quarter results reflect in line performance in revenues and margins and outperformance on the committed cost control measures. For the December quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $3 billion and on a non-GAAP basis gross margin of 25.6%, net income of $246 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.82.", "Our HDD exabyte shipments for the December quarter were 60.6 exabytes, up 10% sequentially. Within this, enterprise exabyte shipments were up 21% sequentially, reflecting strong demand for our high-capacity enterprise products. Average capacity per enterprise drive was a new record of 2.2 terabytes, up 15% year-over-year.", "Non-GAAP operating expenses in the December quarter were $453 million. On a year-over-year basis, we have reduced a quarterly expense run rate by almost $100 million or 17% reflecting reductions around the core business, adjacencies, restructuring activities and lower variable compensation. Overall inventory levels were down 5% with improved linearity and capital expenditures were in line with our expectations.", "Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was $382 million and free cash flow was $245 million, equating to free cash flow of $0.81 per diluted share. Fiscal year to-date, we have generated $1.2 billion in cash flow from operations and forecast cash flow from operations to be approximately $500 million for the March quarter.", "Our capital returned to shareholders remains a top priority at Seagate and we continue to balance the effective investment in our storage technology portfolio with shareholder returns and within an investment grade framework. There has been no change to our capital allocation policy and our dividend payout of $188 million a quarter works comfortably within our cash flow generation forecast.", "We have redeemed 23 million shares fiscal year to-date and considering the macro economic empowerment and investor sentiment, we view the stock as being attractive at these levels. Our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 296 million shares outstanding.", "Our debt structure and level of interest expense is manageable, particularly in light of whatever technology companies have done and/or are planning to do in the public markets. Seagate is focused on maximizing our opportunities in areas of the storage market that will position us to grow our topline, optimize the value of our core technology, continue to generate strong cash flow and create value for shareholders.", "Our specific areas of near-term activity for Seagate's management team are around our product portfolio monetization, operational efficiencies and continued financial discipline. Throughout the decades of storage technology innovation at Seagate, we have maintained a high priority on investing in R&D and acquiring the right assets to provide the most reliable, cost-effective and workload optimized storage products for customers.", "Market demand for storages across multiple forms and locations, including on-premise for performance, in the cloud for availability and directly on purpose built and market devices. We have many new products designed for these different workloads, including HDDs, cloud systems and flash technology products.", "In the nearline market, we have begun the initial ramp of our 10 terabyte Helium product and we are shipping our eight terabyte conventional products in high volume. We continue to believe high capacity enterprise demand will grow in calendar 2016 and our portfolio improvements position us well for full participation in this market.", "Surveillance and video applications are growing rapidly and they are seeing strong demand for our products specifically designed for these workloads. Our retail, gaming and client offerings are continuing to move to higher capacity points and are benefiting from the recent launch of products with industry leading areal density.", "In October, we acquired Dot Hill Systems for our cloud systems business and later in the quarter, the divestiture sale of EVault was announced. We believe this strategy positions us to leverage a broader storage systems and all flash array portfolio across a more focused set of storage OEM customers and channel partners. In addition, our ClusterStor high-performance compute end-to-end system solutions continue to gain traction in a high performance compute market and we are excited about several vertical market opportunities we are targeting with our channel partners.", "We recently announced products at the Supercomputing 15 show. That included a workload optimization HPC drive, emphasizing our direction to create solutions using all elements of Seagate's portfolio. Seagate's flash technology product portfolio has grown significantly over the last two years and includes enterprise SAS SSDs, PCIe accelerator cards, SATA controllers, all flash arrays and hybrid HDDs. In December, we had strong quarter in our PCIe business and we announced sampling of or PCIe and VME product set. Our enterprise SAS SSD qualification activities continue to be on track and are in evaluations with multiple customers.", "Combined, we are planning for our cloud storage systems and silicon business to exit fiscal year 2016 at a revenue run rate of over $1 billion a year. This will position us for continued success and profitability in fiscal year 2017, as several areas of these markets are projected to grow double digits over the next few years. Through the expansion of our HDD portfolio and new business adjacencies, we are having success in broadening our global hyperscale customer base and strengthening our channel partners.", "To best serve our customers and improve operational efficiencies within our marketplace and functions, we announced in January the alignment of our global markets and customers organization under Dave Mosley. We thank Rocky Pimental for his leadership of our sales and marketing organization and we will continue to benefit from his strategic insights in his role as an Executive Vice President. Personally, I am looking forward to working with our executive team over the next several years as we continue to lead Seagate in serving growing global customer base, expanding our storage portfolio, striking our competitive position and optimizing our business for continued financial performance.", "Turning to our business outlook. In the last several quarters, we have discussed our concerns over global economic conditions, particularly in Europe and China, which have proven accurate and we believe will persist at least through June this calendar year. While we are cognizant of the ongoing challenges of the macroeconomic environment, the IT transformational shifts presents significant opportunities for us to continue to be a leader in core storage technology and deliver value to shareholders.", "As we align our storage product portfolio to capitalize upon these market dynamics, our revenue opportunities are shifting with hyperscale customers continuing to drive strong exabyte growth with capital expenditure compounded annual growth rates of 40%. At the same time, our exposure to the traditional PC client market is changing and now represents less than 35% of total revenue.", "In light of these macro conditions and technology shifts, we took purposeful and thoughtful action last year to reduce our operating expenses and evaluated areas where investments were not paying off, resulting in measurable operating expense reduction and cost control implementation across our business. Taking into account macroeconomic factors, we believe overall storage market demand will be seasonally down in the March quarter which has ranged between 5% and 10% over the last five years. We are planning for revenues to be approximately $2.7 billion, which reflects the high end of the seasonal demand trend and operating expenses to be sequentially flat.", "We are forecasting cash flow from operations for the March quarter to be sequentially higher at approximately $500 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP gross margins will be sequentially flat in the March quarter and ongoing activities that will improve our profitability, including raising prices in certain markets, aggressive product transitions and internal and external supply chain optimization such as reducing manufacturing capacity. Based on these factors and expected growth in the nearline storage market, we still expect that our gross margins will be in our target range of 27% to 32% for the June quarter.", "I would like to thank our customers, suppliers and employees for their continued support as well as our shareholders and are now ready for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Sherri Scribner", "Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to dig a little bit into the gross margin improvement. You guys did a good job on managing that this quarter. How much of that was driven by the ramp of your eight terabyte drives and a more positive mix in your business? And how much of that was related to cost reduction actions?", "Dave Mosley", "Hi, Sherri. We are taking aggressive cost reduction actions, but the ramp of the nearline products and re-equilibrating versus what we saw in Q1 was pretty substantial. Nearline went up about 11% in exabytes quarter-over-quarter. That's 18% year-over-year and a lot of that is being driven by sixes and eights moving hard and we will continue that into this quarter as well. So it's pretty profound there.", "Sherri Scribner", "And then maybe could I ask a quick question on the capacity business and the hyperscale business. How do you see that ramping over with the year? I know that you have talked about strong build plans from the cloud providers, but I wanted to get a sense of what you are seeing now? Thanks.", "Dave Mosley", "We still believe that some of the cloud service providers are in hold back mode. There is lot of diversity in the Tier 2 buildout, but there are still people there with their capital budgets that are fairly conservative through this time. So we do see that in the back half of this year, some of them will come back into, not only scale out but also refresh of their existing data centers as well.", "Sherri Scribner", "Thank you.", "Steve Luczo", "Sherri, just to further point out what Dave said, so the cost actions really in terms of how they impact COGS are really in the quarters to come more so than the improvement in the last quarter. That was more related, again, to mix and introducing some of these new products that are higher traction on the eight TB, but I think in terms of the margin improvement we see going forward we are pretty encouraged by what we see in terms of the cost actions related to capacity and supply chain optimization that will impact COGS going through rest of the calendar year.", "Sherri Scribner", "Great. Thanks, Steve.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Co. Your line is open.", "Rich Kugele", "Thank you. Good morning and congratulations actually in a tough environment. Maybe first, let's take a bigger picture view. With all the puts and takes competitively, some people are concerned about the overall drive business health. What do you see now competitively with the Seagate/WD transaction? And even the potential Toshiba's exit in the space? And then I have a follow-up.", "Dave Mosley", "Well, I guess a couple of answers, Rich. I think in terms of the macro view on the industry, I still think the investing world is not quite grasping. The transition is around where storage is being stored. It's locale of the storage, just not the amount of what's being stored that's basically shifting and those are architectural implications. And architectural implications are actually enhancing the application. So it's feeding off of one another, but from every source of data that we have, we still have 95% to 98% of your bits are ultimately being stored on a disk drive or more.", "As you know, cloud infrastructures usually replicate. So even though there is a reduced number of drives being in the client, the data being generated by the client is still ultimately stored on a disk drive. And as it turns out, it's exactly stored in a disk drive that is harder to make and takes more absorption in the factories in terms of number of heads and disk and the content in those heads and disk is quit a bit higher. So, from a manufacturer's perspective, it's a good thing because you are getting more absorption.", "That being said, there is a lot of growth in the silicon related pieces of the business, not at the expense of the HDD business per se and that's an area that we are serious about obviously. We are building what we think is a very good business, both at the systems level and the device level. And it stands what we do with HDDs as well as how we incorporate various levels of silicon, all way up to all-flash arrays and other devices. So we like the overall storage business and we particularly like the fact that we think that the HDD business itself is going to benefit from the continued trend of more people being more connected, generating richer content.", "So I think, to that point, when you look at the competitive aspects, the WD, SanDisk transaction is interesting on one level that it certainly is a huge endorsement of the HDD industry, because in order to pay back anywhere from $20 billion to $30 billion over seven to 10 years just for the debt, that has to come from the HDD business, because the flash business obviously has its own capital needs that are becoming more substantial because the technology shift they are facing.", "So I think that's a big endorsement of, if WD can generate $20 billion, $30 billion over 10 years just to pay back debt and then you have to do capital and things on top of it, that sounds like a pretty good industry. And it's an industry that we think we are ahead technically, but if you want to say we are equal, that's fine. But it's also one that we are entirely focused now and we are not be cutting R&D.", "And so when I look at the transaction, I do think it's tough to 40 times earnings for a company and finance it all with debt. I do think that the interest expense on that transaction is obviously 2X what it should have been or what was maybe expected to be six months ago. And it fell to us, like the operating expense reduction side of $1 billion were aggressive in light of the fact there is only $4 billion of OpEx to begin with and we have always viewed WD as a pretty lean organization.", "So to say that there is $1 billion coming out of that business, that may be true but then some of it has got to be coming out of R&D. And that's not what we are doing. And so we believe investing in your core technology when at the product level and then on top of it there is this technology shift that as it does relate to our silicon business, we want to make sure that we have access to the best silicon technology and as we stack up the various players, you have Samsung as the clear leader, both in terms of capital and technology. They have announced their third fab, $17 billion, thank you, in 3D.", "Hynix is doing great in 3D and we have good dialogue with them. Micron and Intel, leading with 3D XPoint. And 3D XPoint, of course Micron is a planar technology company as well. So we think our engagement with those companies which is quite active provides us access to the technology that we need to pursue our silicon strategy. And we do think that the recent shift in Toshiba's position on what they can do with planar does raise questions of how are they going to compete with companies that have two to 10 times the capital budgets. So we feel pretty good about the industry and we certainly feel about our relative position.", "Rich Kugele", "Excellent. Just one follow-up. In terms of, obviously with the dividend yield now north of 9%, people are concerned supposedly on your cash flow and your ability to continue to pay the dividend. Do you believe that your cost cutting actions that you have implemented and I guess will be finished by June, that you will be able to have that more than $1 billion in cash flow annually and be able to fully fund that dividend?", "Steve Luczo", "Yes. As I cited in the opening remarks, Rich, that our cash flow relative to our dividend payment is not concern for us at all.", "Rich Kugele", "Excellent. All right. Thank you very much.", "Steve Luczo", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Mark Moskowitz", "Yes. Thank you. Good Morning. Two questions, if I could. Steve, can you talk a little more about your exabyte trend line? It was down about 7% in the September quarter, roughly flat for December? Should we anticipate, just getting from your comments, around improvement and targeting higher cap, especially 10 terabyte, that we can see exabyte starting to actually grow in the first half of calendar 2016? And then kind of a follow-up part two of my question is that partly why you are saying you will raise pricing? Or is that comment more around like-for-like pricing and not pricing going up because of new schemes?", "Steve Luczo", "Yes. Let me answer your back question and then I may direct you to an offline discussion so we may have debate about growth rates. But the pricing is like-for-like in certain rate market rises .We are not talking mix. We are talking about prices that have to address the value of the products in a lot of the client space, it's just ridiculous. And I think I made this statement a year ago that the industry was not serving itself by subsidizing client products by trying sell more nearline products just say within the margin range, because this day would come that you don't have any room left. And I think now the industry is recognizing it. Whether or not you are making 10 points of margin on the client or five points, it is nowhere near 20 which is what some people cited and that's nowhere near what you need to basically fund the technology going forward. So there is going to have to be adjustments on the client side to reflect what we do.", "So the price, I think, goes across certain markets and it's like-for-like. We show 10% growth sequentially in exabyte shipments for us, up to 60.6 exabytes. So I am not sure where that information is coming from that you are referencing. So instead of wasting time here --", "Mark Moskowitz", "I am talking year-over-year --", "Steve Luczo", "So instead of talking about it on this call, because we see growth in exabytes and in the nearline space, I would rather take it offline, because it is going to chew up too much time debating data right now. But as I said in the script, we have 10% up sequentially on exabytes shipped and our enterprise exabytes were up 21%. So we are encouraged by the mix up in the enterprise and in the cloud service providers.", "Mark Moskowitz", "Okay. Yes. I was talking about year-over-year, which pretty much dovetails with your numbers, but it sounds like you definitely feel good about that growth trend line and we can see it continue to be a positive, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes. We do believe that.", "Mark Moskowitz", "Okay. Thank you.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Aaron Rakers", "Yes. Thanks for taking the question. First real quickly I want to go back to Rich's question. I am curious on your thoughts on Toshiba as it relates to the hard disk drive business, given the recent news. And then also I was curious if you could just give us an update on the OpEx. I think in the past you talked about $460 million. Obviously you have done better than that. Is there further OpEx realignment? And then an update to that $460 million level exiting the fiscal year. Thank you.", "Steve Luczo", "I forgot to answer the Toshiba question. Thanks for re-asking it. Yes, I don't know. We can't predict what's going on at Toshiba. We can say that we have noticed a marked decline in their presence in certain markets and maybe part of what Nidec was seeing was reduced from them. We don't know and we actually don't really believe Nidec sees all its orders two weeks into the quarter anyhow. But look, it's obviously a difficult situation at Toshiba at the corporate level and clearly their number one priority is to save the fabs and it doesn't make sense to me that being in the drive business serves that purpose. But what they decide is up to them.", "So if you had asked me where was my gauging of would Toshiba be in the business in the next one to three years today versus where was it six months or a year ago, I am much more towards the end that they are not going to be in this business in the next one to three years, just because I don't how I see how they can be competitively, given where areal density is going and given where manufacturing is and given some of their bigger corporate issues, I just can't imagine that that's where they want to spend their R&D expense or frankly their cash flow.", "Aaron Rakers", "And on the OpEx?", "Dave Morton", "On the OpEx side, Aaron, we did outperform. So we are ahead of where we said we would be and that was for exiting the fiscal year. I think we are happy at this level for now. We don't see a real reason to turn it down from here. We still have some ideas about how we might do that and still protect the product portfolio, but I think we are going to run the rest of the fiscal year at this level. And then we will see how the market develops in the next couple of quarters and see what we have do in FY2017.", "Aaron Rakers", "Okay. Thank you.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes. Again, just to emphasize, Aaron, that's what my point was that we think the next focus of our effort is around issues that impact gross margin.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Your line is open.", "Ananda Baruah", "Hi. Thanks guys. Congrats on a really solid trend in a tough environment as well. Just a quick one for me. Steve, I would love to get your thoughts, again just sort of circling back on application set for flash and for flash storage systems. One of your largest customers, a couple of days ago on their earnings call seemed to make a point of putting more energy around their view that flash, flash based systems are going to increasingly address general application set. Your earlier comments on this call of the 95% to 98%, which I know is probably more of a historically data driven remark, but the way you spoke about it, seems to suggest that you believe that they can stay in that 95% to 98% range. Any sort of nuance being that you have with regards to flash systems and their ability to address general application sets, would love to hear that. Thanks.", "Steve Luczo", "I don't think they are inconsistent. I think you have the opportunity for flash to address general application sets, but the data is still being stored disk drives. It's just a question of what it is moving in and out of. In the old days, it was moving in and out of a CPU. Now it's being staged in different levels of, call it memory or storage, that basically allow for greater and faster processing applied against it. But at the end of the day, that stuff rests on an HDD. So my point was, sure, that layer above is a layer that we want to participate on and through Phil's efforts, we feel we will be quite successful there. But it's not eliminating the fact that bit ends up on a disk drive. In fact, it's going into a disk drive that's a pretty sporty, as Dave would say. It's a nearline drive that has lots of heads and disks and a really complicated VLSI architecture. So those are all things that we get paid for.", "Now, Phil, you want to talk a little bit more about what you are seeing?", "Phil Brace", "Yes. I think that, to echo Steve's comment, where we see a lot of the flash, I would say, is on the new tier, if you will, right. A performance tier that does accelerate things and generally speaking, it's in front of large arrays of storage, large banks of storage. And that's where we see a lot of the growth. And we are investing some of our energy. And it is around that performance area.", "Steve Luczo", "I was going to say, yes, I think in particular, as it relates to the super high performance, super high data rate, data processing applications like petro and some of the other energy applications, that's where our high-performance compute solution has been particularly strong because we really have the fastest system to feed those higher levels of, again, call it storage, call it memory. But somehow you have to have a back end that's serving that thing very well. And we have to be the leader in that space. And that leadership comes through partnerships as well as some great companies like Cray and Teradata and others.", "Ananda Baruah", "Yes. That's great context. I really appreciate it. Thanks a lot.", "Steve Luczo", "Great. Thanks. All right. We should probably have one last question.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have a question from the line of Jayson Noland with Baird. Your line is open.", "Jayson Noland", "Okay. Great. I guess a follow-up to this discussion. With some pressure on performance enterprise drives, 15K specifically and a tailwind in capacity drives, could you talk about your exposure to both? And if there is difference in the gross margin profile? Any significant difference between the two?", "Dave Morton", "This is Dave. No significant difference between the two. I would say that the 15k lines are still in demand. There are still a lot of people pulling, not to the levels that maybe they were historically, but not 50% of what they were historically yet and I think we anticipate a fairly long tail there because it still provides a fairly low cost good value hitting the price band that has got a compelling performance tier. And it's important to note that a lot of places that those drives go today, that cost performance trade-off is really compelling compared to any other solution. Maybe the choke point is somewhere else in the architecture. Now that said, it's a million or 1.5 million drives a quarter and at the scale of Seagate, that's pretty small. So if we redeflect those heads and disks into other boxes, that doesn't really have a material impact on Seagate.", "Jayson Noland", "Okay. Great. Thank you. Congrats on the quarter.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes. Thanks very much.", "Steve Luczo", "Okay. So just to wrap it up again, I guess we will again thank everyone and we look forward to speaking to you after the next quarter.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

My name is Christy and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Kate Scolnick, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, Kate.", "Kate Scolnick", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone and welcome to today's call. Joining me today from Seagate's executive team are Steve Luczo, Chairman and CEO, Dave Morton, Executive Vice President and CFO, Dave Mosley, President, Operations and Technology and Phil Brace, President, Cloud Systems and Silicon Group.", "We have posted our press release and detailed supplemental information about our third fiscal quarter 2016 on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com. During today's call, we will review the highlights for the quarter, provide the company outlook for the fourth fiscal quarter 2016 and then open the call for questions.", "We will refer to non-GAAP measures on this call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures on our supplemental information available on the Investor section of our website.

Please go ahead, Steve.", "Steve Luczo", "Thanks Kate. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. In addition to my usual commentary I have extended the prepared remarks for today's call and I have asked the management team to cover a few aspects of our business as it relates to the March quarter and the position of the company moving forward. We will discuss some of the actions we are taking to align with near-term market realities and to improve the company's profitability and cash flow. ", "First I will cover the high-year level trends I have seen from customers and provide information as the direction we will be taking with the company with respect structure and focus. Dave Morton will then walk through certain financial metrics. Kate Mosley will cover the HDD business particularly with respect to our revolving product portfolio and our close recalls our guidance for the June quarter and our general expectations for the second half of calendar 2016. ", "For the March quarter Seagate achieved revenues of $2.6 billion and a non-GAAP basis gross margin of 23%, net income of $66 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.22. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the March quarter were $39 million reflecting cost controls on lower variable compensation. Overall inventory levels were down 11% sequentially and ended at the lowest cost of finished goods excluding the flood since June 2010. ", "Capital Expenditures of $95 million were in line with our expectations. We believe Seagate's March quarter results are reflective of a generally weak macroeconomic environment as well as accelerating usage shifts of technologies and architectures by end users. Our HDD shipments for the March quarter were $39.2 million units and 55.6 Exabyte's reflecting a seasonally lower than expected overall. In the March quarter we initiated targeted pricing increases across our product line.", "And we were successful in some areas and unsuccessful in other. We continue to believe the industry needs a stable pricing environment to deliver the higher level of requirements being placed on our products and to realize the value we are providing to the market. As a result we will continue to pursue a pricing strategy that reduces and properly reflects the investment in technology the market requires. ", "We experienced particular weakness in the client desktop as well as the enterprise legacy markets, adding strength in the enterprise cloud markets. Overall average capacity per drive was 1.4 Terabytes up 30% year-over-year and within this near line cloud average capacity per cloud was 3.9 Terabytes up 25% year-over-year. ", "On a year-over-year basis unit shipments were down 22% while the Exabyte's shipped were up 2%. The decrease in the unit temp in our markets percent challenges for Seagate that will requires alignment to operational preference and pressures the overall HDD supply chain. Especially for suppliers that are supplying one part per drive. However, we are encouraged by the trend towards significantly higher average capacity per rive applications which result in great absorption and heads this in favor HDD storage device now and in the foreseeable future in terms of costs as a function of required performance. ", "The continued advancement and adaptation of mobile and cloud based computing architectures is reflected in the revenue shifts we are seeing in our portfolio. Our long term business thesis continues to be that there will be a significant transition in the HDD from a historical split. Revenue split of 60% client and 40% enterprise revenue to 40% client and 60% enterprise revenue over the next several years. ", "We also expect that the average capacity per drive will increase in all markets. Most important to our product positioning and related investments is not just the mix between client enterprise and the mix shift within these markets. In the client's base, we expect to continue decline in PC shipments that we anticipate to moderate in the next year. PC HDDs now represent about 56% of Seagate client revenue and approximately 30% of total company revenue. ", "While overall PC HDD client revenues is declining the remaining share is dominated by high capacity products which will continue to increase with the new product offerings that we have started to introduce in the June quarter. we are starting to see our client business shift to consumer, surveillance, gaming and DVR markets which are all high capacity user environments which I believe over the next several quarters this growth will result in these combined markets being greater than the traditional PC compute market today. ", "As an example our consumer business revenues as a percentage of total client revenues have grown 6% in the last 12 months whereas PC revenue as a percentage of total client revenues has declined 6%. This is consistent with our belief that reducing the amount of storage on certain client devices propagated to another location. In the enterprise market, revenue mix continues to trend from the legacy mission critical to near line car market. ", "In the March quarter we experienced unexpected weakness for a legacy mission critical HDDs which were approximately 700,000 units below our forecast. While it's difficult to attribute the enterprise mission critical between macroeconomic factors and architectural shifts we expect further declines in the mission critical markets in June quarter and then decline should moderate over the quarters thereafter. ", "This mission critical weakness in the March quarter was offset by near line cloud upside demand of more than 500,000 units over which we could only deliver 350,000 additional units due to the long wait time as required to fulfill demand. Importantly in the March quarter the average capacity per drive for the mission critical HDDs that came out of our forecast versus the average capacity of ATB to 8 Terabytes of near line HDD outside the demand we saw reflected the shifts in Exabyte's of almost 6:1. ", "Demand signals from our near line customers has improved over the last few weeks and we are planning for our fourth consecutive quarter of high demand for HR Byte portfolio and initial volume shipments our 10 Terabyte Helium HDD product. As a result of these trends as well as input from our major cloud customers we believe that these shifts from legacy to cloud for enterprise applications has accelerated in the last 6 months and is now complementing the cloud storage generated by consumer applications. ", "As we managed the shifts in our product portfolio demand and changing the nature of our customer base we are aligning the operating model of our HDD business to optimize our manufacturing preference and we are reducing our capital expenditure to maintenance capital requirement levels. Through these actions Seagate will be operating at very near full capacity in our operating capacity to our shift in chasing demand upside versus managing excess capacity. ", "In the March quarter we began the process of reducing our HDD manufacturing capacity from approximately $55 million to $60 million drives per quarter to approximately $35 million to $40 million drives per quarter. The actions required will be completed within the next 6 to 9 months. At the same time we are continue to accelerate the utilization of our own drive factories internal head and media facilities. ", "For fiscal 2016 total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $535 million down approximately 28% over fiscal year 2015. For fiscal year 2017 assuming current outlook on demand we are targeting an additional reduction in spending reflecting a very low maintenance capital plan of approximately $400 million. In addition we will continue operating expense management across the company that aligns with the market trends. ", "We believe that given the shifts in our product revenues above as well as recognizing the full impact in our management changes and our manufacturing footprint and operating expenses, the company will see revenue growth, product gross margin improvements and improved profitability assuming relatively stable macro environment.", "Dave Morton and Dave Mosley will go into more details on these activities and I will turn the call over to Dave Morton now. ", "Dave Morton ", "Thanks, Steve. With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business there a few specific areas in our financial model that were impacted in Q3. I would like to provide details in these conditions to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion around the actions we are taking manufacturing and operating expense levels. ", "For the March quarter the addressable HDD and cloud storage systems markets were lower than forecast impacting our revenue results for the quarter. Within this there were specific HDD product areas where demand fell short of our expectations including traditional mission critical HDD enterprise products and desktop client's products in China. In addition we made strategic decisions to not aggressively participate in certain areas of the low capacity notebook market. ", "In our systems in Silicon business we experienced weaker than expected demands across most of the product lines. The lowered and forecasted HDD demand impacted our production levels and increased our factory absorption costs. We also aggressively managed our finished goods in the quarter and improved our inventory levels by approximately a $180 million. This reduction in inventory negatively impacted our factory utilization. ", "Combined these factors were the primary reasons that our product gross margins declining approximately 290 basis points sequentially to approximately 23% with 80 basis points impact from the HDD revenue shortfall, 70 basis points from the systems and silicon business revenue shortfall and 140 basis points from factory underutilization. While we are disappointed we did not anticipate the weaker demand in the March quarter. The company is evaluating and implementing a variety of actions to reduce the company's cost structure which will result in financial improvements over the next level months. ", "Towards our infrastructure cost alignments and fiscal Q3 alone we implemented certain cost reduction activities and recognized approximately $90 million in onetime restructuring charges right off of certain fixed assets, certain terminated contracts and discontinued inventory. We are currently sizing future non-reoccurring restructuring cash charges that we are estimating will be approximately $150 million over the next several quarters. We anticipate having more detailed actions identified within 60 days and we will expect that the financial benefits of these actions will begin to have a positive impact in the September quarter with the full benefit occurring in calendar 2017. ", "As we formalize the specific actions and timing of cost savings we will continue to provide updates to this framework. While we are formulating all of the actions we will take to address gross margins and operating profits, we believe the overall cost of alignment activities we will implement will benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business with the goal of achieving a minimum of $2.50 in non-GAAP earnings per share in calendar 2017. ", "For the March quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were approximately $439 million slightly lower than forecasted. Looking ahead our expenses in the June quarter will be relatively flat with additional cost reductions in plan for FY 2017. Cash flow from operations in the March quarter was $205 million and free cash flow was a $110 million. Fiscal year today we have generated $1.4 billion in cash flow from operations. Our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 298 million shares outstanding. ", "Our debt structure and level of interest expense s manageable. As announced today the board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63. There has been no change in the dividend policy and our dividend payout of $188 million a quarter is recorded by our cash flow generation forecast albeit at a higher payout ratio than previously stated as our objective. ", "I will turn over the call to Dave Mosley to cover our HDD business in more detail. ", "Dave Mosley", "Thanks, Dave. Beginning with the near line product lines are 8 Terabyte business critical products continues aggressive volume ramp and we have been essentially sold out for the month of March and April. We have had over 200% volume growth of 8 Terabyte in the March quarter and we anticipate continued growth in the June quarter. In addition our 10 Terabyte product lines shipped a large volume of qualification units in the March quarter and our volume growth is accelerating in the June quarter as well. ", "We believe our 10 Terabyte product to be leading in all performance and power metrics and we are very happy with the feedback from our customers and our qualifications. In the client space as Steve sad the PC market continued to decline in Q3 and we began end of life activity on some of the older 500 Gigabyte and below products that have very low margins. Most of the margin cost benefits of these products will be realized over the next few quarters. ", "In the March quarter we began the ramp of our 1 Terabyte and 2 Terabyte 7 mm 2.5 inch product line for our consumer notebook and DVR customers. This new product line allows us to address the target markets with lower costs and improved value proposition for our customers. Qualifications have gone well with customer interest high and we anticipate shipping several million units in the June quarter. ", "Initially the product will be a consumer offering moving to OEM offering in September and December and we believe we will competitive technology through the end of the calendar year. We are also accelerating the application of these same technologies into our lines for surveillance as DVR at the end of the calendar year. ", "The mission critical market served by our 10,000 and 15,000 RPM products has been declining over the last few quarters and we have seen traditional trends of approximately 8 million to 8.5 million units per quarter decline to approximately 6.5 million to 7 million units in the March quarter. Within the mission critical market approximately 25% of the volumes are 15,000 RPM HDDs. This is the primary area where we are seeing a shift in low end servers to lower capacity flash SSDs and we expect it to continue. ", "In 10,000 RPM HDD there has been some technology shift happening as well however we believe that market will have a much longer transition horizon. Our goal over the coming months is to manage our forecasting conservatively with mission critical TAM decline in the June quarter potentially leveling to modest decline in the back half of the years. Over the long term we believe the technology shifts in the market will report our complimentary investment thesis of flash ware performance and driving HDD for architecture. ", "Shifting our HDD build volumes to our higher capacity offerings will allow us to simplify our wafer requirements and optimize our product portfolio which will not need further product refreshes for some time. Improved utilization of our own factories properly for the market demand will improve our costs considerably. We realize our non-depreciation related fixed costs are high competitively and also too high for current demands. ", "These cost items will be addressed sooner than those related to the manufacturing footprint. There are also mini costs related to the product transitions that while temporarily driving a higher cost profile will also us to improve our cost footprint in FY 2017. With respect to the shift of the higher capacity products we do need to be mindful of longer lead times and supply chain management for these products. By engaging directly with the broader customer base and establishing deeper channel partnerships we believe we will improve our sales operation efficiency and forecast. ", "Thanks now I will turn the call back over to Steve. ", "Steve Luczo", "Thanks, Dave. Given the recent published earning results and the related conservative guidance from a broad base of large corporations that serve the global technology and industrial markets we are planning for season declines and revenue in June quarter for most of the markets we serve with the exception of near line markets. ", "Based on these factors as well as our decision of not to participate in the GPC client market we expect to achieve revenues of approximately $2.3 billion in the June quarter with relatively flat gross margins and operating expenses. We continue to expect the demand in the second half of calendar year 2016 will be stronger than the first half with positive seasonal trends and continued growth in near line demand offset somewhat by macro-economic pressures. With this anticipated revenue growth as well as the actions we are taking to align our manufacturing footprint our operating expense, gross margins and profitability will improve in the second half of 2016. ", "Should there be improvements in the macro economic conditions we should expect to see HDD unit across all markets with commensurate benefits to the company's performance. Thank you for joining us on the call today and we can now open it up for questions and answers. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Rich Kugele of Needham & Company. Your line is open. ", "Rich Kugele", "Thank you, good morning, in terms of the restructuring Steve you talked about getting to something around $2.50 should we assume something revenue wise lower first before it can start to grow again as you realign those lines, $35 million to $40 million units of capacity, you would assume you are probably exiting quite a few categories?", "Steve Luczo", "I think the capacity issue also relates to the amount of outsourced drives we have Rich, so in the second half of the year we expect revenue growth for the guide for June and we would expect that to continue through 2017 so the adjustments manufacturing of where we taking our internal capacity which was under absorbed and taking production inside which was basically additional under absorption but that was the non-operating fix costs or the cost of the factories themselves so there is a double effect of what happens once we bring the drives in as well to reduce our overall footprint. ", "But we would expect to counter your 2017 revenues other than seasonal decline from December to March should continue to grow assuming the macro condition is stable in part because the portfolio also gets a lot stronger with the 1 TB and 2.5 and the 2 TB which are then products which are highly competitive and we believe at least six months ahead of the competition and capacity better much more relevant to us than the clients base. ", "Rich Kugele", "Okay. And then just to understand the difference from moving from mission critical to high capacity can you just expand the gross margin dollar impact and the technology, investments required to go and do that. Is it similar R&D investments, any thoughts about that?", "Steve Luczo", "Let me just give a general trend and then you can talk about the R&D side. In general the gross profit dollars is the same which is why losing 700,000 units but picking up 350,000 the gross margin percentages are about the same and once you reach the crossover point where we can either meet the upside demand or naturally exceed or whatever erosion continues in mission critical and like I said, its' really hard to understanding mission critical right now, is it being driven by macro or flashes or certain segments of that. ", "And maybe the macros even accelerating the incursion of flash, it doesn't really matter; it's not going to reverse itself so we are preparing for the continued decline of the 15K segment. But as Dave indicated the 10K segment from our customer input will remain intact for a number of quarters if not for a number of years. I think it's more about managing the investment in the portfolio forward and then obviously again adjusting the manufacturing footprint so you are keeping pace and are a little bit ahead of the decline so all sold out versus having excess capacity. Dave will talk to you in more detail", "Dave Morton", "From a R&D perspective Rich it's fairly applicable you can move the technologies where it's headed, media technology is over at the money market segment. Other as Steve commented and I won't elaborate too much. The speed of the shift last quarter was really high demand with the cloud product and the following demand for the mission critical price were more a factory reaction than time issue anything. ", "Rich Kugele", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. ", "SherriScribner", "Thank you. The cash flow number came in a little bit this quarter obviously with gross margins coming down. I wanted to get your sense about how your thinking your uses of cash going forward, how will the cash cost related to some of these restructuring actions impact you, are you still committed to the dividend, is there a plan to buy back shares considering shares have come back and do you have plans to buy back any of your debt which is trading at a discount to par?", "Dave Mosley", "Hi Sherri, this is Dave. As we think about heading back into the year. Obviously first and foremost we are going to invest in business ourselves. As we stated and looked around these onetime costs, restructuring cash charge specifically around the $150 million, we think that is very manageable over a generation and what we are able to yield here again over the next 6 month to 9 months and then as far as the dividend we think that is well manageable albeit at the higher end of those payout ratios and obviously up to the board of directors. With that said we feel that the very defendable against what we are able to generate moving forward. ", "Steve Luczo", "I think in the near future Sherri meaning the next 6 months to 12 months the consideration clearly go invest in the business because we do feel we have technology and product leads as long as the macro environment stays like it is with the product execution. We feel pretty good about the company's position competitively. And then in terms of what we will do with the cash flow, I think defending the dividend is the first we would do and would certainly like to keep the dividend level where it is. ", "Initially obviously where the payout ratios are involved 30% and 50% as we had indicated but if the company is growing into that and improving revenues and margins, certainly we will put the company in position where the board has easier decision to make or the other way around. I think in terms of buy backs whether it's debt or equity, for the near term we will probably not reduce the cash or probably if there is excess cash we would keep it on the balance sheet, just in case the macro situation turns on us as we had more confidence about 2017 outlook.", "And again the success of our products, we would evaluate that in terms of best use of it beyond dividend or going on balance sheet. ", "SherriScribner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Aaron Rakers of Stifel. Your line is open. ", "AaronRakers", "Thank you for taking the questions. Steve I was curious in past you have talked about returning to the 27% plus gross margin or the analyst they even talked about 27% or 32% on top of that you talked about 13% to 15% operating expense derivative. Understand there are a lot of things going on and realignments, when are you able to give back into that target model at this point?", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, we talked about was it worth guessing right now to provide you some guidance on that and I think I would prefer just for us to get through this next 60 days of really understanding to the changes we are going to be making to the operational footprint and investments because the reality is depending upon which decisions we make there is different timing. Some of the things we can get after right away is mostly mentioned but others are really a function of product transitions, customer call issue, regulatory issues etcetera so I think this is probably not worth guessing at this point and as we get more clarity on that specific actions we will get back to you. ", "The question is do we still get back in that range in a reasonable period of time the answer is yes, we can get ourselves back into the range. But we want to just get little more work done before we give you an idea of when that's going to happen in this quarter. We rather do a little more work before we lay that out for you. ", "AaronRakers", "And Steve what gives you confidence that the mission critical business declined to the June quarter but then seems to stabilize into the back half of the year and going forward. It seems that there's not that much visibility there given the moving parts of macro and obviously the element of flash. ", "Steve Luczo", "Yes our feeling based on customer input was that the economics mostly talking to the application shift Aaron so the macro stuff I am not going to speculate on, if it gets worse than obviously all these markets will be under pressure. If it gets better all get a little bit reprieve. ", "But it feels like the trend of where mission critical 15K is being taken out the point of exposure in 10K is in for now, maybe not for a while based on customer effects. So, our point is that as the transition to some point stabilizes and this probably happens in the second half of the calendar year. ", "AaronRakers", "Okay. ", "Steve Luczo", "Great. Everyone, thanks for taking the time today. And we look forward to talking next quarter and thanks for all your support as well to our customers and suppliers and most importantly our employees. Thanks very much. ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in todays' program. This concludes today's program and you can disconnect.

My name is Kevin and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question and answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kate Scolnick, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, Kate.", "Kate Scolnick - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome to today's call. Joining me today in the room from Seagate's executive team are Steve Luczo, Chairman and CEO and Dave Morton, Executive Vice President and CFO. Dave Mosley, President and COO is connected into the call remotely and Phil Brace, President of Cloud Systems and Silicon Group is not on today's call as he is traveling.", "We've posted our press release and detailed supplemental information about our fourth quarter and fiscal year end 2016 on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com. During today's call we'll review the highlights for the June quarter and fiscal 2016, provide the company outlook for the first fiscal quarter 2017, and then open the call for questions.", "We will refer to non-GAAP measures on this call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures on our supplemental information available on the investor section of our website. We have not reconciled our non-GAAP financial measures guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.", "We are planning for the call today to go approximately half an hour and we will do our best to accommodate your questions following our prepared remarks as time permits. As a reminder, this conference call contains forward-looking statements about the company's anticipated future operating and financial performance, customer demand, technology and product development advancements, and general market conditions. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current views and assumptions and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date. Actual results may vary materially from today's statements.", "Information concerning our risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause results to differ from these forward-looking statements are contained in the company's SEC filings and supplemental information posted on the investor section of the company's website at seagate.com.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Luczo. Please go ahead, Steve.", "Stephen James Luczo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Kate. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. For today's call, I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business and the direction we will be taking with the company with respect to structure and focus, and Dave Morton will then walk through certain financial highlights and I'll close the call with our guidance for the September quarter and our general expectations for the second half of calendar 2016.", "For the June quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.65 billion, and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 25.8%, net income of $207 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.69. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the June quarter were $443 million. Capital expenditures of $146 million for the June quarter were higher than our previous forecast due to our decision to accelerate the ramp of new products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment. In addition, we are accelerating the expansion of our Korat facility to expedite the plan manufacturing footprint reductions across many sites. For the full fiscal year, our capital expenditures were $587 million, approximately 5% of revenue and below our targeted long-term model range of 6% to 8%.", "We believe Seagate's June quarter results are reflective of a generally stable but relatively benign macroeconomic environment as well as an acceleration in the deployment of cloud-based storage associated with usage shifts of technologies and architectures by end users. Demand from cloud service providers was stronger than expected after several quarters of relatively modest demand from these customers.", "Our HDD shipments for the June quarter were 36.8 million units, representing a record 61.7 exabytes of storage. Average capacity per drive increased to a record 1.7 terabytes per drive and ASPs of $67 were a record since the Thai floods. Overall inventory levels were down 6% sequentially and within this, finished goods were down 21%. These inventory levels represent sequentially improved inventory turns and lean production schedules as we ramp our new HDD products throughout the portfolio.", "With respect to our cloud systems business, we are making good progress in ramping new platforms and gaining new customers offset by some demand softness from top-tier OEM and government customers. The integration of Dot Hill is complete and we will be launching converged storage platforms, including hybrid and all-flash array offerings later this fiscal year, which we believe are equal to or better than our competition.", "On the silicon side, we have recently introduced a number of new products including our industry-leading 2 terabyte NVMe enterprise SSD product which is getting positive customer feedback. This business is extremely competitive and we're working in construction with our key NAND partners who are enabling us to develop workload-specific and optimized products.", "For the fiscal year 2016, Seagate achieved revenues of $11.2 billion, and on a non-GAAP basis, net income of $684 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.26. In fiscal 2016, we shipped 233 exabytes with average capacity per drive up 29% year over year. Within these results, we shipped 70 exabytes for the business-critical product portfolio, up 28% year over year.", "Consistent with our expectations of the impact of the shift from client server to mobile cloud architectures, Seagate's HDD unit shipments over the last five fiscal years have decreased 15% while at the same time exabyte shipments have grown 112% and average capacity per drive has increased 133%.", "Applications which require higher capacity HDDs are responsible for the record demand for HDD storage. Additionally, these application trends align with the Seagate actions that are in progress to optimize utilization in our heads, media and drive-test factories. Since the majority of exabyte growth is related to high-definition streaming content where massive data ingest and sequential write operations are the key characteristics for the specific workloads, HDDs continue to be the optimal cost performance solution over any other storage device.", "In the nearline enterprise market, our 8 terabyte products were the fastest growing products in units and revenue within our overall HDD portfolio this quarter. We expect the market to continue to shift towards this capacity point over the next two years.", "Our 10 terabyte helium enterprise product is best in class for power performance and we will be shipping our 12 terabyte helium nearline enterprise test units for customer evaluation this quarter. To meet the high capacity storage requirements of the client marketplace, we have recently introduced 10 terabyte capacity points across our Guardian Series client portfolio with particular focus on the surveillance, gaming, DVR and NAS markets.", "Over the next several quarters, we will refresh most of our high volume capacity points in our portfolio with lower cost designs using our leadership in areal density and our improved operational footprint. Our customers will benefit from the portfolio advancements and we believe that Seagate will be in the leading competitive position as our market shifts from a low capacity, units-based demand profile to the future applications which are component rich and require aggressive technology advancement.", "This is particularly important as the storage market shifts from client server to mobile cloud applications and storage environments. While we expect this shift to continue to pressure PC unit volumes with HDDs, we are encouraged by the capacity needs of the remaining PC client as well as the significant growth in non-PC-client devices and applications.", "Assuming a relatively stable macro environment, we believe that given the continued shifts in our product revenues as well as recognizing the full impact of the significant changes in our manufacturing footprint and operating expenses, the company will achieve revenue growth, product gross margin improvements and improved profitability.", "I'll turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more details on these activities.", "David H. Morton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Steve. With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business, there are a few specific areas of our financial model that were impacted in FQ4. I would like to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion around the actions we are taking to manufacturing and operating expense levels.", "For the June quarter, Seagate's addressable HDD market was higher than forecast, driving benefit in our revenue and margin results for the quarter. Within this, there were specific HDD product areas where demand was stronger than our expectations, specifically for our nearline enterprise HDD products. Our 8 TB nearline enterprise products were our leading revenue SKUs as overall ACD enterprise revenue increased to 45% of our total HDD's revenue. By comparison, our PC client shipments were 25% of HDD revenue in the June quarter, reflecting the shift of client server storage environments and our strategic participation in the higher-capacity segments.", "We continue to make strategic decisions to not aggressively participate in certain areas of the low-capacity notebook and gaming market where the gross margin contribution does not warrant the long-term manufacturing investment. As a result, our future forecast for Seagate's HDD unit addressable market may have a variance to our competition, as we may not participate in all HDD unit sales demand in any given quarter.", "As we manage the shifts in our product portfolio, customer demand and changing nature of our customer base, we are continuing to align the operating model of our HDD business to optimize our manufacturing footprint and we are reducing our capital expenditures to maintenance capital requirement levels, which is expected to be less than 5% of our revenue over the next fiscal year. Through these actions, Seagate will be operating at or very near full capacity and our operating philosophy will shift to chasing demand upside versus managing excess capacity.", "Earlier this year, we began the process of reducing the HDD manufacturing capacity from approximately 55 million to 60 million drives per quarter to approximately 35 million to 40 million drives per quarter. The actions required will be completed within the next six to nine months. At the same time, we are continuing to accelerate the utilization of our own drive factories, internal head and media facilities.", "Towards our infrastructure cost alignment, in the June quarter, we implemented certain cost reduction activities and recognized approximately $80 million in pre-tax charges and additionally in July, we announced further cost reduction activities reflecting $164 million in pre-tax charges. Overall restructuring actions are proceeding as planned and we expect the financial benefit of these actions will begin to have a positive impact in the September quarter.", "For the June quarter we recorded a tax benefit of $16 million. This is primarily related to the release of tax reserves and changes in our deferred taxes in foreign jurisdictions, impacted by our global footprint changes. Our overall fiscal year 2016 tax expense was $26 million. While we are still formulating all of the actions we will take to address gross margins and operating profit, we believe the new high capacity and cost-advantaged products in our full HDD portfolio refresh and overall cost alignment activities we are implementing will benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of the fiscal and calendar year 2017.", "Given current demand outlook and assuming a stable macroeconomic environment, we are confident in exceeding the minimum of $2.50 in non-GAAP earnings per share in calendar 2017 that we indicated last quarter. We recognize that we are on track to exceed this goal and will provide additional insights for calendar 2017 on our October earnings call.", "Cash flow from operations in the June quarter was $269 million, and for fiscal 2016, we generated $1.7 billion in cash flow from operations. Our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the June quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 299 million shares outstanding.", "Our debt structure and level of interest expense is well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment-grade framework given our staggered maturities and low interest expense. Due to the confidence in our cash flow generation, our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63. There has been no change to our dividend policy, and our dividend payout of $188 million a quarter is supported by our cash flow generation forecast.", "I would now like to turn the call back to Steve.", "Stephen James Luczo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Dave. As we manage the business in the near term, we are cognizant of the recent published earning results and related conservative guidance from a broad base of large corporations that serve the global technology industrial markets, as well as many consumer products companies.", "As indicated, demand for our nearline drives has accelerated from earlier in the year as cloud service providers are deploying new systems and/or replacing HDDs that are in service. We expect this demand to be relatively flat in the September quarter. We see growth in some areas of high capacity non-PC clients, specifically DVR, surveillance, NAS, and seasonal gaming demand, offset with declines in the PC-related markets as we narrow our participation in this segment.", "Overall, I expect demand should improve in the September quarter with our focus on high capacity opportunities for our portfolio. Based on these factors, we expect revenue growth and gross margin improvement in the September quarter. Given the dynamic nature of the technology business as well as a still tepid macroeconomic environment, we have approached our outlook cautiously. We expect to achieve revenues of at least $2.7 billion in the September quarter, with gross margins of at least 27%, and relatively flat operating expenses.", "We believe it's important that investors recognize the continued shift from client server to mobile cloud, and the related infrastructure and application level changes taking place in our industry. These shifts are impacting our traditional customer base, while also creating significant opportunities for core technology providers such as Seagate with an expanding customer base.", "The new customer base includes our traditional OEMs and distribution customers as well as significant and growing demand from cloud service providers, surveillance companies, and will likely include corporate demand in the not-too-distant future.", "As a result of these changes in product demand and customer base, we have experienced shifts in our traditional seasonal demand patterns. Cyclicality associated with cloud infrastructure buildout can now override seasonality, and this has implications for investors' expectations and management of our company resources.", "While the overall shift in technology deployment and related growth in data science applications is quite favorable for the HDD industry on a moving annual average, the rate of growth for storage demand in the near term will likely fluctuate quarter to quarter as major systems installations either aggressively deploy or absorb capacity.", "As we analyze these trends, we are considering that these changes in customer buying patterns and capacity utilization may be better reflected in annual guidance planning for investors. We will discuss this possibility with our investors over the next few months.", "In addition, we continue to implement actions to align our manufacturing footprint and operating expense investment with market demand. These actions, as well as the product portfolio introductions previously discussed, should result in continued gross margin and operating margin improvement over the near term. Should there be improvement in the overall macroeconomic conditions, we would expect to see improved HDD unit demand across all markets with commensurate benefits to the company's financial performance.", "Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we can now open it up for questions and answers.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi. Thank you. Just thinking about the restructuring actions you've taken, you've taken a number of actions over the past quarter. Are you done with the restructuring actions? And how should we think about OpEx as we move beyond the September quarter? Should we start to see that trend down because of the actions, or is it still going to stay about flat?", "Stephen James Luczo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We're not done. And in terms of OpEx, I think for the next one or two quarters, it'll be relatively in this range, Sherri, and then it should reduce afterwards.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And I know you said you'd comment on the $2.50 in October, but it seems like at least at these levels, you're well ahead of that $2.50. Do you have any thoughts for what the earnings power could be as we move into fiscal 2017 and calendar 2017?", "Stephen James Luczo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We're starting to get a sense of it, and to your point, obviously we're confident that the $2.50 will be exceeded. I think until we start kind of getting a better sense on some of these demand patterns on the CSPs, we just want to get a little more data under our belt before we give you a more specific number. But to your point, we're confident that it'll be materially different than $2.50 a share.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Stephen James Luczo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham.", "Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Good morning. First, congratulations on the balance sheet. It's good to see those turns. Just in terms of your comment about cyclicality overcoming seasonality, that's interesting. When you look at the cloud service provider market, do you find that they tend to be more accurate if you look at it over six months versus a quarter? And also, about the qual cycle there, do you see the 10 terabyte and other high capacity products like that getting qualified quicker in the future? And would that help improve the visibility as well as you move out to 12 and other terabytes? Thanks.", "Stephen James Luczo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I'd say that the visibility over a year by quarter isn't great, Rich. I mean I think they have a decent sense of what they think they need in terms of capacity deployment on an annual basis, but when it breaks down to quarter to quarter, I think given the nature of the customers, many of them aren't actually witnessing centralized perspective of demand. So there's a bunch of BUs that are deploying, and a lot of those BUs actually buy on their own. Some of them go to a centralized deployment; some of them don't. So you can't think of these big CSPs necessarily as holistically planning capacity for every one of their application sets, because a lot of those business units within those companies are on their own cycles and maybe it gets aggregated, maybe it doesn't, depending on the customer.", "So I think they're all learning. I think what's going to drive the better visibility is just the lead time associated with these products, and we've already seen it with the ATB. As you know, the wafer cycle times on the heads are longer than the quarter and then the test times are three weeks on top of that. So you're well outside of a quarter in terms of lead time. So if you don't do a great job of your capacity planning in advance of a quarter as a CSP, and you don't have excess capacity, you're going to be somewhat constrained, especially as they move into these spaces where they could see big step function changes in demand, i.e., they pick up a big corporate customer that's going to a huge cloud-based installation of applications, let's say. If they don't have the capacity in place, they can't take that business.", "My guess is if they miss one piece of business like that once, all of a sudden the planning's going to get a lot better. And we've seen that. Those trends are starting where you have these Fortune 50 or even Fortune 20 companies that are now making big moves to the cloud. And that puts on basically sometimes pressure of, we need a whole new data center. And this is the beginning of the trend, not even the middle or the end game. So we expect a lot more of that.", "So the lead time, and the lead times of course with the 10 terabyte are longer and the 12 terabyte are long just because against the complexity of the technology. So your process content is way higher and of course, the test time is way higher. So I think in general, their views aren't bad on a looking out over 12 month basis. It's just their quarter to quarter visibility is still developing.", "In terms of 8s, 10s, 12s, we think the 8s are going to be around for a long time. It's super high performance and very lost cost product for us. 10 TB, we certainly have customers that are taking the drive. We don't know that we see a huge uptick in 10 TB just because you're only picking up 2 terabytes and it costs a lot more right now. Maybe as the two companies get up the yield curve and bring cost down, we'll see an acceleration of the deployment. That's what we noticed on ATB, that once you got up the yield curve and in our case, because we have a disk and two heads less, we were able to hit cost points that really accelerated the replacement of 4s and 6s with 8s.", "So whether or not it's 10 or maybe 12 where you pick up 50% more capacity or frankly, maybe even 16 where it's I'm doubling capacity in that same real estate, it'll be interesting to see where that transition happens. I think the important thing is to make sure from a Seagate perspective that we're leading in areal density and we continue to deliver that in our products. And whenever the customers decide they want that product, we'll be there with it.", "Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC", "Thanks. And, Dave, just on the free cash flow, if you fast forward nine, 12 months, are you confident in the company's ability to generate $1.5 billion type of cash flow?", "David H. Morton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. I think what we've laid out with a lot of our restructuring activity as well as where we're just relying and defaulting on maintenance capital and how that has come down compared to previous years, the trajectory that we're on would suggest that number.", "Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you so much. Take care.", "Stephen James Luczo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "Hey, guys. Thanks you for taking the questions. And hey, congrats getting the confluence of these actions to come together pretty quickly in a nice way. Steve, just a couple for me real quick. I just love your context around second half, specifically second half CSP cycles. Sounds like you saw a little bit of a greater than expected pickup in June. How long do you expect that to last? And then we'd just love your current thoughts around kind of the longer term normalized exabyte growth. And I'll actually squeeze my last one in. Just any thoughts you have on September Q TAM. That's it for me. Thanks.", "Stephen James Luczo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah again, the CSP influence on the overall business is a little tricky just because like we witnessed in this quarter, can be so kind of significant. And when they do start buying, they tend to start buying for longer periods of times, two, three, four quarters. That really hasn't been modeled into our expectations. We'd rather kind of see the whites of their eyes before we make that call.", "We can say that July started off quite strong and the demand seems to be fairly solid. But as I think most of the analysts know, typically the September quarter is a back-end weighted quarter. And if we overlay the back-end weighted quarter on what we've seen so far, it kind of doesn't make sense to us. So we've been a bit cautious and then we'll see what happens with that demand. And again, I think until that customer base diversifies a bit more and we get I think more data around what happens month to month in addition to quarter to quarter, it's probably better for us just to be cautious about what we see and then be smarter as we move forward. What was the second question?", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "The annual.", "Stephen James Luczo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I still think the annual demand for storage is still probably more defined by available capacity than it is real demand. I mean again, if you take population growth times connected devices times richness of content, it gets you easily to three or four zettabytes by 2020, which would imply kind of 30% to 35% annual growth in storage. And I still think that's really kind of what the demands is, and the question is can the HDD industry or the NAND industry for that matter invest to those levels of capital or not. And we'll see. It's pretty tight though, given the budgets that people have deployed or the fabs that are lined up.", "But I still think you're seeing exabyte demand that's well in excess of areal density demand, so in that sense we view it as demand's outstripping supply. And then of course the packaging requirements are moving to more high capacity, so more heads and disks per units, but units probably flattening out. But from an absorption perspective for Seagate, making heads and disk or because the process content is so much higher or the test content is so much higher, that's a really good trend for us.", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "Thank you. And just real quickly, September Q TAM thoughts.", "Stephen James Luczo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "In terms of unit TAM?", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "Unit TAM, yeah.", "Stephen James Luczo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, we're not actually that focused on unit TAM. Again, we're more focused on exabyte. We've heard the 110 million number from our competitor, and on the face of it, that probably seems reasonable. That's not probably a TAM we see visibility to, because we're not participating in the low end of that segment and there's obviously a lot of units there, especially in the gaming market. But it doesn't seem unreasonable to us.", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "Thanks for all the context. Appreciate it.", "Stephen James Luczo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, market's opening so we should probably wrap it up, everyone. We appreciate your support and thanks to our employees, our customers, our suppliers, and we'll talk to you in three months.

Please go ahead, Steve.", "Steve Luczo", "Thanks, Kate. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. For today\u2019s call, I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business, Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights and I\u2019ll close the call with our outlook for the December quarter.", "For the September quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.8 billion, GAAP gross margins of 28.6%, net income of $167 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.55. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 29.5%, net income of $299 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.99, up 85% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $592 million.", "We believe Seagate\u2019s September quarter reflects \u2013 results are reflective of a generally stable but mixed macroeconomic environment, as well as acceleration in the deployment of cloud-based storage associated with usage shifts of technologies and architectures by end users. Demand from cloud service providers for our nearline high capacity portfolio was stronger than we expected going into the September quarter.", "HDD exabyte shipments for the September quarter were up approximately 20% year-over-year, with consecutive record shipments. We shipped 66.7 exabytes of storage in the September quarter. HDD unit shipments were 38.9 million units, with average capacity per drive at a record 1.7 terabytes per drive, up 44% year-over-year and reflecting our tenth quarter of sequential growth in capacity per drive. ASPs of $67 were sequentially flat for the September quarter.", "Our customers continue to benefit from our portfolio advancements, and we believe that Seagate is in the leading competitive position as our market shifts from a low capacity unit space demand profile to the future applications which are component rich and require aggressive technology advancement. This is particularly important as the storage market shifts from client server to mobile cloud applications and storage environments.", "With respect to our Cloud Systems business, we are on track to launch new converged storage platforms including hybrid and all flash array offerings later this fiscal year, which we believe are equal to or better than our competition and we expect to see continued revenue growth for this business in the December quarter.", "We are pleased with Seagate\u2019s execution in the September quarter, both in terms of our ability to maximize the profitability of our technology portfolio and our continued execution on our cost reductions.", "I will turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more detail on these activities.", "Dave Morton", "Thanks, Steve. With the shifts taking place in Seagate\u2019s business, there are a few specific areas of our financial performance in the September quarter that I would like to provide further context to Steve\u2019s earlier discussion.", "For the September quarter, Seagate\u2019s addressable HDD market was higher than forecast, driving benefit in our revenue and margin results for the quarter. Within this, there were specific HDD product areas where demand was stronger than our expectations, specifically for our nearline enterprise HDD products. Our ATB nearline enterprise products continues to be our leading revenue SKU, as overall HDD enterprise revenue was 41% of total consolidated revenue.", "By comparison, our PC client shipments were 24% of total consolidated revenue in the September quarter, reflecting the shift of client server storage environments and our competitive positioning in the higher capacity segments.", "From a market demand perspective, we continued to make strategic decisions to not aggressively participate in certain areas of the low capacity client market where the gross margin contribution does not warrant the long-term manufacturing investment. As a result, our future forecast for Seagate\u2019s HDD unit addressable market may have a variance to our competition, and our unit shipment market share may vary as we may not participate in all HDD unit sales demand in any given quarter.", "Operating expenses for the September quarter were $580 million on a GAAP basis and $472 million on a non-GAAP basis. The sequential increase in our operating expenses was due to higher variable compensation expense related to the upside in our financial performance.", "During the September quarter, we implemented certain cost reduction activities and recognized approximately $82 million in pretax restructuring charges. We continue to drive our non-variable compensation operating expense reduction activities, and our overall expenses will decline on a run rate basis as planned as we move through the fiscal year.", "Capital expenditures amounted to $140 million for the September quarter for maintenance capital, supporting the acceleration of the ramp of new products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment, and the accelerated expansion of our Korat facility to expedite the planned manufacturing footprint reductions across many sites.", "As we manage the shifts in our product portfolio, customer demand, and changing nature of our customer base, we are on track to align the operating model of our HDD business to optimize our manufacturing footprint. Our capital expenditures and maintenance capital requirement levels are expected to be less than 5% of our revenue over the next fiscal year and through our manufacturing consolidation activities, Seagate will be operating at or very near full capacity.", "Our operating philosophy will then shift to chasing demand upside versus managing excess capacity. While we are still in process of executing many actions, we believe the overall cost alignment activities and the new high capacity and cost advantaged products within our HDD product portfolio refresh will benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of the fiscal and calendar year of 2017. Given the current demand outlook and assuming a stable macroeconomic environment, we are confident in our ability to remain around the midpoint of our long-term targeted margin range of 27% to 32% and within our operating income targeted range of 13% to 15% for FY2017.", "Cash flow from operations in the September quarter was $592 million, and free cash flow was $452 million. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the September quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $299 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our debt structure and level of interest expense is well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment grade framework, given our staggered maturities and low interest expense.", "For capital allocation in the September quarter, we participated in a third-party block trade transaction in conjunction with ValueAct Capital and deployed $100 million for the redemption of 3 million shares. Due to the confidence in our cash flow generation, our Board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the September quarter, payable on January 4. There has been no change to our dividend policy, and our dividend payout of $188 million a quarter is supported by our cash flow generation forecast.", "I would now like to turn the call back to Steve.", "Steve Luczo", "Thanks, Dave. As indicated, demand for our high capacity nearline drives has accelerated from earlier in the year as cloud service providers are deploying new systems and/or replacing HDDs that are in service. For the December quarter we expect this demand to remain stable, with overall market exabyte demand to be slightly stronger. We will maintain our focus on high capacity opportunities for our portfolio. As such, we expect relatively flat revenue with improvement in gross margins in the December quarter, and as previously discussed, non-variable compensation operating expenses will trend down sequentially.", "We recognize the continued shift from cloud server to mobile cloud and the related infrastructure and application level changes taking place in our industry. These shifts are impacting our traditional product offering and customer base and are creating significant opportunities for core technology providers such as Seagate with an expanding customer base and higher value-add opportunities. The new customer base includes our traditional OEMs and distribution customers as well as significant and growing demand from cloud service providers, surveillance companies, and will likely include corporate demand in the not too distant future.", "Thank you for joining us on the call today. And we can now open the call up for questions and answers.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your line is now open.", "Steven Fox", "Thanks. Good morning. Just first off, I was curious, given how demand is coming in a little bit better than when you sort of started on this rationalization program, has there been any unintentional consequences in how you are dealing with customers or the supply chain that maybe adjusted the strategy going forward a little bit? And if not, can you sort of talk about how the mix maybe improves further like over a 12-month period from here? Thanks.", "Steve Luczo", "I\u2019m not sure I understand the question, Steven. You want to provide me a little more detail on what you mean by unexpected consequences?", "Steven Fox", "Yes. Basically is component supply getting tighter than you would have thought just three or six months ago when you sort of set out on this plan? Plan accounts seem to be going up.", "Steve Luczo", "No. I mean, not than what we expected. I mean, again, our strategy was to take out the capacity that was mostly related to old technology on single disc two head because we\u2019re ramping new technology on single disc two head. And we\u2019re allocating our component technology across our portfolio, I think pretty effectively. We\u2019re balancing between the demands on 2, 4, 6, terabyte as well as the strong demand at 8 terabyte. So I think the factories are \u2013 they\u2019re all running hot, but that wasn\u2019t unexpected. So I think at the component level we\u2019re definitely at capacity, which the operations people like as they love kind of chasing upsides and running linearly every month of the quarter. So it was the operational goal that we had in mind when we made the manufacturing adjustments that we made.", "Steven Fox", "Thanks. And then just as a quick follow-up, just in reference to your nearline demand trend chart, Slide 8, there\u2019s been periods where that has sort of paused sequentially and gone down, I guess mainly related to cloud demand. Can you talk about your expectations for maybe another sort of pullback based on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of data center spend over the next few quarters? Thanks.", "Steve Luczo", "No. What we pointed out is what we think the demand is for the December quarter, which it looks like it\u2019s going to remain strong. But as you pointed out, the data center growth can have ebbs and flows and they don\u2019t really kind of project out more than a few quarters. And even if they do, the accuracy that they have in that projection is not fantastic. Sometimes they say they\u2019re going to slow down and some big corporation decides to shift to cloud and sometimes they get utilization freeze up. Sometimes a particular customer; we\u2019re strong and may win or lose a big piece of business which then either creates an opportunity or they delay buying.", "It\u2019s still I think fairly dynamic with an overall trend that they continue to absorb a massive amount of storage as indicated by the record exabyte shipment that we\u2019ve now delivered two quarters in a row. So I think it\u2019s not going to be perfect quarter to quarter, but I think the 12-month over 12-month trends will continue to be quite favorable as they have been for the last few years as we\u2019ve started this shift to cloud.", "Steven Fox", "Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks again.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Sherri Scribner", "Hi, thank you. I appreciate the long-term gross margin guidance in the middle of the range for the full year. Just thinking about the gross margin upside this quarter, how much of that was from mixed versus the cost cutting actions that you\u2019ve been taking? Because it seems to me that with more cost cutting to come and some rationalization in December, we should maybe be able to get some margins up into the 30% range, so wanted to see what you thought about that, and also the mix between cost cutting and mix. Thanks.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, I don\u2019t really can presume that much, Sherri, I mean the mix was part of the cost cutting, in reference to the prior answer. When we made our operational adjustments it was to drive a higher capacity offering because of our technical lead. That\u2019s the right place for us to be at. We\u2019ll even see that on the client space. Again, it given where we\u2019re at in terms of 1 terabyte per disc notebook and 2 terabyte on desktop transition, we\u2019re going to get a mix advantage even within that space. So again, it\u2019s kind of all related to where we are technically, and as we ramp these products what we think our opportunity is competitively.", "In terms of your second comment, we posted 29.5% and we said slight improvement, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s at odds with what you just concluded.", "Sherri Scribner", "Okay, great. And then just thinking about the calendar guidance that I think some of us were hoping for an update on this quarter, I mean if you look at the run rate, if you look at the margins, you can easily do $3.50 for calendar 2017. I think some people are thinking $4. Can you maybe give us some thoughts on your calendar expectation? Thanks.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes. I think Dave gave most of the pieces of it and what we\u2019re thinking for revenue. We\u2019re not going to stay in the business of a calendar projection. We did that when people thought we were going out of business three months ago. But because we did say we\u2019d given update, I think the missing piece to do the model you want to do is where do we think revenues are going to come in.", "Right now I would say that we feel that there\u2019s going to be revenue growth year-over-year and it\u2019s probably going to be in the mid-single digits, maybe mid-to-high single digits. That would imply, as you point out, beating that number by 40% to 50% with some head room. So if you landed in the $3.75 to $4 range I think that\u2019s probably right, given what we can see today. But I think the good news is margins near the midpoint of the range, operating margins probably a year ahead of where we thought we were going to be, and revenue growth, which I think we\u2019re feeling more confident that on a year-over-year basis, we\u2019re going to see the revenue growth as well.", "Sherri Scribner", "Thank you.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah of Brean Capital. Your line is now open.", "Ananda Baruah", "Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the strong progress, by the way.", "Steve Luczo", "Thank you.", "Ananda Baruah", "Yes, you\u2019re welcome. You guys must feel great about that. I guess really a quick clarification and then two from me, which are quick and related. Dave made mention of running a full capacity. I couldn\u2019t get if you guys were already essentially there, and I thought he said something about as you go through these initiatives. So would love any context around are you there now. And then I guess the question, Steve, quickly just on the exabytes, is I would love to get your view on what you see as sort of next 12 months to 24 months, sort of exabyte growth range, any context would be helpful. Seems like there\u2019s been an alteration. I know the comps have been easier. But it feels like there is \u2013 through our last two Qs maybe a little bit more high cast demand than you guys thought \u2013 well than the industry had been seeing previously.", "And then the final thing is to your comment about \u2013 collectively you guys comments about being positioned to chase demand, if you can position as you want kind of exiting this, what are the implications of chasing demand and being at basically full capacity utilization? Does it alter the context of the contract conversation? Are there capital implications from that, CapEx implications from that? Anything like that would be helpful. I know that\u2019s a bunch. Thanks, appreciate it.", "Steve Luczo", "Well. Are we at capacity? As you know, in our business you only need to be at capacity on one element and you\u2019re technically at capacity. So yes, we\u2019re pretty much at capacity. But you got to remember, we\u2019re at capacity with a portfolio that\u2019s just rolling into a lot of new products. So the yield improvement potential is fairly significant. And then how we use that yield improvement in terms of where we use those extra heads and just gets very interesting as well. So where does the biggest marginal contribution occur as we free up capacity, whether or not it\u2019s head related or disc related or test related? So yes, we\u2019re at capacity, but it\u2019s \u2013 this is an extremely dynamic business that as you improve yield, you get more capacity, but as you get more capacity you may then decide to use that in more drives that have more heads and discs. So we\u2019re running the business the way we want to.", "Let me skip to your third question because they\u2019re related, as you pointed out. What that means is that when we scope a business to, quote, do 40 million units per quarter, then what we go do is we task the ops team to go figure out how in the same footprint and same capital budget how to get to 50 million. So it doesn\u2019t necessarily imply more capital per se. I think more capital would only be a function of was there some significant market opportunity; whether or not that was a spike in demand or a product opportunity from a technical leadership, which would then obviously be reflected in greater revenue growth or expanding gross margin.", " So we don\u2019t see any big change in where we run our business, and as you probably can tell we\u2019ve been really lean on capital and we\u2019ll continue to do so, even though we\u2019ve had some fairly significant one-time capital events like what we\u2019re doing in our factories to prepare for the consolidation that we identified. Exabyte growth, again, I think it\u2019s just really important for everyone, whether or not it\u2019s an analyst or an investor, to understand that the exabyte growth feels like it\u2019s going to continue in this kind of 20% to 35% range on an annual basis, but that doesn\u2019t mean every year quarter-over-quarter it\u2019s going to go up 20%. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve witnessed and that\u2019s \u2013 as I said before, it\u2019s going to be like this until we get more diversification of the cloud service providers or as corporations start to deploy cloud like architectures that are using these super high capacity drives.", "So whether or not you ask me for the next year or two years or 24 months or 18 months, my answer\u2019s kind of the same. It feels to us that the demand is going to continue for utilizing HDDs in the very highest capacity environments, and those are \u2013 that\u2019s a great trend for us because it\u2019s absorbing more heads and discs. It\u2019s a way more complicated channel. It\u2019s a way more complicated test, manufacturing tolerances are much more difficult and all of that translates into a product that has a lot higher value add. So we don\u2019t see any shift to that fundamental thesis.", "Ananda Baruah", "Great. Very helpful. Thank you.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of\u2026", "Steve Luczo", "And this will be our last one, operator, so we can end before the market opens.", "Operator", "All right. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele of Needham. Your line is now open.", "Rich Kugele", "Thank you. Just quickly, Steve, when will the Korat facility be ready to take on the capacity? And should we assume since you\u2019re doing gross margins already in the middle of your target range that once that\u2019s complete you can potentially get to the upper end of that range? Thanks.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes. I guess I don\u2019t want to necessarily say that right at this second. Again, there\u2019s no reason kind of getting wildly speculative about being at the upper end of the range. There\u2019s a lot of issues that go into that. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve disclosed when the Korat facility is going to be fully operational, and I\u2019m not sure we want to from a competitive perspective. So sometime in the next six months we\u2019re rolling into that facility.", "Rich Kugele", "Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.", "Steve Luczo", "Okay. All right. Great. So we\u2019re going to end the call here. Just want to thank everybody, certainly all the employees at Seagate, our suppliers, our customers, our investors and then we look forward to talking to everybody on the next quarter call.

The drivers of our improving performance, particularly in the December quarter are combination of market demand trends across our high capacity storage solution portfolio, component cost optimization within our storage products, and the structural cost improvements we are driving throughout our company, particularly within our manufacturing operations.", "For the December quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion, GAAP gross margins of 31%, net income of $297 million, and diluted earnings per share of $1.

ASPs of $66 were sequentially flat for the December quarter, and up 12% year-over-year.", "We believe, Seagate\u2019s December quarter demand environment reflects a generally stable, but mixed macroeconomic environment, as well as the continued acceleration in the deployment of cloud-based storage associated with usage shifts of technologies and architectures by end users. In addition, we saw strong sequential demand for higher capacity products in the consumer, surveillance, and NAS markets.", "Our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group demonstrated sequential growth in the December quarter, with particular strength for our flash-based solutions. We are pleased with Seagate\u2019s execution in the December quarter and throughout calendar 2016, both in terms of our ability to maximize the profitability of our technology portfolio and our continued execution on our cost reductions.", "I\u2019d like to thank Seagate\u2019s employees for their tremendous effort and contributions towards our business objectives.", "I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more detail on our operational activities.", "David Morton", "Thanks, Steve. With the shifts taking place in Seagate\u2019s business, there are few specific areas of our financial performance in the December quarter that I would like to provide further context to Steve\u2019s earlier discussion.", "For the December quarter, Seagate\u2019s addressable HDD market was in line with our forecast. We continue to drive our HDD product set sales towards our higher capacity products across our portfolio, benefiting both our revenue and margin results for the quarter.", "HDD enterprise revenue was up 5% year-over-year and represented 37% of our total consolidated revenue. Nearline product revenues were up 15% year-over-year and our ATB nearline product continues to be our leading revenue skew.", "Mission critical product sales remain stable and were up slightly, sequentially. HDD client high capacity growth opportunities include consumer, surveillance, DVR and NAS markets, and represent approximately 30% of total consolidated revenue. In the December quarter, revenue from these markets grew 19% year-over-year and average capacity per drive across these markets was approximately 1.9 terabyte per drive, up 20% year-over-year, and PC client shipments continue to represent 24% of consolidated HDD revenue.", "Operating expenses for the December quarter were $521 million on a GAAP basis and $458 million on a non-GAAP basis. During the December quarter, we implemented a certain cost reduction activities and recognized approximately $33 million in pre-tax restructuring charges.", "The magnitude of these cost efficiencies we implemented across our company in calendar 2016 to ensure the resiliency of our business has been upwards of $500 million over calendar 2015. In this short period of time, we have improved our factory utilization, reducing our manufacturing cost by approximately $200 million year-over-year, operating expenses, excluding variable compensation have been reduced by approximately $300 million year-over-year.", "We will continue to drive cost out of our manufacturing operations and operating expenses, as we move through the fiscal year. Capital expenditures were $95 million for the December quarter for maintenance capital, supporting the acceleration of the ramp of new products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment, and the accelerated expansion of our Korat facility to expedite the manufacturing footprint reductions that are in progress across many sites.", "Our capital expenditures and maintenance capital requirement levels are expected to be less than 5% of our revenue for the remainder of the fiscal year. And through our manufacturing consolidation activities, Seagate is and will continue to operate at or very near full capacity.", "Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was $656 million and free cash flow was $561 million. Our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the December quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $295 million ordinary shares outstanding.", "Our debt structure and level of interest expense is well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment grade framework, given our staggered maturities and low interest expense. Due to the confidence in our cash flow generation, our Board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the December quarter, payable on April 5.", "Our December quarter dividend payout of $188 million is at the low-end of our long-term target range of returning 30% to 50% of free cash flow. In addition, we deployed $147 million for the redemption of 4.1 million shares for the December quarter. Our ability to return to our long-term financial model in the December quarter is a reflection of our portfolio optimization, as well as Seagate\u2019s operational cost reductions.", "From a market demand perspective, we continue to believe that optimizing our full HDD portfolio to the structural shifts in the application workloads towards higher capacity will prove to be a resilient and competitive marketplace strategy. Combined with our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group, we review that approximately 80% of our storage product revenue opportunities in calendar 2017 have growth potential.", "At the same time, we have structured our refreshed portfolio to optimize the gains in areal density improvement, increasing storage capacity per drive, and in turn this enables us to lower our build and material per drive and redeploy the internal head and media components towards our highest margin products across the portfolio.", "While we are still in the process of executing many actions, we believe the overall cost alignment activities and the new high capacity and cost advantage products within our HDD product portfolio refresh will continue to benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of our fiscal and calendar year 2017.", "Given the current demand outlook and assuming a stable macroeconomic environment, we are confident in our ability to remain around a higher-end of our long-term targeted margin range of 27% to 32%, and within our operating income margin targeted range of 13% to 15% for FY 2017.", "I would now like to turn the call back to Steve.", "Steve Luczo", "Thanks, Dave. Over the course of 2016, Seagate demonstrated execution and focus towards structural improvements to our company\u2019s global operations. The ongoing shift from client server to mobile cloud architectures continues to create significant opportunities for core technology providers, such as Seagate, with an expanding customer base and high value-add opportunities associated with data retention and data analytics.", "As Dave mentioned, we have a refreshed cost optimized high capacity portfolio that is well-positioned in the consumer CE surveillance and NAS markets. Where we choose to participate in the PC market, we will lead with our one terabyte and higher products and our desktop products remain highly competitive. We will continue to be extremely competitive in the enterprise market with our business critical product portfolio.", "Our eight terabyte product leads the market in cost and performance and we are pleased with the ramp of our 10 terabyte product in terms of quality, performance, and customer qualifications. For the last few quarters, our 12 terabyte product has been with customers for evaluation and the feedback has been positive.", "During the next 12 to 18 months, we expect the nearline market to be diversified in capacity points for different application workloads, with use cases from two to four terabyte products for certain applications up to 16 terabyte for other use cases.", "From a macro perspective, we remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment and IT spending trends. We expect overall exabyte demand to grow double digits in calendar 2017 over 2016. For the March quarter, we anticipate the unit an exabyte demand environment to decline relatively seasonally.", "Our outlook for enterprise demand is stable and we will continue to drive the high capacity products in our portfolio and minimize exposure to the low capacity HDD market. We are expecting to achieve revenues of approximately $2.7 billion, representing a slightly less seasonal decline in revenue than the last two years.", "We expect to maintain margins at the mid to higher-end of our long-term range at approximately 30%. The sequential decline is primarily due to seasonality and some factory under absorption, as we transition Suzhou facility and other activities through the end of June.", "Operating expenses will trend down sequentially to approximately $440 million, reflecting further cost measures. In addition, assuming market conditions remain intact, we believe Seagate will achieve revenue growth in calendar 2017, with earnings per share of, at least, $4.50. These are significantly improved expectations from where we were last June and positions the company well for our operating and financial performance in calendar 2018.", "Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we will now open the call up for questions and answers.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment for questions. And our first question is from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.", "Richard Kugele", "First, can we just discuss a little bit more about the restructuring? Clearly, you\u2019ve made a lot of progress, those are all structural changes within Seagate. But can you just talk about how we should think about where Seagate excess calendar 2017, perhaps since that\u2019s the metric you\u2019re talking about from a maybe a COGS perspective or utilization if you want to look at that way, OpEx, is this the right level what we\u2019re seeing here for the March quarter exiting the year, how is the progress?", "David Morton", "Hi, Rich, this is Dave Morton, I\u2019ll tackle some of the OpEx ones and then turn it over to Dave Mosley to address some of the COGS and the improved efficiency there. I would take you back to middle of last year, where we had approximately two 8-Ks that we signaled upwards of $225 million of restructuring. We\u2019ve had a significant amount of that get recognized in the P&L, as we\u2019ve noticed on in the 8-K.", "With that said, we haven\u2019t necessarily seen all the savings come through, and those are just on the activities that we\u2019ve announced thus far. And so, as you think about the OpEx, that\u2019s going to continue to trend down.", "Now some of that\u2019s been masked a little bit by some of the variable compensation that\u2019s gone into the first-half. But we believe we\u2019re on a trajectory for that to continue to take steps down exiting not only the March, but continued into the back-half of the year. So that\u2019s our alignment right now. And then Dave in regards to\u2026", "Dave Mosley", "Yes, Rich, on COGS, it comes down to the utilization of our factories to first order, there\u2019s heads media and drive factories. And as we alluded to in the script, we\u2019re still in the consolidation phase on some of those. We have been for the last six months in earnest, but there\u2019s some work left to do.", "So your question directly was at the end of this calendar year, I think, some of it has to do with our product transitions that we\u2019ll still be going through throughout this calendar year as far as whether we can stay full, but we\u2019re planning to, I think, and so we\u2019re planning to stay at the same utilization rates that we have today albeit with a little bit smaller footprint when those factories finally come offline.", "Richard Kugele", "Okay, thank you. And then just quickly on technology, 8 terabyte is your most important skew so far and revenues. But as you look at the balance of the year, do you see 10 terabyte really being adopted in size, or will people just move to the 12 that\u2019s in qual today?", "Dave Mosley", "That\u2019s a difficult question, I think.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, just before we talk about it just so, I think one thing though, Rich, it\u2019s dangerous to conclude that it\u2019s all about 8s or 10s or 12s. I think what this quarter showed is, it\u2019s actually the breadth of the portfolio that matters. So, again, we had great results in the consumer space, the surveillance space, the NAS space, it\u2019s kind of all high capacity product for us and the profitability on the portfolio across the portfolio is quite significant. So I don\u2019t think you want to fall into a trap of thinking that it all comes from a terabytes, because that\u2019s not true.", "And then I think, Rich, as we add the higher capacity points, clearly there\u2019s a value proposition for some customers who have those kinds of installs and see the TCO benefits from the really high capacity drive. I think a soon as we as the industry get the next one out, still tend to want to move to the next one as well.", "So the 12s are out in evaluation that we\u2019ve been \u2013 for a a couple of quarters as we\u2019ve been talking about. And as we go to 2014 and 2016 and so on through the next year-and-a-half, I think, there\u2019s going to be continued motion here. Some people will stop at one that they\u2019re happy with who doesn\u2019t \u2013 don\u2019t want to take the risk on the new or can\u2019t get the new one, there\u2019s going to be a lot of those dynamics I think for \u2013 over the course of the next six quarters.", "Richard Kugele", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Please go ahead.", "Ananda Baruah", "Hey, thanks, guys, for taking the questions. Hey congratulations on the execution. Over the last nine months, it\u2019s been pretty impressive and the velocity has been pretty fantastic to see. I guess, just two quick ones for me. With regards to the sort of gross margin performance for the December Q and the ongoing sustainability of that, I \u2013 to what degree has the expansion \u2013 incremental expansion been from the capacity utilization action or the consolidation?", "And then to what degree is it been and will remain from other factors you guys have talked about, maybe improving gross margin profile in the non-enterprise products the rest of the portfolio, Steve, as you mentioned and anything else, I just like to get a sense of a magnitude of what the improvement has been from, and then I have a quick follow-up? Thanks.", "Steve Luczo", "I think, if you\u2019re breaking it down between product refresh and mix, if you will in demand shifts that we believe are sustainable and restructuring. I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably two-thirds on the product refresh so far, because not all of the restructuring is done. And so I think what we\u2019ll see is uplift from both as we continue, because we clearly expect the demand profile that continue to shift to the higher capacity points, that\u2019s why we\u2019re positioning the portfolio in the manufacturing footprint to support that, and of course, the manufacturing footprint will get more efficient.", "Ananda Baruah", "That\u2019s really helpful. And I guess, just a quick follow-up is, what is the current capacity utilization, or how you want to think about that? And it sounds like the \u2013 sort of the comments are you going to sustain that that, but what is the current way? Thanks a lot.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, I think we have a number of different operational units, if you will, through our heads process or media process and our drive process, there\u2019s a number of different lines. But we\u2019re running anywhere from 80% to a 100%, depending on how you view those factories and we\u2019ll stay there. There will be some places necessarily in the supply chain, where we need flexibility. But we intend to stay at about these levels.", "Ananda Baruah", "Thanks, much appreciated.", "Steve Luczo", "But also just remember, you can\u2019t as soon as one factory is at capacity, you\u2019re at capacity.", "Ananda Baruah", "That makes sense.", "Steve Luczo", "Yes, because we need lots of parts to make a disk drive.", "Ananda Baruah", "Thank you. Good luck.", "Steve Luczo", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Sherri Scribner", "Hi, thanks. If I look at the guidance on a year-over-year basis, you\u2019re guiding to revenue growth for the first time. But the implication suggests that units still are declining maybe roughly 10% on a year-over-year basis. I\u2019m trying to understand what is the implication of the annual unit declines for the HDD industry? Are those declines offset on the utilization basis because of the mix to higher capacities? Do you still need to take some capacity offline, because typically, when we look at sort of the leverage that you get it\u2019s based on the the unit mix or the units improving, but we\u2019re not really seeing that right now?", "Steve Luczo", "Well, it\u2019s really components improving versus what\u2019s the unit, right? So units will probably be flattish to down slightly maybe, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s kind of early to tell on that front, looks like this quarter unit demand was pretty good. I think for us, for sure, you remember, you always have to think about the market that we\u2019re focused on and which is what we\u2019re trying to get people understand that the Seagate addressable market is probably going to be diverging from what the other competitors think of as the market.", "So for the market that we\u2019re in, we actually would say, that it\u2019s probably going to be a growing market, because we see growth in all those applications that require high capacity. And then within that obviously, because it\u2019s the highest capacity technology that we\u2019re using then it\u2019s lots of heads and disk absorption, which goes along with the units. Then as you know, going from 8 to 10 to 12 to 16, you\u2019re going from six to eight disk, at least, on the nearline products and we do think there\u2019s opportunities for more heads and disc on desktop and notebook, as people need higher capacity as well.", "So I think from an absorption perspective, we feel pretty good \u2013 better than pretty good about calendar 2017 in terms of what it means in terms of our factory absorption, which is really what you\u2019re asking. And no, we don\u2019t need a disk drive unit growth to drive factory absorption like we used to, because the demand profile now is all about high capacity drives not about lots of little drives that aren\u2019t connected that go into PCs.", "Sherri Scribner", "So that makes a lot of sense. I was just trying to understand the dynamics, because clearly now there needs to be more of a focus on revenue as opposed to the unit growth, which is what we used to look out before?", "My second question would be, what is the implications for Seagate\u2019s business based on the administration changes we\u2019ve seen in the White House? I know, you guys are not incorporated in the U.S. But will you see any tax benefits potentially? How should we think about some of those changes, because we\u2019ve had a lot of questions about that. Thanks.", "Steve Luczo", "I\u2019ll let Dave talk about the tax implications in a second. I think from a usage perspective, we\u2019re encouraged that they will probably be a reacceleration of data acquisition systems, which had been stalled out fairly dramatically for the last several years. And I think the change in administration is probably going to result in some growth in that segment, which has been pretty stagnant for the last few years.", "On the tax and regulation side, Dave Morton has done a lot of work there. So I\u2019ll let him answer that question.", "David Morton", "Thanks, Steve, and thanks, Sherri. Seagate does carefully monitor any and all potential tax law changes, not only here in the U.S., but in all areas of the globe, where we operate. We continue to evaluate the various proposals coming out of Washington to determine what their potential impact might be. And most of the proposals and process and in flight do contain certain provisions, which could have both positive and negative impacts to the company.", "We do believe that the most serious tax proposals being considered, including the House Republican Blueprint with its border adjustability tax provision would not likely have a significant near-term impact for the company. But again, that\u2019s still under heavy review.", "Sherri Scribner", "Thanks so much.", "Operator", "And our next\u2026", "Steve Luczo", "Okay, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Amit Daryanani", "Thanks, glad I made it through the line. I guess, maybe to start with the free cash flow usage, you guys have had really impressive free cash flow for the few quarters beyond dividend would seem to be a comfortable thing for you guys to do. How do you think about deleveraging versus potentially returning to the M&A framework?", "Steve Luczo", "Well, those are the things we think about. And I think, probably the best thing is to just look at what we\u2019ve done historically. I think, we \u2013 how do we think about it first and foremost whether or not it\u2019s dividends or buybacks. Number one thing we think about is, maintaining enough investment in our core business to maintain the technology platforms that we have and the leadership positions we have, the technology, as we mentioned, in the response to Sherri\u2019s question is it\u2019s getting more difficult, but these to deliver devices at 12, 14, 16, 20 terabytes takes a lot of investment, a lot of technology.", "So first and foremost, we make sure that we\u2019re covered on that front. And then, we obviously protect ourselves in terms of downsides or anything like that. And then if there\u2019s excess cash flow, we think about M&A opportunities or returns to shareholders. And I think the Board has been fairly consistent and I expect to remain consistent of 30% to 50% of free cash flow being returned to the shareholders. That leaves us, given the cash flow generation capabilities of the company that leaves us a lot of cash flow to do things like M&A.", "So it\u2019s not \u2013 we don\u2019t think it constrained us \u2013 constrains us in anyway if we saw an opportunity that we felt was important to any sort of strategic direction we want to go in. And then that\u2019s just the issue between dividends and buybacks. And again, I think, if you look at our history, we try to maintain a dividend base that is kind of at the low-end of that range. And then what we do above that is probably buybacks opportunistically when we see discrepancies in the valuation versus what we think the long-term value of the company is.", "Amit Daryanani", "Fair enough. And if I could just follow-up, you talked about being able to operate at the higher-end of your gross margin range for calendar 2017, what would enable you to operate at or above that range, because mix is only better and I think your manufacturing savings ahead of you?", "David Morton", "Yes, I mean, you\u2019re nailing both of them, right. We\u2019ve got through the March quarter and then extending into June in the back-half of the year. A lot of those savings will come to fruition on that top line, as well as some of the mix iterations and as we continue to ramp up the portfolio as well. So that\u2019s where we have a high degree of confidence in enabling that that sustainability in those levels at that margin range.", "Amit Daryanani", "Thank you.", "Steve Luczo", "Okay, great. I would like to thank everyone for joining us today, and particularly our customers and our suppliers and our employees and our investors obviously. We appreciate your support over the last year, and we look forward to speaking in the next quarter.

As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Kate Scolnick, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please proceed, Kate.", "Kate Scolnick - Seagate Technology Plc", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call we are hosting from Dublin, Ireland. Joining me today from Seagate's executive team are Steve Luczo, Chairman and CEO; Dave Morton, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Dave Mosley, President and Chief Operating Officer.", "We've posted our earnings press release and detailed supplemental information for our June quarter and year-end fiscal 2017 on our Investor Relations site at Seagate.com.", "During today's call, we will review the highlights for the June quarter and fiscal year 2017 and provide the company's outlook for the September quarter and then open the call for questions.

Please go ahead, Steve.", "Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc", "Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. For today's earnings call I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business. And Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights. And I will close the call with our outlook for the September quarter.", "Before I begin my operational comments, I would like to discuss our announcement today of Seagate's CEO succession plan. Today, Seagate's Board of Directors voted unanimously in favor of my transition to Executive Chairman of Seagate and appointed Dave Mosley as Chief Executive Officer. Dave and I will assume our new roles effective October 1, at which time I will shift my focus primarily to strategic growth initiatives and other opportunities designed to enhance shareholder value for the company. Dave has also been appointed to the Seagate's Board of Directors effective immediately.", "Over the last two years the board and I have been focused on executive management succession. In addition to Dave's appointment, Dave Morton transitioned to CFO 18 months ago. And recently we have appointed Jim Murphy, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Marketing; Kate Schuelke as Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, and Corporate Secretary; and Ravi Naik as our Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer.", "In addition, as part of the restructuring actions taken over the last 12 months to optimize our global manufacturing and development center investments, we have also aligned all of our manufacturing operations under Senior Vice President of Operations, Jeff Nygaard. And we have reorganized our R&D functions to meet the evolving storage marketplace requirements.", "The board and I believe we have the right management team and organizational structure in place to execute Seagate's business strategy, capitalize on opportunities in the storage marketplace, and continue to create long term shareholder value.", "It's been an honor and a privilege for me to serve as Seagate's CEO in 16 of the last 20 years. I'm grateful to our amazing employees, customers, suppliers, and shareholders. And I look forward to working closely with the management team on our future opportunities in my new role as Executive Chairman at Seagate.", "Turning to our operational results. The overall macro environment continues to exhibit stability. And we believe this will continue through the rest of the calendar year and well into 2018. We remain cautiously optimistic that this should translate to moderate IT spending growth.", "In the context of the storage marketplace the major transformative shifts from a client server to mobile cloud high capacity mass storage deployments continue to represent significant opportunity for Seagate. The long term trajectory of growth in infrastructure spending for the large cloud service providers and hyperscale companies remains intact, as they continue to increase their service offerings and demonstrate significant business momentum.", "At the same time, the more mature enterprise storage technologies remain a large percentage of the overall IT storage market and can exhibit variance beyond seasonal patterns as the structural shift to a wide variety of IT and cloud service providers accelerates.", "In addition, the end-to-end storage supply chain is continuing to experience price increases by as much as 2 times to 3 times in the memory markets. The effect of this significant price increase is evidenced by some near time enterprise customer demand softness, which we believe will be resolved over the next several quarters.", "For the June quarter Seagate achieved revenues of approximately $2.4 billion, GAAP gross margins of 27.7%, net income of $114 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.38. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 28.9%, up 310 basis points year over year, net income of $192 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.65.", "HDD exabyte shipments for the June quarter were 62 exabytes. Average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was approximately 1.8 terabytes per drive. And ASPs per unit were $64.", "We saw strength in the quarter from our largest nearline U.S. based CSP customers and relative seasonal demand in the compute and branded markets. Offsetting this was weakness in our enterprise storage customers, including traditional OEM nearline and mission critical demand, China CSP nearline demand, and our own Cloud Storage Systems business. In addition, there was weakness in the surveillance and NAS markets due to some intraquarter channel inventory management.", "As a result, our overall revenue results were approximately 5% below plan, with approximately half of that shortfall from our Cloud Storage Systems and half from HDD enterprise weakness and channel inventory management. We believe some of these factors, particularly China CSP demand and NAS and surveillance market demand, are temporal and supply chain related, while some of the OEM revenue declines are more structural.", "Our non-GAAP margin results of 28.9% were approximately 210 basis points below our guidance. Within this, approximately two-thirds of the impact was due to operational trends issues in our CSSG business and approximately one-third was due to lower than expected enterprise and surveillance HDD portfolio mix.", "GAAP operating expenses were $470 million, down 16% year over year. And non-GAAP operating expenses were $422 million, down 5% year over year.", "Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $243 million. And free cash flow was $139 million, up 13% year over year.", "While we were disappointed to not meet our top-line targets in the June quarter, Seagate effectively achieved our operating margin and gross margin profitability targets for fiscal year 2017. For the year, diluted earnings per share grew 215% on a GAAP basis and 82% on a non-GAAP basis. In addition, for fiscal year 2017 we generated $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations and returned 53% of that to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.", "In summary, I'm pleased with the operational improvements we made in fiscal year 2017. And we are well positioned for the markets that are being served by our products and systems. I'll now turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more details on our operational activities.", "David H. Morton, Jr. - Seagate Technology Plc", "Thanks, Steve. For the June quarter we achieved $2.4 billion in revenue and shipped 62 exabytes of storage, with an average capacity per drive of 1.8 terabytes. For the enterprise market we shipped 23.5 exabytes, with an average capacity per drive of 3.4 terabytes. Our average capacity per drive for our nearline products has reached over 4.8 terabytes per drive, up 8% over last year's strong 8-terabyte sales quarter and up 60% from the June quarter two years ago.", "We continue to ramp our 10TB nearline product and shipped approximately 300,000 units in the June quarter. Our sales for this capacity point have almost doubled over the last two quarters. And we expect to ship approximately 1 million 10TB units in the September quarter. In addition, our 12TB product shipped for revenue in the June quarter with excellent customer feedback. And we are confident our qualification process is competitive. We expect to achieve approximately 50% of the exabyte share within the 10TB and 12TB market by the end of the calendar year.", "The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployment continue to represent a significant opportunity for Seagate. And we are confident in our nearline HDD portfolio designed to serve these storage environments. Over the next 12 months to 18 months, we expect the nearline market to be diversified in capacity points for different application workloads with use cases from 2TB to 4TB products for certain applications and up to 16 terabyte for other use cases.", "In the client and retail markets our 1TB per platter, 2.5-inch platform continues to perform well. And to date, we have shipped over 45 million drives, substantially ahead of the competition. Using similar technology, our 2TB per platter, 3.5-inch platform began ramping last quarter for desktop markets, providing great value for customers needing 2TB, 4TB, and 8TB client capacity points. Customer feedback indicates we are well ahead of the competition.", "Operating expenses for the June quarter were $470 million on a GAAP basis and $422 million on a non-GAAP basis, down 5% year over year. Total consolidated expenses were slightly lower than forecast, primarily due to lower variable compensation.", "We continued to identify areas for cost improvements. And this morning we filed a restructuring plan that will provide savings of approximately $90 million annually. These cost actions provide support of our objective to exit the calendar year with non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $400 million per quarter. In addition to these actions, we will continue to manage our operating expenses tightly, targeting approximately $375 million per quarter by the end of FY 2018.", "Capital expenditures were $104 million for the June quarter for maintenance capital and manufacturing footprint redeployment, supporting the continued ramp of new HDD products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment.", "Cash flow from operations in the June quarter was $243 million. And free cash flow was $139 million. These results include approximately $50 million in cash payments related to previously announced restructuring charges.", "Our balance sheet remains healthy. And we ended the June quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 292 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the June quarter, which will be payable on October 4.", "Interest expense for the June quarter was $62 million and will be lower in the September quarter due to the lower debt balance. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rate.", "In FY 2017 we successfully completed a debt offering of $1.25 billion of investment grade financing with weighted average interest rate of less than 5% and paid $316 million to repurchase and redeem outstanding debt, including our 2021's 7% senior notes.", "Overall, our operational and financial performance in FY 2017 reflect execution of our business model profitability improvement objectives and our ability to generate cash flow from our Storage portfolio. Looking ahead, we will continue to optimize our business model and focus on our go to market and product portfolio advancements towards the future growth opportunity markets.", "I would now like to turn the call back to Steve.", "Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc", "Thanks, Dave. Turning to the market outlook. We remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment and IT and enterprise spending trends. We believe the end to end supply chain issues we identified last quarter will persist at least through the end of the year. And therefore, we want to exercise more caution than seasonally normal for traditional enterprise spending and other markets affected by higher than normal supply chain pricing.", "At the same time we are continuing to anticipate a stronger back half of the calendar year for exabyte growth with the CSP ecosystem and seasonal demand for our other major markets, including PCs and the branded market.", "For the September quarter we are expecting to achieve revenues of between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion. Our gross margin expectations for the September quarter are relatively flat and within our 29% to 33% targeted range. Cash flow from operations will be up sequentially.", "As Dave indicated, non-GAAP operating expenses will trend sequentially down to approximately $415 million in the September quarter. And we expect to exit the December quarter at or below $400 million. While we are not on a trajectory to meet our previous guide of non-GAAP EPS of $4.50 for calendar year 2017, we do anticipate revenue and profit growth sequentially for the December quarter.", "Thank you for joining us on the call today. And we'll now open the call up for questions and answers.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question is from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is open.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. Two questions from me. First of all, on the Nearline Enterprise business, have you identified any market share shifts that might have hurt either the quarter or your outlook?", "And then secondly, in terms of the non-HDD business, the Enterprise Systems and Flash business, you've done a bunch of acquisitions in there over the last few years. It's had sort of fits and starts. And this quarter is somewhat disappointing. I guess I'm wondering if you could just sort of step back and give us your big picture take on those acquisitions and the progress you expect to make in the coming quarters? Thanks.", "William David Mosley, Ph.D. - Seagate Technology Plc", "Yeah, Steve. This is Dave Mosley. Let me try the first one. They're somewhat interrelated, I think, your two questions. So on the nearline side, some customers you're heavy with and other customers you're not as heavy with. So there are some fundamental shifts going on, depending on capacity points. I think at the highest capacity points there are some things about our ramp that we're not happy with. The product is really good. And we're ramping it hard right now.", "At the lower capacity points, the 4 terabytes and 8 terabytes and things like that, quite happy with our products. That's where some of the China CSP behavior and the smaller customers and their issues that they had across their supply chain were affected. So there's slight share shifts going on. But really only the highest capacity point is super relevant, and we think that's temporal.", "Like I said, the two questions that you asked are interrelated somewhat. The systems business that we have is \u2013 there's a few different kinds of business in there. There's some specialty products buildout that we do. And then there's some things where we're really acting more like an ODM, I'll say. And that stuff is not very good business.", "And obviously a lot of ODMs got themselves into situations with the supply chain issues where either they were underwater or they couldn't procure parts at the right point. They had supply that was older supply, so to speak. So it was a really tough road for the last two quarters in that. And we're going to have to really take a look at how much of that business we continue to support going forward.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Great. That's very helpful. Appreciate the color.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yeah. Thank you. Steve, congrats on retirement. Dave, congrats on the new role. Just a question on gross margins. Appreciate that you've guided flat for September. But when you take a more medium term look out a couple of quarters, is 29% the right normalized gross margin to think about? Or are there costs in the September quarter around the 10- and 12-terabyte ramp around enterprise mix that you think is depressing the gross margin in September? And you would expect a rebound from that level? Thank you.", "Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc", "So, Katy, let me first say, while I appreciate your congratulations on the retirement, much to my children's chagrin, I have not retired. In fact, this is probably the best way for me to stay engaged with the company for a few more years. But I did I suppose retire from the CEO job. But so I'm super happy about where I'm headed and what my engagement will be with the company. Also super happy that Mosley is CEO.", "As I said to someone the other day, that running a disc drive company is a little bit like driving in stop-and-go traffic. Sometimes you're going 15 miles an hour and sometimes you're going 85 miles an hour. But you usually get to your destination on time and no one's hurt. But it's stressful as shit for the driver and oftentimes for the passengers too. So I think we have a younger driver with better reaction times now.", "The \u2013 I think your point is right on where we're headed on margins. The way we see the math, to your point, clearly ramps are always challenging, whether or not it's a 2.5-inch notebook product or a 3.5-inch surveillance product or a high-end nearline product. And whenever you're ramping the products, the yields come up the ramp. And you get better and you also do redesigns and bring costs down. And you also start to understand customer needs, which allow you to optimize the firmware, et cetera, et cetera. So we would expect that with the ramp on those products and the overall mix-up that occurs as customers move from 10s [terabytes] to 12s [terabytes] to 14s [terabytes] to 16s [terabytes] that we have opportunity to move up in that margin range.", "I think the good news on the quarter frankly is even with the weakness that we had in nearline and mission critical in certain customer bases and even within the services group, the margins that they did contribute were not what they should have been. Even with that, the overall margin structure was pretty solid, which I think should give you a good sense of the underlying core HDD business is operating pretty nicely right now. And yes, it should improve as we execute here in the second half of the year.", "William David Mosley, Ph.D. - Seagate Technology Plc", "Yeah.", "Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from C. J. Muse of Evercore. Your line is open.", "C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC", "Yeah. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I guess two questions. First part, in terms of your commentary on enterprise, can you walk through in a little more detail what you're seeing as temporary versus structural? And then I guess as a follow-up question on the gross margins side, is Enterprise still above 40%? Or do we see it dip below there? And how should we think about I guess that part of your business going forward? Thank you.", "Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc", "Yeah. Let me answer that. And then I'll turn the other thing back to Mosley. Like, we've never talked about where our gross margins are by products. And it's a really dangerous game to get in, because we're so leveraged in our manufacturing and our R&D systems that to try and actually splice margins by segments, while it may be a fun accounting practice, it's really deceiving from an overall business practice.", "I will tell you though that our client portfolio has definitely greened up in terms of the technologies we're deploying. And again we have an areal density lead there that's now going on almost two years. So that means fewer heads and discs. So to reach the same capacity points those clearly have better margins than they did historically for us competitively.", "So but I think the real message here is that it's you have to view it as the manufacturing company as a whole. And we strive to get as much leverage as we can across the components into the products as possible.", "William David Mosley, Ph.D. - Seagate Technology Plc", "And then on the enterprise commentary, there's a structural piece in the sense that our mission critical lines are continuing to decrease somewhat. Some of that is penetration from flash. Some of that's architectural issues that are going on in the enterprise. And we may see some rebound of that with new chipsets that are coming out from Intel, for example.", "But it's kind of interesting, because the last few quarters \u2013 we saw a strong back half to the last calendar year. But the last few quarters have been weaker. And that's counter intuitive with flash prices going up the way they did. So that's the stuff that we're referring to as structural though.", "The temporal stuff, it's very different. If you look at the bill of materials, whether you're a cloud service provider, you're world \u2013 around the world or whether you're an enterprise builder, the bill of materials was dramatically upset because of some component price increases. And tradeoffs had to be made inside of that. In some cases the tradeoffs can't be made, because your supply chain can't do the build with the right economics. In some cases you'll make the tradeoff by saying, I'll prioritize this memory architecture right now or this amount of DRAM for example right now. And then I'll hold.", "The good news on that front for us is \u2013 well, first the bad news. The bad news is exabytes have been rather flat all the way through last year. And that doesn't make sense for where the cloud is going. The good news is from the discussions that we have with our customers worldwide, growth of bits inside of data centers is still on a pretty healthy pace. And so this will come back. We've seen this a number of different times in our industry. And that's why we'll call it temporal.", "C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi. Thank you. I guess I wanted to ask about the restructuring. Was this something that you already had planned in prior quarters? Or was the restructuring a result of something that happened during this quarter that made you feel like you needed to take some additional cost actions?", "David H. Morton, Jr. - Seagate Technology Plc", "Hi, Sherry. This is Dave. No. This has been in constant dialogue and under plan, as we continued to drive to a glide path of exiting calendar year \u2013 this calendar year under $400 million. And so this has long been in process as we go out and continue to drive further synergies amongst the organizations. And how we continue to repivot to higher yielding, higher portfolioed product sets that we bring to market.", "So to your point, this is something that we've definitely had under long consideration and have taken the necessary actions.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay.", "Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc", "Yeah. If you go back a year ago, we kind of \u2013 I think we did at the June call of last year indicate that we were going to take a variety of actions on the manufacturing side to address the capacity issues and where that would have a significant COGS impact, which is obviously reflected.", "And secondly, that we were going to work OpEx on two different vectors. One was absolute OpEx dollars, and the other was to maintain our margin model that we've committed to and we're staying committed to. That one, as you may remember, wasn't kind of on the steady ramp down, because the last six months of last year were quite strong. And we needed to keep a fair amount of people in place to actually meet the upside demand. And there was also some critical product transitioning going on that we felt it made sense to keep the resources in place to make sure those transitions went well. And that benefited us extremely through fiscal year 2017, where we obviously overachieved fairly dramatically relative to where we were a year ago.", "So I think we're back on how do we get to $400 million? I would probably say though, as we think about going from $400 million to $375 million, that that is not a reflection so much of something going on in the market as much as a reflection of what happens when you start making adjustments to your OpEx. You obviously then see other opportunities where you can take some additional actions. And some of it is also related to things that Dave Mosley mentioned about what's the quality of business that we're doing in the systems side? And what's the underlying OpEx support for that? And does that math really make sense?", "So a little bit of that, I'd say in terms of how we're going to get from $400 million to $375 million. But not like market-related to the sale of disk drives. It's more I think related to what we think we can do within the context we've always described as one that's positive.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then on the nearline, just quickly. That piece, I think you did a good job of describing where the weakness was. And it sounds like the cloud is still healthy. But can you give us some sense of the mix in nearline in terms of the exabyte shipments? I think I've heard generally 50% goes to cloud and 50% goes to traditional businesses. But it'd be helpful to have some perspective on that. Thanks.", "William David Mosley, Ph.D. - Seagate Technology Plc", "I think it's probably a little lower going to the cloud service providers. If by the cloud service providers, you mean the top \u2013 the biggest ones of them, right? It's probably a little bit lower than that historically.", "We did get into this discussion about structural versus temporal and noted some of the weakness among OEM nearline worldwide. And some of that may be structural as well, Sherri. I'd say as people are looking to buy, they may be buying from ODMs or other third parties, their non-traditional customers. And that model is accelerating. It's not going back to the old way. So some of that \u2013 that's been soft. But some of it may be structural as well.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc", "Okay. I think we have time for one more question, because I know we're running into the open here. And we want to be respectful of that.", "Operator", "Yes, sir. Our next question is from Stanley Kovler of Citi Research. Your line is open.", "Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Yes. Thank you very much for taking the question here. I just wanted to better understand where we are from a technical perspective. You'd talked about some changes in R&D in terms of getting to the next node and HAMR type of technology.", "And then also if we could just review what you think about in terms of your policy around keeping folks updated around quarters with respect to mid-quarter updates, pre-announcements, and those types of activities, that would be great. Thank you.", "Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc", "I'll do the HAMR first. So this is a technology, for everyone's benefit, that we've been working on for quite some time in the hard drive industry. It's the next S-curve. The top of the areal density curve that we're on right now, it's getting harder and harder to squeeze that much more out of.", "The progress \u2013 and we haven't talked about HAMR very much in the last two years. But the progress has actually been pretty substantial in the labs both on the reliability front, which was really the issue, and then on the demonstration of areal density front as well. So historically we had talked about 20-terabyte drives in 2020. And we still are on path for those kind of demonstrations. We're going to shoot as high as we can. And we may even get above that based on what we're seeing in the labs right now. But productization is looking more and more favorable all the time. And we're going to be driving hard from it from inside of Seagate.", "So what that means is there's been a lot of discussions about 12 [terabytes] and 14 [terabytes] and then ultimately we'll get to 16 terabytes. But we will get to 20 [terabytes] and 24 terabytes some day. And we're seeing that \u2013 those kind of components in the labs right now that with the right amount of coaxing, we'll get them into products and get them out to the markets.", "And then on...", "David H. Morton, Jr. - Seagate Technology Plc", "Yeah, Stanley, this is Dave Morton. In regards to a definitive process per se on a pre or not a pre, I think the approach that the management team took this go-round was, given the fact that there was so much information coming together and lack of visibility of what was really extending out, not only between this quarter but to the back half of the year's results, we opted to have a further context and full disclosure and earnings call set around the full year, versus just the current situation at hand to be able to provide a full context to our investors and shareholders. So that was our thought process that went into it.", "Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Thanks. Very helpful.", "Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc", "Okay. I'd like to thank everyone for taking the time to be on the call today and thanks to our employees and our customers and suppliers and investors. Look forward to talking to you next call.

We are pleased to be part of the consortium and to help facilitate maintaining Toshiba Memory as a world-leading, independent NAND technology company.", "Over the course of many years, Seagate's developed a long-term relationship with Toshiba Memory, and we have always been impressed with their consistent leadership in advancing NAND technology. We believe that Bain Capital is dedicated to the long-term success of Toshiba Memory, and this acquisition is in the long-term best interest of our industry and the storage customers worldwide.", "In addition, we expect to enter into a long-term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory, and that will provide continuity of raw NAND for our expanding product portfolio. We have developed our NAND storage technology portfolio over the last several years and today, we have a broad offering of flash-based products that are ready to scale and grow across multiple markets.", "Our NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory will enable Seagate to continue innovating and providing customers with storage solutions that fit their needs, be it HDDs, SSDs or hybrid solutions.

For the September quarter, we achieved $2.6 billion in revenue and shipped a record 70.3 exabytes of storage, with an average capacity per drive of 1.9 terabytes, also a record. For the enterprise HDD market, we shipped 27.2 exabytes, with a record average capacity of 3.9 terabytes per drive.", "Our average capacity per drive for our nearline products reached over 5.4 terabytes per drive, up 17% over last year's strong ATB demand and up 75% from the September quarter two years ago.", "The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate, and we are confident in our nearline HDD portfolio designed to serve these environments.", "Over the next 12 months to 18 months, we expect a diverse and strong market with multiple capacity points for different application workloads. Use cases will cause capacity points to span from two terabytes to four terabytes for certain applications and up to 16 terabytes for other customer needs. At Seagate, we believe we are well poised to help our cloud customers with our stringent and varied requirements.", "Our 10-terabyte helium nearline product was our leading enterprise revenue SKU in the September quarter, and we shipped over 1 million 10 terabyte units, up threefold from the June quarter. We also achieved sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12-terabyte helium nearline product in the September quarter. Customer feedback has been excellent and we are confident in our competitiveness across our key customer qualification processes.", "For the December quarter, we are planning for significant sequential volume and revenue growth for our 10-terabyte and our 12-terabyte helium products as the market adoption grows.", "In the edge and consumer verticals, our 1-terabyte per platter, 2.5-inch platform continues to perform well. Using our areal density advantage, our 2-terabyte per platter, 3.5-inch platform continues to ramp for desktop markets, providing a great value for customers needing 2-terabyte, 4-terabyte and 8-terabyte capacity points. Customer feedback indicates we are well ahead of the competition in these important verticals.", "Within this, notebook compute revenue was up 37% year-over-year, with exabytes up 75% year-over-year.

Our gaming business revenue grew sequentially 13% and average capacity per drive was up 27% over last year.", "We continue to be selective in our participation in this market, and we are focused on the highest capacity areas for the gaming customers that are demanding more local mass storage for their rich gaming experiences.", "Our non-HDD revenue, primarily from our cloud systems and silicon group, in the September quarter was 242 million, up 30% quarter-over-quarter and up 17% year-over-year.", "Our operating expenses for the September quarter were 481 million on a GAAP basis and 408 million on a non-GAAP basis, down 14% year-over-year. Total operating expenses were slightly lower than forecast, primarily due to restructuring and other cost-containment measures.", "We continue to identify areas for cost improvements, and during the September quarter, we divested the majority of our high-performance computing assets, which will result in a cost savings of approximately 20 million a year and impact revenues by approximately 50 million per year in our non-HDD revenue. We remain on track to exit the calendar year with non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately 400 million per quarter.", "Capital expenditures were 124 million for the September quarter for maintenance capital and manufacturing footprint redeployment, supporting the continued ramp of our new HDD products in our portfolio, which utilize new tooling and equipment. For December quarter, we expect capital expenditures to decrease sequentially and remain less than 5% of our total consolidated revenue for FY 2018.", "Cash flow from operations in the September quarter was 237 million, and free cash flow was 113 million. These results include approximately 46 million in cash payments related to previously announced restructuring charges and some inventory staging related to a strong October demand signals. For the December quarter, we anticipate cash flow from operations to be at least two times more than the September quarter due to working capital improvements in our business outlook.", "Our balance sheet remains heavy \u2013 healthy, and we ended the September quarter with 2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, with 289 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the September quarter, which will be payable on January 3, 2018.", "Interest expense for the September quarter was 61 million. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. In the September quarter, we deployed 166 million to redeem 5 million shares and 22 million towards redeeming our 2018 senior notes.", "As Dave Mosley noted, at the end of September, we announced our participation in the consortium led by Bain Capital Private Equity that has entered into an agreement with Toshiba Corporation to acquire Toshiba Memory Corporation.", "We committed to provide up to $1.25 billion in financing to support the acquisition. Upon closing, we would expect to fund the transaction with existing cash balances and some short-term financing mechanisms, including the long-term NAND supply agreements we expect to enter with Toshiba Memory, we anticipate this transaction to be accretive to our earnings.", "Overall, our operational and financial performance in the September quarter reflects execution of our business model and profitability improvement objectives. Looking ahead, we will continue to optimize our business and focus on aligning our go-to-market and product portfolio advancements towards the future growth opportunity markets.", "I would now like to turn the call back to Dave Mosley. ", "Dave Mosley", "Thanks, Dave. The long-term trajectory of growth and infrastructure spending in the large cloud service providers and hyperscale companies appear intact, as they continue to demonstrate and increase their service offerings and exhibit significant business momentum.", "Critical to supporting the massive growth in data is our ability to continue to provide mass storage solutions that optimize areal density and have the greatest reliability, quality and total cost of ownership benefits. Seagate has demonstrated technology leadership with generations of storage technologies and products.", "Over the last five years, we have been the leader in areal density with our SMR and TDMR areal density solutions, and we continue to make progress towards the introduction of our heat-assisted magnetic recording, or HAMR, technology portfolio, which is expected to be shipping in volume in 2019.", "Over the past year, we have been ramping production of our HAMR evaluation drives, and we have shared samples of current generation shipping product with HAMR technology substituted in these devices. Early customer feedback from more than six months ago, using standard qualification processes, demonstrates that the technology will not require any changes for customers to adopt.", "We believe that HAMR technology opens up a rich design space for high capacity and great value, and we've been communicating that with customers for some months now. In terms of future investment in order to launch our HAMR portfolio, the costs are already contemplated in our existing operating expense and capital expenditure long-term model.", "While we don't have time today, I personally am looking forward to discussing more about HDD areal density and future technology development at our next strategic update that Kate mentioned earlier.", "Turning to our market outlook. With major transformative shifts taking place in the storage marketplace from client server to mobile cloud, high-capacity mass storage deployments continue to represent significant opportunity for Seagate. We remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment as well as enterprise and consumer spending trends.", "On the heels of the various IT component supply constraints, we witnessed in late calendar 2016 and early 2017. We are continuing to monitor outgoing inventory closely. From Seagate's vantage point, our channel inventory positions and inventory for our customers that are visible to us are, in general, lower than last year. Sell-through appears reasonable.", "For the December quarter, we anticipate strong exabyte growth with the CSP ecosystem, normal seasonal demand for our other major markets, including PCs in the consumer market and sequential growth in our Cloud Systems and silicon businesses. Almost all of our vertical markets are now engaged in exabyte growth again compared to the first half of the calendar year.", "Given this demand environment, for the December quarter, we expect to achieve revenues up approximately 3% to 5% sequentially from the September quarter. This is consistent to slightly better than the sequential growth we saw at this time last year.", "Gross margins to expand slightly sequentially and within our 29% to 33% long-term range; non-GAAP operating expenses down sequentially 2% to 3%, with further cost containment measures, as we continue to manage our operating expenses tightly, targeting approximately $375 million per quarter by the end of fiscal 2018; and cash flow from operations to be up significantly sequentially, with improvements in working capital and less restructuring costs.", "In summary, I'd like to thank our customers, employees, suppliers and business partners for their contributions to our quarter's results. Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open up the call for questions-and-answers. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Edward Parker from BTIG. Your line is open.", "Edward Parker", "Great. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask you about your exabyte ships. And it looks like the growth in the quarter was mostly from non-nearline, and so nearline has actually been down year-over-year for the past couple of quarters.", "So, I recognize it's a really tough comp from last year, but I was wondering if you could speak a little bit more specifically as to what you're seeing in that segment, what you're hearing from your customers and what type of exabyte growth you would expect over the next 12 to 18 months? Thanks.", "Dave Mosley", "Thanks, Edward. Yes, it is a pretty tough comp year-over-year. I think, if I think about 2016, calendar 2016, we were strong from March through November in all markets geographically. So CSPs were strong, and we saw strength in some of the more nascent cloud spaces.", "We believe that the various component supply issues that existed and pricing of those components and so on actually caused a little bit of an overbuy and some further disruption in the supply chain, which we've talked about. And so, some of the markets, not necessarily all the CSPs, but some of the markets, were impacted in early 2017.", "And I would say, at this point, all the way through July, we were still seeing that impact. August and September started to turn back on, which resulted in some of the growth that we saw in the quarter. But to your point, it's not back to the level it was before, although it appears to be coming back.", "What we hear inside of the data centers is that the exabyte growth is still high, so the bit growth is still high. That's irrespective of whether you're talking to large-scale CSPs or some of the smaller cloud players who still have yet to build out the scale.", "But people couldn't exactly stretch for all those solutions. And now it looks like now they figured out architecturally how they're going to respond to the new cost structures or maybe they had supply -- other supply chain issues that would cause them to -- some of their suppliers to not want to build for them for a while. I think we're through most of that, and I think we're seeing the world starting to turn on.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Katy Huberty", "Thank you. Good morning. I just want to follow-up on the enterprise segment. While there is a tough compare, exabytes did recover sequentially and the decline was less year-on-year. But you're seeing more aggressive pricing, both sequentially and year-on-year. So, can you just talk about how much of that is mix shift to cloud versus more aggressive pricing in the market? Thank you.", "Dave Mosley", "Right, Katy, I'd say that there is mix shift going on. I'll let Dave talk about the pricing.", "Dave Morton", "Yes, I would classify any pricing you may see as more of a normal mix shift versus a like-for-like across consistent customers within that same channel. Pricing has been relatively benign. And so, to your point, as the exabytes continue to expand in this data rich area, pricing has not been a major factor across all of our nearline portfolio.", "Dave Mosley", "Right. Year-over-year, last year, we were talking about 8 terabytes. Now we're talking about 10s and 12s at the high-end. But especially back to Edward's question, the 4s and 8s now, even 2s, are very relevant in some applications in some of the smaller cloud players. So...", "Katy Huberty", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christian Schwab from Craig-Hallum Capital. Your line is open.", "Christian Schwab", "Great. Thanks for taking my call great quarter. Can you -- as we talk about the cloud and the hyperscale and the increased offerings, which we're hearing about as well, do you have any changes in outlook for exabyte growth over the next three years versus what you previously thought?", "Dave Mosley", "I'd say, great question, Christian. The exabyte growth, as both the previous people have asked the question about, has been rather muted this last year if you look at it in aggregate. And some of that's driven by the cloud, some of it is driven by other dynamics. Long term, we think data's growing at 30% to 35%.", "We've been talking about that fairly openly, but the fact that we're off to a trend this year, means that we'll get back on the trend in the future. Now how fast does it come back, some of that depends on the architectural nuance that I referred to earlier. Are people truly on to further architectures that they can deploy? Or do they still have parts in the system? And what's going on with their specific applications?", "I actually think we're going into fairly healthy period of the growth that gets us back on to the trend line, and that's what's something we're trying to respond to. We can do it with higher and higher capacity drives because we have areal density to solution it.", "Christian Schwab", "Great. And then just one quick follow-up, just as far as you look at your solid state drive business and the broadening portfolio, obviously, with the long-term supply NAND agreement with the technology leader, are you guys prepared to give any expectations of how big that business could be in three to five years?", "Dave Mosley", "Not yet because, I think, to our points on the script, which I don't want to go into more detail on, I think it depends on exactly the natures of the deal. I will say that the work that we've been doing with customers means we have a lot of options. There are customers who really like our solutions.", "I think our portfolio is a little too varied , actually, right now, too many interfaces and different solutions for our customers. I think we're going to have to make sure we pick and choose exactly which ones that we want to scale, but I think we have a lot of options.", "Christian Schwab", "Great. I don't have any other questions. Thank you.", "Dave Mosley", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital. Your line is open.", "Ananda Baruah", "Hi, thanks guys. And congrats for a solid quarter. I would love to just get your take on, I guess, the conviction and then what would be the levers to get the growth margin over time to move back to, say, the midpoint of your range?", "And then just I'll just make another one in there, too. Your share count, you continue to move it down. Is that opportunistic buying at these levels or should we think about a return to sort of share count to $250 million philosophy? Thanks, on both of this.", "Dave Mosley", "Yes. I think, from the margin perspective, to see exabyte growth go back, to Christian's question, I think that's the most relevant point. Obviously, 2017 or early 2017 was rather muted on exabyte growth. We think it'll come back. And on the share count, I'll let Dave answer. ", "Dave Morton", "Yes, the share count, it's back within overall capital allocation, the system that we've been working at over returning over 30% to 50% of our cash flow back to shareholders. And so, obviously, we've been fairly muted on our buybacks, which has been more a reflection of a NII dilution perspective.", "But we're still very convicted in and around the 30% to 50%. And as we continue to see strength in our cash flows, obviously, we'll continue to be in the open-market.", "Ananda Baruah", "Awesome. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Cihra from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.", "Rob Cihra", "Hi, thanks very much. Two quick, if I could. On the enterprise, with mission-critical, I know it's been sort of declining for a while, but the exabyte shipment growth actually looks like -- or declines, I guess, picked up, looks like kind of declining with the low double digits. Is that now, do you think, the pace or do you think you can get that's more of us to a flattish exabyte business?", "And then, I think, just quickly on cost cuts, OpEx coming down nicely. Is that -- are you still sort of cutting capacity and pruning portfolio or is it just more keeping OpEx percentage of revenue discretionary-type cuts? Thanks. ", "Dave Mosley", "So, I'll start with the enterprise side, mission-critical in particular. This market was one of the most impacted earlier in the year by some of the changes in build material pricings. To your point, we do see a mix up in there. Some of the lowest-capacity drives that we sell are on the order of 300 gigabytes. Those are impacted because some of those architectures are changing quickly. Mission-critical is actually a very rich, diverse space. There's not -- it's not a one-size-fits-all solution.", "And we do see mix up to 1.2 and 2.4-terabyte type drives. And we think that, that'll have a long tail for especially for a lot of those workload-intensive applications that need that value. So, I don't think you're going to see significant exabyte growth, but you will see that mix in the longer tail. And then on the OpEx question, I'll hand it over to Dave. ", "Dave Morton", "In the OpEx, it's been too hard. We still have, I'll call it, some curtailing specifically in the portfolio when you look at some of our adjacent businesses. But then we also have just common items that we've been still trying to drive towards the lowest common denominator. So, we're still very much convicted on achieving the $375 million by the end of FY 2018, and I believe we're on a very good glide path to enable that.", "Rob Cihra", "Great. Thank you.", "Dave Mosley", "Good, I think we have time for one more.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open.", "C. J. Muse", "Yeah. Good morning. Thank you for fitting me in. I guess a follow-up question on the nearline side. Clearly, you had a difficult comp from a year ago. But if I look at your outlook for calendar '17 in its entirety, it looks like that business is growing low to mid-single digits on an exabyte basis. Curious if you could kind of walk through what your outlook is from here?", "And then second part of the question, on the enterprise side, as you look at Intel and the launch of Skylight, can you talk about how you see that core enterprise piece of the business flowing through from here? Thank you.", "Dave Mosley", "Yes. Thanks CJ. I think we've talked about it quite a bit on the call. With the issues that there were earlier, that's why the year-over-year compare is pretty tough on the nearline space, with now higher capacity drives and ramping in the market and some of the markets, especially geographically turning on, some of the smaller cloud providers now seeing the architectures that they want to go invest in. We think that there will be substantial nearline growth into next year.", "Now, obviously, our job is to turn that into orders as quickly as we possibly can, and we're out pursuing strategic agreements to go do that because these are large investments that these companies are going to have to make. But I do think that calendar year '18 will be better than calendar year '17 was from an exabyte perspective.", "On the Skylight question, it's kind of interesting because we look back ourselves at some of these Intel transitions and said, what does that typically mean for our industry? And when do things latch?", "This one's very different because, I think, the nature of the interface and performance and so on are actually pretty exciting for the entire enterprise space. Typically, it doesn't latch very quickly. But typically, it does move to a different value proposition overtime, and that's consistent with the mix-up discussions that we had in mission-critical.", "We believe that some of the lower capacity points will be flushed from the system and will mix up to higher capacity points and mission-critical as we look towards the future, that market, it's not a big market but the mix will be high, so.", "Dave Mosley", "Okay. I would like to thank all of our customers, suppliers, employees for all their hard work on this quarter and all their partnership. It's been a very good back half of the year coming. In July, when last time we spoke to investors, things were pretty tough with the slow Q4. It's good to see August and September turning on, and we look forward to talking to you on the next call.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

My name is James and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question and answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Kate Scolnick, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please proceed, Kate.", "Kate Scolnick", "Thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome to today\u2019s call. Joining me today from Seagate\u2019s executive team are Dave Mosley, Chief Executive Officer, and Dave Morton, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019ve posted our earnings press release and detailed supplemental information for our December 2017 quarter on our Investor Relations section of our site at Seagate.com.", "During today\u2019s call, we will review the highlights for the December quarter, provide the company\u2019s outlook for the March quarter, and then open the call for questions. We are planning for the call today to go approximately half an hour, and we will do our best to accommodate your questions following our prepared remarks as time permits.", "We\u2019ve received a lot of interest in our next strategic update and we will be finalizing a date shortly, most likely in the early fall time frame. In addition, we would like to note that our March quarter quiet period will begin on March 26.", "On our call today, we will refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP figures are reconciled to GAAP figures on our supplemental information available on the Investor section of our website. We have not reconciled our non-GAAP financial measures guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted; accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.

Please go ahead, Dave.", "Dave Mosley", "Thanks Kate. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. For today\u2019s earnings call, I will cover the high level trends we\u2019re seeing in the business. Our CFO, Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the March quarter. ", "Beginning with our operational results for the December quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion, up 11% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year, GAAP gross margins of 30.1% and a net income of $159 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.55 including a one-time provision for income taxes of $208 million related to tax reform. ", "On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 30.4%, net income of $431 million, up 5% year-over-year, and diluted earnings per share of $1.48, up 7% year-over-year. ", "HDD exabyte shipments for the December quarter were a record 87.5 exabytes, up 28% year-over-year. The average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was also a record - 2.2 terabytes per drive, up 29% year-over-year, and the average selling price per unit was $68, up 3% year-over-year.", "GAAP operating expenses were $440 million, down 15% year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $390 million, also down 15% year-over-year. ", "Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $850 million, up 30% year-over-year, and free cash flow was $773 million, up 38% year-over-year.", "Achieving revenue and profitability growth and significant cash flow generation in the December quarter reflects Seagate\u2019s strong execution and the competitiveness of our storage portfolio, particularly in cloud-based environments as average capacity per drive continues to grow rapidly. I\u2019m very pleased with the traction we have gained with our mass storage solutions across the enterprise, edge and consumer markets. ", "In addition to the solid December quarter results, in January we announced that Seagate has entered into a long-term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory. This agreement will provide continuity of NAND supply for our expanding product portfolio.", "We have matured our entire technology portfolio over the last several years and today we have a broad offering of flash-based products that are ready to scale and grow across multiple markets. Diversifying and expanding our competitive HDD mass storage portfolio with SSD and enterprise storage solutions will enable meaningful future revenue growth and profits over the next several years while providing significant value for our storage customers. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the future.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Dave Morton to go into more depth on our operational activities. ", "David Morton Jr.", "Thanks Dave. For the December quarter, we achieved year-over-year revenue and profitability growth with record exabyte shipments of 87.5 exabytes and record average capacity per drive of 2.2 terabytes. For the enterprise HDD market, we shipped a record 37.4 exabytes with a record average capacity of 4.3 terabytes per drive. In the Nearline market, we shipped 35.1 exabytes and our average capacity per drive reached 5.9 terabytes per drive, up 31% over last year\u2019s strong demand and up 75% from the December quarter two years ago.", "Overall, HDD revenue was up 2% year-over-year in the December quarter. The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate, and we are confident in our Nearline HDD portfolio designed to serve these environments.", "Our 10Tb Nearline product was the leading enterprise revenue SKU in the December quarter. In addition, we achieved sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12Tb Nearline product as we continue to ramp for material revenue contribution in the March quarter. As Nearline capacity demand continues to grow, we expect continued opportunity for our mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads. Use cases will cause capacity points to span from 2 to 4Tb for certain applications and up to 16Tb for other customer needs. At Seagate, we believe we\u2019re well poised to help our cloud customers with their stringent and diverse requirements.", "Looking ahead, cloud-based enterprise market demand continues to be strong and supply remains bid constrained. In the enterprise market, the long-term trajectory of growth and infrastructure spending in the large cloud service providers and hyperscale companies continues to have significant velocity. Critical to supporting the massive growth in data is our ability to continue to provide mass storage solutions that optimize areal density and have the greatest reliability, quality and total cost of ownership benefits.", "Seagate has demonstrated technology leadership with generations of storage technologies and products. Over the last five years, we\u2019ve been the leader in areal density with our SMR and TDMR areal density solutions, and we continue to make progress towards the introduction of our heat-assisted magnetic recording, or HAMR technology, which will open up a rich space for high capacity and great value. We anticipate launching our HAMR portfolio in 2019 and the future investment costs are already contemplated in our existing operating expense and capital expenditure long-term model.", "In the edge and consumer verticals, we had a strong year-over-year exabyte growth in almost all end markets, including PC compute, consumer, surveillance, gaming, and NAS markets. Our 1Tb per platter 2.5 inch platform continues to perform well. Using our areal density advantage, our 2Tb per platter 3.5 inch platform continues to ramp for desktop markets, providing great value for customers needing a 2, 4 and 8Tb capacity points.", "In addition to positioning ourselves for growth in the silicon business, we continue to minimize our alignment with the 500 GB client consumer and mission-critical 15K hard drive markets as we believe these workloads will over time move to mobile, silicon cloud storage. In the December quarter, these products represented less than 8% of our total consolidated revenue.", "December quarter non-HDD revenue, primarily from the cloud systems and silicon group, was $213 million, down 12% year-over-year mostly due to the divesting of our high performance computing assets and OEM legacy system demand. Looking ahead, we continue to be bullish about our opportunities to leverage our long-term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory Corporation for significant revenue growth and expanding margin contributions of our silicon product portfolio in SAS, SSD, and the PCIe, NVMe, and consumer and gaming markets. This value creation is above and beyond the base economics previously disclosed with our equity commitment letter for Seagate to invest up to $1.25 billion with the Bain-led consortium acquisition of the Toshiba Memory Corporation. We believe that our strategic approach to the participation in the silicon market allows us to address customer storage portfolio needs and provide for revenue growth opportunities in our business model without overhang from additional capital requirements and cyclical market exposure. ", "Operating expenses for the December quarter were $444 million on a GAAP basis and $390 million on a non-GAAP basis, down 15% year-over-year. We remain on track to exit the fiscal year with non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $375 million per quarter. ", "Capital expenditures were $77 million for the December quarter for supporting the continued ramp of our new highest capacity HDD products and maintenance capital. For the March quarter, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million primarily for maintenance capital and some incremental capital to address the strong cloud market demand. We anticipate capital expenditures to remain less than 5% of our total consolidated revenue for FY18.", "Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was $850 million and free cash flow was $773 million. These results include approximately $34 million in cash payments related to previously announced restructuring charges. For the first half of the fiscal year, we have generated nearly $1.1 billion in cash flow from operations, including $80 million in cash payments against restructuring charges, and nearly $900 million in free cash flow. ", "Our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the December quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and 285 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the December quarter, which will be payable on April 4 of 2018.", "Interest expense for the December quarter was $61 million. Our debt structure and levels of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. In the December quarter, we deployed $130 million towards redeeming our November 2018 senior notes. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio continues to trend down and is 1.1 times as of the December quarter.", "As Dave Mosley mentioned, in the December quarter we made a one-time provision for income tax adjustment of $208 million related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Specifically, the company recorded a one-time reduction of $208 million to earnings due to the re-measurement of our U.S. deferred tax assets at the lower enacted 21% corporate tax rate, which has no cash impact. The deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings and profits to be taxed at 15.5% for liquid assets and 8% for non-liquid assets is not impactful for Seagate because our U.S. corporation has no un-repatriated earnings. The interest expense of this allowance impact will be minor since Seagate does not have significant long-term debt held in the U.S. We believe that the impact of the international provisions, including the global intangible low taxed income provision and the foreign derived intangible income, and the base erosion anti-avoidance tax will be minimal to Seagate. ", "In summary, Seagate has evaluated the impact of the most significant provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We do not expect the tax act to materially impact Seagate\u2019s effective tax rate going forward. ", "As we consider future use cases for storage growth, we invest in companies that align to our long-term thesis of exponential data growth in new verticals, some of which are outlined in the Data Age 2025 report with IDC. A few years ago, we made an investment in Ripple, a company driving technology innovation for distributed ledger and block chain use cases. We believe the proliferation of these companies will create tremendous amounts of data, require high levels of data integrity, and will alleviate friction in global financial operations and other important use cases that require the transfer of value with improved agility and transparency. While recent attention is on the valuation of the XRP crypto assets, we believe Ripple has a real and robust block chain technology platform, a defined and validated use case for XRP, and a leading management team.", "Overall, our operational and financial performance in the December quarter reflects execution of our business model and profitability improvement objectives. Looking ahead, we will continue to optimize our business and focus on aligning our go-to-market and product portfolio advancements towards the future growth opportunity markets. ", "I would now like to turn the call back to Dave Mosley.", "Dave Mosley", "Thanks Dave. The Seagate team has focused for the past two years on reducing our operational footprint and reshaping our cost structure to address the current demand environment. Our supply chain from suppliers to factories to sales and fulfillment are now entirely focused on agility and flexibility for our customers. I\u2019m proud of the team for completing our significant restructuring plans, and while we will always have cost reduction efforts, we are well positioned to shift our focus as a company to capturing new market opportunities and achieving sustainable revenue growth and profitability. ", "Turning to our market outlook, we remain conservatively optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment as well as spending trends for cloud-based environments. On the heels of the various IT component supply constraints we witnessed over the last year or so, we\u2019re continuing to monitor outgoing inventory closely. From Seagate\u2019s vantage point, our channel inventory positions and inventory for our customers that are visible to us are, in general, lower than last year. For the March quarter, we anticipate year-over-year exabyte growth with continued strong demand in cloud storage as supply remains tight in our highest capacity solutions. For the other markets we serve, we anticipate normal sequential seasonal demand declines. As a result of the strong cloud demand and seasonality in our other markets, we expect total revenues to be down 5 to 7% sequentially from the December quarter. This represents lower sequential revenue declines than the last few years and year-over-year revenue growth for Seagate.", "We expect gross margins to be sequentially in line with the December quarter\u2019s gross margins and continue to be within our 29% to 33% long-term range. Non-GAAP operating expenses will be down sequentially 2% to 3% with further cost containment measures as we continue to manage our operating expenses tightly, targeting approximately $375 million per quarter by the end of fiscal \u201918.", "In summary, I\u2019d like to thank our customers, employees, suppliers and business partners for their contributions to our quarter\u2019s results. Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we\u2019ll now open up the call for questions and answers.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions]", "Our first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Katy Huberty", "Thank you, good morning. There was a really nice ramp in gross margin sequentially, but you\u2019re still down year-on-year. Can you talk about what some of the headwinds are that are keeping you from getting back up into that 32, 33% range that you were a year ago, given how strong cloud is, and is it realistic to think that you can get there over the next three, four quarters? Thank you.", "Dave Mosley", "Hi Katy. I think I\u2019d characterize it more as flat year-over-year, but to your point, are there opportunities to move higher, yes, there are if the demand picture continues to improve like we saw it do so last quarter. I would say that there are some markets, and in particular we called out the enterprise solutions, some of the non-HDD assets that we\u2019re still continuing to pare, so that\u2019s work that we have to do that may have been a slight drag, and I think we can fix that over time. But I think there are opportunities if we see the demand picture continue.", "Katy Huberty", "Can you just comment quickly on how you see free cash flow for the year? If I look historical first half versus second half seasonality, that would put you around $1.5 billion; but working capital was really good in December, so do you think you can get higher than that for the full year?", "Dave Mosley", "I\u2019ll let Dave answer that.", "David Morton Jr.", "Yes, hi Katy. Yes, we\u2019ve been confident on some of our previous comments that we thought cash flow from operations would be $2 billion to $2.5 billion, so I still think we\u2019re well within that scope. Clearly when you see strong linearity and strong velocity on the results, you\u2019ll see that end up in our working capital, so I think there\u2019s a lot of confidence going into the back half of the year.", "Katy Huberty", "Great, thank you. Congrats on the quarter. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Mark Delaney", "Yes, good morning, and thanks very much for the opportunity to ask a question. I was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on the NAND opportunity now that you have the deal in place with Toshiba Memory. Can you give us a sense of what type of scale that may be for Toshiba, either in terms of the number of bits you may be able to procure, the potential revenue you could translate that into, and is it a market minus or cost-plus? Then what sort of go-forward that may look like longer term, do your bits scale proportionally with Toshiba\u2019s or does Toshiba maybe--excuse me, does Seagate maybe get an increased mix of Toshiba\u2019s bits as Toshiba adds new factories?", "Dave Mosley", "I think the quick answer is no, I won\u2019t go into any of those details. What I will tell you is we have a fairly broad portfolio with which to play the hand, so we have all the way from enterprise, even into consumer devices that we can use. We\u2019re developing those right now and we\u2019re trying to intercept not only the Toshiba NAND but all the NAND supply that we can get, and we believe that this is a good chance for us to grow, but we haven\u2019t really quantified it yet and we won\u2019t for a while, until the deal is finally done.", "Mark Delaney", "Okay. My follow-up question is on market share in the high capacity hard drive market. Clearly Seagate is demonstrating improved momentum, which we saw in the results this quarter. You had your main competitor, WD talk about trying to come into more of the mid-range market, where I know Seagate has been particularly strong and you\u2019ve got Toshiba with its first 14Tb drive that it\u2019s announced, so maybe you can just help us understand how you think about market share and economics in the cloud market this year.", "Dave Mosley", "Let\u2019s see. I like our portfolio. There is a lot of times where people tend to fixate on one product versus another. We have a fairly strong product offering across many, and so therefore when we can satisfy customers who are fairly diverse in their requirements, we\u2019ll do well. ", "I think as we\u2019ve talked about before, we\u2019ve been moving away from some of the lower capacity points over the past year, and that has served us well as well. From a competitiveness standpoint, all I would say is that from our portfolio perspective, we\u2019re leading in areal density so we have a lot of flexibility in how to play those components into the various markets.", "Mark Delaney", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.", "Christian Schwab", "Congratulations guys on a great start. A follow-up on the enterprise - your largest competitor was extremely excited about exabyte growth for 2018 and the first half of the year. Are you seeing the same type of order enthusiasm?", "Dave Mosley", "Yes, as are we. I would say when you compare it to last year, cloud growth was almost non-existent last year. Exabyte growth was almost non-existent in some of the quarters last year. I think we ran three quarters in a row with a fairly flat demand profile. If you go back historically over the last five years, it\u2019s been 35%, so to your point, to go from zero percent over three quarters, there is going to be some backlash, higher than 35% for a while, and we are seeing that demand in calendar \u201918.", "When it ends, don\u2019t know at this point, but right now to the point, we\u2019re bit constrained as we\u2019ve said for the last few weeks, and we\u2019ll continue to chase it.", "Christian Schwab", "Great. Then as you guys have successfully reshaped your cost structure as well as enhancing your product portfolio with the soon to be addition of NAND, how do you guys view your dividend strategy? I know you guys have outlined what percentage of revenue you want to return, but given that cash flow is maybe well above what a lot of investors may have thought it would have been, as far as capital allocation - you know, you paid off some debt, but should we be thinking with further stability of this type of cash flow, plus or minus, that a dividend increase is logical at some point? ", "Dave Mosley", "Let\u2019s see - logical is an interesting question. What I would say is a year ago when we were being asked the question in a different way, we remained committed to it, so we remain committed to returning value to shareholders via these mechanisms right now. I really don\u2019t want to get into the forward-looking pieces of this because as we\u2019ve seen, the market can be fairly volatile. I think we\u2019re happy with where we are right now.", "Christian Schwab", "Great. No other questions, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open.", "Steven Fox", "Hi, good morning. I understand that you don\u2019t want to get into how you might be receiving bits from the Toshiba relationship, but could you talk about your own product launches on SSCs, maybe when we could start to see more meaningful commercialization into the rest of the calendar year? Then I have a quick follow-up.", "Dave Mosley", "There are products in qualification right now across NVMe, multiple flavors of NVMe, SAS, refresh to the SAS portfolio, and also SATA products, even consumer products. So specifically which product, what capacity points, it\u2019s a fairly diverse offering, and I think this is reflecting the same thing that\u2019s going on in those markets. So we\u2019re fairly happy with it competitively and I think that\u2019s why we think that both on brand strength and customer service we\u2019ll be able to get some revenue growth with the bits all come online, when we intercept all that flash supply and get the technology integrated.", "Steven Fox", "Thanks. Then just as a quick follow-up, it sounds like you\u2019re not adding a lot of capacity to meet some of these constraints that you mentioned, so would we expect to see some more of your own internal bit production shift towards high-end capacity products, or would you continue to have the same mix the rest of the calendar year?", "Dave Mosley", "I look at it a little bit differently. We\u2019ve taken factory footprints down, and as we did that, we had to actually move and build some buildings and things like that, so even the capital that we talked about, 4 to 6% of the range, we\u2019ll start applying some of that capital to bit growth if you want to look at it that way.", "We\u2019re really pleased with the way that average capacity per drive is moving north, and we\u2019re going to have the capital there to achieve that kind of growth. Yields are something we continue to work. We\u2019ve had a lot of focus obviously in the factories on moving things in the last two years as we did this restructuring, but now we can just focus wholeheartedly on improving our yields and getting after better equipment utilization and things like that, now that we have the footprint.", "Steven Fox", "Great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Cihra with Guggenheim. Your line is open.", "Rob Cihra", "Hi, thank you very much. Just wanted to dig into cloud demand a little more. You\u2019re clearly benefiting from cloud capex and you guys have laid out long-term capacity demand growth that you see as strong, but if you look at that market, it has been choppy historically, so can you tell us how you get visibility over the next couple quarters, and if there\u2019s anything you can do to sort of smooth that out or are you just always going to be at the mercy of a smaller group of customers? Thanks very much.", "Dave Mosley", "Right. That\u2019s interesting. I think there have been what we call digestion cycles in the past, where large cloud service providers would buy in big tranches and then they would digest for a while, which means they buy less relatively. I think we\u2019re starting to see more diversification, especially in this last cycle, and it may have been magnified by some of the component supply - other components, not hard drives, component supply issues that happened last year. But right now, we see a very, very healthy diverse market geographically by capacity points, by application space, which the cloud isn\u2019t all about one application space, as people know, there are many different [indiscernible]. So to your point, helping with that, addressing all those different customers with all their diverse needs is going to help us get better visibility, I think.", "Rob Cihra", "Thanks again. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open.", "Ananda Baruah", "Hey, good morning guys. Appreciate the questions. Just two real quick ones - the first is going back to gross margin, Dave, and the impact from the system business that you\u2019re paring off. How far through that paring do you believe that you are, and how material over time can that impact be to gross margin? I guess back of the envelope, going through the file, I sort of calculated that maybe it was as much as 100 basis point headwind - I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s accurate, but that was just my calculation. Then just real quickly, I\u2019ll squeak this one in, has the tightness from cloud demand have you guys begin to engage yet in supply agreements with key customers? Thanks a lot.", "Dave Mosley", "Hi Ananda. On the first point - gosh, if we start by looking at all the different customers we serve, there are some markets where we were competing with people who didn\u2019t necessarily control the core componentry like we do but they build really cheap, and there is a lot of disruption going on in the market - I don\u2019t need to tell you guys that. There is a lot of complexity in the market as well, so people can move from solution to solution very quickly. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be in our bailiwick. ", "I do think that longer term, it\u2019s important that Seagate is able to add value above and beyond the drive at the system level, if you will, and part of the reason for that is we have to do it anyway when we integrate into customers\u2019 chassis and so on. I think as you see some of those markets stabilize a little bit, less complexity, it\u2019ll be more obvious as to what we should do and which customers ultimately we\u2019re building for, and so it\u2019s been a churn for us. I think it\u2019s going on in other places in the industry as well. Relative to how far are we through that, I can\u2019t really tell, but I do think it started five or more years ago and it\u2019s not over yet. We\u2019re going to do the smart thing. We believe that long term it\u2019s important that Seagate maintains this kind of ability to understand and add value above the drives.", "On the second part, I think your question was tightness in the market for enterprise drives, and it\u2019s really back to the question I think Rob asked, which was long-term visibility, does that give you better visibility. I think it does. Most of the scale players as they sense these kind of problems are actually talking to us quite a bit about longer term visibility and making sure that our supply chain is properly architected to address their needs. You know, hopefully that helps the demand picture, as I answered Rob too.", "Ananda Baruah", "Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks a lot. ", "Dave Mosley", "Good. With that, thanks everyone. I\u2019d really like to thank our customers, employees, and suppliers and business partners for their help this last quarter, and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you very much.
